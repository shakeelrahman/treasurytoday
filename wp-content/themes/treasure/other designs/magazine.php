                            <p class="pe-3 mb-4">As this edition goes to press, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has raged for four weeks. Alongside the tragic human consequences, the war has left companies scrambling to cope with the impact. Commodity prices have surged, impacting supply chains, and sanctions have forced companies to cut ties with Russia where doing business is neither morally, commercially nor politically viable. Some of our best-read stories include the impact of axing Russian banks from SWIFT, and whether this could accelerate China’s rival payments system, CIPS.</p>
