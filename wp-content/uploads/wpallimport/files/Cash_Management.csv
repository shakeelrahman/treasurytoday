<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Take two cash management scenarios for a multinational company with payment obligations around the world. On one hand, the company runs a costly overdraft and prefunds all its obligations. On the other, it sets up a notional multi-currency cash pool covering the US, APAC and EMEA, whereby the surplus cash in the different regions passes from one to another over a 24-hour period to meet working capital needs.</p>
<p>The structure allows the company to leverage idle internal cash, the most cost-efficient source of funding a company has and preferable to short-term credit facilities, freeing up other reserves to target growth strategies. All the while offering the ability to tap different fungible currencies to make payments whenever and wherever needed without a currency conversion.</p>
<p>Multi-currency notional pooling offers an effective and cost-efficient liquidity structure that allows treasury to leverage surpluses hidden in subsidiaries, reduce dependency on overdrafts and play off different currency balances for maximum flexibility. “The solution marks the start of our global treasury reinvention and serves as a foundation for our ambitions to set up a global cash pool and in-house banking structure,” says Cecilia Li, Head of Global Treasury at BeiGene Limited, the global biotech company that specialises in the development of drugs for cancer treatment. “By moving away from manual processes towards automation, we have been able to reduce our error rates and minimise risk exposure.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan suggests two key strategies – multi-currency notional pooling and negative yield optimisation – to complement physical cash concentration tools and FX hedging. Traditional physical cash pooling centralises funds across multiple bank accounts to reduce idle balances and deficits whereas notional pooling achieves a similar result but is accomplished by creating a notional position resulting from an aggregate of all the accounts without physical transfer of funds. Add on the multi-currency element to a notional pool, and treasury teams don’t need to carry out FX transactions to access a particular currency, introducing a valuable element of flexibility.</p>
<h4 id=""macro-backdrop"">Macro backdrop</h4>
<p>Today’s uncertain global business environment makes effective liquidity management and FX hedging increasingly important to provide funding stability and cost optimization. But the combination of rising interest rates and volatile stock market valuations creates a demanding debt funding environment. For this reason, rather than tap external funding, it makes sense to leverage internal surpluses built up in the loose credit conditions post-2008 and often held out of sight in idle balances across fragmented global accounts or pushed down into subsidiaries.</p>
<p>“These cash surpluses are often generating optimal returns and are not deployed,” says Tim van Bijsterveldt, Executive Director, Liquidity &amp; Account Solutions Specialist at J.P. Morgan Payments, adding that subsidiaries also often over-forecast their cash needs because they do not have automated processes or sufficient visibility across accounts.</p>
<p>Mobilising internal idle cash for self-funding and working capital purposes also frees up costlier debt finance to drive long-term growth and shareholder return via acquisitions or entering new markets. “The economics of recycling internal cash for operating purposes rather than using external funding really do pay. Rising rates mean raising capital is more expensive than leveraging internal cash for operating purposes,” says Amy Eckhoff, APAC Head of Liquidity &amp; Account Solutions Specialist at J.P. Morgan Payments, where analysis of corporate financial statements found global multinationals on average hold at least 30% in idle cash.</p>
<p>Multi-currency notional pooling also provides support and cost benefits for companies facing a mismatch between their forecasts and actual need to access funds like, for example, an unforeseen payment obligation. “Notional pool pricing will almost always be more favourable and beneficial than a spot or overnight swap rates,” says van Bijsterveldt.</p>
<h4 id=""fx-element"">FX Element</h4>
<p>Multi-currency notional pooling enables corporates to decide which currencies they want to keep operating in a surplus balance while running others intentionally negative. If there is a surplus in one currency, say US Dollar, and treasury doesn’t borrow more in another currency than they have US Dollar, corporates can draw down another currency at a preferential rate. This can be done manually or by using the same automated cross-sweeping tool that is commonly used to move out restricted currency balances from the more complex markets in Asia. “It might sometimes be better for treasury to draw down in Japanese Yen rather than keeping that account surplus from a an interest rate perspective without impacting underlying business operations,” explains van Bijsterveldt who says the strategy allows treasury teams to really look at the currency composition of the pool and run certain positions short on purpose.</p>
<p>It makes for a compelling solution for companies pushing into new regional markets against the backdrop of digitisation and trends in real-time payments, shifts online and the proliferation of wholesale business to business marketplaces. Having local currencies on tap in the regions and keeping the currency in the market where it connects to a local business is increasingly sought-after, explains Eckhoff. For example, a company might be receiving new flows of revenue from online customers in currencies not received before; need to service pay-outs on a rapid basis or apply cash into the business as quickly as possible, all requiring the frictionless ability to fund and have settlement optimisation. “Before, treasury could slightly pre-empt, but today corporates need access to cash quickly in the right place and in the right currency,” she says.</p>
<p>Expanding on the idea of the right currency in the right place, Eckhoff and van Bijsterveldt explain that the multi-currency element offers a new, hybrid model. Under notional pool structures, different currencies and country of incorporation of certain entities are unable to participate directly and the common way to move money around is via inter-company loans.</p>
<p>The multi-currency approach not only gives timely access to funds at pace (unless you convert Asian currencies in Asia, it is rarely settled same day) it also allows treasury teams to respond to rising rates when deciding which currency to draw down. “Rising interest rates are good on surplus balances but not so good on negative positions as you are charged more,” says van Bijsterveldt.</p>
<p>This FX element also holds real flexibility. Treasury teams are not forced to convert currencies and can be more thoughtful on choosing which tenors to expand and manage: bills will still get paid as long as there is a sufficient balance, as different entities can access funds in the entire ecosystem. It offers companies a way to absorb unhedged flows and an alternative to the short-term FX market to fund the business on an immediate basis in an approach that was particularly useful at Goodyear, explains James Ho, Regional Cash Management Manager &amp; Japan Treasurer at the tyre company. “Together with J.P. Morgan we implemented a flexible, scalable liquidity solution which has helped Goodyear achieve its treasury objectives to lower idle cash and financing costs without adding additional FX exposures or manual work.”</p>
<h4 id=""key-considerations"">Key considerations</h4>
<p>Multi-currency notional pools require a few key considerations. Treasury teams need to ensure the accounting principles that lie behind intercompany or commercial flows coming in and out of the pool are robust. This means working with internal advisors and ensuring treasury benefits from the net treatment in their balance sheet - as opposed to gross positions that require capital set against them. Elsewhere, treasury teams should be mindful of the tax considerations around the jurisdiction of the pool. “There is a responsibility to understand how the pool fits with clients’ ecosystems and existing infrastructure,” says Eckhoff. “Multi-currency pooling entities have more complex accounting standards. If one entity is continuously drawing down and not contributing, then auditors and accounting experts might re-consider if direct participation in a notional pool is appropriate,” adds van Bijsterveldt.</p>
<p>Indeed, both Eckhoff and van Bijsterveldt reflect that treasury should be mindful of what the cash is funding, keeping in mind pool funding is only meant as a working capital tool for short-term cash fluctuations or asymmetric demand from different business centres; regulators will quickly distinguish between inter-company loans and capital injections. It is not the right funding mechanism to finance a new factory, for example, and structural loans on a long tenor basis are better handled outside the pool. It also requires cohesion across regions and treasury teams in different jurisdictions need the expertise to manage the pool, handing it on in different time zones.</p>
<p>Multi-currency notional pooling benefits companies with fragmented bank accounts and supports account minimisation; it helps companies with a large cash burn to leverage internal cash and is an effective way to recycle cash from cash generating parts of the business. The structure also allows companies to extract the currency they like from the notional pool for redeployment if another currency is in surplus. “Multi-currency notional pooling is becoming an increasingly important tool for multi-nationals to lever their cash positions supporting new ecosystems that need to be managed at pace and at scale,” concludes Eckhoff.</p>

<p>Cash pooling has different flavours. Companies can pool in-country or cross-border. It is the latter that appeals to multinational corporations because it allows them to maximise their credit and offset positive and negative balances across different legal entities. There are two approaches: physical and notional.</p>
<p>Physical pooling allows funds in separate subaccounts – at the same bank – to be automatically swept to and from a header account. The participating entities’ bank accounts are either in surplus or deficit position on an end-of-day basis. The physical concentration to the designated header account effectively zero balances the subaccounts. Physical pooling can be used across multiple legal entities, located in the same or different countries – but on a currency-by-currency basis. The idea ensures that a company doesn’t have one entity overdrawn on the same day that another entity, in another jurisdiction, has excess cash. Everything is swept at the end of the day, and the next morning funds cover outgoing payments for the overdrawn entity.</p>
<p>Movements between accounts in this way are categorised as intercompany loans to and from the header entity and the participating subsidiaries. Specific loan documentation related to the pool structure is prepared in advance. The holding entity should be designated as an agent for the group which allows the interest paid and earned to be treated as bank interest and is not subject to withholding tax.</p>
<p>Notional pooling achieves a similar result but is accomplished by creating a shadow or notional position resulting from an aggregate of all the accounts, which can be held in multiple currencies. Interest is paid or charged on the consolidated position. There is no actual movement or commingling of funds. It is a seemingly simple, hands-off solution; but the opaque nature of the arrangement in terms of costs and minimal documentation between separate legal entities makes many tax directors uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Most multinationals prefer physical pooling as it is cleaner from a tax perspective because those movements to and from the header accounts are characterised as loans. Cash pooling is day-to-day cash management – if you have an operation that needs funding on an ongoing basis, either handle through a capital infusion or a direct intercompany loan with specific terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Physical pooling is typically done with one bank, and companies must decide which of their banks is going to manage the daily cash positions and liquidity. There are only five or six banks globally that can effectively offer this service and have the reach and reporting platform required.</p>
<p>Cash pooling can reduce costs as companies are not paying fees to multiple different banks or doing wire transfers to fund operations or move excess cash – however the real value for companies is in administrative saving and cash optimisation. Cash pooling also eliminates overdraft charges and in times when interest rates are higher, companies can get a return on their cash. Still, there is a cost to a pooling arrangement and pricing may differ between banks.</p>
<p>Can third-party vendors provide pooling services? Information and transaction tracking potentially, but I can’t see banks being pushed out of the picture. Banks hold the balances and provide the credit lines that are normally behind this type of service, so I’d advise companies to give this service to one of their credit banks that can offer cash pooling. It is good transactional business and can provide balances and liquidity for the banks which is required from a regulatory perspective.</p>

<p>Cash pooling enables companies to efficiently use their own money, and drives working capital management. As a rule of thumb, companies would prefer to use their own money rather than borrow from financial institutions, so pooling also reduces the cost of capital. Cash pooling also helps ensure that funds are available when needed, helping to smooth the payments process.</p>
<p>As a structured approach, companies can focus on cash consolidation at a country level first. This works best for a country that has multiple entities and business lines enabling better use of cash within the country for the purpose of payments, efficient collection, and consolidation. The process also involves defining the optimum requirement for cash at a country level and determining the core surplus which can be utilised by the wider company for cash management around the globe.</p>
<p>Cash pooling drives efficiencies in terms of companies’ ability to use their own funds. For example, in emerging markets in places such as Africa, cash pooling and collections in local currencies are often used for local payments and expenses as soon as possible to reduce FX exposure and protect against the risk of currency devaluation.</p>
<p>Cash pooling is a strategy that can be used to manage FX exposure, excess liquidity, and country and bank counterparty risk. By extension, companies shouldn’t shy away from borrowing in local currencies either. If collections and expenses are in local currency, companies may think about borrowing locally to fund the business to protect against the risk of devaluation. Local currency borrowing costs are preferable to the implications of FX devaluation.</p>
<p>It is simplest for a company to use one bank for its pooling needs, but this isn’t always possible because banks have footprints in different countries. Different regulatory requirements and product development can also require companies use the services of multiple banks to pool. Companies need to set up cash pooling between these different paradigms. Many countries still prohibit cash pooling, particularly those with low dollar reserves or with economies that are import-dependent.</p>

<p>All companies need cash to support their business and make payments. This liquidity is an important risk mitigant, but excess liquidity can also be inefficient when seen in the context of capital that the company hasn’t deployed to invest either in the company or the yield curve.</p>
<p>Solutions like physical cash pooling connects accounts and corridors of activity, moving cash in between accounts to ensure treasury has cash where it needs it and when, in the right currency, and able to cover short positions or aggregate long positions. Notional cash pooling is similar but doesn’t involve physically moving cash. It creates a fungibility across currencies and provides visibility, control, and optimisation. Companies can also integrate virtual account solutions that retain the integrity of data and information on that underlying position.</p>
<p>Cash pooling is vital for optimising cash on account. Take a multinational with decentralised operating entities running their own businesses. These subsidiaries will keep their own cash buffers to mitigate risk and ensure they can make their payments that when added together, combine to make a significant sum across a global company. Yet not every operating company needs their buffer every day. As companies go on a journey of centralisation, they will create a fungibility in those cash buffers. It means that different entities can have a cash injection according to their needs, creating a central buffer that is optimised – and reduced – at a treasury centre.</p>
<p>When companies migrate from a decentralised to centralised structure, they can reduce the need to keep cash on deposit by up to 50% from simple efficiencies. Treasury can see what cash it has and where it has it, giving real-time control that allows companies to take that surplus capital and invest it to accelerate the business growth.</p>
<p>Of course, the cost of capital fluctuates in any given economic cycle, but companies benefit from reducing the amount of capital whatever the cycle because reducing capital is a value add. We saw a huge demand for pooling in 2020 when the business cycle changed and companies realised they would benefit from a centralised structure, with visibility and control of their cash.</p>
<p>Technology and digitisation are also driving pooling demand. Digitisation has led to an acceleration in e-commerce, giving way to faster payments and causing money to move much more quickly, putting pressure on liquidity management. Corporate treasury needs to know where cash is and have access to it. For example, one of the biggest challenges within cash management is short-term forecasting. It has created a need for structures that can respond and allow treasury to put cash where it is needed and in the right currency.</p>
<p>In another example, the evolution in e-commerce means more companies are selling third party goods and need to manage third party monies (3PM). It means these companies are an intermediary in a cash exchange. We increasingly work with companies to structure liquidity and account solutions that support 3PM which often involves safeguarding cash and requires even more visibility and control.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For the last few years, money market funds (MMFs) have existed in a low interest rate environment. Alongside compressed yields, the recent landscape has also been characterised by a mismatch in supply and demand. “We’ve been at zero or negative interest rates, but the available supply has been diminished,” explains Laurie Brignac, Head of Global Liquidity at Invesco. “Usually you would expect that low rates may encourage people to leave money market funds– but we haven’t really seen that.”</p>
<p>In fact, as Paul Mueller, Head of Global Liquidity EMEA Portfolios at Invesco, points out, the AAA-rated MMF market for GBP has grown six-fold since 2004, while the EUR market has almost quadrupled in the same period – “despite rates being negative since 2014<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.” While some clients have looked at setting up segregated mandates, or investing in MMFs to squeeze out more returns, Mueller says there have not been material flows into these areas – not least because the volatility brought by the pandemic may have deterred people from taking additional risk.</p>
<h4 id=""interest-rate-outlook"">Interest rate outlook</h4>
<p>While the last decade has been characterised by low rates, it’s clear that the landscape is now changing. Where GBP is concerned, the Bank of England was gauging the possible impact of negative interest rates little more than a year ago – but with inflation concerns taking centre stage, a rate hike in December 2021 was followed by another in February. Further increases are expected: Mueller notes that the market is now pricing in rate hikes of around 1.75% by the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Turning to the US, meanwhile, last year’s ‘Powell pivot’ gave rise to expectations of two rate hikes this year – “and now we’re pricing in over five, with some dealers calling for seven rate hikes,” says Brignac. She adds, “Looking at the next Fed meeting, we’re pricing in a strong possibility of two rate hikes in March. But there’s a strong possibility that the market is overpricing how aggressive the Fed is going to be, which makes it quite interesting for our clients.”</p>
<p>Until recently, interest rates in Europe had not been expected to move in 2022. As such, Mueller notes that the ECB’s recent comments about near-term risk to inflation “have opened the floodgates to the market to start pricing in quite a rapid turnaround in interest rates in Europe, which to us certainly seems a bit premature.” He points out that the ECB has previously stated it would need to finish asset purchases before starting to make rate hikes. “So if they’re going to price an increase in Q3, they’re going to have to bring that much sooner forward.”</p>
<h4 id=""impact-on-mmfs"">Impact on MMFs</h4>
<p>With interest rates set to increase in the coming months, what could a rising rate environment mean for MMF providers? In today’s unusual market conditions, this question may be difficult to answer. As a heavily regulated investment vehicle, a significant portion of any MMF portfolio will always be in overnight to one-week paper. “Apart from that, it’s really going to depend on how quickly central banks may be raising rates,” comments Brignac. “As we’re looking at that, liquidity always comes first. The second question is, where is the value up the curve? Does it make sense to extend out?”</p>
<p>Where floating rate instruments are concerned, Brignac notes that as rates go up, securities will start to reflect the higher interest rates – sometimes even ahead of the move. “One of the best indices for that was always LIBOR, but a lot of the indices that we are now looking at or referencing are overnight, so they don’t necessarily reflect higher interest rates until the central banks actually move,” she says. “This is another reason why these hiking cycles are different to what we’ve seen before.”</p>
<p>Traditionally, says Mueller, “you’ll see an immediate drawdown in money market fund assets in a rising rate environment – but after one or two hikes, we may start to get more money coming in, because investors will look to park their cash on the front end until the central banks have finished raising rates. So we may see inflows at some point during the hiking cycle.”</p>
<p>Of course, rising rates are not the only factor set to impact MMFs in the coming months. The COVID-19 crisis has also prompted regulators to look once again at money market fund reform, as part of a wider conversation about liquidity across different markets. “There are quite a few moving parts in today’s market,” concludes Brignac. “People need to be quite diligent, and work with their partners to understand what these developments could mean.”</p>

<p>The Chinese money market interest rate landscape has rotated substantially in 2021 as investors grappled with the implications of slower economic growth and the PBOC’s reluctant monetary policy pivot. Concurrently, money market funds (MMFs) witnessed strong inflows, despite increased competition from new products. In 2022, lower interest rates, a focus on climate change and the implications of looming asset management product rule changes will create challenges and opportunities for Chinese MMFs.</p>
<h4 id=""the-interest-rate-pivot"">The interest rate pivot</h4>
<p>From robust growth at the start of 2021, multiple factors negatively impacted the Chinese economy, translating a gradual slowdown into a sharp decline. The government’s commitment to deleveraging the property and shadow banking sectors, combined with Delta variant outbreaks, all magnified economic volatility and prompted expectations of fiscal and monetary policy easing.</p>
<p>Initially, hawkish PBOC comments pushed SHIBOR yields to year-to-date peaks in February. However, by the mid-year, the PBOC pivoted to neutral and then most recently a dovish policy stance. The central bank cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio twice; on both occasions it was foreshadowed by calls by Premier Li for monetary support for the real economy.</p>
<p>Anticipating these cuts, SHIBOR yields declined and the curve flattened throughout the remainder of 2021. The PBOC also focused on maintaining adequate liquidity, ensuring that repo rates were much more stable than in 2020. However, escalating property-related risks continued to negatively impact onshore credit spreads, which surged higher in the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>MMFs with long duration positions outperformed, but heightened expectations of additional monetary policy rate cuts next year have diminished the longer-term outlook for MMF yields. Given their focus on high quality investments, MMFs, especially triple-A rated funds, remained insulated from higher credit risks – although credit markets are likely to remain volatile in 2022.</p>
<h4 id=""the-evolving-asset-management-industry"">The evolving asset management industry</h4>
<p>Mutual fund assets under management (AUM) jumped to a new record high of CNY24trn, up 34% year-over-year (as at end Q321). While this was impressive, mutual funds still only represent 10% of the total bank deposits base (~CNY230trn) – although they have caught up on bank wealth management products (~CNY27trn).</p>
<p>In absolute terms, the biggest increase was in MMFs, which jumped 29% year-over-year to a new record high of 9.4 trillion – a strong rebound following declines in 2019 and 2020. MMFs still represent the largest asset class with 39% of total AUM, although this has continued to trend downwards from a peak of 67% in Q318 as other asset classes, have grown faster.</p>
<p>MMFs utilised by e-wallets continued to dominate, representing 49% of total MMF AUM – interestingly, these are now more diversified as regulatory concerns translated into more fund choice across these platforms. Institutional demand also remained strong, representing 38% of AUM, although the number of triple-A funds was unchanged – AUM growth was also robust as multinational corporations and large local institutional investors sought MMFs with good liquidity and security.</p>
<p>These growth trends are likely to persist in 2022 as ongoing pandemic and economic uncertainty encourage renminbi retail and institutional investors to hold elevated cash balances.</p>
<h4 id=""new-rules-new-competition"">New rules, new competition</h4>
<p>China’s Asset Management Product (AMP) Rules will finally come into force at the end of 2020 after a one-year delay. Originally announced in April 2018, the rules represent the most significant change to how China regulates its shadow banking sector since inception.</p>
<p>The new rules require banks to take their wealth management products (WMP) back on balance sheet, convert them to mark-to-market and, importantly, no longer guarantee returns. By the end of 2020, WMP outstanding had declined sharply as banks repackaged and resold these products via their new asset management companies, and this trend will continue into 2022.</p>
<p>Aside from the competition posed by new NAV-style asset management products, MMFs will also face challenges from new mutual fund products, including NCD Index Funds and ultra-short duration funds, offering different characteristics and features. The authority’s prioritisation of ESG factors, especially climate change and a focus on carbon neutrality, have likewise started impacting security issuance, fund developments and investor requirements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, attractive returns, ease of use, high liquidity and good credit quality should help MMFs maintain growth momentum into 2022.</p>

<h4 id=""what-does-chinas-money-market-fund-look-like-today"">What does China’s money market fund look like today?</h4>
<p>Since renminbi money market funds were first introduced in mainland China in 2004, the sector has been growing in both size and significance.</p>
<p>As of November 2021, there were 330 registered MMFs in mainland China, with RMB9.4trn in (AUM), representing around 38.77% of all types of asset AUMs. The MMFs serves as an intermediary between borrowers seeking short-term funding and investors searching for a low-risk cash management solution. MMFs play a very vital role in short-term, fixed income capital markets.</p>
<p>While there is a large number of MMFs in mainland China, the industry is concentrated. The top ten funds concentration has decreased gradually since 2013: the top ten funds accounted for over 64.20% of assets in 2013, but the figure was 24.77% by the end of November 2021.</p>
<p>In the past, retail investors preferred wealth management products and bank deposits, whereas institutional investors were limited to products offered by banks. After the introduction of MMFs, while retail investors welcomed this product, they seldom pay attention to the risk control of MMFs. As for institutional investors, they are more interested in MMFs for their higher safety margin nature, as well as their high liquidity and market yield characteristics.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of MMFs in the market has sped up regulatory tightening. In 2017, CSRC published regulatory requirements for all the open-ended mutual funds, and also imposed stricter regulatory requirements on MMFs such as WAM and WAL, single asset investment limitation, credit quality, single entity exposure etc, which aimed to reduce the financial disintermediation and increase the stability of China’s MMFs.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the rising focus on the safety margin of MMFs in the mainland China market, the fund size of HSBC Jintrust MMF has grown steadily since its inception in 2011. HSBC Jintrust Money Market Fund has a strict risk control process, and is suitable for corporations with RMB surpluses in mainland China. The investment objective is to maintain the low risk and high liquidity of its assets and seek to achieve a yield that is higher than that of its benchmark: RMB seven-day call deposit rate.</p>
<h4 id=""what-developments-are-likely-in-2022"">What developments are likely in 2022?</h4>
<p>In 2021, due to the low interest rate environment, hybrid bond funds which include a certain portion of equity assets, also known as “fixed income plus” products, have become more popular among investors. We believe the trend will continue in 2022.</p>
<p>The performance of the fixed income plus products beat market expectations in 2021. As of October 2021, according to data from Wind, the median performance of hybrid bond fund was 4.2% and bond fund-II was 4.10%, beating the performance of long-term pure bond fund (2.99%) and short-term bond fund (2.67%).</p>
<p>We think this trend will continue in 2022, as 2021 was the last year for transitioning wealth management products from being valued on an amortised-cost basis to a net asset basis. Those investors who focus on lower risk and stable performance will likely turn to invest in fixed income plus products.</p>
<p>As at 3rd December 2021, there are six interbank AAA NCD index funds registered in mainland China. This is the first time that the interbank AAA NCD index has been introduced. The interbank AAA NCD index fund’s risk characteristics is in between traditional MMFs and short-term bond funds, with normally a seven-day holding requirement. It provides a new tool for those investors who are risk-averse while seeking a yield return that is a bit higher, as its underlying assets are AAA NCD issued in the mainland China market.</p>
<p>There is a potential risk arising from the mismatch between yield and time under amortised-cost valuation. As such, some regulations are implemented in order to control the usage of the amortised-cost method. The interbank AAA NCD index fund is suitable for those investors who focus more on cash management solutions, and we expect this product is likely to become more popular in 2022.</p>

<h4 id=""digital-commerce-and-real-time-payments-business-and-revenue-drivers"">Digital commerce and real-time payments – business and revenue drivers</h4>
<p>Retailers are focused on growing their share of direct-to-consumer sales by gaining first-hand information on customer preferences and omni-channel data insights. The ratio of digital commerce to total retail sales is becoming material and is expected to go over 20% of all retail sales worldwide by 2024 with Asian countries leading the way, according to Statista. Scaling up the digitisation of treasury and cash management will be the bedrock required to harness this e-commerce growth and support 24/7 always-on business models.</p>
<p>E-tailers are working to add new and localised mobile wallets and real-time payment methods to widen their digital customer base and grow their businesses. While doing so, there is a clear preference towards mobile and real-time payment methods vis-à-vis credit cards and cash on delivery payments.</p>
<p>This preference is driven primarily by traceability, instant settlement capabilities, and the elimination of interchange and charge back costs. However, for adoption of real-time payments to continue to increase at the same rate in the coming years, consumers will need to be lured by loyalty offerings and rewards programmes similar to credit cards. These could include value adds like Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) to support customer credit needs, QR codes, and Request to Pay (R2P) for improved controls.</p>

<h4 id=""tipping-point-for-a-real-time-digitised-treasury"">Tipping point for a real-time, digitised treasury</h4>
<p>Given the regulatory ‘payment amount’ restrictions on instant payment schemes in most markets, the usage to date has largely been for consumer-to-business (C2B, B2C) flows. This is, however, expected to change, given the planned increase in amount thresholds of real-time payments and RTP scheme roll outs. There is also an increased focus by central banks on building cross-border instant payment rails using interoperable distributed ledger technology (DLT). These changes are set to propel the business-to-business (B2B) usage of domestic and cross-border instant payments. This B2B usage coupled with increasing share of C2B digital sales is expected to make up a very material portion of the operating flows for corporates real-time, and further drive-up the working capital cycle velocity requiring treasuries to be truly digitised and real-time.</p>
<p>However, not all payment flows and treasury processes need to move to real-time. There are several costs associated with real-time payments. Apart from the obvious technology-related costs in terms of bank connectivity, robotic processing, security and fraud controls, the liquidity buffer costs are expected to become significant with increased C2B and B2B adoption. The cost benefit analysis and justification for real-time payments and treasury processes is likely to be dependent largely on the business model and the share of real-time payments in a business’ overall working capital.</p>
<h4 id=""digitisation-and-data-enablers-for-a-real-time-24-7-treasury"">Digitisation and data: enablers for a real-time, 24/7 treasury</h4>
<p>During the pandemic there has been heightened attention on liquidity risk management. Treasurers have transitioned from periodic liquidity checks and reporting to building direct connectivity between their enterprise resource planning (ERP), treasury management system (TMS), foreign exchange (FX) platforms and banking partners, vendors and suppliers. In 2022, the current batch-based weekday only connectivity with banks is expected to evolve to its logical next stage. The use cases for Application Programming Interface (API) based on-demand, near real-time balance visibility for all days in a week across multiple banks are expected to widen beyond insurance and payment intermediary companies. This will require treasuries to invest in and evolve their own technology stack and further digitise their day-to-day back-office processes using DLT and artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies.</p>
<p>Treasurers are finding it hard to manage the ebbs and flows in working capital velocity given the increase in miniature direct-to-consumer ecommerce flows. This is compelling them to graduate from Excel-based forecasting and cash position management. Treasurers are now focusing on building on-demand, near real-time data consumption and AI based forecasting models to support dynamic decision making. Without the evolution to a real-time treasury – in terms of visibility, predictable forecasting models and decisioning, the costs of liquidity buffers (actual and notional) to fund real-time payments will outweigh their benefits.</p>
<h4 id=""hidden-yield-real-time-liquidity-and-working-capital-management"">Hidden yield: real-time liquidity and working capital management</h4>
<p>A shift in business strategy towards digital commerce, near-shoring and digitisation of the supply chain is having a significant impact on liquidity and working capital management. Treasurers are adapting their liquidity structures to manage this shift and seamlessly facilitate commercial success.</p>
<p>Traditionally, corporates with a B2B business model have been comfortable with once-a-day inter-company sweeps to fund their group companies for their payments and short-term working capital requirements. However, with the increased direct-to-consumer flow share and working capital velocity, treasurers are now keen to reap the liquidity cost benefits of funding real-time payments on-demand or just-in time rather than building up intra-day, overnight and/or weekend buffers. Corporates focused on C2B growth and/or liquidity cost efficiency, are expected to graduate to balance triggered real-time sweeps to fund their group subsidiaries and their group subsidiary payments just-in-time.  Deploying liquidity generated from real-time collections to support faster delivery, release merchant limits, fund group companies with their working capital requirements or make just-in time investments is becoming pivotal.</p>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2022-01-11-tt-00-sf__citi__real-time-treasury__1500x1499.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=6C656EAD4A3CC7CACC108C5D18A2316A"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Efficiency gains from real-time payments"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2022-01-11-tt-00-sf__citi__real-time-treasury__1500x1499.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=6C656EAD4A3CC7CACC108C5D18A2316A"" title=""Real-time treasury"" width=""600""/></a></p>
<p>Real-time liquidity sharing across entities, helps corporates with multi-entity business models to increase reliance on their own group’s intra-day liquidity to fund payments in a frictionless manner instead of relying on bank credit. Businesses that do not have in place sophisticated forecasting capabilities are able to benefit from real-time liquidity sharing by achieving higher straight through processing rate of payments and eliminating intra-day and end-of-day liquidity costs to fund payments. In addition to the abovementioned use cases of real-time intra-day liquidity sharing between physical accounts, the adoption of real-time liquidity sharing between multi-entity virtual and physical account structures is expected to grow not only for corporates with mature treasuries, but also for expanding digital natives as they diversify their businesses and chart their course towards becoming super apps.</p>
<p>For corporates, where weekend activity of instant payments is becoming material, there is a clear need for seven-day sweeps emanating to avoid weekend overdraft charges. Select corporates are transitioning from end-of-day zero balancing sweeps to targeted balancing sweeps to have enough liquidity to fund after hours domestic and cross-border instant payments.</p>
<p>Traditionally treasurers reviewed their sweep structures once or twice a year. Treasurers are turning to their banking partners to provide them liquidity sweep structure visualisation tools with the ability to self-serve and make changes dynamically. These active changes will help optimise the use of liquidity surge on sales days or to support unplanned shortfall in group cash position. While adoption of electronic submission of e-signed documents started in 2021, this digital onboarding of liquidity structures is set to become the norm in 2022. Rule-based automated investments will be an area of attention for cash surplus treasurers in this pandemic where the market has been flushed with liquidity and there is a huge focus on yield improvements in the low-rate environment.</p>
<h4 id=""risk-management-automation-and-intelligence"">Risk management: automation and intelligence</h4>
<p>Treasurers will continue to stress on real-time payments security and fraud risks by building front-end validations, fraud analytics and outlier behaviour monitoring tools. The risk management focus will become especially important as the amount thresholds for these payments and their adoption increases. There is also likely to be an increased adoption of cross-currency sweeps to manage both liquidity and FX risks in an automated manner.</p>
<p>Several banks offer automated counterparty risk management support to their corporates by mobilising liquidity in excess of defined limits and basis rule-based priorities to other trusted banking partners. This multi-bank liquidity mobilisation tool usage is expected to become more real-time once the amount threshold of instant payments continues to be increased by regulators. This is expected to fuel cross-bank real-time funding of payments and investment automation while supporting with liquidity risk management.</p>

<p>Many companies are still holding more cash than usual in a legacy from the pandemic and the need for ample liquidity on hand. Their cash levels have remained buoyed by factors such as the reduction in dividend pay-outs over the last year and decisions to delay capex projects. This is leading more companies to explore cash segmentation strategies to optimise both liquidity and returns in today’s low yield environment.</p>
<p>“Cash segmentation involves separating cash into three main buckets,” explains James Morek, Managing Director, Head of International Cash Sales at BlackRock. “One bucket prioritises liquid working capital, holding cash needed daily. Second and third buckets target diversification and returns, with the second holding core cash in a rainy day or buffer fund, while a third invests more long term.”</p>
<p>Cash forecasting technology is a crucial element of cash segmentation, as is education and understanding the different risk profiles in segregated mandates. Treasury teams must also ensure all the correct internal investment approvals are in place. “Treasury teams looking to broaden their investment products need to build it into their systems; working with partners is easier than buying in the resources to do it in-house,” says Morek.</p>
<p>Treasurers should approach cash segmentation by putting capital preservation at the heart of the strategy. From this base, they can then shape liquidity and income priorities based on their appetite for interest rate and credit risk. “The operating account should have less interest rate risk and more highly rated securities, such as treasury bills or overnight securities,” explains Brett Davis, Director, Cash Portfolio Manager at BlackRock. Cash that can be locked up for longer can be invested in credit instruments, commercial paper, corporate bonds or swapped between fixed and floating rates. “With more runway into when you need liquidity, treasury teams can opt for more duration and interest rate risk via longer-dated securities and more credit instruments.” At its core, segmentation means constructing a portfolio based on a deep understanding of treasury’s cash needs in an approach that can be dialled up or down within a company’s broad risk tolerance.</p>
<p>Segregated or separate accounts should not be a replacement for short-term money market funds. Instead, they offer a complimentary place in treasury’s cash management armoury and avoid any recourse to in-house teams –  they allow treasury teams to diversify their cash investments and invest further up the curve in different products. “You get the benefits of co-mingled products and the chance to tailor solutions to your own needs,” says Morek. “In a low-rate environment, they allow companies to optimise their cash positions and target different points of the yield curve,” adds Davis. They also offer a chance for treasury teams to better navigate market turbulence and benefit from a rising rate environment ahead of central bank policy moves. “Optimising the use of cash has become even more important,” says Morek.</p>
<p>Morek and Davis conclude that liquidity should be more than just cash on hand. Separately managed accounts utilise a broad set of investments and take advantage of the technological benefits of cash flow forecasting. “Cash segmentation is here to stay. We will see more of it as corporate treasury teams tap the benefits of outsourcing,” says Morek.</p>

Accelerating Asia’s shift to digital transactions ,"


<p><em>The digitisation of business-to-business transactions is accelerating in Asia, and recent developments in Japan, India and China show how the shift away from paper is giving treasurers the opportunity to rethink and overhaul their existing systems and processes.</em></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>As the world shifts from physical to digital – a trend that has been accelerated by the global pandemic – various markets in Asia are undergoing a transformation. Take Japan, for example, where a longstanding corporate tradition is disappearing that is symbolic of the wider trend of digitisation.</p>
<p>The hanko company seal or ‘chop’ – a red stamp that is uniquely carved and registered with the legal bureau – has long been used instead of handwritten signatures on corporate documents. Corporates usually keep it under lock and key in the company safe, with strict procedures around who is authorised to use it. Makoto Hasegawa, Head of Transaction Banking, Japan at BNP Paribas, comments how in an environment where most people are now expected to work from home, “The company chop does not actually match the world culture of 2021.”</p>
<p>Japan needed to find alternatives to the physical company stamp. In October 2020, the prime minister told the government to make plans for removing hanko from government documents. And many corporates have also decided to drop the chop. Hasegawa explains how BNP Paribas was able to support its corporate clients with such a transition. The first step, she says, was to use digital signatures for documents where a company seal was not legally necessary. For example, a withdrawal request, or a loan rollover – where the original paperwork with the seal was already on file – did not need to be stamped again. Also, trade finance guarantees, term deposits, balance confirmation requests, for example, could be arranged by email or e-signature. “This made treasurers life easier as they did not need to go into the office - we offered them a solution,” comments Hasegawa.</p>
<p>The pandemic has been a catalyst for change, and the hanko could eventually disappear altogether. Hasegawa says that corporates should start preparing for this shift now. In advice to treasurers in Asia, she says, “I would start working with a bank that already accepts e-signatures so the shift is easier,” she says.</p>
<p>Japan is not the only market in Asia that has been heavily reliant on physical processes. India has also been undergoing a digital transformation of its own with corporate transactions. Rupa Balsekar, Head of Transaction Banking, India for BNP Paribas comments how the pandemic has pushed treasurers to be more digital: “If a client had manual transactions and was previously sitting on the fence about whether to be manual or digital, they are now moving into digital solutions,” she says. Digitisation is now a top three priority for treasurers. They realise that working from home could be extended,” she says.</p>
<p>She goes on to explain that India is a regulated market where, for example, numerous documents need to be validated in trade transactions. BNP Paribas has developed an online platform to make this process more efficient, a solution that has digitised more than 21 types of trade transaction. Corporate treasurer can now execute trade transactions in an efficient manner . removing manual work from the process, along with the need for paperwork, emails or phone calls.</p>
<p>Balsekar comments that BNP Paribas’ already existing virtual account solution also helps the digitisation process and has been useful in easily identifying remitters of transactions. In addition to that, a couple of industry leading solutions have been put in place in last two years by BNP Paribas in India to digitalise the receivables reconciliation process. The Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment solution (EIPP) can facilitate collections digitally on a 24x7x365 basis.  The order-to-cash reconciliation, which was earlier an incredibly cumbersome process involving extensive manual efforts in reconciling single payments against multiple invoices has been automated using advanced character reading capabilities (ACR) coupled with AI &amp; Machine learning to enhance the accuracy. Now with advanced ACR technology, it is possible to digitally scan documents and automatically match payments with their corresponding invoices, with the reconciliation data being fed into the corporate’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. “This is another game changer that has been put in place in India by recognising companies’ needs and supporting operational efficiency,” says Balsekar.</p>
<p>This digitisation trend in India is also in line with another key priority for treasurers – sustainability – as reams of paper are removed from the system, which in turn helps the environment.</p>
<p>China is another market in Asia that has been on a journey with the digitisation of its payments. Louise Zhang, Head of Transaction Banking, China at BNP Paribas, explains that domestic solutions such as AliPay and WeChat Pay have been ahead of the pack when it comes to digitisation. The area that is ripe for disruption, she notes, is cross-border transactions. In recent years, Chinese regulators have issued a few guidelines in order to facilitate the flow of renminbi internationally. This has also involved simpler, more digitalised processes for the supporting documents for cross-border payments, which can now be submitted in electronic format.</p>
<p>Now, instead of needing to verify paper documents, it is possible to check customer data by referring to a shared database – by checking underlying details with the system of customs office and tax office directly, for example. “This has created new efficiencies,” says Zhang. Payments for goods trade is now far more streamlined, through validation of information in the China International Trade Single Window,  which  removes  paper from the process. In addition to this, BNP Paribas also offers a digital tool to all the clients for regulatory declarations, which has also accelerated the shift to digital transactions for corporates.  “BNP Paribas is very committed to this market, and we are offering the latest technology to our clients,” says Zhang.</p>
<p>Zhang emphasises, however, that it is not just to provide a technical tool or product to the treasurers. “We want to help clients navigate this journey and do the entire review of their cash management set-up. We play an advisory role for our clients – it is easy to adopt technology, but it is important that the workflow and the process are also fine-tuned,” she says.</p>

The changing forms of money,"


<p><em>From the early days of sea shells (Asia) and monumental stones (Yap), humans have long used a variety of units for exchange and store of value. Coins date back some 3,000 years (Greece) and paper money dates back 1,000 years (China). Promissory notes known as ‘Jiaozi’ were printed by a group of merchants in Sichuan during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong (AD 997–1022).  Venetian merchants are famously credited with inventing accounting and bills of exchange, but JiaoZi pre date them by a few hundred years.</em></p>

<p>We tend to think that money as we know it has been around for ever, but the Bank of England was established in 1694 (three decades after the Riksbank), and the Federal Reserve in 1913.</p>
<p>Money is important for the operation of complex societies with increasing specialisation, but there is no intrinsic reason why money will not continue to evolve.</p>
<h4 id=""20th-century-money"">20th century money</h4>
<p>While the underpinnings of money changed during the 20th century from money backed by gold to free floating fiat currencies, the experience of money was reasonably stable (and paper based) until the advent of early computer systems that enabled early ATMs and credit cards and telex which powered the initial SWIFT four corner cross border settlement schemes.</p>
<p>Before the early digital era, money comprised coins and bank notes together with personal cheques and bank drafts. It all had to be done on paper and manually, so it was slow and expensive. The role of banks as creators of credit (effectively money) through the magic of fractional reserve banking was well established, albeit much slower and harder to regulate because of the lack of transparency that comes from manual paper-based processes. (Better regulatory visibility enabled by digitisation has been offset by even faster and more complex banking activity delivered by the same technologies.)</p>
<p>Even though banking was slow and expensive, people and businesses became familiar with considering a bookkeeping entry as part of their wealth, in addition to physical notes and coins. In bank back offices, money was moving from ink on paper to bits and bytes. But from a user perspective, the banking system was only accessible during banking hours which were normally more restrictive than the classic nine to five workday of most employees.</p>
<h4 id=""early-digitisation-of-money"">Early digitisation of money</h4>
<p>Electronic messaging and rudimentary automation were game changers, and eventually led to the first credit cards which freed us from bulging wallets.</p>
<p>ATMs freed us from bank branches by giving people access to cash 24/7 – though in Japan ATMs were locked inside bank branches well into the 2000s, giving a huge boost to non-bank cash distributors like Seven-Eleven. Likewise, credit cards enabled us to spend money 24/7 regardless of bank working hours.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, Americans discovered the joys of money market chequing accounts offered by brokers to get around the OCC rules that prevented banks from paying interest on current accounts. Regulatory restrictions drove, and digitisation enabled, innovation in the business banking space as well, with new services such as sweeping (ZBA) and in the early 1980s notional pooling. (Notional pooling is still not allowed under OCC rules, so American banks offer the service in Canada and Bermuda.)</p>
<h4 id="""">Money in the 21st century</h4>
<p>The internet, and later mobile, have radically changed user expectations. Massive service innovation and Moore’s Law in technology have created expectations of instant everything and mostly for free too. Money has generally been slow to adapt. An industry with a government mandated monopoly has little incentive to disturb the status quo. Fintech encroachment on core money has until very recently been held back by regulatory constraints. Internet and mobile wallets remained niche.</p>
<p>Regulators, seeing the internet develop rapidly ahead of what 20th money could service, and spurred by the growth of niche services such as PayPal, Venmo, AliPay, etcetera to material scale, have finally become more proactive. This is reflected in the push for 24/7 instant payments and the creation of regulatory sandboxes for fintech and financial innovation generally.</p>
<h4 id=""invisible-banking"">Invisible banking</h4>
<p>It has become commonplace that “we don’t want banking, we want stuff”. After decades of emphasising how nice their branches are, or more recently how great their internet banking is, banks are understanding that the best user experience is invisible (and safe). Users want homes, not mortgages. Users want goods and services, not payments.</p>
<p>Uber is a good case study in proto invisible banking. By interfacing with credit card systems, Uber was able to create an invisible settlement experience for its users. Specify your trip, get into the car that arrives, get out at the end – there is no payment step in the process. It helps that the mobility business executed through mobile devices with GPS provides a strong evidence of service delivery to justify those credit card charges.</p>
<p>Banks, often driven by regulators, are catching up with this reality in terms of service innovation. Instant payments, which are rolling out in most markets, enable verifiable settlement with QR codes and RFID tags, offering a cheaper alternative to card networks. Open banking, which is spreading much more slowly, enables better integration of settlement services into internet platforms that provide ‘stuff’ that users want.</p>
<p>It has been a decade since the internet moved on from ‘mash-ups’ to APIs everywhere. Mash-ups were the first examples of services built on top of other services – an example is Zillow showing homes for sale on top of a Google map. Now APIs allow internet services to integrate multiple specialist offerings in their own products. For example, the tutorials that pop up over web sites and the friendly chat icon at the bottom right of most web sites are all external specialist services that are pulled in (aka ‘consumed’) through APIs.</p>
<p>Banks are finally starting to work on similar capabilities, though clearly consuming bank balances, not to mention payment services, through API requires careful security planning. More critically, APIs redefine who owns the customer experience, which is causing headaches to banks.</p>
<h4 id=""wallets"">Wallets</h4>
<p>In response to the clunky and expensive user experience provided by traditional banking in the online world, tech in general has embraced wallets. These obviously have their own problems, including fragmenting user cash, potential credit risk, and increasingly regulation.</p>
<p>Ant Financial’s Yu’e Bao, which means ‘leftover treasure’, became the world’s biggest money market fund within a couple years of launching. It peaked at US$1.7trn in 2018, but has since shrunk in response to regulatory pressure to increase the liquidity of its assets, which resulted in lower yields.</p>
<p>Consumer facing businesses in China increasingly need to accept settlement from wallets. Some have more than half their cash in ‘non-bank accounts’ – primarily wallets. The market is material enough that cash pooling and similar corporate products have become available. Integrating wallets and bank accounts remains a work in progress, and it will be interesting to see which predominates in the future.</p>
<p>Most wallets are tied to fiat currencies, but the success of Bitcoin and other DLT coins, has spurred big tech to move into this area as well. Facebook announced its coin ‘Libra’ in 2019, but strong regulatory and political backlash cancelled the proposed 2020 launch, and it has since been re-branded as ‘Diem’.</p>
<p>Also in 2019, J.P. Morgan announced ‘JPM Coin’ as USD on a private DLT. All this activity has spurred central banks to speed their studies and in some cases roll-outs of their own coins.</p>
<h4 id=""central-bank-digital-currency"">Central bank digital currency</h4>
<p>In 2020, PBOC rolled out large scale pilots of its CBDC – digital CNY. Uptake has been enough to prompt tech companies to develop capabilities for CBDC settlement. To the extent that CBDC is legal tender – just as notes and coins and bank bits and bytes – commercial adoption is ineluctable.</p>
<p>Although CBDCs are not necessarily implemented as DLTs (cloud databases are totally fit for purpose), it seems clear that the growth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, et al – as well as the ‘Libra’ saga – has pushed governments forward. CBDCs – properly implemented – can eliminate the volatility problems of Bitcoin as a store of value, and with the same technology base that has been proven with instant payments can provide fast and cheap settlement (Bitcoin is expensive and slow).</p>
<p>CBDCs introduce some interesting issues that have the potential to radically transform money and banking. In some implementations, CBDC has the effect of allowing citizens to bank directly with the central bank, thus cutting out banks. This would have many advantages, and would result in big reductions in risk across the monetary system. It would also render ineffective many central bank policy levers that are currently executed through the banking system.</p>
<p>If CBDCs allow citizens and businesses to bank directly with the central bank, this would free banks from onerous regulation and allow them to focus on value added provision of financial services such as investment, loans, risk management, and so forth.</p>
<p>If CBDCs are implemented via banks, they will not be very different from the current status quo such as instant payments, which are messaging around bits and bytes held at banks.</p>
<h4 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h4>
<p>For treasurers, the future course of money might have radical consequences for daily operations and risk management. In any case, the spread of instant 24/7 settlement will require deep and thoughtful automation as long as treasurers need sleep and holidays. Treasurers are likely to have to deal with new service providers for wallets and potentially DLT coins. And depending on how CBDCs roll out, they may start to have a very different relationship with central banks.</p>

<p>Like corporations everywhere, Japanese multinationals have faced considerable challenges during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>These have included some challenges specific to the local market. “One of the main challenges for Japanese MNCs is how to manage the COVID-19 crisis in overseas areas,” explains Olaf Zimmlinghaus, Director – General Affairs and Finance at Nippon Express, a global logistics company with the group headquarters in Tokyo and the European headquarters in Düsseldorf, Germany, “There’s a considerable distance between their headquarters in Japan and Europe or the US, which can present challenges when it comes to responding to urgent situations.”</p>
<p>In addition, Zimmlinghaus says, Japanese multinationals faced complexity when staff who had previously been seconded to Europe had to return to Japan with their families. “Co-ordinating action between the local management, workers in Europe and Japanese people returning to Japan was a big challenge but finally well managed,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""the-transition-to-home-working"">The transition to home working</h4>
<p>As in other countries, the transition to home working has also presented challenges. During the crisis under “state of emergency”, the Japanese government called on companies and asked 70% of their employees to work from home. While Japan has a strong culture of office working, the transition went smooth for large Japanese corporates, says Makoto Hasegawa, Head of Transaction Banking, BNP Paribas Tokyo Branch.</p>
<p>“This year was supposed to be the year of the Olympics in Japan,” she explains. “In the run up to the Olympic games, the government had already asked companies to prepare to work from home during the Olympic period in order to avoid heavy traffic and crowded trains.  Even though we could not host the games in the end, Japanese corporates were able to deploy the contingency plans in place for the Olympics as the pandemic situation worsened.”</p>
<p>During this period, there was a marked increase in customers seeking to avoid disruption to their activities, says Isabelle André, Regional Cash Management Sales, BNP Paribas Paris. She adds that key priorities included ensuring that payments would be processed on time, and that information could be shared effectively between teams in different geographical locations when working from home.</p>
<p>One particular pain point was the Japanese local practice of chopping documents with a company seal, which is typically locked in a safe in the office. Consequently, staff had to go into the office in order to chop documents – but the Japanese government is currently reviewing this practice in order to shift to processes that can be carried out from home.</p>
<h4 id=""full-steam-ahead"">Full steam ahead</h4>
<p>Despite the transition to a remote working environment, Nippon Express has not only maintained continuity of its treasury activities but has also kept up momentum with a major cash management project that was initiated before the crisis began.</p>
<p>In 2018, the company was seeking greater efficiency in its cash management strategy in Europe – which meant working with a banking partner that had a broad coverage across the European region. Following a formal RFP process, Nippon Express selected BNP Paribas. “Our target was to implement a European cash pool across Europe, with BNP Paribas bank accounts for all of our companies,” explains Zimmlinghaus. “The BNP Paribas bank accounts needed to be our primary settlement accounts for collections and payments. In addition, we wanted to have a cash management system that would enable us to see what liquidity we have in our organisation, and where it is placed.”</p>
<p>After selecting BNP Paribas, the next step was to set up a joint project team and map out the steps that the implementation would need to include. The relevant countries were divided into two phases – the UK, for example, is included in the second phase in light of the evolving Brexit situation – but during the course of the project the company has also been flexible in adjusting which countries should be prioritised.</p>
<p>In addition, weekly calls are held between BNP Paribas  and Nippon Express Europe  in order to maintain momentum. BNP Paribas provided a dedicated team which has followed the project from the outset and uses a dashboard to monitor progress and follow up action points. Other key success factors include transparency into the decision-making process.</p>
<p>“Also important is the communication from BNP Paribas in both Europe and Japan,” comments André. “There are two teams that are working together, with the same knowledge of the project.”</p>
<h4 id=""looking-forward"">Looking forward</h4>
<p>While the project is still under way, Nippon Express is well on its way to achieving its key goals of greater transparency, higher compliance and greater security within its financial environment. Following the adoption of BNP Paribas’ eBanking solution, the company has already gained visibility into the accounts that have already been opened. “The next step is to execute according to the clear road map we’ve committed to,” Zimmlinghaus says.</p>
<p>More generally, he observes that for Japanese MNCs operating in Europe, “the main challenge is to bring the differences in these cultures and working styles under one umbrella as much as possible.” He notes that Japanese companies should be prepared to hand some control to European management, as other Japanese multinationals have done. Conversely, he says, European multinationals moving into Japan need to “understand and respect the underlying structures and procedures of the highly developed Japanese business culture.”</p>
<p>With an eye on the future, Hasegawa says that Japanese companies operating in Europe will be focusing on expected market changes in the coming year. Nippon Express has regional headquarters in Germany, but for companies with regional headquarters in the UK, Brexit may make it necessary to move those headquarters elsewhere in Europe. Other challenges include the transition away from LIBOR.</p>
<p>But despite the challenges, Hasegawa points out that Europe continues to present considerable opportunities for Japanese multinationals. While Europe includes multiple currencies, the region’s regulatory environment makes it relatively easy to implement efficient cash management solutions. “With the opportunities available in Europe, Japanese corporates are increasingly looking at achieving greater efficiency across their payments, collections and liquidity management,” she concludes.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, it’s cash that makes the business world go round. Short-term is the big concern for many businesses in the current COVID-19-constrained trading environment. With revenue streams hit hard, the pandemic has impacted the cash and liquidity positions of many companies. But not all are impacted in the same way.</p>
<p>Companies with large cash buffers and low leverage and debt-servicing costs will be more resilient than those leveraged to the hilt. Some sectors are naturally more robust than others in the current situation. Online retailers and supermarket chains are clearly benefitting from increased cash flow. Many of those in the travel and tourism sectors are suffering existential crises.</p>
<p>Even the so-called ‘defensive industries’ (those that are relatively immune to economic fluctuations, such as the supermarkets) are facing new challenges with COVID-19. As infection rates peak, the supermarkets have had to develop their logistics infrastructures in order to satisfy rapidly rising demand. For some, it was a matter of assessing whether increased demand would be sustained long enough to get sufficient return on any infrastructure development costs, or whether post-COVID-19 their expanded logistics infrastructure would absorb too much cash.</p>
<h4 id=""cash-control"">Cash control</h4>
<p>“Any crisis, like the great financial crisis in 2008 or now the corona crisis, always highlights the importance of liquidity and the old corporate treasurer’s truth ‘cash is king’. It is therefore crucial to have good control over your organisation’s funds.” Thus states Christian Bartsch, a treasury and finance consultant, managing director, and Professor of Business Administration (Finance &amp; Accounting) at IUBH University of Applied Sciences, and Adjunct Lecturer at EU Business School, Munich.</p>
<p>One way to achieve essential control is by cash segmentation. This, he explains, is the division of an organisation’s funds into categories to increase financial stability and promote better control over assets and – at the same time – the budget process. The most common divisions under cash segmentation are operating cash, reserve cash, and strategic cash. However, he notes, some organisations may also have restricted cash division.</p>
<p>For Aziz Parvez, Head of Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Sales, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America, the extent to which is it necessary to have a clear picture both of cash holdings and capital planning is clear.</p>
<p>“It is extremely important for a company’s treasury to segment cash, not only to ensure that day-to-day cash needs are properly catered for but also companies’ mid-term requirement and long-term visibility of cash positions to support strategy objectives and expansion plans are met,” he says.</p>
<p>Parvez acknowledges that this has become particularly relevant against the backdrop of a pandemic and global economic slowdown. “Now more than ever, companies need to ensure visibility and accuracy of their cash flows so that they can plan ahead and ensure their funding requirements are fully supported in these challenging times.”</p>
<p>Thomas Stahr, Interim Treasurer, Treasury Consultant and Project Specialist, believes too that it is essential for treasurers to divide cash into core segments. This, he says, “starts with cash which is available on the balance sheet but which cannot be accessed because it is trapped, and goes all the way to cash that is causing negative interest on credit and, above all, with particular attention given to the currency in which cash is available or needed”.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current circumstances of collapsing economic demand on the one hand, and negative interest rates for cash in EUR and CHF on the other, “are the two biggest cash challenges a treasurer should have under control at the moment,” says Stahr, a former Head of Corporate Treasury at global airport ground services firm, Swissport.</p>
<p>“The goal in an uncertain economic situation must be very clear: to secure sufficient short-term and medium-term liquidity,” he warns. This means “a healthy mix” of committed and uncommitted credit lines is the first choice, because these generate the lowest costs. “But planning early refinancing to secure long-term liquidity is also a priority during this period.”</p>
<p>The current economic circumstances have indeed changed client goals, reports Parvez. “Clients are focused on short- and medium-term cash requirements,” he says. The key focus right now is to ensure a sufficient cash buffer to see the business through the current situation. “This has become important not only to manage the operational needs of the companies but also from a rating perspective, given the shifting credit environment.”</p>
<h4 id=""levels-of-segmentation"">Levels of segmentation</h4>
<p>It depends on what the operational business of the company is, as to how detailed and layered the segmentation process is. A company that produces machinery has different cash requirements to one that is a wholesaler, and different again from one that is engaged in insurance or banking. But all areas have one thing in common, and that is ensuring minimum liquidity for the operational business and investments.</p>
<p>Three levels of segmentation are the most effective, covering operating cash/working capital (short-term), reserve cash (medium-term), and strategic cash (long-term).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-term</strong>. Short-term forecasts provide the cash detail needed to help manage working capital and to protect day-to-day company liquidity, covering the immediate cash inflows and outflows that affect overnight balances. Daily and even intra-day forecasts ensure that treasury keeps abreast of last-minute changes to cash flows. Weekly and monthly forecasts (for up to about three months) provide advance warning of the expected cash positions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Medium-term</strong>. Rolling monthly forecasts for up to 12 months ahead help to predict cash needs and surpluses further into the future. They help to show where the high and low points of cash availability are likely to occur through the course of the year as well as identify when existing investments and debts may be maturing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Long term</strong>. Long-term forecasts may cover up to a three or even five-year period. They provide a longer view of potential surplus resources and financing needs to help ensure that a company’s business plans and strategies can be properly funded. They also help to identify future cash that has not yet been ‘earmarked’ for use and is therefore available to invest for a longer time period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""Vital-forecast"">Vital forecast</h4>
<p>In terms of applicable technique, first of all, it is extremely useful to establish well-structured reporting of required liquidity, per entity and currency, and then to consolidate that data, urges Stahr. “The whole process should be on a time axis with a minimum of nine months, but better still over one year.”</p>
<p>The aim here is to determine all cash requirements in detail. This should result in a clear understanding of the financing surplus or financing gap. “Always pay attention to the facts of effectively available liquidity,” he advises.</p>
<p>In theory then, corporate treasuries can easily gain control over the organisation’s assets at any given time by embracing cash segmentation, Bartsch says. But first there is a need to have a detailed cash forecast that directs organisations to which cash segment their money is allocated, in order to survive tough economic times or crisis.</p>
<p>Cash forecasting is one of the most important and effective tools in cash segmentation, agrees Parvez. “It has also been a top priority for corporate treasuries, and recent events have only reinforced its strategic worth in carrying the company through this difficult time and the future.”</p>
<p>Although forecasts still tend to be less accurate than most treasurers would like them to be, they do (or should) provide a realistic view of future cash resources, and therefore provide an early opportunity for identifying potential surplus cash or funding gaps, as well as other essential information such as currency denomination, present location, total amount (value) available, planned future location (and currency), and time horizons (the length of time cash will be available for investment before it is needed by the business).</p>
<p>In addition, forecasts will help treasury to define how ‘important’ the cash is to the business’s daily operational activities and what the impact would be on the company if the cash to be invested was not readily available to meet day-to-day obligations.</p>
<p>From this point, it is up to the treasurer to define, introduce, optimise and, where necessary, expand the adoption of the appropriate instruments. This starts with cash concentration or cash pooling, continues with extending credit lines, even arranging syndicated loans, and ends with the placement of capital market bonds.</p>
<p>For surplus cash, investments need to be forecasted over two to three years. Accurate prediction reduces the risk a company may experience if the investment were to fail under the current economic times as a worst case but more likely counter sub-optimal investing, or the possibility of overestimated surplus cash having to be pulled from investments at short notice or inability to liquidate in time to meet business needs.</p>
<p>“In the current business environment, corporate goals and objectives have changed as many organisations focus on accomplishing short-term goals that lead to long-term ones,” says Bartsch. For instance, he notes short-term goals are easier to achieve now, compared to long-term ones, due to the emergence of the pandemic, especially given that forecasting in such tough times is extremely challenging.</p>
<p>What’s more, he observes that the use of funds has been reduced, due to current uncertainties, that “would create havoc in organisations if the economic situation does not change in the future”. He notes too that a rise in debt has been recorded as many businesses seek to benefit from bank loans, which they may be unable to service on time.</p>
<p>Indeed, the World Bank reports that the debt crunch has made it hard for decision-makers and managers in industries where the production of goods is the main activity. Most organisations, it says, are also focusing on increasing strategic and reserve cash due to the current uncertain financial condition. However, says Bartsch, the operating cash division must be monitored as any eventuality will need to be catered for using these funds.</p>
<p>For many, this is a cash balancing act that could have troubling consequences if the numbers are wrong. Distressed organisations are trying to find emergency liquidity, and cash-rich businesses are having to think ahead and engage with a wide range of ‘what-if’ scenarios as they reinforce their liquidity positions.</p>
<h4 id=""suitable-approaches"">Suitable approaches</h4>
<p>When it comes to the three segments, corporate treasuries should maintain a constant flow of funds to the operating and reserve cash divisions, advises Bartsch. This approach will help treasuries to create appropriate financial plans, given that operating in the current environment requires proper economic forecasting to eliminate the chances of insolvency. Thus, he adds, “this calls for corporate treasuries to communicate with other departments to ensure prioritisation of projects”.</p>
<p>Indeed, he says, one of the most effective cash segmentation approaches in the current business environment is the budget model. This strategy allows corporate treasurers and accountants to determine what an organisation requires at the present and forecast what might be necessary for the future.</p>
<p>The budget model covers all the elements of an organisation, making it more accurate in handling financial issues that arise in the day-to-day operations. Nevertheless, Bartsch adds, this model must be regularly compared to the forecasting model that identifies future risks (the forecasting model mainly used in financial planning and analysis incorporates all the aspects of the organisation in minimising risks and looking for opportunities).</p>
<p>If most companies operating cash segmentation every financial year obtain a scope of what should be done during that period, Bartsch believes that a combination of all three divisions can be effective in the current business environment, “because they cover the short-, medium- and long-term needs of an organisation at the same time”. The use of this approach can help corporate treasuries to allocate funds to different departments effectively, being based on an informed assessment of the short- and long-term needs of an organisation.</p>
<p>However, warns Bartsch, a segmentation review should be conducted after every quarter of the financial year to eliminate ‘interferences’, with corporate treasuries monitoring every task or operation to ensure that money is spent appropriately. Parvez agrees, saying that review is necessary “to ensure that any changes to market or economic conditions are assessed and acted upon on time”.</p>
<h4 id=""current-risk-response"">Current risk response</h4>
<p>Corporate treasurers have a further significant role to play in the current business environment because they must respond by allocating funds to risks rather than expanding portfolios, suggests Bartsch. “Risks affect the financial aspect of an organisation, hence cash segmentation should be focused on making short-term agile decisions with long-term effects.”</p>
<p>Good liquidity planning must therefore always be a top priority, adds Stahr. Due to events that have arisen in the last six months, he believes that consideration should be given to introducing additional reports, such as weekly or even daily cash reports, on top of the usual liquidity planning, in order to avoid sudden unpleasant surprises.</p>
<p>“Segmentation into immediately available cash and funds, which only take a few weeks or even months to become available, is essential,” he argues. “If critical time-windows are identified, they must be secured with suitable measures, for example by increasing credit lines or optimising cross-border cash pooling by adding further Group companies.”</p>
<p>For Parvez, short-and medium-term cash flows are key priorities now. “This is extremely important, so companies can continue to meet not only their day-to-day operational requirements but also their funding needs for at least a year,” he advises.</p>
<p>With markets still trying to contain the coronavirus and some seeing a spike and reintroducing lockdown measures, he believes we will continue to see a slowdown in economies globally. “In order to operate in these times, treasurers should take into account various factors such as purpose of the cash, time horizon and review their liquidity strategy to ensure they are equipped with sufficient cash to ride through the current situation.” Segmentation may indeed be a welcome case of divide and rule.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, it’s cash that makes the business world go round. Short-term is the big concern for many businesses in the current COVID-19-constrained trading environment. With revenue streams hit hard, the pandemic has impacted the cash and liquidity positions of many companies. But not all are impacted in the same way.</p>

<h2>December 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>Sustainability is fast becoming a key investment driver for liquidity investors. A fifth of respondents to our <strong>J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup></strong> survey said they are already taking account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their investment decision making. And this number is set to grow quickly, with the survey suggesting that within two years almost half will do so.</p>
<h4>A long commitment to sustainability</h4>
<p>What can liquidity managers do to ensure that they can live up to their clients’ expectations when it comes to sustainable investing? At J.P Morgan Asset Management, we have a long commitment to sustainability, having been a signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) initiative since 2007. Our asset management product lines are annually rated for their commitment to the PRI rules — of the 11 products under review, 9 are currently graded “A”.</p>
<p>We’ve made sure that our commitment to sustainable investing touches every part of our business, from senior management to our investment desks, and from risk management to technology. In our liquidity portfolios, for example, ESG analysis is a natural part of the research carried out by our credit analyst and quant teams. Also, our Sustainable Investment Leadership Team (or SILT for short) and our dedicated sustainable investing resources work together to drive a coordinated strategy for sustainable investing across all of our asset management businesses.</p>
<h4>Integrating ESG factors into liquidity portfolios</h4>
<p>Sustainability is fully integrated into our global liquidity investment process at all levels, from our philosophy through to the security selection process. Our philosophy, for example, contains the following statement:</p>
<p><em>“As fixed income investors, we expect the issuers in which we invest to conduct business in a sustainable manner and to demonstrate high standards. We take into consideration, where relevant and material, ESG issues alongside other market risk factors as part of our rigorous investment and risk management processes that help us to avoid event and headline risk, identify ESG-related industry trends and best practices and ultimately reduce reputational risk for our clients.”</em></p>
<p>Guided by this philosophy, ESG factors are a natural part of our security selection. We’re fortunate in this regard to have a large and experienced team of 20 investment grade corporate credit analysts<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>, who take account of ESG factors in their fundamental analysis of issuers — hard wiring sustainability into our liquidity portfolios.</p>
<h4>Building sustainable liquidity strategies</h4>
<p>The size of our credit analyst team means that each analyst is able to focus on one sector, or just a few sectors at most, covering roughly 40-50 corporate issuers (at the parent level). This means that we can conduct rigorous fundamental credit research, including analysis of ESG factors, and assign each issuer with an ESG score.</p>
<p>Our proprietary fundamental ratings are crucial for risk control, as they guide tenor and concentration limits in our funds, to varying degrees, depending on product style.  Our portfolio managers will also use both our fundamental credit ratings and ESG scores as they evaluate potential trades, and build and monitor our liquidity portfolios on an on-going basis. ESG scores are therefore an important factor in determining relative value.</p>
<p>ESG scores are also incorporated into the Global Liquidity team’s monthly governance meetings to highlight higher and lower ESG-rated issuers, as well as scoring our credit portfolios on a cap-weighted average basis.</p>
<h4>ESG in practice</h4>
<p>This all sounds impressive, but what does it mean in practice? The recent treatment of Scandinavian banks by our liquidity funds makes a good example, after several of the region’s lenders hit the headlines due to anti-money laundering issues.</p>
<p>Our own analysis had suggested that action should be taken on several of these names relating to governance concerns, leading to the suspension of one name and the curtailing of limits on others.</p>
<p>Overall, we look to engage positively to highlight ESG issues, either through analyst touchpoints, or via portfolio managers, who will use ESG factors to decide whether or not to purchase a security and pass their feedback to brokers and issuers.</p>
<h4>Proud to be sustainable</h4>
<p>I’m proud that J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity has built a professionally and culturally diverse team, employing women and men in portfolio management, distribution and analytics across Asia, Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Together, we’re working to ensure that the same commitment to sustainability is reflected in all our cash and Managed Reserves strategies.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>How would you describe investors’ appetite for return in the current environment?</h4>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Generally, investors have been somewhat affronted by the very low or negative rates of return seen in recent years. However, in the last 18 months, we have seen less acceptance of the status quo. As a result, many have been reviewing their policies and guidelines to see if they can push for a slightly enhanced return on slightly longer-dated cash, mindful of course, not to mistakenly start chasing yield at any cost.</p>
<p><strong>CH:</strong> With investors and asset managers under significant yield pressure, corporate treasurers, institutional investors and even traditional credit investors have contributed to the net inflows seen in enhanced cash products this year. These longer duration credit investors are surprised at just how much additional risk needs to be taken for minimal incremental returns, since the yield curve is so flat. In contrast, enhanced cash products still offer the necessary liquidity and security but with higher risk-adjusted returns.</p>
<h4>How are investors tackling the new environment?</h4>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> Today, investors are generally taking a more considered view – looking to blend their approach to see if they can improve their yield. Previously, traditional cash management desks concentrated all of their operational cash in short-term money market funds (MMFs) that offered daily liquidity. Now, they are closely scrutinising their cash and forecasting metrics. This gives them a far better understanding of their operational, reserve and strategic cash segments, and means they can begin matching the different cash segments with the most appropriate investment products.</p>
<p>MMFs are still a primary destination for their operational cash, but treasurers are now leveraging a pick-up on yield in the enhanced-space for cash pools that have slightly longer horizons of around three to six months.</p>
<p><strong>CH:</strong> Understandably, if an investor’s entire cash bucket fluctuates wildly, putting it in a same-day MMF makes sense. But if, through that deeper understanding, they know that a proportion of that cash bucket is more stable, and has a slightly longer horizon, they can choose to optimise it by putting it into a liquidity-plus style fund without sacrificing liquidity or security to achieve that yield.</p>
<h4>How should treasurers approach building a bespoke mandate for their cash?</h4>
<p><strong>CH:</strong> Bespoke mandates are ideal for clients that have both large buckets of cash and require a tailored approach, in terms of not only risk and return, but also in terms of investment restrictions. For example, portfolios can be put together using two buckets: one for liquidity purposes and one for return. Clients can also decide on an allocation to ABS or fixed bonds, with co-management of the portfolio from credit portfolio managers, combining the expertise of two skill sets to produce a sophisticated portfolio designed to meet bespoke objectives.</p>
<h4>What returns could an investor taking the cash-plus path anticipate?</h4>
<p><strong>CH:</strong> The universe of cash-plus funds is diverse, so it is important for investors to match the profile of the fund with their liquidity and credit constraints. For those with a conservative strategy, but able to invest for three to six months, an additional 15-25bps return can be achieved using AAA-rated cash plus funds. For investors prepared to take more risk, the ‘non-rated’ cash-plus universe, which stretch further down the capital structure and/or extend tenor, could potentially provide an additional 25-50bps.</p>
<p>Clients investing euros often ask if we can achieve a zero-rate of return; this is possible but requires taking significantly more credit and liquidity risk. For us, it is important for asset managers to educate clients about what’s achievable for the risk and volatility they are prepared to take.</p>
<p>With the large range and diversity of funds in this space, investor due diligence is essential, evaluating not only what the fund manager is investing in, but also how robust its credit analytics and credit risk management are.</p>
<h4>What can Aviva Investors offer that is unique?</h4>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> A number of our clients have their own investment guidelines and policies in place, and recently many have been reviewing and changing them. Based on these alterations, we can create dummy portfolios, what-if scenarios and other indicators, allowing us to table opportunities that their new guidelines present.</p>
<p>For treasurers who may not realise the opportunities in this space, we stress that Aviva Investors is an asset manager and not a bank, so this is our area of expertise. In fact, we have a 40-year history in running bespoke mandates across a wide range of products.</p>
<p>We value the credit process above all else, not least because we look after our own cash, safeguarding it in the same way as we do our investors’ money. Furthermore, we always call upon our expertise in this area to offer our clients appropriate solutions.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Corporate treasuries have a number of models to consider when it comes to centralising activities, streamlining processes and reducing costs. One of the more ambitious of these is the IHB – a structure that is used to provide subsidiaries with services that would otherwise be provided by external banks. Often this includes models such as payments on behalf of (POBO) and receivables on behalf of (ROBO), whereby the IHB makes and receives payments on behalf of subsidiaries.</p>
<p>While the concept of the IHB has been around for decades, Asia’s diverse regulatory landscape means that the region presents particular challenges for companies seeking to put this type of structure in place. But these challenges are not insurmountable – and many companies in Asia have taken advantage of this approach to gain major benefits.</p>
<p>With that in mind, what can companies achieve by adopting an IHB, what challenges may they need to overcome – and how can companies leverage technology and best practice to take an existing IHB to the next level?</p>
<h4 id=""what-is-an-ihb"">What is an IHB?</h4>
<p>“IHBs follow a clear strategy of treasury transformation and are often the foundation of further centralisation such as payments factories, central FX trading and funding,” explains François-Dominique Doll, Executive Director, Global Treasury Advisory Services at Deloitte Southeast Asia. He adds, “The ultimate goal of leveraging an IHB account is to keep external bank accounts to the bare minimum and only at the group level.”</p>
<p>Byron Gardiner, Executive Director of Treasury Solutions, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered, says that the term ‘IHB’ describes “a sophisticated treasury structure used to provide financial services such as cash management, risk management (FX, interest rate, and commodity hedging), core funding and working capital to business units or affiliates within an organisation.”</p>
<p>Gardiner explains that in the classical treasury model, treasury arranges banking facilities on behalf of affiliates. “Banks subsequently contract directly with the affiliates even though treasury may negotiate the facility agreements and manage activities such as loan draw downs and FX trades on behalf of the affiliates,” he notes. Under the in-house banking model, in contrast, “the IHB contracts directly with affiliates to provide them with loans, FX, cash management, and other services. In turn the IHB buys these services from external banks where necessary but tries to internalise as many transactions as possible.”</p>
<h4 id=""from-cost-savings-to-controls"">From cost savings to controls</h4>
<p>In this way, an IHB can deliver a variety of benefits, including operational efficiencies, better treasury controls and cost savings. Indeed, Gardiner says that IHBs “typically deliver multi-million dollar savings by consolidating various financial activities.” Other potential benefits include the ability to rationalise the company’s bank account structure and reduce external borrowing, as well as the opportunity to standardise and automate processes.</p>
<p>As Gardiner notes, companies may also be able to achieve significantly lower FX costs “by internalising FX trades and other hedging activities which permits the netting of these exposures.” He adds, “The IHB subsequently only covers its net position with the market rather than the gross FX needs of the underlying business units.”</p>
<p>Latifah Yusof, Group Treasurer at Malaysian satellite television provider Astro, explains that setting up an IHB in February 2019 has enabled the treasury to consolidate and streamline its banking and cash management operations, greatly reducing the company’s reliance on multiple external banks. The new structure provides business units with services including POBO, ROBO and foreign exchange deals. External banking services to effect the POBO and ROBO are provided by the mandated IHB partner, Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia, with the support of SAP’s In-House Cash module.</p>
<p>As a result, Astro group companies participating in the IHB have seen a reduction in banking fees, finance charges and account maintenance fees. Other benefits include process standardisation and better visibility over the group’s cash position. While Yusof notes that “change is not easy,” she says that support from Astro’s senior management, financial reporting, tax, corporate assurance and IT teams – as well as from external auditors – has made the implementation a success.</p>
<h4 id=""no-time-like-the-present"">No time like the present</h4>
<p>The concept of the IHB has been around for some time. As Doll explains, “in-house banking is not a new concept and has been well-established in some corporations for more than 20 years now.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several reasons why this type of model may have particular value in today’s market conditions. Gardiner cites the drive for efficiency, noting that “the philosophy of doing more with less and generating higher degrees of operational and strategic value from the treasury department is a common theme amongst clients we are speaking to today.” He also says that the increasing globalisation of Asian MNCs means there is more need for treasury to transform itself to “more effectively manage the geographically diverse and complex business needs of a global organisation.”</p>
<p>In addition, Gardiner notes that improvements in systems connectivity are enabling greater levels of integration between treasury and other finance units, alongside “the availability of advanced treasury management systems (TMS) incorporating ‘IHB ready’ functionality that can be deployed relatively quickly in support of the sophisticated needs of these structures.”</p>
<p>Gardiner explains that these improvements in technology and connectivity enable companies to build a more compelling business case for an IHB model – not least because the initial investment and the integration and implementation of the necessary technology “have become less arduous and available at a quantifiably lower all-in cost.”</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Is an IHB right for your organisation?</h2>
<p>Bank of America’s Abraham recommends that companies consider the following six points when considering whether to implement an IHB:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Who?</strong> Is an IHB right for you or your company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What?</strong> Key considerations include the company’s current legal entity structure, regulations that may affect the decision and the company’s capacity to take on a multi-year transformation project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Which?</strong> Which entities/functions are in scope? Abraham notes that companies tend to include wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries – and that it is rare to include joint venture or non-majority-owned entities in the structure due to the associated complexities. In terms of which functions are in the scope of the structure, Abraham says that IHB typically include areas such as FX, liquidity management and funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where?</strong> Where is the most suitable location for the IHB? Considerations include legal and tax, the sophistication and depth of financial markets and the availability of incentives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> What are the expected benefits? These are likely to include cost savings, enhanced visibility, increased control and the ability to negotiate more effectively with banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How?</strong> How will you go about implementing the structure? Abraham emphasises the importance of gaining full support from C-Level executives including the CFO, CEO and potentially the board. He notes that an IHB project may involve significant change up to and including review and restructuring of the company structure, which also requires input from legal and tax.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""caveats-and-challenges"">Caveats and challenges</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s important to note that an IHB isn’t the right structure for every company.</p>
<p>Anton Abraham, Head of International Advisory at Bank of America, says that the typical profile of companies looking to implement IHBs include large corporations with multiple business units and operating across multiple countries and regions. “They are also comfortable with high volumes of intercompany transactions – and are likely to be seeking much more standardisation and integration in terms of what they do with the treasury function,” he adds.</p>
<p>In addition, companies in Asia will have to navigate certain region-specific challenges when setting up an IHB. Doll points out that in contrast to the Eurozone, currency exchange is a consideration in Asia – which “may result in the combination of multiple pool levels across different countries. The balances of these pools can then be converted onshore or offshore in the pool header currency, which is usually in one of the G5 currencies.”</p>
<p>“In Asia, the primary area of concern lies in restrictions over FX and intercompany loans, which effectively limit the use of traditional POBO/ROBO structures,” adds Gardiner. “In many parts of the region, the use of local currencies for cross-border transactions is restricted to specific situations such as import/export trade settlement, capital injections and dividend payments.”</p>
<p>Gardiner also cites regulations on cross-border intercompany loans in many of these jurisdictions, noting however that there is often more flexibility with foreign currency denominated loans. “Furthermore, the types of transactions that can be processed through non-resident accounts by the IHB are often restricted,” Gardiner says. “The combination of these factors means IHBs are unable to use an account held in their own name to process POBO/ROBO transactions.”</p>
<p>In addition, Gardiner says there are a number of practical issues that can affect the operation and success of IHBs in Asia, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Management fees</strong> – some countries may place limits on the fees that can be paid to an IHB for services rendered, meaning independent legal and tax advice is important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data restrictions</strong> – some markets have strict regulations which may require the IHB to replicate systems, hold data local or exclude the country from the IHB structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited clearing information</strong> – some clearing systems cannot carry information about the underlying paying party, which “creates potential issues in recognising receipt of payment or raising issues of ‘payment masking’, leading to a block on these types of payments.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Central bank reporting</strong> – some central banks require additional information about the purpose of payment transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Special payments</strong> – some payments, such as payroll, taxes, customs and duties, may require access to special clearing systems or offline lodgement processes, meaning process customisation may be needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""setting-up-an-ihb"">Setting up an IHB</h4>
<p>When it comes to setting up an IHB, Doll emphasises the importance of a strong banking partner that can support the set-up with appropriate liquidity management products, such as cash pool sweeping, notional pooling or virtual accounts.</p>
<p>“A policy review is also necessary to define what will be the service cost undertaken by the treasury centre to provide IHB services,” says Doll. “This can be done by defining more competitive rates than banks or charging a flat fee.”</p>
<p>In addition, Doll says that changes in cash accounting may be required to reflect the intercompany flows in the general ledger. “The value of technological solutions such as TMS is reinforced as they have inherent capabilities to provide automation and reporting on IHB balances,” he adds. “On the other hand, banks are closing the technology gap, by providing reports and data which are also available in a TMS.”</p>
<h4 id=""taking-it-to-the-next-level"">Taking it to the next level</h4>
<p>While companies have been using IHBs for a number of years, that’s not to say the model cannot be enhanced – and for companies with existing structures in place, it may be worth considering how best practice can be harnessed to take in-house banking to the next level.</p>
<p>Deloitte’s Doll notes that a leading practice is to “keep treasury operations lean and simple: minimal external flows, minimal bank accounts.” He adds that while the first stage of an IHB is to replicate the pooling structure, “companies can use the core setup to handle intercompany payables and receivables with multi-lateral netting, settle treasury transactions such as FX internally, and aim to process all external payments on behalf of subsidiaries through treasury or payment factory accounts.” However, Doll points out that the latter can still be challenging in a number of Asian countries linked to non-resident accounts.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered’s Gardiner notes that IHBs can deploy different variations of the POBO/ROBO model in order to overcome the challenges of operating in Asia and cater for the different regulatory landscapes in markets across the region:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the least restricted markets, this may mean adopting a global POBO/ROBO model, with the IHB processing payments and collections through its own accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In restricted markets, companies may need to use an account in the name of a local entity for local currency payments, while using the IHB to process foreign currency payments and collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the most restricted markets, Gardiner says: “the IHB may simply operate as a processing agent, utilising the accounts held by each legal entity to process payments and collections on an In-The-Name-Of basis.” Nevertheless, the benefits of standardised processing, automation and greater control can still be considerable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""setting-up-a-funding-desk"">Setting up a funding desk</h4>
<p>Beyond these models, Bank of America’s Abraham says that some companies which already have an IHB are increasingly turning their attention to the possibility of adopting a funding desk model. By establishing a single platform for all group funding activities, both internal and external, companies can reduce the total cost of group funding. As Abraham explains, this involves aggregating all group cash flows and excess balances in order to maximise funding efficiency and minimise third-party funding.</p>
<p>“I don’t see companies setting up funding desks unless they have pretty sophisticated technology in place,” comments Abraham. “You need to have full visibility into your funding requirements and all of your credit lines. The objective is to ensure that management has a complete understanding of all the group funding activities and all the costs associated with that funding.”</p>
<p>Abraham explains that implementing a funding desk may also involve hiring suitable talent – and that may mean that companies need to recruit from banks or hedge funds in order to find people with the right skills and experience. That said, the level of complexity associated with this model may vary from company to company. Abraham points out that companies which are simply trading or managing liquidity and FX flows will find it simpler to set up a funding desk than companies that may want to use more sophisticated financial instruments.</p>
<p>Last but not least, companies with IHBs may consider improving the efficiency of their structures by harnessing technology such as AI and robotic process automation. “I would expect that most treasuries that are looking at funding desk arrangements will also be looking at these sorts of automation opportunities,” Abraham concludes.</p>


","The in-house bank (IHB) is a powerful model, enabling companies to achieve major cost savings and efficiency gains.

<p>Expedia Group is one of the world’s largest diversified travel companies, home to some of the leading travel brands in the world. Operating more than 200 travel booking sites in over 70 countries, the company currently employs more than 24,000 people across the globe. As the business continued to grow, the challenges of gaining better visibility on its cash and investment practices and performance had to be overcome – and they were. But how?</p>
<h4 id=""going-back-to-basics"">Going back to basics</h4>
<p>Back in 2017, yields on roughly half of Expedia Group’s 600+ bank accounts, term deposits and money market funds (MMFs) were not effectively measured by Expedia Group’s treasury. “We were motivated by the idea that we needed to be smarter and faster in our liquidity and investment management practices,” says Ken Bugayong, CFA, CTP, Treasury Manager at Expedia Group. “In terms of data accuracy, details on rates on bank accounts were incomplete. We weren’t capturing the full scope of our portfolio due to spreadsheet limitations.”</p>
<p>Whilst the Group had a treasury workstation, it lacked the bespoke functionality required to perform the rigorous analytics and integration with internal systems. “Some tasks were repetitive and data was spread across multiple sources,” said Bugayong. “It was time-consuming to gather and standardise the information, and having to stitch Excel-based reports together across multiple files contributed to the challenge.”</p>
<p>In addition, Bugayong points out that the tremendous amount of data to process and analyse, coupled with the ever-changing banking and investment landscape, meant it was not going to be an easy task to revolutionise the Group’s existing system. “Looking at our global banking and investment infrastructure, we knew it would be a massive undertaking,” he says. “Add to this, because of the separate systems used for FX hedging, coming up with holistic investment results net of foreign currency hedging costs/benefits posed additional hurdles.”</p>
<h4 id=""preparing-for-take-off"">Preparing for take off</h4>
<p>However, it was a challenge that Bugayong and the team were more than up for taking, and in just over a year they managed to roll out a new and state-of-the-art data warehouse and business intelligence solution.</p>
<p>At the heart of the solution is Microsoft’s Power BI, with market intelligence data sourced from Bloomberg, while Kyriba and Oracle serve as the treasury workstation and accounting ERP systems respectively.</p>
<p>“The solution we’ve created provides enhanced analytics and reporting, along with a performance attribution model that explains the key drivers of investment results, allowing our company to uncover new investment opportunities and diagnose areas of underperformance,” he said.</p>
<p>Bugayong continues: “The solution has paved the way to over a million dollars in productivity benefits and value-adding investment strategies. It provided the team better visibility to cash and investment performance, uncovering approximately US$14M in benchmark outperformance over 2017-2018.”</p>
<p>What makes Expedia Group’s achievement all the more remarkable is that it managed to deploy and implement an entire data warehouse. Existing spreadsheets were converted into structured relational databases, whilst FX trades and hedging data were modelled intensively and incorporated into the benchmarking process.</p>
<p>This underlying schema covers the complex relationships across various data sets, encompassing accounting entries, workstation trades and key indices/benchmarks. This allowed Expedia Group to introduce a new framework for comparing interest income data and accounting journal entries on investments.</p>
<p>“Our team also introduced periodic investment meetings to systematically evaluate performance, both on a hedged and unhedged basis, and assess how the portfolio was performing against a benchmark,” says Bugayong. “This process offered the opportunity to arrive at better informed decisions on currency and investment allocations, allowing the team to continuously improve our cash and investment practices.”</p>
<h4 id=""key-benefits"">Key benefits</h4>
<p>A worthy winner in the 2019 Adam Smith Awards in the Judges’ Choice category, Expedia Group’s solution has improved decision-making through benchmarking and seen increases in income, whilst the more integrated financial systems has led to enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>“The project has uncovered new insights, elevated the speed and quality of decision making, and enhanced intelligence in investment and liquidity management,” concludes Bugayong.</p>
<p>Expedia Group Inc. is the one of the world’s largest diversified travel companies with an unmatched portfolio of leading travel brands, including, but not limited to, Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Egencia, Vrbo, trivago, Orbitz, Wotif, Travelocity and Hotwire.</p>

<p>At a time when falling rates have reanimated the cash management challenges across the globe, treasurers are looking more than ever to search for yield that does not come at the expense of liquidity and security. Enter the 2019 <strong>J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup></strong> survey, which sheds light on the most prevalent portfolio strategies, liquidity concerns and cash solutions that treasurers use today.</p>
<img alt=""Flag at the top of a mountain icon"" height=""48"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/2019-11__icon__top-global-finding.png?la=en&amp;hash=CCEFDD5AA62D3C48B14D18E9AEF2623A"" style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""64"">
<p>One top global finding: The most popular investment permitted in policies worldwide is stable net asset value (NAV) money market funds (MMFs) (92%). Bank obligations and U.S. Treasuries were next (permitted by 78% and 62% of respondents’ investment policies).</p>
<p style=""padding-left:6em;"">What short-term instruments do treasurers across the globe expect to add? Stable and floating MMFs were the top answer, followed, to a lesser extent, by ultra-short/short-term bond funds. What instruments do they expect to remove? The top overall answer was non-rated MMFs (5%).</p>

<p>Rising political risk is the challenge worrying cash investors most (67% globally), including the U.S-China trade war and Brexit. Respondents’ number two investment challenges vary across region – yield curve inversion in Americas (52%), negative yields/returns in Europe (39%), and regulatory changes in Asia Pacific (55%).</p>

<p>Cash investors in APAC are reviewing their investment policies more often than their peers elsewhere: Two-thirds of APAC respondents review at least annually (that’s true for 39% in the Americas and 48% in Europe).</p>

<h2>October 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>Over the past two decades, China has witnessed a substantial period of economic growth helped by robust exports and rapidly developing domestic markets. Underpinning this economic growth has been a massive increase in the size and scope of its fixed income markets: a combination of interest rate and financial market liberalization triggered a surge in the range of credit issuers, instruments and structures available.</p>
<p>China now has the world’s second largest bond market (Exhibit 1), making it difficult for investors to ignore, both as a source of yield and diversification as well as its influence on global liquidity and interest rates.</p>
<h4 id=""exhibit-1"">Exhibit 1: China’s bond market has grown significantly over the past two decades</h4>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Asian Bonds online; CCDC and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. As at 30<sup>th</sup> June 2019</em></p>
<p>However, with increased opportunities comes increased risk. The elimination of the implicit government guarantee on all commercial bank debt, combined with weak corporate fundamentals and the limitations of domestic rating agency methodologies, is creating significant credit analysis challenges.</p>
<p>Understanding China’s bond market structure is a critical first step toward addressing these issues. While there are many similarities between the Chinese onshore credit market and more developed offshore markets, there are also several significant differences - mainly due to local regulations, distinctive issuer and investor characteristics and unique local market practices.</p>
<p>Below we highlight six key areas for investors to consider when investing in the local Chinese credit market:</p>
<img alt=""Investment Platforms icon"" height=""71"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/2019-10__icon__investment-platforms.png?la=en&amp;hash=9C499D2C21225B4D3A57DED01D73039C"" style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""70""/>
<h5>Investment Platforms:</h5>
<p>Bonds and other fixed income instruments are traded on three different platforms: the interbank market, the exchange market and the commercial bank over-the-counter (OTC) market. The interbank market is the dominant bond platform, while the exchange market mainly focuses on retail and other non-interbank market investors. The OTC market is used exclusively by small retail investors.</p>

<img alt=""Instruments icon"" height=""65"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/2019-10__icon__instruments.png?la=en&amp;hash=FE9414486F3D22151F514DC96401DB7F"" style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 1em 0;"" width=""69""/>
<h5>Instruments:</h5>
<p>There is a broad range of credit instruments available, which vary by platform and regulatory approval. These include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit, medium-term notes and various types of bonds.</p>

<img alt=""Issuers icon"" height=""74"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/2019-10__icon__issuers.png?la=en&amp;hash=D053CA472A9A8342EF1066D2C9324827"" style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 1.8em 2em 0;"" width=""73""/>
<h5>Issuers:</h5>
<p>Local government bonds represent the largest sector of China’s credit markets and have been a major contributor to the growth of the onshore corporate bond market since 2015. Commercial bank issuers represent the second largest sector of China’s credit markets. Other credit bond issuers include state owned enterprises and private companies operating mainly in the construction, industrial, utility and energy sectors.</p>

<img alt=""Investors icon"" height=""66"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/2019-10__icon__investors.png?la=en&amp;hash=082E926FBE9DE3D29D676D663BF0F800"" style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""68""/>
<h5>Investors:</h5>
<p>Domestic investors dominate the onshore bond markets. Collectively, commercial banks, insurance companies, policy banks and securities brokers own a significant portion of corporate bonds, although these investors typically prefer interest rate bonds as a safe investment due to their low risk tolerance. China’s bond markets are now open to foreign investors, but participation remains low.</p>

<img alt=""Characteristics and Pricing icon"" height=""82"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/2019-10__icon__characteristics-and-pricing.png?la=en&amp;hash=8CF254677FBD13E1025FF2B35705C09B"" style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 1.2em 2em 0;"" width=""83""/>
<h5>Characteristics and Pricing:</h5>
<p>Chinese credit bond yields are more volatile than those of similar securities in developed markets. Multiple macroeconomic and technical factors, including central bank monetary policy, government fiscal policy, frequent regulatory changes and interbank liquidity conditions, all contribute to this volatility. Historically, credit ratings had a very low correlation with credit bond yields and spreads, especially for bonds rated between AAA and AA. Not until ratings fall to AA- or lower do credit spreads widen significantly, suggesting insufficient compensation for onshore corporate bond investors compared with credit spreads in offshore markets.</p>

<img alt=""Domestic Ratings icon"" height=""83"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/2019-10__icon__domestic-rating.png?la=en&amp;hash=4A4C7EF20A73F6A6E04DB25995A01A53"" style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 1.2em 2em 0;"" width=""83""/>
<h5>Domestic Ratings:</h5>
<p>Several local rating agencies dominate the onshore rating market while the authorities regulate rating nomenclature and bond rating requirements. The combination of rating arbitrage and local agencies developing their own standards, which emphasizes implicit government support, has resulted in most issuers obtaining AAA ratings. This limits the ability of international investors to map domestic ratings to international rating scales.</p>

<p>Gaining a familiarity with local market structures is just the beginning. Equally important is the adoption of rigorous, independent analysis by issuers and counterparties to understand the true underlying risk characteristics of onshore credit investment. Moreover, a robust investment policy, independent credit research and an objective analysis of the potential level of government support are critical steps toward minimizing downside risks while taking advantage of increasing market opportunities.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2>September 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>Around the world, we continue to see growth slowing, trade tensions rising and interest rates falling. The US Federal Reserve has already responded by cutting interest rates in July and financial markets are expecting further easing. The European Central Bank (ECB) is preparing to follow in the Fed’s footsteps and start a programme of monetary easing. Markets have already priced in a 10-basis point (bp) cut to the deposit level in September, which today stands at -40 bps, while forward projections go as low as -70 bps by July 2020.</p>
<p>The September meeting will be Mario Draghi’s last as ECB president before he passes the baton to Christine Lagarde. Some economists expect more details to be shared at the September meeting with regard to kicking off another round of quantitative easing. Lagarde has already acknowledged the downside risks to the Eurozone economy, noting it is “therefore clear that monetary policy needs to remain highly accommodative for the foreseeable future”.</p>
<h4>Record-low yields</h4>
<p>Unsurprisingly, negative interest rates are pushing yields below zero. European government curves have actually fallen to all-time lows; the yield on the German two-year bond has fallen 30 bps this year to -93 bps, and even the 30-year bond is negative at -18 bps (as at 30 August 2019). The rally in bonds has extended into credit, with Nestle issuing the first 10-year euro corporate bond at -1 bp in August. Even BBB-rated five-year bonds are now offering a small negative yield (see chart). And this phenomenon has gone global, as nearly USD 17 trillion worth of global bonds, including a handful of high yield and emerging market debt issues, are trading with negative yields (see chart) as investors flee risk assets.</p>

<h4>What can investors do?</h4>
<p>Long-term inflation and growth outlooks remain weak, particularly for Europe, meaning the period of deeply negative yields could be here for some time. Investors are re-calibrating expectations as to what risk-adjusted returns are achievable in light of the declining yield backdrop. The risks ahead include the end of the credit cycle, increased spread volatility and potential squeezes on liquidity.</p>
<p>Low-risk investors are actively segmenting their assets between those required near-term, which must then tolerate yields of -50bps or lower in liquidity funds, and those assets which can be invested more strategically in ultra-short duration strategies to achieve higher returns.</p>
<p>In a world of negative rates, many investors long for the days of zero yields. On the positive side, bond prices continues to rise and investors can still achieve positive returns through conservative credit exposure and currency hedging.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Asia-Pacific currencies have weakened significantly over the past few months, culminating in the Chinese renminbi breaching the psychologically important seven per US dollar level on 7 August. The Australian dollar has also hit a decade low against the US dollar at 0.6756, the Hong Kong dollar moved to the weaker end of its trading band against the US dollar at 7.8464, and even the safe haven Singapore dollar hit a nine-month low against the US dollar at 1.3847.</p>
<p>While these movements have been partially caused by the strength of the US currency, they still have implications for regional cash investors. With this in mind, we take a look at the major currencies, the reasons for their recent weakness and the outlook for cash rates in the current uncertain environment.</p>
<h4>Why this time may be different for the renminbi?</h4>
<p>The escalation of trade tensions with the US triggered a classic market response from China, which weakened its currency. The renminbi experienced one of its largest single-day movements in several years on 7 August. Both the CFETS index and the CNH (renminbi funded in the onshore market) weakened, with the latter hitting a record high of 7.1403 to the US dollar, before rebounding slightly.</p>
<p>Ongoing trade tensions, combined with domestic economic weakness and broad US dollar strength suggest the currency could weaken further, with most economists now predicting a range of 7.10 to 7.20 by year-end. The declaration of China as a “currency manipulator” by the US administration should not have significant implications, but will likely raise anxiety further among investors—particularly as further currency weakness could raise concerns about capital flight. In 2015, the authorities spent over USD 1 trillion (a quarter of reserves) defending the renminbi.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) likely to emphasize stability and support the currency around current levels, the current weakening of the renminbi should be steady and managed, as opposed to the abrupt and unexpected devaluation in August 2015. Given the more managed nature of the current depreciation and the broader range of tools available to the PBoC, the probability of large capital outflows is therefore lower this time round.</p>
<p>It should also be remembered that the renminbi depreciated in 2018 in response to the first round of US trade tariffs, without causing capital outflows. Domestic economic weakness combined with an escalating trade war suggests the PBoC will likely implement further monetary policy easing – potentially cutting open market operations, or reducing short-term or medium-term lending rates.</p>


<em><strong>Things to watch:</strong> Foreign exchange reserves, PBoC open market operations</em>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>Will the Hong Kong dollar require intervention?</h4>
<p>The recent escalation of local political protests, combined with the weakness of the renminbi, have triggered a sharp weakening of the Hong Kong dollar whilst Hibor rates have also jumped higher. With US Libor yields falling, Hibor-Libor spreads have widened back to their quarter-end highs.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong dollar peg looks safe given Hong Kong’s USD 446 billion of reserves backing up the territory’s USD 208 billion monetary base. Nevertheless, markets expect a further depreciation and more outflows from the currency, which will keep liquidity tight and Hibor rates high. If the Hong Kong dollar hits the lower boundary of its convertibility range, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will have to intervene, draining local liquidity and pushing Hibor rates even higher.</p>


<em><strong>Things to watch:</strong> Consumer confidence, the HKD deposit base, HKMA interventions</em>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>What is causing the decade low for the Australian dollar?</h4>
<p>Weak housing, muted inflation and low wage growth have convinced the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut rates twice in the last two months to a record low of 1%. While the RBA left rates unchanged in August, markets continue to price in one additional rate cut in 2019.</p>
<p>In anticipation of rate cuts, Bank Bill Swap Rate yields have fallen dramatically and the yield curve has inverted. The US-Australia central bank interest rate differential has hit a record high of 150bps – triggering the sharp sell-off in the Australian dollar, which has pushed the currency to a decade low.</p>
<p>The RBA remains dovish and has explicitly mentioned its focus on employment and inflation as key indicators for future rate cuts. The latest unemployment rate was unchanged while inflation edged higher, but remains below the RBA’s target level. Exports, an economic bright spot, remain robust due to strong demand and high commodity prices. However, any weakness in exports demand could lead to further currency weakness.</p>


<em><strong>Things to watch:</strong> Employment, inflation, the housing market</em>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>Will the Singapore government or turn dovish?</h4>
<p>Escalating global trade tensions have significantly impacted Singapore’s export dependent economy, with GDP growth falling to its lowest level in a decade. Against a backdrop of muted inflation, weak consumer sentiment and low tourist spending, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) moved from a hawkish to a more neutral policy stance at their last policy meeting in April, leaving the slope (~1%), width and centre point of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) unchanged.</p>
<p>Despite the economic weakness, the S$NEER has held up remarkably well, remaining close to the top of the trading band for the past several months. However, in recent weeks, both the Singapore dollar and S$NEER have weakened.</p>
<p>Given the continued economic weakness and heightened trade tensions, many economists expect the MAS to assume a more dovish policy stance at its October monetary policy meeting, potentially reducing the S$NEER slope by 1% to 0%. This would trigger further currency and S$NEER weakness. Historically, when the S$NEER trades below its mid-point, swap offer rate (SOR) yields increase.</p>


<em><strong>Things to watch:</strong> Exports and inflation</em>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>What are the implications for investors?</h4>
<p>Asian economies are facing multiple headwinds, from escalating trade tensions, slower economic growth, to muted inflation and weak domestic demand. Following the US Federal Reserve’s lead, regional central banks have turned more dovish. Most economists now expect additional interest rate cuts in the coming months. This is a significant pivot from earlier in 2019 when economists expected further, gradual rate hikes and steeper yield curves.</p>
<p>The impact of lower yields and flatter yield curves has reignited the challenges of identifying good investments and locking in reasonable yields. Critical to this is having a robust investment policy that well defines objectives and acceptable levels of risk and return.</p>
<p>In a falling rate environment, time deposits rate decline in line with central banks’ rate cuts. Active management plays a critical role in offering extra cushion of yield. </p>
<p>For investors that can segment their cash balances by liquidity needs, maintaining high liquidity for operating cash, whilst extending the duration, reducing the liquidity and broadening the range of acceptable credit ratings on reserve and strategic cash balances (where cash is not needed for several months) can help boost the overall returns achieved – especially during the current period of foreign exchange and interest rate volatility.</p>

<h2>July 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>As summer begins, fixed income and treasury investors are feeling the heat from macro uncertainty, low interest rates and the ageing credit cycle.</p>
<p>The new UK Brexit deadline of 31 October has extended the period of economic uncertainty, with daily headlines on the Conservative Party leadership election fanning the flames of volatility near-term. Some market participants are factoring in increased probabilities of a general election, a ”no-deal” Brexit and a Corbyn government.</p>
<p>US-China trade negotiations are also contributing to economic worries, as tariffs could affect not only the US and China, but other major trading partners, such as the European Union.  A prolonged trade dispute also increases the chance of the US slipping into recession.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, central banks are remaining dovish and the market is pricing in multiple cuts globally. The Bank of England has reduced growth forecasts and raised the alarm about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. The UK bond market is currently staying neutral, pricing in no rate changes.</p>
<p>Finally, the ageing credit cycle brings expectations of widening credit spreads and an increase in downgrades. Our economists predict around 9% of the BBB global corporate bond universe could be downgraded to sub-investment grade in the event of a “normal” US recession. The disparity of spread movements across this BBB rated universe is high, increasing risk.</p>
<h4>Hit the ultra-short sweet spot</h4>
<p>Investors can employ a few strategies to beat the macro heat and boost returns from their liquid investments. <br/>In the current uncertain and volatile macro environment, where it is difficult to see where rates are heading, we believe investors can still generate 20-40 basis points of return over money market funds while remaining in a low-risk solution. In fact, adding low-risk exposure to complement higher risk strategies may be prudent diversification in this late stage of the credit cycle.</p>
<p>We seek to hit the ultra-short sweet spot by using a conservative credit approach that is active, liquid and diversified. Our Sterling Managed Reserves strategy leverages our Global Liquidity Money Market Funds’ approved-for-purchase list and risk framework, employing an active approach in general positioning and, importantly, in credit allocations. This means we are not forced to hold BBB rated securities if they are part of a benchmark.</p>
<p>We also focus on liquidity, with an average 60/40 ratio of money market securities to short-term bonds. This structure offers natural liquidity as securities roll off but also reduces price sensitivity because of the large allocation to commercial paper and other sub 12-month securities.  We like these securities on the basis of their relative value and low duration.</p>
<p>Diversification through a blend of fixed income securities, ranging from money market securities to corporate bonds to mortgage-backed securities, is particularly important in a more volatile environment. These sectors behave differently during times of stress in the market, enabling access to various types of returns.</p>
<h4>Sterling Managed Reserves: Enhance Income, reduce risk</h4>
<p>With a strong track record throughout the interest rate cycle, our actively managed, sterling-denominated ultra-short strategy aims to generate incremental returns over money market funds, providing a potentially attractive solution for cash investors looking to maximise returns from their strategic allocations.</p>

<h2>June 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>The definition of cash, while ostensibly straightforward – banknotes and coins – becomes increasingly challenging when the demands for higher returns counteracts the obligation to ensure adequate liquidity and the commitment to avoid losses.</p>
<p>As memories of the liquidity stress and market dislocation triggered by the global financial crisis faded, the range of financial instruments deemed acceptable in Australian cash products broadened dramatically. This was also a time when investors grappled with the challenges of outperforming attractive headline retail bank deposit rates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, defining which instruments are truly cash equivalents is one of the most difficult tasks for modern corporate treasurers.</p>
<h4>The Regulatory Dilemma</h4>
<p>Globally, cash investors look to regulators and rating agencies to define and clarify suitable cash investment instruments and structures. This is especially true in the United States, European Union and China, where the size and systemic importance of liquidity and money market funds (MMFs) made this a critical regulatory issue following the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>These rules and regulations vary from prescriptive, listing specific approved and unapproved instruments, to abstract, outlining key sources of investment risk and limits to mitigate them. Regardless of the regulator’s philosophy, the ultimate goals remain the same – to ensure adequate liquidity and minimise the probability of losses. Over the past decade, global regulators have strengthened MMF guidelines. They now demand higher levels of liquidity, impose tighter investment limits and require increased diversification. For both retail and institutional investors, these new rules have raised the standard of MMF investing while significantly reduced the likelihood of funds suffering losses, albeit at the expense of lower potential returns.</p>
<p>In contrast to detailed global standards, Australian regulators have historically demurred the responsibility to define cash or the suitability of various instruments for cash investments. The Federal government’s unlimited bank guarantee during the Global Financial Crisis helped shelter the local financial industry while a long history of self-regulation encouraged investors to create their own definitions of cash and cash equivalents.</p>
<p>However, in 2018, a review of cash investment products by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) raised significant concerns about the level of volatility and risk in these products. Across the industry, the range of instruments and structures defined as cash varied enormously – as did returns. This created confusion for retail and institutional investors. In its subsequent report, APRA highlighted “examples in the industry where cash investment options appear to include exposure to underlying investments that would not generally be considered cash or cash-like in nature”<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To encourage investment consistency and reduce the volatility of cash investment products, APRA concluded that “cash equivalents represent short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value”<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Cash means security, liquidity and return</h4>
<p>The report signalled a tougher regulatory stance and additional focus on questionable cash investments styles. However, in the absence of detailed regulatory guidelines and exact definition of liquidity and risk, investor due diligence is still required to balance the need to preserving capital, while ensuring suitable levels of liquidity and maximising returns.</p>
<p>Three key steps in this process involve clarifying investment policies, creating well defined investment objectives and implementing cash segmentation.</p>
<p>Firstly, using an investment policy statement forms a solid foundation for cash investment decisions. A well written policy provides clarity, instils discipline and allows the organisation to successfully navigate shifting markets, changing regulations and evolving business needs.</p>
<h4 id=""step-1"">Step 1: Defining and mitigating investment risks</h4>
<p>Short term investments have three key risks...</p>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2019-06__step-01__defining-and-mitigating-investment-risks__1802x692.png?la=en&amp;hash=5CA2C9498C1524351275F25D272C96E9"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Step 1: Defining and mitigating investment risks"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2019-06__step-01__defining-and-mitigating-investment-risks__1802x692.png?la=en&amp;hash=5CA2C9498C1524351275F25D272C96E9"" width=""967""/></a></p>
<p><em>Source: Bloomberg. J.P. Morgan Asset Management; As at 8th May 2019</em></p>
<p>Secondly, by defining short term investment objectives and the strategies for achieving them, an organisation can establish acceptable levels of risk, identify permissible investments and detail relevant constraints.</p>
<h4 id=""step-2"">Step 2: Understand short term cash investment options</h4>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2019-06__step-02__defining-and-mitigating-investment-risks__896x358.png?la=en&amp;hash=8FA26679BBCFB14DCDF11BC842DF9D90"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Step 2: Understand short term cash investment options"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2019-06__step-02__defining-and-mitigating-investment-risks__896x358.png?la=en&amp;hash=8FA26679BBCFB14DCDF11BC842DF9D90"" width=""967""/></a></p>
<p><em>Source: J.P. Morgan Asset Management. For Illustrative purposes only.</em></p>
<p>Finally, by putting cash into different segments, the organisation can optimise its investment choices – ensuring it has sufficient liquid cash to meet its daily needs while avoiding the opportunity costs associated with very high levels of liquidity and principal protection by diversifying across different types of cash investment depending on their level of liquidity, volatility and diversification.</p>
<h4 id=""step-3"">Step 3: Put cash in its place</h4>
<p>Identify the right investment strategy for each cash segment and utilize longer-term investments where appropriate for enhanced return potential.</p>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2019-06__step-03__put-cash-in-its-place__1791x665.png?la=en&amp;hash=8C11DAB211F3333F995A918D123AB426"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Step 3: Put cash in its place"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2019-06__step-03__put-cash-in-its-place__1791x665.png?la=en&amp;hash=8C11DAB211F3333F995A918D123AB426"" width=""967""/></a></p>
<p><em>Source: J.P. Morgan Asset Management. For Illustrative purposes only.</em></p>
<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
<p>The new APRA definition of cash has already prompted a significant reorganisation across the Australian cash management industry with several instrument structures being avoided and more conservative investment guidelines introduced. This, combined with more due diligence and understanding of the underlying risks by retail and institutional investors, should help the industry create a safer foundation for future growth.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2>May 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>The market mood has changed dramatically over the last six months. The risk-off sentiment that dominated in late 2018 has very much been replaced by a risk-on attitude in 2019, mainly in response to the recent dovish shift in Federal Reserve policy.</p>
<p>This change in sentiment has been reflected in European markets, where Chinese stimulus measures have also had a positive impact since the start of the year. However, with a weaker trend in economic data and the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit making it difficult to predict the outlook for monetary policy, investors will need to look closely at the data.</p>
<h4>Eurozone: A downward spiral?</h4>
<p>The European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) decision in March to provide further targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) to support the banks came much earlier than the market was forecasting. However, the announcement reflected downward revisions to eurozone growth and inflation expectations. Regional bond yields have slumped, with pricing now suggesting that there will be no ECB interest rate increases for about 18 months.</p>
<p>To see whether the downward trend in eurozone economic data is likely to continue, or whether growth will rebound, investors will need to keep a close eye on several key economic indicators, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment intentions and consumer and business confidence data</strong> – Investors will need to monitor how business is responding to the risks of a global slowdown fueled by trade tensions with the US and China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong> – ECB president Mario Draghi recently stated that “inflation convergence is delayed and not derailed” when fielding questions on the current growth slowdown. We will be closely monitoring upcoming inflation prints, specifically wage inflation in the quarter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domestic demand</strong> – We are looking at whether the downturn in external demand will spill over to domestic demand. The ECB recognises that risks to the consumer have also increased to the downside.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>UK: Brexit means uncertainty</h4>
<p>The Bank of England continues to suggest that a gradual – and limited – tightening of monetary policy will be appropriate if the economy develops in line with the projections it set out in February. However, these projections are based on a smooth transition towards a new trading relationship with the European Union. In other words, they are substantially subject to change depending on the chosen Brexit path.</p>
<p>Given the current uncertainty over the outlook for UK interest rates, we are monitoring two main areas of the UK economy for clues to the Bank of England’s thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment intentions and consumer and business confidence data</strong> – Analysis of the latest business surveys will be crucial given risks of a global slowdown fueled by a trade war have increased and the lack of clarity over Brexit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong> – Wage inflation needs to be carefully monitored, particularly as any softer outcome to Brexit could boost activity and allow the Monetary Policy Committee to justify tightening of policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2>April 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p><span>Singapore’s de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), will hold its semi-annual monetary policy meeting in mid-April. Given the recent rapid changes in the global and regional economic outlook, market consensus for future policy direction remains divergent – but both the MAS’s actions and words could have significant implications for Singapore dollar cash investors.</span></p>
<h4><span><strong>A hawkish policy stance</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>Consistent with other central banks, the MAS’s primary policy objective is price stability – it currently believes that a core inflation rate of just under 2% is compatible with this objective. However, its monetary policy is unusual in that it is focused on managing the exchange rate rather than interest rates. Whilst this methodology is reasonable because key inflation factors are imported (food and fuel), it also implies a loss of control over domestic interest rates.</span></p>
<p><span>Since 2015, core inflation has gradually moved higher, towards the MAS’s target range, allowing the central bank to assume a more hawkish policy stance. In 2018, the MAS increased the slope of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) by approximately 0.5% at both its April and October monetary policy meetings.</span></p>
<p><span>At its October meeting, the MAS retained a hawkish bias, expecting robust domestic demand to offset any future export weakness whilst continued labour market tightening would push wages and inflation higher. Consequently, most investors expected further policy tightening in 2019, taking the S$NEER slope to a more historically neutral +1.5% level.</span></p>
<p><span></span> <img alt="""" height=""508"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/tt-blog-apr-2019--chart-1.png?la=en&amp;hash=682967E21BAB0EEF9BF386C5C0197E99"" width=""939""/></p>
<h4><span><strong>The economic outlook is evolving</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>Unfortunately, Singapore’s actual economic activity during the past five months has not mirrored the MAS’s predictions. Growth has slowed, with exports sharply lower, private consumption has weakened and unemployment has edged higher. </span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, the fall in oil prices and sluggish wage growth are reflected in recent muted headline and core inflation data. Finally, the US Federal Reserve interest rate pause and scepticism regarding the strength of China’s economic stabilisation have created additional policy uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" height=""508"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/tt-blog-apr-2019--chart-2.png?la=en&amp;hash=02D5F19D7EF2E3F13E3883F302B7045E"" width=""939""/></span></p>
<p><span>Despite sluggish economic growth, local short-tenor interest rates have moved higher. Given the MAS’s focus on controlling the S$NEER, US interest rates exert significant influence and the four federal funds target rate hikes in 2018 helped push Singapore swap offer rate (SOR) yields to a decade high.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" height=""508"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/tt-blog-apr-2019--chart-3.png?la=en&amp;hash=40ABE9AF80480FDDEF29A1C641993038"" width=""939""/></span></p>
<h4><span><strong>Assessing the implications for investors</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>At its upcoming monetary policy meeting in April, the MAS has two potential policy actions and three potential wording choices.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" height=""99"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/thought-for-the-month/jpm51974_treasury_today_april_2019_table_300px_.png?la=en&amp;hash=86A09E15F74223A15E72072CAF5DE945"" width=""300""/></span></p>
<p><span>The recent dovish comments by the Federal Reserve suggest no further US rate hikes for the foreseeable future, limiting the upside for US Libor rates. Nevertheless the MAS’s policy decision will impact the SOR-Libor spread, which remains, by historical standards, wide. </span></p>
<p><span>A decision to leave the S$NEER slope unchanged could push SOR rates higher, whilst an increase to the $NEER slope could pull SOR rates lower. However, at this policy meeting the MAS’s bias will, arguably, be more important. Weak economic data and muted inflation is likely to encourage a dovish or neutral bias, which would negatively impact investor expectations for future Singapore dollar appreciation, reducing the availability of local liquidity and paradoxically pushing SOR yields higher over the long-term. </span></p>
<p style=""padding: 0cm; border: none;""><span>For Singapore dollar cash investors, the recent higher SOR yields are welcome following an extended period of low returns and negative real yields. Regardless of the MAS’s ultimate decision, increasing diversification across asset classes and extending further out the curve where possible should help maximise potential Singapore dollar cash returns.</span></p>

<h2>March 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>After a decade of anaemic returns, cash rates moved decisively higher in 2018 – at least in the US. Three-month Treasury yields pushed through the 2% mark, while dollar money market yields actually rose above the yield available from many broader fixed income benchmarks.</p>
<p>This represents something of a turnaround from the ultra-low interest rates that had held sway since the 2008 financial crisis. And although the pace of interest rate increases is likely to slow this year, dollar cash rates should remain competitive against other asset classes.</p>
<p>Outside the US, sterling and euro investors have so far not enjoyed quite the same pickup in cash yields as dollar investors. The Bank of England is raising rates, but is moving cautiously as it assesses the potential economic impact of Brexit. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is trailing well behind, with ECB president Mario Draghi warning that euro rates will remain at -40 basis points (bps) “at least through summer” of 2019 and that risks “have moved to the downside”.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although the UK and the eurozone are lagging behind the US, the direction of travel is the same, with monetary policy becoming tighter. We therefore recognise that higher cash rates could become much more of a global theme as we move through 2019 and beyond.</p>
<p>In this environment, it’s important for treasurers to remain positioned for rising yields, and to be prepared just in case central banks move faster than expected. It can be painful if you’re unable to respond quickly when the yield curve steepens.</p>

<h4>Make sure you’re able to take advantage of rising interest rates</h4>
<p>Cash segmentation can help corporate treasurers to utilise longer-term investments that have the potential to deliver incremental returns. Treasurers will need to first ensure that they have a robust investment policy in place, which clearly states their organisation’s investment goals, how much of the investment portfolio must be in cash, and how much duration and credit risk is acceptable.</p>
<p>Accurate cash flow forecasts are also important. This means considering when and where surplus cash is held, how much of it is available and for how long, and the likelihood and timing of any events that could have an effect on the cash position – for example, a bond issue, the sale of part of the business, an acquisition, or a share buyback.</p>
<p>It’s only when an accurate cash flow forecast is available that an organisation can determine the percentage of its cash holdings that needs to be immediately accessible for operating purposes, the percentage required for potential reserve requirements, and the percentage that can be viewed as strategic, longer-term cash.</p>
<p>To maintain security and same-day liquidity, operating cash should always be invested in highly rated short-term instruments, or government and prime money market funds (either with a constant or variable net asset value). But it’s the next step up into reserve cash – and beyond into strategic cash solutions – where we expect to see further strong demand this year.</p>
<p>Ultra-short-duration strategies, for example, can have a greater duration budget of up to one year portfolio duration and can buy into a broader range of investment grade securities, providing a compelling way for treasurers to earn incremental returns on surplus cash balances, while also attracting fixed-income investors looking to reduce duration in their portfolios and guard against the rising rate environment.</p>

<h2>February 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>China is experiencing a broad economic slowdown. GDP growth fell to a 28-year low of 6.4% year on year in the fourth quarter of 2018, as weaker domestic demand combined with escalating trade tensions to weigh on business and consumer sentiment. The strong fiscal and monetary policy response from the Chinese authorities to this slowdown should help to support growth, but will also have a significant impact on cash investment options and cash returns in 2019.</p>
<h4>Policy response designed to support growth</h4>
<p>In early 2018, with economists predicting solid economic growth, China introduced new asset management product regulations that were designed to cut leverage and reduce risks to the economy by curbing activity in the shadow banking sector. However, the regulations were unexpectedly restrictive, leading to higher borrowing costs and a sharp slowdown in the availability of funding. The private sector, which accounts for over 50% of Chinese tax revenues and over 80% of employment creation, was especially hard hit.</p>
<p>The Chinese government reacted quickly with tax cuts and additional infrastructure spending to support growth. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China cut repo rates, reduced the reserve requirement ratio and introduced targeted credit easing. The cumulative effect of these actions can be observed in the massive increase in liquidity (CNY 4.9 trillion<sup id=""fnref:13""><a href=""#fn:13"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>) into the banking system and the subsequent decline in market driven interest rates that made the Chinese bond market one of the best performing in 2018.</p>
<h4>Lower rates means reduced cash returns </h4>
<p>For short-term cash investors, this combination of lower interest rates and new asset management product rules has reduced potential returns and increased investment complexity. In 2018, as repo and Shibor rates declined sharply, yield-sensitive retail money market funds sought to offset lower returns by lengthening duration and buying even lower credit quality issuers – dramatically increasing risk. Triple-A funds, with more restrictive guidelines and a focus on liquidity and security, also suffered a decline in yields.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the private sector remains under pressure despite the government’s stimulus efforts. This is because China suffers from a capital allocation problem rather than a lack of liquidity. Funding is available, but it isn’t reaching the parts of the economy that need it most. Instead, bank loan rates are at record highs and banks are still funding themselves via costly methods like structured funding.</p>
<h4>Yields are likely to continue to trend downward</h4>
<p>Ultimately, China must unblock its monetary transmission mechanism to boost growth. Nevertheless, given the authorities need to continue to support the economy while deflating a credit bubble, it is likely that liquidity will remain abundant and short-term interest rates will continue to trend downwards in 2019.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately for cash investors, this implies lower yields. However, with default and downgrade risks intensifying, and interest rate volatility increasing, the temptation to add lower quality credit or extend duration to boost returns should be resisted. Despite lower yields, investors should continue to focus on safety and security if they want to avoid jeopardising principal. </p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Open banking has yet to win over consumers and corporates with its promise of greater competition and innovation across the financial services industry. But with banks and fintechs beavering away creating solutions and infrastructure to support it, the initiative looks to be building up a head of steam, with advocates certain it will, eventually, prove irresistible.</em></p>
<p>Open banking, which requires banks to make customer account data they hold available to third parties so that they can create new, innovative financial products, is being hailed as revolutionary. Yet, so far, almost a year from it coming into force, the concept seems to be having a tough time making much of an impression on those who it is intended to benefit most: consumers and corporates.</p>
<p>A YouGov poll in August 2018 found that nearly three quarters of Britons had not even heard of open banking and that, moreover, over 77% of the 2,074 polled are wary about sharing their data with companies other than their main bank. Just 12% said that they would be prepared to share their financial data in order to access new and innovative products or services.</p>
<p>Further evidence of consumers being distinctly underwhelmed by open banking came in November, with design and technology firm Splendid Unlimited revealing that just 22% of UK adults polled had heard of open banking as a concept and for many of them trust remained a big issue, with security and privacy high on their list of concerns. Just 9% of the 2,000 adults surveyed by Splendid said they use open banking.</p>
<p>On the face of it then, despite its bold and honourable mission of opening up financial services to greater competition and innovation, open banking appears to be struggling to win over the public. And if a live audience poll at the recent Eurofinance International Treasury Management conference in Geneva is to be taken at face value, corporate treasurers too seem to be wondering what all the fuss is about. Approximately 60% of the treasurers polled at a plenary session said they believed open banking and the EU regulation that enables it, PSD2, are not relevant to them.</p>
<p>The regulation that launched open banking in the UK came into force in January 2018 but the groundwork for it was being laid as far back as 2015. The Open Data Institute (ODI), an independent, non-profit organisation co-founded by the inventor of the web Sir Tim Berners-Lee and artificial intelligence expert Sir Nigel Shadbolt to champion open data and its innovative use, played an instrumental role in creating the technical framework that underpins the initiative.</p>
<p>David Beardmore, the ODI’s Commercial Director and an expert on open banking, recalls the early period of its conception: “We corralled and convened all of the regulators, the banks and consumer groups to help that framework come into being and we provided a lot of the written paperwork that went into the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA’s) report that eventually led to open banking coming into force.”</p>
<p>In 2016 the CMA mandated the nine largest personal and small business account providers in the UK – Barclays, Lloyds, Santander, Danske, HSBC, RBS, Bank of Ireland, Nationwide and AIBG – to adopt an “open standard” that would enable third parties such as fintechs to easily tap into their data to create new products and services. With the nine mandated banks accounting for 85% of all personal and small business current accounts, the body could be certain that the open banking regulation had the potential to impact most Britons and SMEs.</p>
<h4 id=""slow-burn"">Slow burn</h4>
<p>Beardmore is well aware of the reticence of consumers and corporates to fully engage with open banking but insists it is still very early days for the mission. He recalls that even before the mandating of the banks by the CMA there was a lot of talk that open banking was never going to happen for one reason or other. “That has proven not to be the case and there is a lot more to come. For sure we are on slow burn here with open banking but make no mistake, momentum is building.”</p>
<p>The mandated retail banks have been active with launching open banking solutions, of course but for Beardmore, a rather more powerful indicator of the forces that will help drive and shape open banking going forwards is “the absolutely thriving, burgeoning fintech sector around open banking that is growing at an exponential rate”.</p>
<p>He adds: “There are about 50 fintechs out there already accredited by regulators to operate in this open banking space and behind them there more than 150 looking to secure the same privilege. That all amounts to an awful lot of creativity and enterprise being expended on open banking. Add in the efforts of the high street banks, and the direction is clear. So, corporates absolutely need to take notice of open banking – it would be an absolute folly for them to ignore or believe it is irrelevant to their business models or financial operations.”</p>
<p>So, what exactly is open banking and how does it relate to PSD2? Beardmore explains that open banking is essentially the UK’s take on PSD2, the EU regulation that enables it. The big difference is that while PSD2 also requires banks to open up their data to third parties, the EU regulation is leaving the technical format for how that is enabled up to the market to define. The UK’s open banking, by contrast, demands banks open up their data according to a common standard format: “That is a really important aspect and distinguishes the UK from the other countries.”</p>
<p>With open banking, the nine banks mandated by the CMA have been required to implement a pre-defined single application programme interface (API), the underlying plumbing that enables software at one company to gain very fast, secure access to software at another company. “Many people get very excited about APIs and think that is what open banking is all about – it really isn’t. An API is just a piece of code that allows two applications to talk to each other. It is like a universal power socket for the digital world, allowing multiple systems to work together and speak to each other and we have been using them for many, many years.</p>
<p>“Uber, for instance is built on API calls, so when you stand in the street and say “I need an Uber right where I am now”, there’s an API call from the GPS module in your phone to the GPS server that locates where you are. When you pay using the credit card registered with Uber, there is another API call to your credit card provider to take the payment.”</p>
<p>The open-ended formatting proposed by PSD2 means that across the rest of Europe we could see the rise of various groups of standards driven by consortiums of European banks and third-party providers. That has given rise to concerns that the development of new services to clients of specific banks could be limited. The Berlin Group, consisting of 40 banks, payments associations and payment service providers from across the EU, has been formed to define a common API standard called NextGenPSD2. Although several other PSD2 API initiatives have been set up, the NextGenPSD2 looks to be in pole position to become the leading API framework across the EU as it has the greatest scale and number of participants.</p>
<h4 id=""api-days"">API days</h4>
<p>Whether it is PSD2 or open banking, the prime objective of both is that once consumers and firms have given permission for their bank data to be shared with third parties, they will be able to access new services and products from those parties. Within such an open environment, corporates, especially those that enjoy multiple bank relationships, are likely to benefit from more convenient payment management across different banks via a centralised platform, enabling more effective cash management. “An example here would be fintechs offering an account aggregation solution. They would create a platform where you can see accounts from multiple providers on a single platform, see the operation of those accounts together. That is just one potential and obvious application of open banking.</p>
<p>“The real beauty, though, and the reason why there are so many fintechs developing open banking solutions, is that they can build whatever service they want to put out there. As long as they do so with this common API recipe, they know they can go to any of those nine banks mandated by the CMA in full confidence that their app, service – whatever it is that they’ve built – will connect directly to those banks without any middle ware, without any transition or transposition, and directly to the customer’s accounts providing, of course, they have been given permission by that customer.”</p>
<p>Clearly fintechs are mightily keen on tapping into a market that potentially offers them access to up to 85% of bank customers in the UK alone, but they are not alone. Beardmore says there is growing, active interest in open banking right across the financial services industry: “There are a lot of legacy players – banks like TSB, credit card companies like Amex, credit reference agencies, all kinds of institutions – none of whom were mandated by the CMA. They too have noted that the big banks are playing to this single API recipe and feel it would make a lot of sense if they were to follow suit by building APIs to that same recipe. They also want to leverage into the seamless, interoperable banking space. So that again is another powerful signal to corporate treasurers saying: don’t ignore open banking because not only are the institutions mandated by CMA doing it, so too are those who weren’t told to do anything and were outside of that order. Momentum is building.”</p>


<blockquote><p>Don’t ignore open banking because not only are the institutions mandated by CMA doing it, so too are those who weren’t told to do anything and were outside of that order. Momentum is building.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">David Beardmore, Commercial Director, Open Data Institute</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For treasurers, one of the most important benefits that open banking and common API standard is expected to offer is speed in access to data. Corporates today may receive details about their account balances at set times through SWIFT MT940 messages but in an API enabled world, there would be no need to wait: they would be able to access up-to-date balance information via their TMS, ERP or online banking portal in near real-time. Batch to near real-time processing will become far more ubiquitous and accessible to firms of all sizes.</p>
<p>Beardmore believes that when it comes, open banking’s impact on businesses, it will initially be the small firms that benefit most: “They are the most underserved in the whole spectrum. In fact, I think the first real evidence of the positive impact of open banking will actually come from small firms and their experience will then encourage ordinary consumers.</p>
<p>“Although it might lag behind for a while, I think there will be significant benefits for corporate banking. Instead of having them go through the more manual processes for decision making, whether that’s for lending, underwriting, payments, insurance, they’ll have a very rich API ecosystem that will give them fast, accurate, granular information for automated decision making. Open banking will also allow firms to pull in other sources of data, to marry up with existing data streams to make far richer, more informed sources of decision.”</p>
<h4 id=""tangible-benefits"">Tangible benefits</h4>
<p>Among the banks, HSBC has been one of the most proactive in offering open banking solutions. Like Beardmore, Lance Kawaguchi, Managing Director and Global Head – Global Banking Corporates for HSBC’s Global Liquidity and Cash Management (GLCM) division, also believes open banking and PSD2 are paving the way for innovation, transparency and open market competition and as such “provide a wealth of opportunity for corporate treasurers to leverage”.</p>
<p>In considering their benefits for firms, Kawaguchi points first to their potential for easing the heavy administration and ‘non-value added’ workload on founders and directors of SMEs and mid-market enterprises. Solutions that integrate technology like machine learning and AI with open banking and PSD2 will help to reduce these burdens, he says, freeing up management time for greater focus on growing their business.</p>
<p>For the larger corporates, one of the benefits is likely to be the eradication of the interchange fee charged by payment gateways like Paypal and Worldpay and card processors like Visa and Mastercard. Corporates that receive money from consumers via existing card or wallet providers will be able to utilise open banking and PSD2 to allow transfers to be made instantly and so remove or reduce the interchange cost.</p>
<p>Kawaguchi says HSBC is committed to developing “compelling open banking propositions” that help all parties do what they need to in a frictionless and secure way. “We are working with some interested corporate clients to build and enhance our propositions. Our goal is always to work in partnership with a broad set of customers to build propositions that solve real client problems.”</p>
<p>Cash flow forecasting is one area HSBC believes can benefit greatly from open banking-based solutions, with SMEs and mid-market enterprises especially well placed to gain access to a service that extracts and visualises information in a clear way, and allows them to aggregate and consolidate the data using apps, all without the need of SWIFT messaging.</p>
<p>Within its Global Liquidity and Cash Management business, HSBC recently launched a liquidity management portal to give corporate and financial institution clients a clearer picture of their cash position globally and provide tools to self-manage their liquidity, enabling improved funding and investment decisions. The portal uses data visualisation to give treasurers an accessible, real-time view of their cash and cash-equivalents, across multiple banks and products. Kawaguchi says the portal aims to provide “easily consumable information” and likens it to HSBC’s ‘Connected Money’ app, which allows retail customers to see their various bank accounts together in one place.</p>
<p>He adds that HSBC has a significant portfolio of customers and evident leaders among them looking to actively pursue opportunities that are arising from open banking, especially across sectors where they can disintermediate banks and/or third parties, and own the relationship with the end consumer.</p>
<p>But he adds that the “vast majority” of treasurers are yet to understand the tangible opportunities open banking and PSD2 present and are waiting for either banks or fintechs to come up with propositions that solve real problems and evidence of their benefits: “Our focus at HSBC is to really understand those customer pain points and innovate to solve them.”</p>


","Open banking has yet to win over consumers and corporates with its promise of greater competition and innovation across the financial services industry. But with banks and fintechs beavering away creating solutions and infrastructure to support it, the initiative looks to be building up a head of steam, with advocates certain it will, eventually, prove irresistible.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/20190102tt07bktechnologynetworkonlinebankinginternetnetworkingss6922969871920x1080.jpg,2019-01-01,Cash Management,False

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2>January 2019</h2>
<br/>
<p>2018 ended with investors very much in risk-off mode. Markets wilted under pressure from several headwinds, including concerns about trade wars, a US recession, a global slowdown, Brexit, Italian fiscal policy, French fuel protests, leverage in the credit markets and deteriorating market liquidity.</p>
<p>Given the current uncertainty on markets, euro and sterling corporate treasurers will need to closely monitor economic data releases as they look to navigate central bank policy decisions over the coming 12 months.</p>
<h4>Eurozone: Towards positive rates?</h4>
<p>The eurozone economy has now dropped a gear, moving from above-trend to trend growth. Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to guide the markets for higher rates to come. Whether the central bank actually manages to tighten and finally move rates out of negative policy remains to be seen. But with the Asset Purchase Programme recently stopped, European rates and credit markets will now have to manage without crisis support.</p>
<p>We are keeping a close eye on two key eurozone economic indicators for indications of the likely course that the ECB will take in 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong> – With wage inflation still expected to pick up in the coming months, we will be closely monitoring the situation as rising consumer prices will be central if the ECB is to justify higher rates over the next 12 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domestic demand</strong> – Improving labour market dynamics are allowing for a decline in the household savings rate and are providing investors with the confidence to embrace credit. We will be looking to see if this trend continues in 2019.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>UK: Clouded by Brexit uncertainty</h4>
<p>The UK government’s difficulty getting its Brexit deal through parliament means that the market’s fear of a no–deal scenario still cannot be discounted. In the short term, fears of a disorderly exit from the European Union will likely keep many investors quite rightly on the sidelines, or cautious on UK risk, as the uncertainty premium on UK trading is currently just too large. Sterling remains volatile, moving on Brexit-related headlines.</p>
<p>Keeping rates strategy shorter feels appropriate at this juncture until we have more concrete information. What we do know is with the UK bank rate at 75 basis points, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee had three cuts-worth of ammunition in a no-deal scenario (if it does actually cut at all). On a softer Brexit outcome, we believe the market will price a far steeper yield curve with a faster tightening cycle than is currently forecast.</p>
<p>Given the current uncertainty over the outlook for UK interest rates, we are monitoring two main areas of the UK economy for clues to the Bank of England’s thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer and business confidence</strong> – Considering risks of a global slowdown fuelled by a trade war have increased and the ongoing concerns over a no-deal Brexit, investment intentions – and consumer and business confidence data – will need to be closely monitored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong> – Average weekly earnings growth rose to 3.3% in October, which is the highest level since July 2008. With unemployment remaining close to multi-year lows at 4.1%, and a reduction in net inward migration, there appears to be little slack left in the economy. This metric will certainly be closely followed by the Monetary Policy Committee as it debates interest rates.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2>December 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>Although China’s bond market is the third largest in the world, with USD 9 trillion<sup id=""fnref:10""><a href=""#fn:10"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> outstanding, the concept of corporate bond defaults – or indeed downgrades – has until now been alien to the vast majority of local retail and institutional investors. However, with default rates now on the rise, investors increasingly need to understand the credit risks when investing in China, and the ways to mitigate them.</p>
<h4>Rising corporate default rates</h4>
<p>Prior to 2014, China had never suffered a corporate default. Entities encountering financial difficulties were either taken over or bailed out, which ensured that investors never suffered losses, but also reinforced the perception of an implicit government guarantee and intensifying moral hazard.</p>
<p>The Chinese government’s efforts to eliminate this moral hazard, improve capital allocation and create a closer link between risk and return have been the trigger for the gradual financial evolution witnessed over the past decade. These regulatory changes cumulated with the new Asset Management Product (AMP) rules announced in April 2018, designed to curtail shadow banking activity, remove implicit guarantees and improve investment transparency.</p>
<p>However, a significant side effect of these new AMP rules is the reduction in access for borrowers who previously used shadow banking channels for funding. With formal lending channels also tightening, the number of defaults in China has risen sharply, reaching a record high in 2018 (although defaults remain low relative to global bond markets<sup id=""fnref:11""><a href=""#fn:11"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>).</p>

<h4>Credit analysis is challenging</h4>
<p>For bond and cash investors, understanding credit and counterparty risks in China has therefore become increasingly important.</p>
<p>However, credit analysis is challenging, due to a combination of opaque financial data, complex financial interconnections and an inconsistent domestic ratings system that rates 70% of issuers triple A and 97% of issuers AA- or better<sup id=""fnref:12""><a href=""#fn:12"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Often, there are large differences between the domestic and international ratings for many Chinese banks and corporates. Onshore credit spreads reflect these differences.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, investors should focus on the issuer’s potential level of government support and its standalone credit profile.</p>
<p>The first of these factors – government support – remains important. But is should not be overestimated. Only a limited number of issuers enjoy strong government links – especially those with social benefits, monopolies and direct government involvement. Other issuers may have weak government support from lower ranked provincial or city governments.</p>
<p>Increasingly important is an analysis of the issuer’s capital, earnings, liquidity and management. Similar to western financial markets, a “bottom-up” approach to understanding the issuer’s financial condition, resiliency and quality is critical in determining the issuer’s willingness and ability to repay their debts.</p>
<h4>Adopt a rigorous credit process</h4>
<p>Slower economic growth and tighter financial conditions have created a challenging environment for many Chinese bond issuers. This suggests a growing likelihood of further defaults.</p>
<p>In this environment, it’s vital for investors to adopt a rigorous credit process that primarily focuses on the credit profile of an issuer’s counterparties, while also considering the level of government support. Such rigorous credit analysis should help investors minimise the risk of suffering downgrades or defaults when investing in China.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>With potential for the repatriation of US$2trn of overseas investment, Dan Burns took the opportunity at a recent Treasury Today webinar to explain the main changes to US tax. Here are his key takeaways:</p>
<h4 id=""corporate-alternative-minimum-tax"">Corporate alternative minimum tax</h4>
<p>Repeals the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax.</p>
<h4 id=""territorial-system"">Territorial system</h4>
<p>Exempts US corporations from US taxes on most future foreign profits, ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all US-based corporations, no matter where they are earned. This would align the US tax code with most other industrialised nations, undercut many offshore tax-dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years.</p>
<h4 id=""repatriation"">Repatriation</h4>
<p>Sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8% on illiquid assets and 15.5% on cash and cash equivalents for about US$2.6trn in US business profits now held overseas. This foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax-deferred if they are not brought into the United States, or repatriated. That rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system.</p>
<h4 id=""base-erosion-and-anti-abuse-tax"">Base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT)</h4>
<p>Prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad. Sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between US corporations and foreign affiliates, and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property, including patents. In combination, these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions, represent a dramatic overhaul of the US tax system for multinationals.</p>

</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is how BEAT is designed to work: If a company generates more than US$500m in annual revenue in the US, and its American units make above a specified level of tax-deductible payments to related companies overseas, those units must pay a minimum tax on their US profit after adding back in certain types of deductions. The minimum rate is 5% in 2018 but rises to 10% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2026.</p>
<h4 id=""capital-expensing"">Capital expensing</h4>
<p>Allows businesses to immediately write off, or expense, the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years, then gradually eliminates this 100% expensing over five years beginning in year six. Also makes changes to permit for more expensing by small businesses.</p>
<h4 id=""interest-deduction-limit"">Interest deduction limit</h4>
<p>Caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30% of taxable income, regardless of deductions for depreciation, amortisation or depletion.</p>
<h4 id=""clean-energy"">Clean energy</h4>
<p>Preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower.</p>
<h4 id=""carried-interest"">Carried interest</h4>
<p>Leaves in place ‘carried interest’ loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by Republicans including President Donald Trump to close it. These financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. A new rule would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers but preserving its availability for many.</p>
<p>Companies are benefitting when gains in profits attributable to reductions in effective tax rates are shown to the tune of US$56.4bn in the case of the big technology companies.</p>
<p>The current situation is also having a major impact on exchange rates against the greenback with only the currencies of Mexico (although this is probably a correction of earlier weakening following President Trump’s policy on Mexico), Ukraine, Colombia, Kenya, Japan and Nigeria showing gains.</p>

<h2>November 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>Rising rate environments can challenge even the most sophisticated fixed income investor. As the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hiking cycle unfolds and regulatory reform kicks in, investors need to consider the implications for their short-term investments.</p>
<p>We are already starting to see the effects of the Fed’s policy, which is reflected across the Atlantic as the European Central Bank and Bank of England gradually unwind their fiscal stimulus. As the effects of the global financial crisis receded, the Fed chose to unwind its unprecedented policy cautiously at first, hiking rates only once in 2015 and again in 2016. However, since the beginning of 2017 it has raised rates six times and signalled further hikes in the coming years.</p>
<p>The 2018 hikes – in March, June and September – are expected to be followed by a fourth before the end of the year. Additionally, the Fed anticipates  a further three in 2019, which will fundamentally transform the landscape for fixed income investing. If anything, the market has underpriced the scenario, meaning that if the Fed follows through with its own projections or acts more quickly than expected, many investors will be taken by surprise.</p>
<p>But why are rising interest rates such a cause for concern? Simply because when interest rates rise, the market value of previously issued fixed coupon bond holdings will fall, with investors’ interest shifting to newer, higher-yielding bonds. That said, not all securities are created equal. Assuming a stable credit environment, bonds with shorter maturities, floating interest rates and/or higher yields will prove far more resilient, and are likely to encounter less precipitous declines in demand and hence value.</p>
<p>So how should cash investors react to this new environment of rising global interest rates? An obvious solution to improve total returns from fixed income portfolios is to shift investments into shorter duration, higher-income-generating strategies, which may not necessarily entail significantly increased risk in the current stable credit environment.</p>
<p>As with all aspects of investing, forewarned is forearmed: careful study of past rising rate cycles and dynamic scenario analysis of potential future rate moves can deliver real insight and perspective, enabling the right investment decisions to be taken.</p>
<p>That said, nobody can predict the future with certainty. It is possible that improving economic data will persuade Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to take a more hawkish approach and accelerate the pace and scale of interest rate rises. Alternatively, evolving trade wars and a strengthening US dollar could lead to a slowdown in the normalisation process.</p>
<p>But whatever unfolds, shorter duration, higher income strategies should provide some relief – provided that decisions are informed by careful analysis of past events and deep understanding of the investor’s short-term cash needs and appetite for risk.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h2>October 2018</h2>
<h4>Australia’s domestic economy still looks strong</h4>
<p>In Australia, second-quarter GDP beat expectations – hitting 3.4% y/y – as strong exports and consumption helped offset lower investments. Strong commodities demand helped exports grow at a double-digit level, while the trade balance remained in surplus, supporting a surge in business confidence indicators.</p>
<p>Employment growth pushed the unemployment rate to a six-year low of 5.3%. But wage growth kept close to record lows, chipping away at consumer confidence and retail sales. Quarterly inflation hit a five-quarter high of 2.1% y/y as higher transportation costs cancelled out falling housing costs. But the overall trend remains muted, with core Consumer Price Index printing at 1.9% – still below the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA’s) 2%-3% target range. Meanwhile, political concerns, curbs on foreign buyers and higher mortgage rates joined forces to erode housing market sentiment.</p>
<p>The domestic economy remains strong, supported by exports and consumption. Slower housing, low wage growth and muted consumer sentiment are still a worry – but a manageable one. The RBA believes growth and inflation will continue to gradually trend upwards towards its target ranges. The central bank judges that current interest rates are appropriate, indicating the next interest rate movement would be up–albeit not anytime soon.</p>
<h4>The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) support fails to stall the slowdown of China’s economy</h4>
<p>Moving north to China, the pace of economic growth slowed yet again. Second-quarter GDP slipped to a two-year low of 6.7% y/y as robust service sector growth failed to make up for weakness in the industrial sector and weaker investment spending. Key domestic data–including industrial production, fixed asset investment and retail sales – all kept close to record lows as weak demand and the negative impact of recent financial regulations weighed on domestic demand.</p>
<p>Money supply and new loan growth data also remained subdued, despite emerging efforts by the authorities to rev up demand. Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) numbers still look relatively robust, as do exports, which were up 12.2% y/y, as trade tensions have not yet dampened demand. Meanwhile, inflation reached a six-month high as both food and non-food prices increased.</p>
<p>The recent crackdown on shadow-banking activities and trade tensions have helped spark weaker economic growth, continued currency weakness and further declines in the stock market – which have all hit investor sentiment. In a nod to the risks, the authorities have eased recent asset management product implementation rules, while the PBoC has injected liquidity via medium-term lending facility and open market operations, expanded its approved collateral limits and initiated its countercyclical factors model to reduce currency volatility. But the economy continues to slow, with interest rates likely to remain low for now.</p>
<h4>Solid growth in Singapore as government reaffirms growth forecasts</h4>
<p>Across the water in Singapore, economic data was generally solid. Second-quarter GDP printed at 3.6% y/y as strong exports and services helped offset weakness in the construction sector. Exports remained relatively robust, although electronics exports were weak due to lower Chinese demand. This was also reflected in strong PMI and industrial production data, pointing to steady manufacturing growth.</p>
<p>The second-quarter 2018 unemployment rate remained low at 2.1%, but this failed to feed through into stronger retail sales. What’s more, signs of a recovery in property prices were cut short by the recent introduction of property cooling measures, which has already dampened transaction volumes. Meanwhile, headline inflation remained broadly stable at 0.6% y/y, core inflation jumped to a four-year high of 1.9%.</p>
<p>The steady upward growth rate has allowed the government to reaffirm its 2018 growth forecast range at 2.5%-3.5%. Global trade tensions and higher US interest rates remain key downside risks, but the government believes these can be mitigated and are unlikely to derail growth. And with core inflation rapidly moving into the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s target range, we’d expect the central bank to stick to its hawkish bias at the October monetary policy meeting.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>US tax reform has prompted many companies to review their cash repatriation policies. But how and why does cash become ‘trapped’ in overseas markets, what are the benefits of bringing cash home – and when is it preferable to leave cash where it is?</em></p>
<p>Companies around the world are continuing to hold high levels of cash. Mark Smith, head of Global Liquidity for Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, comments that since the financial crisis, corporates have increasingly aimed to carry more cash on their balance sheets in order to build a more significant buffer against unforeseen circumstances. At the same time, low interest rates have prompted some companies to issue debt for large acquisitions, rather than make use of that cash. “In other words, there has been a build-up of cash from a defensive standpoint, and there hasn’t been any need to deploy that cash urgently because debt has been so cheap,” he says.</p>
<p>But while a cash buffer can provide a sense of security, in practice not all of the cash held by a multinational company may be readily accessible. From stringent foreign exchange controls to tax considerations, there are many factors which can make it difficult for treasurers to bring cash home from overseas offices.</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers, one perennial goal is to overcome these obstacles and reduce the amount of cash trapped in other markets. This is certainly the case for George Dessing, Senior Vice President, Treasury &amp; Risk at global information, software, and services company Wolters Kluwer. “We want to provide value for stakeholders, which means that we want to limit the amount of trapped cash, or restricted cash as we refer to it, and therefore maximise the cash which is repatriated to the central parent level in the Netherlands,” he explains.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, the company’s restricted cash amounted to around €17m, down from €29m in 2016. As Dessing comments, “Most of the restrictions we face are due to local exchange control regulation on exporting cash and capital out of the country – and we even mention that explicitly in the notes to our annual report, so it’s definitely a topic receiving a certain amount of attention in our financials.”</p>
<h3 id=""challenging-markets"">Challenging markets</h3>
<p>Where Wolters Kluwer is concerned, Dessing says that restrictions can be found in a number of markets, including countries where exchange controls are prevalent – such as China, India and Brazil – as well as other emerging markets and some Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>“China has always been a challenge in this landscape although the authorities have over recent years made a number of attempts to allow more movement, albeit sometimes for certain periods before reimposing restrictions,” comments Yera Hagopian, Head of Liquidity Services, Barclays Corporate Banking. “Certain Latin American countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela also present challenges alongside other Asian countries like India, Thailand, and South Korea.” She adds that Russia and Turkey “are still in the more challenging space when it comes to free movement of cash”.</p>


<blockquote>In this way, factors that should not normally lead to a trapped cash problem can contribute to the outcome.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Yera Hagopian, Head of Liquidity Services, Barclays Corporate Banking</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>But tax and regulatory factors are not the only reasons why companies may have issues around trapped cash. “Poor visibility or inaccurate data can impede efficient cash management,” says Hagopian. “Zero balancing may need to be watered down to target balancing, with substantial local buffers if there is the risk of overdrawing the local account and incurring a hefty local overdraft charge. Similarly, organisational factors may have some bearing on how cash is managed.”</p>
<p>Hagopian points out that in organisations where payments are decentralised across different markets, local operations will require a degree of control over their cash flows, as well as the certainty that their payments have adequate access to funding on an intraday basis. “In this way, factors that should not normally lead to a trapped cash problem can contribute to the outcome.”</p>
<h3 id=""weighing-the-risks"">Weighing the risks</h3>
<p>As Hagopian explains, there is a dilemma in that the markets which present the most challenging environments for cash repatriation “often present the greatest concern regarding country risk”. As such, she says that these considerations are best contemplated at the outset when investment in a particular market is being reviewed.</p>
<p>“The decision to invest may still be upheld, but the capital and funding structure of the local operation may be different as a result of a holistic review, given the reliance on dividends and royalties as the primary mechanism for repatriating cash. In addition, the attraction of a taxation rate for profits has to be weighed against the restrictions upon repatriation.”</p>
<p>Naturally, there’s no one size fits all when it comes to managing cash effectively. Where Wolters Kluwer is concerned, Dessing says that the group faces a variety of financial risks, including liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk, all of which are managed via a strict financial framework, policies and procedures. Against this backdrop, the company’s total debt is around €2bn – “and therefore you want to reduce that by having access to all available cash on a global basis.”</p>
<p>Dessing says that Wolters Kluwer tackles this task via a three-pronged approach. “First of all, we are using global cash pooling structures to gain access to cash, even in countries which have certain limitations,” he says. “Secondly, our intra-group financing includes certain netting and settlement structures that we use internally. And finally, we reduce the restricted cash via our internal dividend policy.”</p>
<h3 id=""impact-of-the-us-tax-reform"">Impact of the US tax reform</h3>
<p>While the issue of trapped cash has long been a concern for treasurers, conditions in specific markets can and do change over time. One notable development in recent months has been the US tax reform: as well as cutting corporation tax from 35% to 21%, the reform set out to encourage US corporations to repatriate foreign earnings, offering a reduced one-off repatriation tax rate on profits brought back to the US.</p>
<p>The consequences of this development could be significant. “The United States Worldwide system meant around US$2.5trn of cash was parked abroad by some estimates, discouraging onshore investing, debt restructuring and dividend payments,” says Hagopian. “At 35%, the rate of US Federal Income Tax was considerably higher than the average across the OECD, resulting in a deemed lack of competitiveness for attracting and retaining business in the US.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Hagopian says that the reduced transition tax, reduction in income tax rate and the ruling that foreign subsidiary earnings and dividends from foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to US tax in future, “has led many US multinationals to reconsider their repatriation policies”.</p>
<p>Some companies have been quick to take advantage of the opportunity. Apple, for example, announced in January that it anticipated repatriation tax payments of approximately US$38bn – implying that the company planned to repatriate around US$245bn.</p>
<p>But there are other factors to consider. Hagopian notes that there is a new minimum tax on ‘global intangible low-taxed income’ (GILTI), while CFC rules still apply to certain ‘passive’ income, making it subject to full US tax rate. “Of course, foreign capital gains remain subject to US taxation and local withholding or dividend taxes may still apply in local markets,” she adds.</p>
<h3 id=""to-repatriate-or-not-to-repatriate"">To repatriate or not to repatriate?</h3>
<p>When it comes to taking advantage of the changes, not all companies are alike. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Smith points out that large companies in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and technology may have built up large cash balances which they may have placed in short-term investments – “and they were waiting for repatriation to happen so that they could bring that cash onshore.”</p>
<p>For other companies, however, the situation may be somewhat different. “A lot of overseas cash is actually needed to run the overseas operation, so not all cash is eligible for repatriation,” says Smith. “Another factor is that companies have put together structures for their overseas cash that are sometimes complex, but ultimately efficient – and that efficiency may still hold post-tax reform. In any case, these structures can be quite time consuming and sometimes costly to unwind.”</p>


<blockquote>In some cases, tax considerations outweigh the benefit of transferring cash in the long run. We sometimes leave the cash in-country, but mostly we try to get it to a central level.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Consequently, Smith says that the bank has not seen a significant 
volume of flows as a result of the US tax reform. While some larger 
companies have taken advantage of the opportunity, many others are 
taking time to weigh up their operating cash needs versus their excess 
cash. Another consideration is that in some cases, there may be 
attractive investment opportunities overseas, which may mean companies 
can earn more overseas than they can by repatriating that cash.</p>
<p>Of course, taking the decision to repatriate cash is not the end of 
the story. “Even once they have reached their conclusions and found that
 they have cash that is eligible and desirable to repatriate, they still
 have to go through a process to actually repatriate it,” says Smith. He
 notes that undertaking a capital distribution from a subsidiary to a 
parent can take time: “Cash could be buried several layers below that 
parent and you are going to need to do financial statements, have those 
audited and get tax advice. So there are practical reasons why it can 
take time to gather cash efficiently into the place where it is needed, 
and then execute the repatriation.”</p>
<h3 id=""weighing-the-options"">Weighing the options</h3>
<p>These considerations are not limited to the developments in the US. 
While there are many good reasons for repatriating cash, from reducing 
reliance on external funding to taking advantage of opportunities for 
higher yield, there may also be situations when companies choose to 
leave cash where it is.</p>
<p>“Apart from the non-discretionary reasons relating to local 
regulations, punitive tax consequences are a primary reason for leaving 
cash in local operations, even if it is not needed for operational 
purposes,” says Hagopian. She points out that withholding taxes 
generally apply to cross-border payments of interest, dividends and 
royalties. Likewise, transfer pricing considerations can apply to 
inter-company loans and deposits that require interest arrangements to 
be conducted at arm’s length to prevent potential tax avoidance.</p>
<p>“In some cases, tax considerations outweigh the benefit of 
transferring cash in the long run,” comments Dessing. “We sometimes 
leave the cash in-country, but mostly we try to get it to a central 
level.”</p>
<p>Another consideration is the need for treasurers to provide their 
relationship banks with revenue opportunities. “If deposit rates are 
attractive and risk is acceptable, a local deposit or investment product
 may be a good way of rewarding a relationship bank, especially if the 
cash cannot be put to better use elsewhere,” Hagopian explains. 
“Manufacturing and production sites can often be set up in challenging 
countries, and sometimes the best way to use cash is to invest further 
in that country to then generate more finished goods for sale. These 
goods can be destined for the home market, leading to bigger dividend 
repatriation if that is possible, or made available for export.”</p>
<p>The currency in which cash is denominated will also need to be taken 
into account. Hagopian notes that consolidation of minor currencies may 
not always make sense, “especially where there are no corresponding 
funding requirements and currency markets are not deep enough to be 
certain of a beneficial exchange rate for swaps, whether real or virtual
 by way of a multi-currency pool”. Likewise, in some Asian markets, it 
is possible to repatriate foreign currency but not local currency.</p>
<h3 id=""keeping-up-to-date"">Keeping up to date</h3>
<p>It’s clear that there are many factors to consider when it comes to a
 company’s cash repatriation policy – and given that market conditions 
and local regulations are not set in stone, treasurers need to be fully 
apprised of any developments which may affect their chosen approach.</p>
<p>Dessing explains that the company’s treasury stays on top of these 
questions by leveraging local knowledge not only from the tax 
department, but also from local units that can advise about in-country 
changes. “We also speak to certain trusted advisory firms, our global 
banking partners and local and international treasury peer groups,” he 
adds.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is much to be gained by bringing cash home 
wherever this will benefit the company. But before this can happen, it 
is essential to have a full understanding of current market conditions, 
the mechanics of the repatriation process – and any factors which could 
mean cash could be put to better use in local markets.</p>

<h2>September 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>New European money market fund (MMF) regulations are opening up the MMF landscape to include some products that could leave unwary investors short on their security or liquidity requirements. Investment decisions may no longer be as obvious as they once were.</p>
<h4>Short-term or standard?</h4>
<p>The new regulations provide two categories of money market funds: short-term MMFs and standard MMFs. The short-term MMF is still the fund that most corporate treasurers have in mind when investing their operating cash. These funds have a Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) of 60 days or less, providing a high level of short-term liquidity and security.</p>
<p>However, treasurers also have the choice to invest in less liquid longer-dated standard MMFs, which can hold instruments out to two years and have a WAM of up to six months. The proportion of the standard MMF portfolio that matures within one day and one week may be significantly lower than a treasury manager expects.</p>
<h4>CNAV, LVNAV or VNAV?</h4>
<p>Under the new regulations, the traditional Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) fund will be replaced by Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV), Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV), and public debt Constant Net Asset Value options.</p>
<p>These new categories can be confusing. For example, LVNAV and public debt CNAV are short-term MMFs only, but VNAVs offer short-term or standard options. It’s important therefore to understand the new acronyms and regulatory jargon if you want to avoid investing in a fund that unexpectedly adds risk.</p>
<p>Treasurers therefore need to have a clear understanding of their own investment needs, and  they also need to look closely under the hood of every fund they are thinking of investing in to ensure it meets their needs. It’s not an issue of right or wrong, it’s simply one of being aware of what the underlying investments are and what the funds add to your cash strategy.</p>
<h4>A helping hand</h4>
<p>To help, we’ve produced a handy table to provide a quick at-a-glance reference of the main differences between the MMF categories. An awareness of the risks that the new regulatory classifications can present – or rather, the risks that confusing the new terms can create – should also lead to more attentive reading of the fund manager prospectuses.</p>

<p>Which product is deemed most suitable will depend on a number of variables such as investment objectives, business goals and the cash flow cycles to which a business is subject. However, having the flexibility to be able to respond to liquidity requirements, and being able (and confident) at an investment policy level to invest in any of the new options, may create opportunities to optimise corporate cash.</p>

<h2>August 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s (the Fed’s) interest on excess reserves (IOER) shot to prominence last month following an unprecedented adjustment by the central bank.  What was the rationale for the change and what, if any, are the implications for markets and investors?</p>
<h4>The evolution of Fed monetary policy</h4>
<p>Depositary institutions hold required and excess reserves on deposit at the Fed. They are allowed to borrow and lend their excess reserves to ensure they meet their required reserve obligations. The effective fed funds rate (EFFR) is the volume-weighted, daily traded rate of all this activity (Exhibit 1a). It is actually a market driven rate, but influenced by the Fed to ensure it remains close to the fed funds target rate (FFTR).</p>
<p>Historically, the Fed influenced interest rates via its open market operations. However, during the global financial crisis, the Fed’s quantitative easing programme injected a massive amount of liquidity into the banking system, effectively removing the structural short in fed funds and boosting excess reserves (Exhibit 1b).  The need for banks to trade fed funds declined sharply and the effectiveness of the Fed’s open market operations was significantly reduced.</p>
<p>The increase in excess reserves was an unintended consequence of quantitative easing.</p>

<p>In response to substantially lower fed funds trading activity, the Fed introduced two new monetary policy tools: interest on excess reserves (IOER), which acts as a ceiling; and the overnight reverse repo programme (ON-RRP), which acts as a floor. Since the Fed began raising rates in December 2015, it has increased its target rate, IOER and ON-RRP in tandem and by the same amounts.</p>
<h4>The Fed’s interest rate challenge:</h4>
<p>Recently, the Fed’s monetary policy model has shown signs of stress as the EFFR moved towards the top of the Fed’s target trading range and the EFFR/IOER spread narrowed to a post-global financial crisis low (Exhibit 2a). In his latest testimony, Fed chairman Jerome Powell expressed uncertainty about the reasons for the EFFR movement, exacerbating market concerns about rising funding costs, tighter liquidity conditions (Exhibit 2b) and the impact of the Fed’s balance sheet reduction.</p>
<p>The spread between IOER and the effective fund rate has narrowed to a seven- year low.</p>

</figure>
<p>Nevertheless, to ensure that EFFR continues to trade within its target range, the Fed raised the IOER by only 20 basis points (bps) while raising other rates by the customary 25bps at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in June. This unusual adjustment provides a strong signal of the Fed’s intention to prevent the EFFR breaching the IOER ceiling.</p>
<h4>Much ado about nothing?</h4>
<p>In reality, the EFFR breaching the IOER or the Fed target range should have no major operational implications; however, many market participants would view such an event negatively and question the Fed’s ability to control a historically important benchmark rate.</p>
<p>For now, it appears that the Fed’s IOER adjustment has achieved its goal, although the continued challenges of increased Treasury bill issuance and the Fed’s balance sheet reduction suggests the problem may re-emerge.  Any further deviations will trigger additional Fed actions – which could range from another adjustment of the IOER to something potentially more drastic, such as an early end to the Fed’s balance sheet reduction programme.</p>
<p>For US dollar cash investors, a hawkish Fed and tighter funding are significant positives, pushing interest rates higher and boosting returns on cash investments. As real rates approach their highest level in almost a decade and commercial paper offers a significant yield pickup over Treasuries, cash investments have re-emerged as an important asset allocation choice.</p>

<h2>July 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>The introduction of new asset management product (AMP) rules, bank liquidity rules and money market fund (MMF) redemption rules in the past two months have combined to create the most significant period of Chinese financial regulatory change in two decades.</p>
<p>While the changes are widely regarded as both necessary and important for the long term stability and safety of the Chinese financial system, the unprecedented breadth and depth of these new regulations has already had major repercussions. Banking activities and financial markets have witnessed substantial dislocations, while the secondary impact on monetary policy and economic growth are now becoming apparent.</p>
<p>In brief, the new AMP rules<sup id=""fnref:7""><a href=""#fn:7"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> ban implicit guaranteed returns, reduce leveraging, layering and pooling and require investment in (lower yielding) standard asset classes. New products launched after the introduction of the new regulations on the 27th of April 2018 must comply with them, while existing products have a transition period until end of 2020. Meanwhile, the new liquidity rules<sup id=""fnref:8""><a href=""#fn:8"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> introduced in May encourage stronger bank liquidity profiles by penalizing the use of short term wholesale funding and holdings of undesirable assets. Finally, the new MMF liquidity rules<sup id=""fnref:9""><a href=""#fn:9"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> limit T+0 redemptions to ten thousand Renminbi per investor per day, effective on 1 July 2018.</p>
<p>Lower returns and the removal of principal guarantees have greatly reduced the desirability of wealth management and trust products. The latest aggregate financing data shows a substantial decline in shadow banking activities with trust loans, entrusted loans and banker’s acceptances all sharply lower. This lack of new AMPs will have considerable implications for commercial banks’ fee revenues and profitability. Especially as competition for time deposits intensifies and issuance of certificates of deposit increases to fund the return of shadow banking debts onto bank balance sheets.</p>
<p>This has triggered several actions by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to help alleviate short term commercial bank stresses. Use of quasi-monetary policy tools remain close to record highs, in addition the central bank cut the reserve requirement rate in April to help banks repay PBoC loans and it widened the range of lower grade assets it will accept as collateral, making it easier for commercial banks to borrow from the PBoC.</p>
<p>The impact of the regulatory policy tightening is also evident in the latest Chinese economic data with fixed asset investments and industrial production noticeably weaker. In a divergence from its previous policy, the PBoC did not raise its open market operation interest rates following the June Fed rate hike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new CSRC regulatory cap on T+0 redemptions will also have little direct impact, especially as investors with larger balances can still make unlimited T+1 redemptions. But it should help reduce liquidity risks and clarify that MMF should be regarded as saving products rather than instant access cash accounts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for corporate treasures who only use time deposits and money market funds, the new AMP rules are unlikely to have any significant impact. Money market funds are already among the most heavily regulated instruments in China and will continue to offer attractive yields and operational convenience. Meanwhile, time deposit yields could move higher as commercial banks compete for stable funding. However, corporate treasurers using wealth management and trust products will need to revisit their investment strategies in order to invest in suitable products under the new regulatory regime.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while several short term challenges have quickly become apparent, the substantial long term benefits of more standardized, unified and stringent regulations will emerge as the financial industry transitions to a healthier and more stable foundation for future growth.</p>

<h2>June 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>The low (or negative) yield environment, coupled with many banks backing away from liquidity products following the introduction of Basel III, is forcing corporate treasurers to sharpen their focus on cash management.</p>
<p>However, with cash on balance sheets still at all-time highs, it looks like many treasurers are choosing to take a very conservative approach. The question is whether they can afford to stay so heavily invested in low yielding cash accounts, or if this strategy may ultimately come at too great a cost in terms of lost returns.</p>
<h4>A more effective cash management strategy</h4>
<p>It seems that many treasurers need to re-evaluate their investment strategies to meet the demands, and seize the opportunities, of an evolving rate and regulatory environment.</p>
<p>An effective strategy incorporates a clear <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/liquidity-insights/instituting-an-investment-policy"">investment policy</a>, with well-defined goals and parameters for liquidity, quality and return. An essential element of this investment planning, in our view, is <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/liquidity-insights/leveraging-the-power-of-cash-segmentation"">cash segmentation</a>.</p>
<p>In following this discipline, corporate treasurers can distinguish among Operating Cash (requiring same-day liquidity), Reserve Cash (with an investment horizon of six-to-nine months or longer) and Strategic Cash (with an investment horizon of one year or longer).</p>
<p>Once the segmentation exercise has been conducted, treasurers can choose the most appropriate investment solution to match the investment horizon of each cash segment.</p>
<h4>Ultra-short solutions</h4>
<p>As cash segmentation has grown in popularity, a sizeable ultra-short industry – including J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Global Liquidity Managed Reserves business – has developed to help service treasurers’ Reserve Cash and Strategic Cash requirements.</p>
<p>Our own <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/products/our-managed-reserves-strategy"">Managed Reserves strategy</a> has been popular with liquidity investors as a mutual fund and as a <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/products/separately-managed-accounts"">separately managed account (SMA)</a>. With exchange-traded funds (ETFs) becoming increasingly used for liquidity management, we are now able to offer this ultra-short duration solution under an exchange-traded fund (ETF) wrapper.</p>
<p>According to a Greenwich Associates report published in the first quarter of 2017 (“ETFs: Dynamic Tools for Institutional Portfolios”) 45% of institutional ETF investors are now using ETFs for liquidity management, up from 36% in 2015. We forecast a continuation of this growth as traditional bank/liquidity fund investors become more familiar with ultra-short ETFs.</p>
<p>It may make sense for treasurers to investigate this new and growing asset class, particularly given the need to review and update investment policies ahead of the impending implementation of the new European money market fund regulations.</p>
<p>However, ultra-short ETFs are not just useful tools for traditional cash investors looking to enhance the yield earned by their Reserve Cash and Strategic Cash allocations. Ultra-short ETFs should also benefit longer-term fixed income investors looking to shorten their duration positions in a rising rate environment.</p>
<p>We are currently witnessing this trend in the US, as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy. With higher rates expected across the globe, ultra-short ETF solutions should continue to gain traction.</p>
<h4>Differences between traditional mutual funds and ETFs</h4>
<p>For corporate treasurers new to ETF investing the experience should be pretty similar to trading any listed securities on exchange, as the exchange traded fund acronym suggests. Treasury investors using ETFs may also benefit from heightened portfolio and pricing transparency, with holdings typically published on the J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s ETF website daily.</p>

<h2>May 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>In April the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) continued its hawkish strategy of shadowing Federal Reserve (Fed) Rate hikes, raising rates on two of its quasi-monetary policy tools. However, later the same week, the central bank announced a distinctly dovish reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut. These apparently conflicting interest rate movements have increased market volatility and intensified uncertainty – especially for liquidity and treasury investors.</p>
<h4>What happened?</h4>
<p>The PBoC raised both its 1-year Medium Term Lending Facility (MLF) and its 14-day reverse repo rate by 5 basis points (bps) to 3.30% and 2.70% respectively (Figure 1A), increasing wholesale funding costs for commercial banks. Meanwhile the 1% RRR cut (Figure 1B) reduces the reserve ratio for large banks from 17% to 16% and for smaller banks from 15% to 14%. The RRR rate cut will release approximately CNY1.3trn, but given qualifying banks are initially required to use the funds to repay a maturing MLF of CNY900bn, the net liquidity boost will be modest and mainly impact smaller banks who do not have significant MLF loans. Nevertheless, large banks will also benefit from lower interest rate payments, as interest rates paid on reserves are significantly lower than those charged on MLF loans.</p>

<p>While the PBoC stressed that the RRR cut did not imply a change in its monetary policy stance, the central bank has previously avoided altering benchmark rates or the RRR due to their strong signaling effect. Therefore, this RRR rate should, on face value, be considered a precautionary move given recent weaker economic data, rising trade tensions and a slowdown in inflation. Meanwhile the repo and MLF rate hikes continue to signal the central bank’s desire to forestall capital outflows and encourage continued deleveraging.</p>
<h4>How will this impact treasury investors:</h4>
<p>Market driven bond and Shibor yields (Figure 2) all moved lower following the RRR announcement and yield curves have also steepened as short dated yields have declined faster than longer dated yields. Meanwhile repo rates remained relatively high due to tight wholesale funding costs and longer maturity bond markets and equity markets both rallied on the dovish signal by the central bank.</p>

</figure>
<p>For treasury investors the initial effect of the PBoC’s actions will be limited, however the secondary implications could be substantial. While elevated repo rates may cushion the short term impact, it is likely that yields on fixed income investments will decline further. A further complication is the reported easing of informal interest rate policy guidance by commercial banks that could lead to higher deposit and lending rates. Nevertheless, high quality RMB money market funds should continue to offer attractive yields by extending duration, maintaining high cash balances by investing in repo and ensuring good security by diversification.</p>
<h4>Outlook:</h4>
<p>This action by the PBoC is an important additional step on the path towards a market based monetary policy regime. Historically the high RRR rate made commercial banks insensitive to changes in policy rates; however as the RRR is gradually reduced to a more suitable level for its role as a safety net rather than a monetary policy tool, the ability of the PBoC to adopt the 7-day repo rate as its operational target becomes more achievable.</p>
<p>Finally, with economic growth slowing and future regulatory changes expected to tighten monetary conditions, it is likely the PBoC will continue to use targeted policy and quasi-policy rates to adjust the quantity and cost of liquidity to achieve its multiple, and, sometimes conflicting, goals.</p>

<h2>April 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>The wide-ranging scope of the upcoming changes to European money market fund (MMF) regulations should be enough to make most investors sit up and take notice. Quite simply, money market fund investors will need to be ready for the change, or risk losing out.</p>
<h4>Take time to adapt to the new rules</h4>
<p>We anticipate that our existing European-domiciled MMF range will transition to the new regulatory regime over the weekend of 30 November 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. This may still seem some time away, but investors will need plenty of time to adapt and work out which options are best for them under the new rules. This means starting the planning process as early as possible.</p>
<p>Fund providers have a particularly important role to play to ensure their clients have all the information they need and have plenty of time to review their investment options before their funds are converted to meet the new rules.</p>
<p>At J.P. Morgan Asset Management, we intend to write to all our MMF clients after the summer holidays, setting out the available options for their money market fund investments. Investors will then have until end of November 2018 to declare their choices.</p>
<p>MMF providers must also ensure the new regulations are formally implemented into the fund’s constitution (the Articles of Association). We will convene an extraordinary general meeting in April 2018 so that investors can vote to implement provisions on the Articles.</p>
<h4>Understand the planned fund range options</h4>
<p>The new regulations are wide ranging, but essentially they require MMF providers to make a number of changes to their funds in terms of structure, composition, valuation, liquidity requirements and information reporting.</p>
<p>Under the new European regulations, MMFs will be re-categorised into two fund types: Short-term MMFs and Standard MMs, with three structural options available to investors: Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) MMFs, Public Debt Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) MMFs (for government funds) and will create a new type of fund – Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) MMF.</p>
<p>We anticipate the following options for short-term liquidity investing available to clients, subject to regulatory approval:</p>

<h4>Don’t delay, start planning today</h4>
<p>If you are invested in European-domiciled MMFs, these funds will be re-categorised under the new regulations. At J.P. Morgan Asset Management, we aim to implement this change by 30 November 2018. Investors will need to take action to make sure they are ready for this change. They will need to vote on the Articles of Association, choose which new fund’s structures to go into, and update their internal investment policies.</p>

<p>Under new European Money Market Fund Regulations, the line-up of our liquidity fund range will be changing. However, there will be no changes to the investment profiles of our funds, or to our investment philosophy. Our <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/liquidity-insights/european-money-market-fund-reform-resource-centre"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">European Money Market Fund Resource Centre</a> gives a summary of the fund range options we intend to offer in the short-term space for USD, GBP and EUR investors. We continue to evaluate additional structural options and currencies, and will communicate with investors as these evolve.</p>
<h4>It may be a good time to update your investment policy</h4>
<p>Now is the time to think about reviewing your investment policy and decide if you need to make changes to take full advantage of all the options available under the new European Money Market Fund Regulations. The new rules require changes to our funds’ constitutional documents, so your dedicated client advisor may ask you to vote on the changes, by post, at an extraordinary general meeting. This is a functional requirement that enables the regulation to be implemented.</p>
<p>Reviewing your investment policy represents an opportunity to reconsider your risk appetite, investment objectives and portfolio constraints.</p>

<h4>You may need to review your operational procedures</h4>
<p>The characteristics of the new funds may have no implication for a corporate treasury’s existing accounting platforms or treasury workstations, but this is something that should be reviewed.</p>
<p>If a corporation is utilising a third party technology platform or bank platform to access its money market fund investments, a discussion with the relevant platform provider(s) will be important to ensure that there will be no disruption or change to this process.</p>
<h4>Make sure you have the right reporting capabilities in place</h4>
<p>Corporate treasurers may want to consider what type of additional information, if any, they will require in order to monitor the modified range of funds being offered. They will also need to think about any internal reporting requirements they need to fulfil and the timing of any information they need to receive from their fund managers.</p>
<p>Fund managers are accustomed to these types of requests, but it is recommended that treasurers speak to their dedicated client adviser to ensure that their requirements are understood and can be met.</p>
<h4>Seek advice from your advisors/auditors</h4>
<p>The new regulations will change the structure of certain short-term money market funds. For some corporate treasurers, it may be important for them to review the new fund structures from a tax and accounting perspective to ensure that they continue to provide the characteristics that are important to the organisation.</p>

<h2>February 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>China’s recent robust economic growth has confounded cynics, demonstrating that the country could successfully balance the conflicting challenges of ensuring financial stability while decelerating the growth of debt. A combination of a continued global recovery, robust local property markets and improved household consumption all helped the government achieve its 2017 growth target. At the same time, the hawkish monetary policy bias and macro prudential measures from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has started to curtail the growth of the shadow banking sector, while also reducing financial risks.</p>
<p>The pace of Chinese regulatory reforms quickened, highlighting the seriousness of the authorities in their efforts to tackle the financial imbalances facing China. Individual regulators closed loopholes and tightened controls within their industries, while under the auspices of the PBoC the main financial regulators introduced<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> new unified rules designed to reduce regulatory arbitrage and minimize the risk of a systemic crisis.</p>
<p>This background of tighter financial regulations, improved economic stability and higher interest rates allowed renminbi cash investors to enjoy high returns, a stronger currency and reduced volatility in 2017. By the end of last year, the Chinese money market fund industry saw assets under management (AUM) jump by 60% year-on-year<sup id=""fnref:5""><a href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> to a record high of CNY 7.14 trillion (USD 1.1 trillion) and represented 62% of total fund industry assets. The AUM of triple-A rated money market funds also hit a record high as the gap between CSRC and triple-A fund guidelines and yields narrowed.</p>
<p>While achieving strong growth remains important to ensure social and economic stability, the Chinese government is now confident enough to focus on the quality rather than quantity of growth, with 2018’s goals emphasizing poverty alleviation, financial stability and pollution reduction. This implies growth should moderate further as the authorities continue to pursue tighter fiscal and monetary policies to further deleverage and de-risk the financial system.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for renminbi cash investors in 2018? A more stable economy and currency should keep negative headlines at bay while continued monetary policy tightening should ensure market driven interest rates and money market fund yields remain attractive. Traditional asset management products will also benefit as investors switch from regulatory constrained trust and wealth management products.</p>
<p>Despite the optimistic outlook for the Chinese economy, tighter financial controls and higher interest rates escalate the risks of a monetary policy or regulatory mistake. Investor complacency could also be challanged if a myopic drive to deleverage the financial system triggers increased credit stress, potential downgrades or even defaults among heavily indebted issuers. Therefore cash and money market fund investors should remain vigilant and continue to focus on their key goals of liquidity and security when selecting investments, counterparties and liquidity funds.</p>

<h2>January 2018</h2>
<br/>
<p>As 2017 has drawn to a close, we look ahead to what may lie in store for euro and sterling money market fund investors in the first quarter of 2018.</p>
<h4>Eurozone sentiment is buoyed by robust growth momentum</h4>
<p>2018 marks the first time in many years that we are not flagging any near-term systemic risks for Europe. Growth momentum is now very strong and sentiment is on the up. With unemployment still trending downwards, we expect consumer confidence and spending to stay high in 2018. But as long as inflation fails to follow suit, we don’t expect rate hikes from the European Central Bank (ECB) until 2019.</p>
<p>This will continue to fuel the growth momentum in the real economy, and we are forecasting the fastest growth in 10 years for 2017. So with rates for 2018 probably locked and the ECB’s balance sheet even larger – a dynamic that is supportive for risk assets – money fund investors may need to wait another year before they benefit from higher rates in Europe.</p>
<h4>Post-Brexit fallout is clouding the UK’s outlook</h4>
<p>In the UK, Brexit continues to make its presence felt through subpar economic momentum. But post-Brexit growth, despite being relatively poor, has seen the economy continue to outperform the Bank of England’s expectations in 2017.</p>
<p>The currency-induced pick-up in inflation looks like it may well have peaked in late 2017 and should fall back towards target in 2018. The lack of wage inflation is a global phenomenon and the UK, with unemployment at multi-year lows, is no exception. Considering the Brexit overhang, we don’t expect a pick-up in wages in 2018, but it’s an important consideration for the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) when it comes to future rate hikes.</p>
<p>It’s hard to have a strong conviction on the UK economy right now, but lead indicators are clearly pointing to steady, but not spectacular, growth. This could be just enough to justify further tightening from the MPC, as expected, with the Committee’s own caveat that there are “considerable risks to the outlook from Brexit”.</p>

<h2>December 2017</h2>
<br/>
<p>The countdown to implementation of the European Money Market Fund (MMF) Regulation is well underway, with just over a year left on the clock. As that deadline approaches, we’re as committed as ever to helping our clients get to grips with their choices under the new rules.</p>
<h4>Which investment options are currently coming out on top?</h4>
<p>So far, our clients are telling us that their top choice for government investment is the public debt Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) MMF, while our credit or prime-style liquidity investors are opting for the Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) structure. Whichever option they choose, our primary focus is to move our existing fund range over to the new structures in the least disruptive way possible for our clients.</p>
<p>Complementing the public debt CNAV and LVNAV structures, we’re also planning to introduce a range of Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) short-term MMFs for clients who prefer the features offered by this structure under the new regulation, or who want to avoid the structured fees and gates that come with both the CNAV public debt and LVNAV MMFs.</p>
<h4>What about cash and cash equivalents?</h4>
<p>So what does the regulation say about MMFs treatment as cash and cash equivalents? The short answer is not a lot – much like the current rules – so we’re advising our clients to stay close to their external auditors when it comes to this topic.</p>
<p>That said, we have every reason to expect to continue offering our short-term MMFs, along with their existing focus on same-day liquidity, capital preservation and their external AAA MMF rating. Crucially, the new regulation looks set to take a more conservative line than the present one, which we believe should support the case for our short-term MMFs to be treated as cash and cash equivalent.</p>
<h4>Four practical ways we’re helping our clients</h4>
<p>We’re committed to helping clients prepare for the regulation in four practical ways. First, we’re supporting them as they weigh up the pros and cons of the fund structures presented in the new regulation. Second, we’re working closely with them as they make any necessary changes to their existing internal policies. Third, we’re helping them to review any operational set-up and reporting requirements. And fourth we’re doing everything we can to pave the way for a smooth transition for our clients as they implement their new fund offering.</p>
<h4>Where to find out more</h4>
<p>We’ve designed our <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/liquidity-insights/european-money-market-fund-reform-resource-centre"" target=""_blank"">European Money Market Fund Reform Resource Centre</a> to give investors easy access to our latest thinking on the new regulation, with white papers on topics like investment policy, as well as helpful FAQs and summaries. As the implementation date draws nearer, we’re also continuing to support our clients by holding informative roundtables and presentations at key locations around the world as they get ready for the new regulation.

<h2>November 2017</h2>
<br/>
<p>In recent years, Chinese money market funds (MMFs) have thrived thanks to their ability to generate attractive yields vs. alternative investments (including bank deposits) and the convenience they offer investors. In fact, since June 2012, the number of individual MMFs has risen from 72 to 372, while assets under management have increased 13-fold to CNY 5.3 trillion (USD 815 billion) – a size that makes the industry systemically important<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>A move up in assets has driven a move down the quality spectrum</h4>
<p>But this robust growth been accompanied by a less welcome phenomenon. As MMF yields have declined due to lower investment yields, there has been a broad move by fund managers to boost dwindling returns by increasing leverage and investment concentration, while also taking a step down the credit quality spectrum to more illiquid investments. As a result, credit and liquidity risks have risen at a time when domestic defaults and cashflow volatility are on the up.</p>
<h4>The three core goals of new CSRC MMF rules</h4>
<p>On 1 September, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) moved to address these problems by introducing new mutual fund guidelines. The new rules set out three core goals for MMFs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to reduce systemic risk concerns created by the rapid growth of MMFs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to limit liquidity risk caused by high investor concentrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to control credit risk by reducing MMFs’ ability to invest in lower-quality investments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>The rules came into force on the 1 October 2017 and give managers a six-month grace period to achieve compliance. But what do they really mean for the China’s rapidly growing MMF industry?</p>
<h4>Part of a broader regulatory process</h4>
<p>Taking a step back to look at the bigger picture, these rules coincide with recent efforts of the government and regulatory authorities to reduce the rate of growth of debt, deleverage the economy and avoid triggering a systemic financial crisis. The new CSRC MMF rules should help reduce the risk of a loss of confidence in the industry by encouraging funds to be more conservative by holding higher levels of liquidity, investing in better-quality assets and having shorter durations. However, the new MMF rules will also reduce the potential yields that MMFs can offer and the ability of individual fund managers to significantly outperform.</p>
<h4>No impact on our own MMFs</h4>
<p>The tighter limits on credit quality and concentration should have no major impact on our investment strategies or on the yields of our own funds because they already operate within the tighter internal J.P. Morgan Asset Management investment limits and AAA credit rating limits imposed by Fitch credit rating agency.</p>

<h2>October 2017</h2>
<br/>
<p>In today’s volatile, low-yield world, where corporate treasurers are working harder than ever to generate the returns they need from short-term cash, ultra-short-duration strategies may represent an increasingly attractive proposition.</p>
<p>The current environment is driving a tangible shift in the way clients think about their investment strategy, with investors with a longer investment horizon and a higher tolerance for volatility increasingly segmenting a portion of their more stable cash balances in pursuit of additional returns. Fund options for cash that fit this profile tend to sit outside of traditional money market funds and are typically managed in a variable net asset value (VNAV) structure, where the focus is on total rate of return.</p>
<h4>Restrained rate rises for now</h4>
<p>In the short term, we expect to see relatively restrained rate rises, but we still believe that the current thesis of low relative rates remains intact. Against this kind of backdrop, ultra-short-duration strategies can look even more attractive when looking at the potential incremental return vs. cash alternatives, which are essentially locked to base rates.</p>
<h4>Responding to the short-term cash challenge</h4>
<p>Our range of funds that apply our innovative ultra-short-duration Managed Reserves strategy in various jurisdictions, respond to the challenges facing corporate treasurers, such as our sterling-denominated fund, launched last summer. Investing primarily in short-term investment-grade sterling debt securities, the fund is specially designed for investors with longer investment horizons who are looking for a higher level of return than money market funds can deliver, while still aiming to preserve principal over a longer time horizon.</p>
<p>All the funds in the strategy come with a maximum portfolio duration of one year (with a three-year final maturity limit) vs. 60 days weighted average maturity (WAM) (with a 13-month final maturity limit) for our AAA rated funds. What’s more, the sterling-denominated fund has the flexibility to invest down as far as BBB (as opposed to A) and is structured as a VNAV vehicle and is therefore marked-to-market.</p>
<h4>Targeting enhanced returns in a low-rate world</h4>
<p>A low-rate environment doesn’t mean you can’t make money. In a world where the neutral rate is far lower than historical levels, an ultra-short duration strategy structure can give investors greater potential to benefit from enhanced returns. In addition, strategies that aim to beat the return of liquidity funds by 20-40bps may appear to be setting their sights low in a “normal” environment. The current low-yield environment is far from normal, but if it’s here to stay – for now, at least – these low-volatility, incremental returns undoubtedly have the potential to make a big difference to corporate treasurers.</p>

<h2>September 2017</h2>
<br/>
<p>Two months on from the finalisation of the European MMF Regulation, it’s all too easy to feel that implementation in January 2019 is a long way off. But, as a treasurer, taking a proactive approach to thinking ahead can position you to make the most of the opportunities that the regulation will bring. So what do you need to do? And, crucially, when do you need to do it?</p>
<p>There’s still plenty of time to tackle the implications of European MMF regulation for your organisation, but it’s important to start planning now. Let’s break things down into three manageable chunks, beginning with the steps you need to consider between now and the end of this year.</p>
<p>First, start by getting to grips with the detail of the regulation itself. As part of this process, you’ll need to make sure all internal stakeholders understand exactly what the regulation entails and what the changes mean for your organisation. You’ll also need to define the cash that could fall within the scope of the regulation.</p>
<p>What’s next? In the first half of 2018, think about reviewing your investment policy and decide if you need to make changes in order to take full advantage of all the options available under the new rules. Some of the new rules require changes to the funds’ constitutional documents, so your MMF client advisor may ask you to vote on the changes by post at an extraordinary general meeting. This is a functional requirement that enables the regulation to be implemented. You’ll also need to think through any implications for accounting platforms and treasury workstations, and engage with trading portals and sweep platforms as appropriate.</p>
<p>And finally, in the second half of 2018, you must be ready to communicate your decision on the options that best suit your cash requirements, as MMF sponsors will likely be looking to convert their funds to the new regulation during the final quarter of 2018, ahead of the deadline. This is also your chance to test and review all changes to your internal processes and system ahead of implementation in January 2019.</p>
<p>We’re very happy to help you prepare for meetings with your board or senior management. You’re also welcome to contact your MMF client advisor or explore the implications of the regulation at <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/liquidity-insights/european-money-market-fund-reform-resource-centre"" target=""_blank"">J.P.

<br/>
<p>For corporate treasurers, a well-articulated cash investment policy is the vital first step towards bridging the gap between shifting market circumstances and investment goals. But the best investment policies also need the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.</p>
<h4>Stay up to speed with market changes</h4>
<p>With market expectations pointing to the end of quantitative easing purchases by the European Central Bank and a potential interest rate rise from the Bank of England, corporate treasurers face one overriding challenge: to ensure their investment policy is flexible enough to allow practitioners to respond to higher interest rates. Even in an environment where rates are changing and the yield curve is adjusting, investors may have opportunities to take advantage of these movements.</p>
<h4>Seize opportunities as they happen</h4>
<p>More respondents are updating their investment policies to ensure that they provide the flexibility needed in the new rate and regulatory environment, with our recent <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/mod/themes/ins/2017-peerview-survey?utm_source=treasurytoday&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jpmorgancomliquiditypeerview&amp;utm_content=blog"" target=""_blank"">2017 Investment PeerView™ Survey</a> showing that half of all respondents plan to change their investment policy in the next 6-12 months for this very reason. However, more than three-quarters of respondents said it would take a moderate or significant effort to implement a change – suggesting that planning well in advance makes absolute sense.</p>
<p>A good investment policy will most likely prioritise cash segmentation and give treasurers the flexibility to take advantage of different investment solutions. For example, investors may achieve an improved yield by investing further out the yield curve or they might be able to place cash in shorter-dated instruments to benefit from spread differentials. Indeed, PeerView found that more than 70% of respondents can forecast their cash flows out for a month or longer, while just under half can forecast out a quarter or longer.</p>
<h4>Keep it flexible</h4>
<p>Setting out a solid cash investment policy is just the start of the story for corporate treasurers. Higher interest rates should create more opportunities for treasurers to exploit – for those that can segment cash as effectively as possible. That’s where a dynamic, flexible investment policy can really pay off.</p>

<h4>What is the central concept of the Cash Management University?</h4>
<p>The Cash Management University (CMU) is a unique event designed for treasurers and senior finance professionals. It has been attracting hundreds of delegates from all over the world, who come together for two days to focus on the subject of cash and liquidity management as a performance lever for businesses. Over the years this annual event has established itself as a prominent fixture in the world of cash management. The CMU provides an opportunity for treasurers from all over the world to exchange ideas and experiences with their peers and key industry players and to get to know the latest in the business using pan-European and international case studies.</p>
<h4>Tell us a little more about the content of a typical Cash Management University. Also, give us a flavour of the companies represented.</h4>
<p>Over the years we have been using the feedback of our delegates to constantly adapt the content and the structure of the Cash Management University. For example, in 2016 the event marked a substantial change in format. We adapted the 9<sup>th</sup> CMU in order to preserve those features that make the event unique, but also moved away from a ‘seminar-like’ setup. We have been encouraging delegates to co-create the agenda with us so that their engagement becomes a core value of the event. In this spirit, last year’s Cash Management University comprised of smaller workshop sessions on various industry ‘hot-topics’ like fintechs, reverse factoring and treasury robotics. We really do our best to provide unique added value to all our delegates.</p>
<p>As for the participating companies, BNP Paribas Cash Management, alongside other group business lines, has been bringing together major players in the cash management business. For example, the ninth Cash Management University received 260 treasury professionals, 100 group treasurers and leading treasury experts from 20 countries representing organisations like IATA, Orange, Merck, BASF, Accipiter, KPMG and SWIFT. Several of these delegates were more than just participants and took an active part in the plenary sessions or workshops of the event. This afforded them the opportunity to network with their peers as well as representatives from BNP Paribas.</p>
<h4>2017 will mark a decade for the Cash Management University. What’s in store for delegates to the tenth anniversary edition?</h4>
<p>The motto of the tenth Cash Management University is ‘EXCELerate – from knowledge to decision making’. It will be a revamped and modernised event, the first to be organised at Chateauform Paris, centrally located at Avenue George V in Paris. Instead of two full days, the event this year will be held over two half days (on 30<sup>th</sup> November and 1<sup>st</sup> December 2017), giving ample networking opportunity to delegates. The programme will consist of topics at the top of treasurers’ agendas (cyber-security, fintechs, the future of treasury). I am happy to announce that along with Pierre Fersztand, Global Head of BNP Paribas Cash Management, we will have the pleasure of hosting the CEO of BNP Paribas, Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, who will open the second day of the event. The Group Chief Economist, William De Vijlder and Philippe Henrotte from HEC will talk about the global economic outlook and there will be a host of workshops and roundtables around the most important topics of the day. Additionally, there will be a special session dedicated to the second edition of our thought leadership report, Journeys to Treasury, which we are co-producing with the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT), PwC, and SAP.</p>
<p>In 2016, delegates were invited to select a word to summarise the ninth Cash Management University and ‘great’ was the winner. We are committed to improving the experience this year.</p>

<p><em>Capital controls are a function of both political and economic policy over which corporates have little or no say. The growth agendas of certain countries within Asia have loosened these controls to an extent, but recent slowdowns have seen the rules revisited. So, is your cash still trapped?</em></p>
<p>In a world where cash visibility, liquidity and sovereign risk remain major themes for international corporates, capital controls are a concern.</p>
<p>Corporates operate across a landscape of complex local and home market regulations where they generate and hold cash overseas. “In countries where inter-company lending, stringent capital frameworks, foreign exchange and taxation are regulated, they become key considerations for the repatriation of cash,” notes Kee Joo Wong, Asia Pacific Regional Head of Global Liquidity &amp; Cash Management at HSBC. “This is often misinterpreted as a barrier to repatriation and is commonly referred to as ‘restricted cash’ or, more commonly, ‘trapped cash’.”</p>
<p>Whilst moving cash on capital account tends to be troublesome, moving commercial account cash is generally permitted by regulations. ‘Trapped’ or economic restriction impacts corporates on an intra-day, daily, quarterly or annual basis and there is a need to have good forecasting processes to counter the inefficiencies. All capital controls exist for good reason. But these reasons are subject to change as domestic, regional and global macro-economic conditions evolve and hence it is extremely important to understand the driving forces for an efficient plan, says Sandip Patil, Managing Director and Region Head, Global Liquidity and Investments, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Their primary purpose in China, for example, has been to encourage inflows but put the brakes on any likelihood of a runaway drawdown of the country’s foreign currency reserves, whilst at the same time maintaining a relatively stable RMB/USD exchange rate.</p>
<h3 id=""market-forces"">Market forces</h3>
<p>In November 2016, the Financial Times reported that Chinese authorities (PBoC and SAFE) had introduced “stricter vetting procedures” for China-based companies seeking to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions. Dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments by foreign investors were also subjected to tighter scrutiny, it said.</p>
<p>In January 2017, Chinese regulators started preventing banks from shifting RMB out of the country as part of their clampdown on loopholes under the country’s strict new capital controls regime. Not written down but verbally ‘agreed’ with banks, this so-called ‘window guidance’ was not codified in law and so theoretically makes it easier to turn the transfer tap on again as needed.</p>
<p>But RMB, in China’s push for liberalisation and internationalisation, is up against the vagaries of the global market. Since around 2015, the Chinese currency has been facing pressure to depreciate against the US dollar. In 2016, the value of RMB depreciated over 6% against the US currency. This is why the PBoC took steps to slow down and manage that decline by buying RMB. In doing so, it depleted its foreign currency reserve – from US$4trn to US$3trn.</p>
<p>Now, as the SEC pushes tentatively forwards with its rate rise cycle in the US, and the PBoC shows unwillingness to tighten monetary policy in the shadow of a Chinese economic slowdown, once more RMB is subject to downward market pressure.</p>
<p>According to Dr Ming Huang, Professor of Finance at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, quoted in a report by Trans-Pacific View journalist, Mercy Kuo, the Chinese central bank is “neither willing to let the RMB suffer a drastic decline due to considerations of financial stability and international trade frictions, nor willing to let its foreign currency reserve drop down to dangerous low levels”.</p>
<h3 id=""for-the-long-term"">For the long term?</h3>
<p>Such a scenario leaves the macro-economic risks including capital outflow, says Patil. Hence, it is not unexpected to see “precautionary measures”. However, with stronger fundamentals on commercial flows, the restrictions tend to change and hence, need dynamic calibration. With China’s 19th National Party Congress anticipated for November this year, Dr Huang expects capital controls to remain in place at least until then, “and possibly for much longer”.</p>
<p>Ong Shiwei, Global Head for Cash Liquidity Management, Standard Chartered, acknowledges that trapped cash has been a long-standing issue in parts of Asia. And whilst there may be regulatory changes that deepen the challenge in individual countries in the short term, she agrees that in the longer term, “this issue is not going away”.</p>
<p>“Countries that have been liberal in the past, such as Australia and Singapore are likely to remain as such, while cash will continue to be trapped in countries such as Vietnam, Sri Lanka and India,” Shiwei opines. Similarly, she does not expect to see any fundamental change in semi-regulated countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where foreign currency can be moved cross-border but local currency is retained in-country.</p>
<p>“Recent trends show that we may be entering an era of protectionism,” comments Shiwei. She recognises that the countries that have been opening up, China being a leading example, are indeed taking a step back and looking into a long-term path towards liberalisation of their regulations and currencies.</p>
<h3 id=""working-within-the-rules"">Working within the rules</h3>
<p>In light of volatile market conditions and pressure on emerging markets, protectionist regulations are typically expected to defend the market forces. Although Patil does not necessarily see this sustain for long, there is always a negative impact on trade and commercial flows till the protectionist mindset prevails.</p>
<p>Wong argues that regulations have been influenced by trade and monetary policy, foreign exchange reserves and interest rate differentials. “Understanding these regulations actually provides a window of opportunity for corporates to move funds with conditionality,” he notes.</p>
<p>Of course, the issues of liquidity and restricted cash have always been pertinent considerations for corporates, Wong adds. Treasurers have particularly had to address the issue of restricted cash in circumstances where their cash balances are sizeable, the means of alternate funding for the group are limited, the costs of borrowing are expensive, and of course where repatriation costs are prohibitive.</p>
<p>Indeed, for corporates in Asia, the key markets of China and India are notably high on the agenda for cash repatriation. The size of these markets coupled with prolonged periods of growth have led corporates to build up significant surplus cash balances, says Wong. As a result, he says treasurers are focused on understanding and adapting to evolving local and national regulations such as restrictions on capital accounts, repatriation caps related to ownership equity, and evidencing trade-backed documentation.</p>
<h3 id=""seeking-answers"">Seeking answers</h3>
<p>However, anecdotal evidence, in the form of a frank conversation with Treasury Today Asia, suggest that some banks are less than helpful with their corporate clients when it comes to managing their trapped cash, the reason being that those banks would rather keep that cash on their local balance sheets than shift it into massive pools in regional hubs.</p>
<p>This is just anecdotal evidence but some may say there’s no smoke without fire and if some banks are not making best effort to move corporate cash to where it best serves its owners, then trapped cash really is what it says it is – and corporate treasurers must remain vigilant for optimal solutions.</p>
<p>For the time being, foreign MNCs in particular will be compelled to use traditional methods for capital repatriation to the corporate HQ or elsewhere. These methods, such as creating dividends, royalties and management fees may, in certain circumstances, be augmented by procedures such as intercompany lending. “Interest rate optimisation also remains important to leverage the value of trapped cash,” notes Shiwei, “even if the capital is inaccessible outside of the country in which it was generated.”</p>
<p>It is a slightly different story for Asian MNCs. Here, trapped cash is a lower priority as companies are typically looking to develop a deep regional presence, and therefore are happier to maintain balances in-country for ongoing investment. It is worth noting that this scenario is less likely with cash trapped in other regions, such as Africa or Latin America, says Shiwei.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-clever"">Getting clever</h3>
<p>The fundamental risks of trapped cash, referred to at the start of this article, are forcing a corporate response as each jurisdiction takes steps to protect its own interest. “We are seeing increasing demand amongst customers for techniques to reduce trapped cash, not only for liquidity management purposes, but also to reduce sovereign risk,” comments Shiwei. “In addition, treasurers are seeking to simplify their cash management structures and rationalise bank relationships and accounts to optimise visibility and control as far as possible.”</p>
<p>Although remedies for trapped cash are somewhat limited, the creativity of the treasurer has nonetheless driven the implementation of investment policies capable of reaching across the countries of operation, says Wong. Establishing visibility and control of cash through information and data platforms offers clear advantages, whilst adopting formal liquidity and foreign exchange management strategies has enabled treasurers to automate physical sweeping in less regulated markets with yield interest enhancement for residual balances.</p>
<p>Alternate means, through collateralised cross-border funding such as deposit pledged loans, are also now being explored by the market, he adds. It is true to that some businesses are funding their China business from offshore capital, adds Patil. As long as China continues to be a manufacturing engine of the world, he feels such alternate models will always be experimented within the scope of defined regulations.</p>
<h3 id=""tackling-the-problem"">Tackling the problem</h3>
<p>“The phrase trapped cash has a negative connotation but sometimes, it can be a less material issue financially,” argues Patil. Malaysia is seeking to reposition its economy in the face of current economic climate. With regulatory changes, the movement of cash is not as free as it was, he notes. Exporters are required now to repatriate dollars, partially convert to local currency and hold special accounts to take these actions. “Some of the changes increased trapped cash problems in Asia,” he notes. “It is not that the problem cannot be solved at all. There are flexibilities that the government has allowed ie deserving exceptions.” For corporates, as is the case in China, working with the banks and the Malaysian regulators can facilitate an easing of the flow, “so long as the intentions are clear and trust can be built”.</p>
<p>India is unlikely to see significant change in its status as a trapped cash market, says Patil. Domestically, the market is stable, the country’s financials are improving and it’s a growth market, he notes. From a cross-border perspective cash continues to be trapped: “It was trapped, it is trapped and is likely to be trapped for quite some time.” However, there are always options to use liquidity optimally locally and reduce costs/improve yields.</p>
<p>But thinking laterally, the net profits generated by corporates here can be deployed for the benefit of the local business allowing companies to grow more rapidly. The same growth story is happening in Indonesia, notes Patil. He does not feel companies need to worry too much about trapped cash under such positive circumstances.</p>
<h3 id=""is-it-really-a-problem"">Is it really a problem?</h3>
<p>Indeed, if there is no material use for the cash and if it can be used to grow the domestic business faster, then clearly companies are not suffering from “the trapped cash problem as much”, Patil comments. And in certain circumstances, as is the case in Malaysia and China, working with the regulators and convincing them of company’s core objectives with that cash can secure approval for exceptions. Here, even with the likely conditions applied to such easements, more freedom can be enjoyed than would otherwise be available.</p>
<p>Better yet, the experience of trapped cash pushes companies to be more efficient, he argues. This sometimes leads to beneficial structural changes in the organisation. Where, for example, centralisation of treasury at a regional level is not possible because of capital controls, companies presiding over multiple legal entities in-country can bring these together. Clearly this requires flexibility with a consolidated treasury policy but this enables the creation of a single pool of liquidity across participants, and presents a case for consolidating banks in the process.</p>
<p>For Shiwei, techniques such as payments of behalf of (POBO) and receivables on behalf of (ROBO) offer the potential for a new approach to managing cross-border liquidity and even tackling trapped cash.</p>
<p>There are broadly two types of POBO and ROBO, she explains. The more popular approach is the funded scenario, with intercompany positions often implemented in conjunction with virtual accounts. “Realistically, this is only achievable in liberal economies,” she says.</p>
<p>A second approach in this mould is an agency or pre-funded concept which, if applied appropriately, could be a way of alleviating cash being trapped at all. “For example, rather than collecting receipts locally, a company may choose to invoice and instruct the payer to pay into an offshore account,” Shiwei explains. Clearly there may be some tax, documentation and service or management fee implications here, but in her view, such an approach represents a workable strategy for minimising trapped cash, alongside other techniques.</p>
<h3 id=""a-wider-conversation"">A wider conversation</h3>
<p>The overarching need is for improved visibility, control, yield and, in turn, working capital and forecasting efficiency. The treasurer is in the front and centre of the response to this. However, it is a big ask of one function to drive such sweeping changes.</p>
<p>“The scope for strategic footprint expansion has a wider reach and should also include reference to aspects such as the geopolitical environment, foreign exchange controls, trade policies, inter-company and legal structures,” warns Wong. In such a case, he feels treasury is only one component of the corporate’s consideration when tackling the issue trapped cash.</p>
<p>However, with Patil’s view that the general status of capital controls is “not about to change significantly in Asia in the near future”, treasury’s input is vital. “Just because there is trapped cash, it does not mean a company should give up. There are lots of positive changes they can make and treasury’s role should be front and centre.”</p>

<h2>July 2017</h2>
<br/>
<p>For Australian cash investors, a multi-year run of attractive returns from domestic short-maturity investments has ended as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates to a record low, the Australian dollar weakened from three-decade highs and domestic commercial banks’ demand for time deposits declined due to new restrictions imposed by Basel III.</p>
<p>Caught between the challenges of low wage growth and slow economic growth versus elevated house prices and high consumer indebtedness, it is likely the RBA will keep base interest rates unchanged for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate hikes have already reduced the RBA/Fed spread to just 0.25% from their peak of 4.50%, and could soon turn this spread negative if they continue.</p>
<p>Lower onshore interest rates, lower ratings for Australian “Big Four” banks and fewer available counterparties pose challenges for Australian treasurers with Australian dollar cash to invest. However, with US Libor yields at their highest in almost a decade, treasurers with US dollar assets, or the ability to hold unhedged or hedged investments, will find that the opportunities to diversify beyond the domestic market and enjoy higher offshore interest rates have become significantly more attractive.</p>
<p>Implications of a US dollar rising rates environment, together with regulatory developments relating to US on-shore money market funds were recently discussed in <a href=""http://blog.jpmorganinstitutional.com/2017/06/money-in-motion/"" target=""_blank"">‘Money in motion’</a> from J.P.

<h2>June 2017</h2>
<br/>
<p>In the early months of 2017, nearly 400 CIOs, treasurers and other senior decision-makers – each representing a unique entity and from all sectors of the global economy – responded to the J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup> survey.</p>
<p>Here are some key findings from the survey:</p>
<h4>Investment in money market funds still strong</h4>
<p>Nearly 40% of respondents cited money market funds (MMFs) as their chosen vehicle for money moved off a bank balance sheet – by far the most popular placement.</p>
<h4>Regulatory pressures</h4>
<p>Respondents are grappling with the implementation of money market reform in the U.S. and the approach of reform in Europe, as well as the effects of Basel III around the globe. In Europe, 44% of respondents said they need more time and/or information before deciding on a preferred MMF structure.</p>
<h4>Investment policy changes</h4>
<p>More respondents are updating their investment policies. Notably, 48% of respondent policies now permit floating NAV funds, up from 32% in 2015.</p>
<h4>Shifting rate environment, search for yield</h4>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they will select money market funds for their cash investments if bank deposit rates lag.</p>
<h4>Keener need for cash segmentation</h4>
<p>Cash segmentation is increasingly important. More than 70% of respondents can forecast their cash flows out for a month or longer. </p>
<h4>Moving back into prime funds</h4>
<p>Only 37% of U.S.-based respondents are currently invested in a prime money market fund, down from 63% in 2015. A majority transitioned assets to a government money market fund in the wake of new SEC 2a-7 rules. Over 50% of U.S. investors who transitioned assets from a prime to a government MMF cited comfort level with floating NAV and gates/fees as the primary factor in reconsidering prime. Among respondents who transitioned assets out of prime MMFs, nearly half would consider moving back if prime offered an excess yield of between 15 basis points and 50 basis points.</p>
<h4>Conclusion: Partnership and PeerView</h4>
<p>In today’s challenging rate and regulatory environment, investors will be looking for strong investment partners who can help them understand the implications of new regulations and fund structures, offer guidance on cash segmentation, and provide insights into the global rate outlook. Never has it been more important for financial decision-makers to understand how their peers are positioning portfolios for the coming changes.</p>

<br/>
<p>Historically, monitoring the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC’s) monetary policy was relatively challenging due to opaque monetary policy meetings and limited communication from policymakers. Fortunately, the central bank’s limited set of interest rate tools meant that interpreting PBoC changes was relatively simple. By using a combination of interest rates (deposit rates, lending rates and reserve retirement ratio) and influence (window guidance and loan targets), the PBoC could determine the cost and quantity of money available to domestic, mainly state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>However, the proliferation of financial instruments triggered by interest rate liberalisation, combined with the rapid growth of non-bank financial institutions and huge growth in the shadow banking market, has made the task of implementing monetary policy significantly more difficult in recent years. Consequently, interpreting PBoC policy has also become more challenging.</p>
<p>Attempts by the PBoC to balance the government’s requirement for growth and stability with the need to deleverage and mitigate financial risks have led to a trifurcation of PBoC monetary policy across traditional, quasi and regulatory methods. Traditional monetary policy tools remain, but are less significant and little used. Use of quasi monetary policy tools, including the Medium Term Lending Facility (MLF) and Standing Lending Facility (SLF), has expanded rapidly, with the PBoC manipulating multiple programs, tenors and interest rates to fine tune market liquidity. Finally, the central bank's regulatory monetary policy (exemplified by macro prudential assessment and the new unified regulations) is forcing banks and other financial instructions to adjust their liquidity and interest rate requirements.</p>
<p>While these changes should reduce market risk and complexity, in the short term they have created more volatility and uncertainty for investors. Prudence in selecting investments remains important, as does a focus on security and liquidity.</p>

<br/>
<p>In the depths of the credit crunch, corporate treasurers fought to preserve capital and maintain the right amount of liquidity for their organisations. Now, with money markets back on a more even keel, but short-term interest rates still close to zero, many treasurers are shifting their focus to analysing cash flow to identify surplus cash – and proactive strategies to make that cash work harder for their organisations.</p>
<p>When it comes to surplus cash, every business has different needs, and different timeframes. For example, an organisation might consistently hold a core of cash on its balance sheet – year in, year out. It might need access to another pool of cash every six months to pay tax bills or dividends. And it might need to tap into other pools of cash for investment, but for much shorter timeframes.</p>
<p>Categorising – or segmenting – each of these different pools of cash can help organisations to rank their priorities in terms of access, security and yield for cash across the whole business. Formally allocating cash in this way enables treasurers to set out a crystal clear investment strategy for each different segment. This can help ensure that the business has access to cash whenever it needs it, while still having the power to make the most of investment opportunities.</p>
<p>But treasurers don’t just want to maximise returns; they also strive to minimise the volatility of those returns. This is where our range of Managed Reserves Strategies comes in. Launched in August 2016, our Sterling Managed Reserves Strategy – the latest addition to the range – is aimed at investors with longer-term investment horizons who are looking for additional returns above AAA-rated money market funds, while carefully managing risk.</p>
<p>We can help you maximise opportunity by segmenting cash and leveraging solutions across the full ultra-short spectrum.</p>

<p>Walid Shuman opened proceedings by identifying the key challenges in managing USD flows globally: control, visibility, time zones, regulations and cost/efficiency.</p>
<p>The presentation emphasised that a myriad of opportunities exist to most effectively manage your USD and optimise returns on your cash. With the multitude of investment options, irrespective of a centralised or decentralised treasury structure, it is important to work with your banking providers to understand what solutions best enable your company to optimise its cash.</p>
<p>Shuman recommended corporates should “speak with their banking partners to source advice on whether a centralised or decentralised model makes more sense and where to locate the company’s US dollars.”</p>
<p>BNP Paribas regularly receives questions from its clients on structure types such as:</p>
<p><em>“Can I centralise my USD accounts globally in the US and manage my payments and collections worldwide centrally?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Could this structure type (centralised/decentralised) work for my company and, if so, what are the pros/cons?”</em></p>
<p>For some companies a centralised structure in the US works very efficiently and achieves all of the benefits without losing any local advantages.</p>
<h3 id=""the-global-functional-currency"">The global functional currency… yield generating currency</h3>
<p>James Santoro discussed the question of centralised vs decentralised structures and the three key pillars of any investment decision, namely liquidity, yield and risk. Please see the table below. He also spoke about Basel III and how banks, such as BNP Paribas, are dealing with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement.</p>

<p>The presentation also explained that not all liquidity is valued equally by banks. As Santoro explained, “The ability to provide banks with additional transactions or the ability to place funds ‘out along the curve’ will translate into the highest yields.”</p>

<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Treasury considerations for optimising USD structures</h2>

<p>Jan Rottiers moved the conversation into the area of centralisation and decentralisation enablers and how the two approaches will impact the cash pooling (notional and/or physical) solutions available: “Centralisation is not a goal in itself,” he explained.</p>
<p>The presentation concluded by revisiting the three key questions posed at the opening of the webinar:</p>
<h5>What are best practices for establishing USD cash management structures worldwide?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Degree of centralisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key drivers and considerations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost/benefit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>What opportunities and benefits can be gained by managing USD more efficiently?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optimise yield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost efficiencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-economic benefits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Are centralised treasury structures or decentralised structures better for increasing investment returns on USD?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opportunities exist, irrespective of structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralised structure – products that enable ‘aggregating’ cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralised structure – products/providers that value incremental cash.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Asia Pacific is generally regarded as a complex place to do business, especially when compared to the largely standardised markets of the United States and Europe. With each country in Asia Pacific at a different stage of development, with its own regulatory environment, market practices and investment instruments, this complexity manifests itself in many forms, but one area where the challenge is most acute for corporate treasurers is short-term investing. The need then to develop an investment policy that fits the Asian market and not simply import this from Europe or the US is crucial.</p>
<p>The policy should be drafted in such a way that it maintains the investment philosophy of the company’s headquarters, aligns with the regional office’s strategy, and accounts for local practice. To do this a holistic approach needs to be taken; marrying together the local knowledge of the teams on the ground with the overall investment objectives of the headquarters. Drafting the policy in this way will also provide uniformity across the region and ensure that the local teams are comfortable with what they are doing, empowering them to operate efficiently and invest fully.</p>
<p>For more information and guidance on how to ensure that your investment policy is fit for purpose in Asia Pacific, read the <a ""="""" href=""/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/built-to-fit-a-bespoke-cash-investment-policy-for-asia-pacific-ttsf?utm_source=ttweb&amp;utm_campaign=march-totm&amp;utm_medium=url"">‘Built to fit: a bespoke cash investment policy for Asia Pacific’</a> article, which features an exclusive Q&amp;A session with metals giant Rio Tinto, whose treasury team outlines why putting in place a robust framework to guide the investment of its short-term cash holdings has been such a key area of their focus.</p>

<p>The <em>Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Money Market Funds</em> is a big name with some big implications for the way that money market funds in Europe are likely to be classified and structured.</p>
<p>This regulation is now well on its way to final approval in the coming weeks, which will start the clock ticking on an implementation period for MMFs managers – 18 months for existing funds and 12 months for new funds. For investors, the regulation provides a high degree of optionality for investing short-term cash.</p>
<p>There are two types of MMFs and three structural options from which to choose. Under the new rules, MMFs must be classified as either short-term or standard MMFs. Short-term funds are those that keep the existing conservative investment restrictions currently set out under the ESMA<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. Short-Term Money Market Fund definition. Meanwhile, Standards MMFs reflect the existing ESMA Money Market Fund definition.</p>
<p>When it comes to structure, short-term MMFs can be set up as Public Debt Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV), Low Volatility NAV (LVNAV) MMFs or Variable NAV (VNAV) MMFs. Conversely, standard MMFs can only be structured as VNAV.</p>
<p>As with any new regulatory reform, there’s a lot to take in – and some important decisions to make. We’re here to guide you through the implications step by step.</p>

<p>The Chinese Renminbi (CNY) is the worst performing Asian currency this year, down 5.67% vs. the USD. This marks the third year of declines with the red-back hitting an 8 year low. The pace of depreciation has actually increased in recent months with the currency lower by 1.94% in November this year as investors accelerate capital outflows to take advantage of better offshore opportunities whilst avoiding low onshore rates and further depreciation. In response, the government has introduced new capital controls and strengthened enforcement of existing ones. The combination of a weaker currency and new controls is creating significant challenges for Renminbi cash investors.</p>

<p>With Basel III set to change how banks view deposits there is an increasing interest amongst corporates in off-balance sheet solutions such as Money Market Funds (MMFs). Money market funds are an attractive option to corporates because of the safety and liquidity they offer, as well as the ability to invest across a broad spectrum of highly-rated assets.</p>
<p>However, the MMF industry in Asia is young; meaning that knowledge of how funds operate is limited in the corporate community, especially when compared to more developed markets such as the US and the EU. Corporate treasurers need to make sure they understand the differences between money market funds and how they operate in each market as characteristics and risks of money market funds can vary substantially.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, publicly available information relating to money market funds can be quite restricted. We advise that companies should not necessarily opt for the largest fund with the best yield, but consider a fund which has a good track record, has been in the market a long time, in addition to having the required resources in place to provide thorough portfolio management and quality credit research.</p>

<p>In December 2015, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced the introduction of new guidelines for domestic money market funds. These guidelines, which came into force on February 1, 2016, represent the most significant and comprehensive changes to the rules governing Chinese money market funds since the industry was established in 2004. The new guidelines aim to reduce risk, increase liquidity, improve disclosure and encourage more proactive credit control by the fund manager. They also should help improve standardization and availability of information, and bring Chinese money market funds more closely in line with Western money market fund guidelines.</p>
<p>For institutional-focused funds with AAA ratings, the impact of the new guidelines will be negligible; that is because rating agency guidelines have significantly tighter restrictions. For the much larger retail money market fund sector, the new guidelines will increase liquidity while reducing credit and interest rate risk. Whilst the new rules improve disclosure standards and encourage more proactive credit control by the fund manager, they will also negatively impact fund yields and the ability of fund managers to outperform their peers.</p>
<p>To hear more about the new guidelines for China’s domestic money market funds, read the <a href=""http://image.gim.jpmorgan.com/lib/fe92137277640d7f72/m/2/JPM32766PrimerMoneymarketreforminChina.pdf"" target=""_blank"">‘Money market reform in China’</a> whitepaper by Aidan Shevlin, Head of Asia Pacific Liquidity Fund Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

<h2>October 2016</h2>
<br/>
<p>Basel III is set to dramatically change how banks view deposits; a development that is already having an impact on corporate liquidity management. Corporate investors need to understand that going forward non-operational deposits are becoming ever more unattractive to banks and we are likely to see increasing instances of banks turning away some deposits.</p>
<p>In Asia, this comes at a time when corporates are holding more non-operating cash than ever before; cash holdings for Japanese companies are close to US$3trn, with corporates in China holding roughly US$1.2trn – that is a lot of cash that corporates may need to find a home for once Basel III truly begins to bite in the region.</p>
<p>Hence, now is really the time for treasurers to begin thinking about how their deposits will be treated moving forward and the difficult short-term investment decisions that lie ahead. For those treasurers who have not already started discussing the impact of Basel III internally and externally, it would be prudent to now begin this exercise.</p>
<p>To hear more about how the region’s short-term investment environment is changing and some practical steps that corporate treasurers should take, <a href=""/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/interview-kheng-leong-cheah-jp-morgan-asset-management-ttiv"">read the interview</a> with Kheng Leong Cheah, Head of Global Liquidity Sales, Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

<p><em>Virtual accounts have been receiving substantial attention lately – and it isn’t hard to see why. This solution offers flexibility for corporates to ease reconciliation, improve cash flows and strengthen credit control. But one of the less discussed advantages of virtual accounts is the ability to move all domestic and cross border transactions of the company into one single location. We look at how this capability might help corporates build the treasury models of tomorrow.</em></p>
<p>Ask almost any leading bank what the hottest innovation in cash management is right now, and you are likely to get the same answer. Virtual accounts have been widely adopted by insurance companies, FX brokerages and pension funds for many years. Now, especially since the harmonisation of the European payments landscape, the solution has been turning more than a few heads in the corporate world too.</p>
<p>At a roundtable discussion hosted in early 2016 by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), Matthew Davies, co-head of Product Management, GTS EMEA, noted that the payments solution has been coming up in nearly every client conversation since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>“This year almost every RFP we have seen has included virtual accounts, either as a core part of the requirement or as a peripheral part that is on their roadmap,” says Davies.</p>
<p>Davies is far from being the only banker seeing this trend either. “There is a growing interest, and it is something we are seeing in many RFPs at the moment,” says Jean-Francois Denis, Deputy Head of Cash Management, BNP Paribas. “Some clients are already implementing projects and require solutions, while others are simply interested in finding out what we can propose. But overall the trend is there – and it continues to grow.”</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence of the growing popularity of virtual accounts is also supported by survey data. A recent Rabobank Treasury Barometer study found that a majority of treasuries are evolving to a more centralised treasury model, particularly in the area of cash management where 91% of treasurers say their businesses are endeavouring to centralise activities. Virtual accounts appear to be an increasingly popular facilitator for such centralisation projects, with the survey finding that 30% of treasurers are now considering virtual account solutions as an alternative to notional pooling structures.</p>
<h3 id=""the-sepa-factor"">The SEPA factor</h3>
<p>Virtual accounts are actually not especially new or cutting in the corporate world – indeed from the 1990s onwards such structures were offered by certain banks in a number of eastern European countries, used mostly by financial clients. So what accounts for the sudden surge in corporate interest?</p>
<p>Andrew Bateman, Head of Treasury Software Solutions at FIS believes it is the growing sophistication of the solutions banks are now able to offer. Observing the issues that arise when large corporate organisations with multiple entities attempt to centralise, the banks have looked at ways of developing virtual account solutions that can make the endeavour less arduous.</p>
<p>“As companies began to centralise and rationalise their bank accounts, activities like reconciliation became more difficult,” says Bateman. “Banks realised that virtual account structures could help by providing them with the information that they need to perform collections on-behalf-of (COBO). When centralising, virtual accounts aid reconciliation allowing corporates to benefit from lower transaction costs and greater visibility but without adding complexity to incoming payment processing.”</p>
<p>When a treasury is collapsing multiple accounts down into a single account there is often a challenge around understanding precisely who is being paid for what. As Denis explains: “Treasurers need to be able to allocate the funds to the subsidiary of the group that the funds belong to.” This is where virtual accounts come in.</p>
<p>Imagine a company using a payment-on-behalf-of (POBO) solution that uses non-virtual account methods. When the payment beneficiary receives the payment, on their account they will see it is not from the subsidiary it is doing business with but from the account owner (who in many cases is the shared service centre or parent company). This leaves them with the challenge of working out who exactly has paid them. If the payment gets rejected in clearing and is returned, the parent doing the POBO also has to figure out who it is it has been making the payment for, so that it can be returned to the subsidiary.</p>
<p>All of this is solved automatically by virtual accounts. In a virtual account scenario within BofAML, as the actual virtual account detail (VA Name and VA Account Identifier) is passed on to the beneficiary, when the beneficiary receives the payment it can see it has come from the ‘virtual’ account of the subsidiary. Equally, should a payment be rejected, the company paying on behalf of the subsidiary can see straight away which virtual account the payment has come from and return it to the right subsidiary.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“This is where it gets quite powerful, I think,” says Davies. It is also where the advantages of a virtual account solution that uses virtual account numbers, not reference numbers for the underlying account – as some banks still use – are the most apparent. “You can’t make a payment from a reference number – it always has to be from a physical account. That is why we think this is the winning virtual account solution for treasurers.”</p>
<p>BofAML says that more than half of the client conversations they are currently having about virtual accounts concern centralisation projects. A few years ago, it was a mere two out of every ten clients. “Now even if clients are not looking at centralising their accounts immediately, they are saying that they want to achieve this sometime in the future, and asking what they need to do now.”</p>
<p>Dick Oskam, Global Head of Sales for Transaction Services at ING, agrees that the treasury industry is now beginning to look beyond collections to see the centralisation benefits of virtual accounts. By opening virtual accounts for each entity within a group and appending sub-level virtual accounts to these, he explains, clients of those entities can effectively remit to a central account (whether national, regional or global) using their own unique virtual account identifier. Like notional cash pooling, then, virtual accounts could enable corporates to allocate cash without segregating it physically.</p>
<p>It is a capability that could draw a lot of interest from treasurers at a time when regulatory requirements are raising questions around the future of notional pooling. For now, this form of multi-entity application for virtual accounts remains in its infancy. But with speculation that some banks may withdraw notional pooling altogether by the time Basel III rules are fully implemented in 2018, it is not likely to remain as such for very long. Indeed, if the way the banks are starting to talk about and market solutions is anything to go by, the shift may already be underway.</p>
<p>“We speak of virtual cash management – not just virtual accounts – because ours is a comprehensive offering,” says Oskam. The bank claims that the Virtual Cash Management (VCM) solution it formally announced in August 2016, which integrates virtual bank accounts with administrative sub-accounts called virtual ledger accounts (which populate a multi-bank cash management dashboard), is one of the first of the ‘next generation’ of digital cash management solutions. VCM’s liquidity management capabilities are central to this claim. “Whilst we do already see separate virtual account and virtual ledger solutions in certain countries these are usually only domestic,” he says. “It is the combination of the two capabilities – and the fact that it operates cross-border – that makes it a very unique and powerful solution for our customers.”</p>



<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">The next level of centralisation</h2>

<p>In rolling-out POBO and COBO in the Nordics, the treasury team at Roche show how it is possible to take centralisation to the next level by implementing new, more efficient treasury management processes across multiple currencies.</p>
<p>In 2013, Roche’s IHB started to implement a full on behalf of setup in the Eurozone. By implementing payments on behalf of (POBO) and introducing virtual accounts for collections on behalf of (COBO), Roche was able to close bank accounts of subsidiaries in various countries. Today the in-house bank (IHB) serves as the only bank partner to 20+ companies in more than ten European countries.</p>
<p>With the expertise gained in these implementations, treasury decided the next step would be to roll-out the full on-behalf-of concept to Denmark, Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>The base for this concept outside the Eurozone are residential currency cash pools in each country, containing zero-balanced collection accounts per legal (operating) entity and one main account. All accounts in these cash pools are legally owned by and in the name of the IHB and replace the existing bank accounts of the legal entities.</p>
<p>With this the IHB became the single point of contact for the banks, as well as for the affiliates. As Stefan Windisch, Cash Manager at Roche explains: “The affiliates have no need to hold bank accounts with commercial banks anymore; payments, collections, guarantees and all other services are processed or provided on behalf of in the name of our IHB.”</p>
<p>This allows Roche to review all current interactions, processes and operations between the current commercial bank and the entities in the respective countries. Inefficiencies were identified and either de-commissioned or streamlined. Processes such as KYC, account opening – and replacement – and payment communication were organised centrally and brought up to the current standard. This included using xml communication for commercial payment instructions (pain.001), bank statements (Camt.53) or credit advices (Camt.54C).</p>
<p>One of the major gains for Roche with this implementation was to have full transparency on all payment and collection processes by providing one banking system to the affiliate in-house.</p>
<p>With this the affiliate has access to the full range of services required locally, but all provided in an efficient way. For example, one daily bank statement, containing all third-party payments, all cash pool movements, intercompany payments/receivables and interest is provided to the affiliate. Instead of relying on an anonymous bank helpdesk, the affiliate can now approach Roche Group treasury for any cash and bank related topics.</p>
<h4 id=""no-copy-paste-exercise"">No ‘copy/paste’ exercise</h4>
<p>Roche’s IHB has reached the next level of centralisation with the implementation of POBO/COBO in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The project in these distinctly regulated countries has not been a ‘copy/paste’ exercise. Currency specific requirements needed to be understood, considered and adopted across in the IHB.</p>
<p>Despite being a non-resident in these countries Roche’s treasury team has managed to establish all business relevant bank-related processes to fulfil all payment and collection requirements. Hence, the IHB became their only bank partner and serves these Roche affiliates with an increased portfolio of services, such as one electronic statement for all transactions (internal and external), a lean KYC procedure and a globally compliant SOD setup. All this comes with reduced pricing for the affiliate.</p>
<p>This successful model will now be rolled out to Asia with Hong Kong as a pilot. As Windisch explains: “Running subsidiaries without bank accounts has many advantages for the Roche Group with regard to efficiency, transparency, security, standardisation and cost.”</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""going-virtual"">Going virtual</h3>
<p>There is little doubt that demand in the market for cash centralisation solutions is strong. Banking services the world over are becoming ever more digitised at a time when treasurers are being asked to do more with less, whilst increasing cash visibility and control. Amid such a powerful concurrence of challenges and opportunities we should perhaps not be overly surprised that virtual accounts have been a recurring theme in the RFPs landing on the desks of banks this year.</p>
<p>But while a virtual account solution is certainly a powerful enabler of centralisation it is not a panacea. As Oskam explains, it is the same with the so-called virtual ledger: “When we were at the drawing board, we realised that virtual ledger accounts already address a lot of the challenges on-behalf-of structures, but not quite all. SEPA promised more centralisation, but it didn’t solve the issue of interacting, for example, with local tax authorities. In some countries to get a tax refund companies still needed to have a local bank account to receive the payment.”</p>
<p>By pulling together virtual accounts and virtual ledgers this obstacle is removed, allowing full cash concentration and visibility right across the group. Bank account structures can be rationalised, and in-house banks established without any expensive additional software. Straight through processing and reconciliation rates will increase and real-time information will be put at the treasurer’s fingertips.</p>
<h3 id=""broader-appeal"">Broader appeal</h3>
<p>Since much of the focus has until now been primarily on the receivables reconciliation benefits of virtual accounts many early adopters of virtual accounts have tended to be big billers, like telecommunications companies for example. But Oskam believes that ING’s VCM solution could have a much broader appeal.</p>
<p>“If you look at mid-sized companies with a lot of online sales,” he says, “rather than opening physical bank accounts when expanding into new countries, they could open virtual accounts with us. With VCM that company would be able to sell in different markets without needing, from an administrative point of view, to be physically present. There are many reasons why treasurers might want this solution and because of that we see it as being not only for large corporates but also mid-sized companies and everything else in between.”</p>
<p>There is also a risk management benefit, Oskam adds, comparable to that offered by notional cash pooling. He draws on the recent Greek debt crisis as an example. Ahead of the referendum held by the Greek government on whether to accept or reject the terms of the Troika’s new bailout regime, concerns were growing that Greece might leave the euro and return to the drachma. But using VCM, treasurers need not worry about the fate of their balances in Greece because their cash need not reside in the country physically. “So the centralisation we are enabling is also reducing risks for corporate treasurers,” he says.</p>
<p>For that and all the above reasons, ING believe that treasurers could turn to VCM to help them continue to meet their liquidity management objectives post implementation of Basel III. ING emphasises that notional pooling is a service they still offer and are committed to, but greater choice for clients cannot be a bad thing in these times of regulatory upheaval. “Treasurers will make a choice depending on their needs and ultimately as to which solution fits best.”</p>
<h3 id=""new-structures-new-markets"">New structures, new markets</h3>
<p>As banks continue to develop their virtual account offerings, FIS’s Bateman is convinced that we will see ever more sophisticated structures being deployed by corporates. “It could be similar to what has happened in the virtual cards space; treasurers could start creating dynamic virtual accounts and, for instance, create a virtual account for a particular invoice. It would be taking the concept to a deeper level than merely having invoices for all a certain entities coming into a virtual account.”</p>
<p>With no shortage of innovative applications being dreamt up it seems that virtual accounts are going to remain a hot topic in the treasury community for some time to come. In fact, the recent FIS payments and bank connectivity survey highlights that around 23% of treasurers are not aware of virtual accounts and half of those who are aware of the technology have some concerns about how they may operate in practice. This suggests that interest in the corporate treasury community may not have peaked yet. “There are concerns around what banks are actually able to offer,” says Bateman, noting that there remains a huge degree of disparity in capability between the virtual account offerings of many of the leading banks. “If banks are able to satisfy their clients that they can actually deliver these solutions in the way they promise then I think we will continue to see growing interest.”</p>
<p>Interest in virtual accounts is also likely to increase with market coverage. Although the availability of virtual account solutions is not yet universal, BofAML’s Davies says that there is no reason why the solution cannot be expanded to include other regions. But any future expansion in coverage will ultimately be determined by the appetite of the bank’s corporate clients.</p>
<p>“Every bank is now looking at how to take what is evolving out of Europe and deploy it globally, because frankly that is the demand we are getting from our clients,” says Davies. “They are saying, ‘we love this but we want it everywhere, not just in Europe’.”</p>
<p>BNP Paribas’ Denis agrees. “The availability in terms of country coverage and payments instruments is very variable on the market today,” he says. “For instance we have deployed the solution in more than ten countries today and on both domestic SEPA and international payments. Some banks will have it deployed in fewer counties and some, perhaps, only within SEPA. So the availability is not really equal at the moment, and that is one of the ways I think this will evolve in the years to come.”</p>
<p>Progress is already being made by the banks on this front. In Asia, BNP Paribas’ solution is already live in 11 countries. Guillaume Flies, Head of Collections at BNP Paribas told Treasury Today back in 2015 that the bank will not be stopping there. “As for other regions – the Middle East and the Americas, for example – we are also considering ways to develop our solution in the countries and markets where we see the strongest demand,” he said.</p>

<p>The short-term investment landscape is certainly growing and it is not just the European and US regulatory changes driving this growth; factors such as Basel III and the interest rate environment also act as catalysts to this growth.</p>
<p>Although the key cash investment objectives of preservation of principle, liquidity and yield remain intact, the realities of today’s short-term investment environment require some new thinking around what these objectives should mean. Treasurers are therefore evidently thinking about their investment policies much more than they have ever done so in the past.</p>
<p>At J.P. Morgan Asset Management, our aim is to offer clients a range of investment products that sit across the risk and return spectrum to meet their changing needs. To deliver this, we make sure that our portfolio of products is constantly evolving to cater for a wide range of investment appetites. For example, in August we launched a new Sterling Managed Reserves Fund (MRF)<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>; this is a bond fund which will invest exclusively in short-term investment grade sterling securities. The launch of this product really comes at quite an opportune time for sterling investors, given the prospect of lower interest rates in the UK post-Brexit.</p>

<h2>August 2016</h2>
<br/>
<p>In October 2016 new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules governing money market funds (MMFs) take effect. Like earlier SEC reforms, they aim to make the MMF industry stronger and more transparent. Under the new rules, institutional prime and municipal MMFs must use market-based net asset value (NAV) for their transactions. (Previously market-based NAVs were calculated and disclosed, but they were not required for transactions). The rules also stipulate that if an MMF’s level of weekly liquid assets falls below 30%, the board may impose a liquidity fee or temporarily suspend (or gate) redemptions. Government MMFs are not required to be subject to the fee and gate provisions.</p>
<p>These regulatory changes are unfolding in a market environment in which interest rates, industry flows and portfolio security supply/demand dynamics may be very much in flux. As investors adapt to the new regulatory environment, they are re-evaluating their liquidity strategies and considering their investment options. Cash segmentation (distinguishing among operating, reserve and strategic cash), coupled with a firm grasp of the new SEC rules, will enable investors to create the most-effective liquidity strategies for their own particular risk tolerances and return objectives.</p>

<p>With a strong RMB cash position in onshore China, Alibaba’s treasury team were looking for short-term liquidity investment tools that would give them a better yield without compromising liquidity. Yet at a time when China had not begun to liberalise its interest rate market, higher yielding cash investment products meeting Alibaba’s corporate investment criteria in terms of transparency and credit rating were very few and far between.</p>
<p>As Randy Ou, Vice President, Treasury, at Alibaba Group, explains: “A few years back when China’s interest rate market was not as market-driven as it is now, our options were limited. What’s more, the choice of investment tools with a satisfactory credit rating was even more restricted back then.”</p>
<p>To find out how Ou and his treasury team at Alibaba Group overcome this challenge by utilising the RMB money market fund (MMF) offerings distributed by J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity (JPM GL), <a href=""/treasury-practice/case-studies/problem-solved-randy-ou-the-alibaba-group-ttps?utm_source=jpm-am-totm&amp;utm_medium=url&amp;utm_campaign=alibaba-problem-solved"">read the full case study here</a>.</p>

<p>Basel III regulations redefine global standards for bank capital, liquidity and leverage, and will profoundly impact how banks manage their balance sheets. Liquidity investors need to understand how banks will treat deposits under the new rules. In this way, they can most effectively structure and segment their liquidity portfolios to gain the greatest benefit from the new rules and incentives, and maximize their investment returns.</p>
<p>A centerpiece of Basel III – widely described as a “game changer” in the way banks view their deposits – is the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). It aims to ensure that a bank can meet its liquidity needs in a severe stress scenario. Specifically, the regulation looks to make certain that a bank holds a sufficient stock of unencumbered assets that can be converted into cash within a day, without a decrease in value, to meet all of the bank’s liquidity needs for a 30-day stress scenario. Though Basel III will not be completely implemented until 2019, European and U.S. banks have already started to report under the new regulations, and many large banks are choosing to follow the rules sooner than required.</p>

<p>With markets ever changing, a well-written cash investment policy is a must for corporate and institutional investors striving to meet critical cash objectives. A well-written investment policy provides important internal clarity that allows everyone – from the investment team to the board of directors – to share a common and clear understanding of the organization’s objectives and permissible investments. In a time of fluctuating markets and ever evolving regulatory environments, an investment policy helps an organization avoid making impromptu investment decisions and focuses attention on long-term goals. It also provides financial transparency and serves as a mechanism for internal control.</p>
<p>Constructing an investment policy should be a dynamic process. Once implemented, it is important to regularly review and update the investment policy to ensure that it is current and provides the flexibility needed to quickly respond to changing events.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Organisations of all shapes and sizes continue to face challenges in managing their accounts receivables, particularly around reconciliation. A lack of payment information on incoming receipts typically results in the process breaking down with substantial administrative time and cost spent investigating and resolving receivables matching. The resulting unapplied cash and open invoices routinely lead to compromised customer service and delays in shipment release. Closure of monthly financials and working capital management often suffer as a consequence.</p>
<h3 id=""a-working-solution-in-practice"">A working solution in practice</h3>
<p>The use of virtual accounts ensures unique and immediate identification of remitter details which facilitates straight-through cash application. Corporates seeking centralisation and optimisation will no longer need to manage extensive physical bank accounts and instead are able to draw the same advantages using one central account. Accounts receivable (AR) teams also save on time and effort previously spent investigating and reconciling open receipts.</p>
<p>Virtual accounts, as the name implies are bank-issued virtual bank account numbers that reroute payments to the underlying physical bank account they are linked to and ensure each remitter is uniquely identified. From a remitter perspective, virtual accounts look and function exactly like a real bank account number, and do not require any changes other than ensuring they pay into the new unique account number provided to them.</p>
<p>Virtual accounts offer a number of key benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Ease of management</h5>
<p>The solution does not require corporates to operate multiple physical bank accounts, eliminating the cost for opening and managing multiple accounts. Further, Standard Chartered offers flexibility by allowing virtual account numbers to be set intuitive to corporate’s customers, which smoothens the transition, with minimal cost and disruption to the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Operational efficiency</h5>
<p>The solution eliminates issues around missing remitter information and subsequent manually-intensive tracking and investigation processes, enabling clients AR team to focus on more productive core functions and value-added activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Automated reconciliation</h5>
<p>Automatic remitter identification allows for straight-through cash application in an AR system. This significantly reduces the processing float and enables faster release of remitter’s credit line and booking of next sales.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard Chartered offers virtual accounts across its geographic footprint in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, where historically the quality of remittance data is poor. As such, the solution has been very popular with corporates across industry sectors. <a href=""#table-1"">Table 1 below</a> illustrates just some of the ways virtual accounts are used across industry sectors:</p>

<p><em>Unilever is one of the world’s leading FMCG companies with unrivalled presence in the developing markets, especially in Asia. In Pakistan, Unilever has established an extensive dealer network covering several remote and rural locations, receiving a high volume of receipts in the form of guaranteed instruments, cash and electronic transfers, resulting in considerable time spent on reconciliation.</em></p>
<h4 id=""clients-goals"">Client’s goals</h4>
<p>Unilever has always perceived automated cash application into their ERP as an intrinsic part of their business model, which is highly dependent on the efficient turnaround of orders received from their vast distribution network. It had been observed that shipment releases were often delayed whenever payers were not being promptly identified.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>“Technology like virtual accounts gives us the flexibility not only to improve our cash flows but also to minimise our credit exposure. This is indeed a big leap forward in how businesses can manage their operations more effectively especially in volatile market situations. Unilever is proud of its partnership with Standard Chartered on this breakthrough initiative.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Zahid ul Islam Malita, Corporate Finance Director, Unilever Pakistan Limited</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>This gave Unilever a compelling reason to seek an integrated receivables solution to help expedite release of shipments once payments had been received from their respective dealers. Additionally, Unilever wanted to reduce the time it was taking for them to receive payments from their dealers, especially those located in remote parts of the country. Unilever approached its bank to request a solution to this problem.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution"">The solution</h4>
<p>Working with Unilever across Asia, Standard Chartered were able to facilitate straight-through cash application by streamlining the payer identification process. Through understanding the client’s existing processes, the bank was able to structure a virtual account solution to accommodate the dealers’ preferences for a variety of payment types.</p>
<p>Whilst the bank collaborated with Unilever in promoting adoption of virtual accounts amongst their dealers, Standard Chartered simultaneously engaged with dealers’ banks to seek their assistance in helping dealers remit funds electronically.</p>
<p>Paving the way with easy and non-disruptive transition for their client’s dealers, the bank delivered an integrated solution that expedited the adoption of electronic payment methods to achieve straight-through cash application. This solution has also enabled the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Early release of shipments to Unilever’s dealers with faster payer identification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational efficiency with straight-through ERP update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction in float costs that were associated with paper instruments and addressed with the adoption of electronic funds transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced dealer satisfaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the solution are impressive. The move to virtual accounts has shortened the shipment release cycle and encouraged dealers to opt for electronic payment methods. Unilever benefits from same-day credit of funds into their collection account leading to working capital improvements (eg in days sales outstanding – DSO), as well as a considerable reduction in the manual work associated with ERP updates, monitoring and tracking of outstanding receivables. Most importantly, Unilever’s sales organisation can now book successive orders from respective dealers without delay.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Unilever is looking to gain further efficiencies in receivables management by driving higher adoption of virtual accounts amongst its dealer network. They are also exploring further automation of invoice level reconciliation while improving the analytics available on their paid and outstanding receivables.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Smith Awards Winner – Best Cash Management Solution</strong></p>
<p>In the fast moving and ever evolving consumer goods (FMCG) sector corporates need to be ready for both now and the future.  Hear how Hindustan Unilever (HUL) embarked on an ambitious journey to transform its transaction banking capabilities, which involved rewiring a range of internal processes and deploying best in class solutions, with a strong emphasis on technology and simplification. The aim to make transaction banking capabilities future ready.</p>
<p>The project, which was delivered alongside business as usual operations, saw HUL become early-adopters of SWIFT’s ISO-based XML payment with SAP integration.  To leverage this further the company initiated SWIFT based invoice discounting and a first-of-its-kind payment of statutory taxes and levies over SWIFT. Furthermore, HUL has exploited its early-adopter mind-set to develop a strong e-collections set-up, using the new ACH Debit module of the National Payments Corporation (NPCI).</p>
<p>The benefits include HUL being able to reduce its bank accounts across eight legal entities by more than 75% in a short space of time.  Moreover, 99% of payments and collections are now electronic and there has been a significant improvement in banking process efficiency and controls across the board.</p>
<p>In this webinar hear how General Manager &amp; Head of Treasury, Investor Relations and M&amp;A at HUL, Dinesh Thapar and his team were able to complete this project.</p>
<p>This webinar was held on Thursday 21st April 2016.</p>

<h2>April 2016</h2>

<p>The Chinese government is committed to further financial sector reform, believing that market-driven interest rates and profit-minded institutions are central pillars of efficient capital allocation and continued economic growth. But the next phase of reform, full interest rate liberalisation, will present fresh challenges. The government, regulators and banks will all look to strike a balance between free markets and government control, aiming to spur economic growth while restraining unhealthy financial risk.</p>
<p>Despite the various obstacles and complications, two powerful forces are at work: the government’s push to create a sustainable domestic growth model and the desire of investors to benefit from the higher yields of liberalised markets. Together they demonstrate China’s aspiration for more market-driven interest rates, better access to capital and greater investment choice.</p>

<h5>The J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup> survey results provide unique insight for cash investors.</h5>
<h4>Key findings</h4>
<p><strong>Investment in money market funds still strong</strong> – Based on the market outlook for next year, 63% of respondents will continue with the same allocation to money market funds, while an additional 20% will increase their allocations. In the U.S., of the respondents who are currently invested in a prime money market fund, 70% intend to still use it when SEC 2a-7 money market rules go into effect next year.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory pressures</strong> – Respondents are grappling with a host of regulatory pressures, including SEC Rule 2a-7 reform in the U.S., pending money market fund regulation in Europe and Basel III around the globe. Almost half of respondents report that their banks have encouraged them to move non-operating deposits off the banks’ balance sheet. Also, approximately 40% of participants plan to make changes to their investment policies given the current regulatory landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and liquidity</strong> remain priorities – As indicated by their choice of investments, survey respondents focus on safety and liquidity: Almost half of global cash assets are still placed in bank deposits. Usage is most prevalent in Asia, where 57% of assets are held in bank deposits vs. 44% in Europe and 42% in the Americas. Money market funds represent roughly one-third of cash assets in the Americas and Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Risk is still a focus</strong> – While risk management continues to be critically important, the framework for assessing risk is shifting for many liquidity investors. Negative interest rates in Europe and low rates globally are compelling organizations to re-evaluate their appetite for risk and more precisely calculate their short-term liquidity needs.</p>
<p><strong>Search for yield</strong> – Separately managed accounts (SMAs) – customized portfolios that allow investors to define their own risk, security and liquidity parameters – will continue to account for a significant share of cash allocations. Twenty percent of respondents in the Americas and 16% in Europe plan to increase their allocations to cash assets that are invested with SMAs or outside managers. Investor demand for SMAs can be seen as a clear demonstration of the need for yield.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Smith Awards Winner – Best Cash Management Solution</strong></p>
<p>The era of trapped cash in China is over. Hear how one of the trail-blazing companies in cross-border RMB established their market-leading structure and how you can too.</p>
<p>This was a major issue for this company until it introduced a trailblazing solution which Matthew Clarke, Group Treasurer at Intertek is willing to share with you. China accounts for around 20% of Intertek’s revenue and an even greater percentage of its operating profit and cash flow so the need to repatriate the cash back to the UK was a major challenge. This solution takes maximum advantage of the changing regulatory environment to deliver a robust, yet flexible, sweeping structure to maximise cut-off times for same-day value. Intertek applied for a quota for its onshore entities to lend to related offshore entities and was one of the first ten companies to get approval in Shanghai, and the very first in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>This webinar was held on Wednesday 3rd February 2016.</p>

<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Questions asked throughout the webinar</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PBOC has just tightened control on cross-border loans a few weeks ago, any advice on the impact and solutions? <strong>(18:52)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the cross-border sweeping utilised by your company still need to be converted from a loan to a dividend on an annual basis? <strong>(27:13)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You said your structure has not been affected by the recent restrictions. Is this because the pool is a net lender into China, or do you have another form of structure? <strong>(30:34)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the pool suffer any FX losses or gains due to the CNY/CNH FX difference? <strong>(31:55)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What advice would you give other corporates with trapped cash in China, particularly given the recent restrictions that we’ve alluded to? <strong>(33:16)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there anything you would have done differently, with the benefit of hindsight? <strong>(35:02)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through the cross-border loan approach, can CNY be exchanged in China into GBP before sending back to the UK? Or does it have to be sent back to the UK in CNY and then converted in the UK market? <strong>(36:59)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of your previous responses suggests you have had FX gains or losses resulting from your RMB cross-border cash pool. Can you give a simple example as to how an FX gain or loss would arise? <strong>(38:11)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""questions-asked"">Additional questions:</h4>
<h5 class=""question"">When you refer to Shanghai are you in the free trade zone or just a Shanghai company?</h5>
<p>We have entities in both. Our particular structure is not from the FTZ.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Central bank of China has just tightened control on cross-border loan a few weeks ago, any advice on the impact and solutions?</h5>
<p>The situation remains fluid and depends on each companies circumstances. My recommendation would be to stay in close dialogue with your relationship banks and monitor the situation closely. To the extent you haven’t already you should consider back up alternatives.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Any indication when this suspension could be lifted and what caused it?</h5>
<p>The situation is a response to the pressures on the currency to try to stem external flow of capital. It is not clear at this time how long the suspension will apply.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Is the dividend cash repatriation route recommended? What's the withholding tax to pay?</h5>
<p>For us dividends are the principal method for profit repatriation. This applies to all jurisdictions we operate in. WHT rates vary across entities and jurisdictions.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">The first sentence means that it is not more possible to transfer cash in excess from China through the cash pooling but it is just possible to send there cash to maintain the zero balance?</h5>
<p>My understanding is that inward sweeps are still permitted under the 2-way sweep structure. The concern is around outflows. As our solution is not 2-way I recommend speaking with a bank adviser to get the latest position on this.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">What was main reason why cashpool sweeping was not suspended?</h5>
<p>There are a number of different structures available. Certain of these structures are currently subject to a suspension.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">From Tax perspective, for cross border pooling the offshore entity need to give interest at arm's length to the local entity without incurring a loss itself from the pooled cash. How do you handle that?</h5>
<p>Again I can’t comment on the application of the suspension across all structures. Ours is not a Shanghai FTZ cross-border pool.</p>

<h2>February 2016</h2>
<br/>
<p>Over the last ten years we have seen some dramatic changes in the Chinese economy and financial markets. In 2015 we faced the complex challenge of slowing economic growth, a weaker currency, volatile stock markets and faster financial reforms as the Government attempted to introduce the critical structural economic reforms necessary to realign China to a more sustainable consumption based growth model.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The challenges and opportunities of interest rate liberalisation and regulatory changes have raised concerns about China’s ability to restructure and reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triple-A Chinese money market fund strategies remain focussed on credit quality, good asset allocation and a strong maturity profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By assessing and understanding counterparty exposure Chinese credit risks can be reduced.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <em>2016 outlook – Mixed expectations</em> by Stephanie Flanders, <em>Chief Market Strategist for the UK and Europe at J.P. Morgan Asset Management</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In December 2015 we saw an interest rate rise in the US, further monetary loosening in the eurozone and another lurch down in oil prices-all key developments which will frame the outlook for investors for many months to come.</li>
<li>The big message is one of divergence: the world is divided, not just by the direction of monetary policy, but by region and by sector, with the brightest spots in the global economy largely in the developed markets and close to consumers.</li>
<li>Despite the prospect of further rate increases in the US and probably the UK, policy in most of the world is still highly supportive. It makes sense for investors to be tilted in favour of risk assets over core fixed income, and developed market (DM) assets over emerging ones.</li>

<p>Achieving more visibility, control and efficiency are key priorities for treasurers in the current business environment. However, meeting this objective is not straightforward for corporate treasuries who still rely on manual processes (such as faxing of trade requests and confirmations) to invest their surplus cash.</p>
<p>By using more automated solutions, such as J.P. Morgan’s Global Cash Portal or industry standardized financial messaging services offered by SWIFT, corporate treasurers around the world would have the ability to access their company account information, execute trades online, as well as export such information to a spreadsheet afterwards, if desired. This means that by incorporating technology advancements into their daily routines, corporate treasurers are empowered to obtain a real-time snapshot of their company’s cash holdings and investments with increased efficiency and less manual effort – resulting in more time for investment decision making.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It is first important to point out that most bank electronic cheque deposit products are browser-based options that are offered as part of online cash management portals. Therefore, like other functions of the cash management portal, specific user privileges are determined based on entitlements that either the bank or a corporations’ administrator decides. We think that best practice involves: the separation of duties, ensuring that the person checking and approving the deposits is someone other than the person scanning the cheques; guaranteeing that the portal is configured so that individual users can only deposit into specific authorised accounts; scanning items early in the day so that the deposit can be submitted before the bank’s cut-off for next day availability; treating the cheques as you would any confidential information and setting scanned items aside so they are not inadvertently scanned for a second time (although most electronic deposit products check for previously deposited items).</p>
<p>Desktop scanners offered with electronic cheque deposit products are simple and easy to operate. Typically, bank-provided drivers are installed on the desktop computer which will be used to make deposits. If multiple scanner choices are offered, choose the one with a capacity best suited to your expected needs. Most corporates don’t get that many cheques, so a relatively inexpensive scanner will work just fine. Higher priced scanners with higher throughput (items per minute) won’t make much of a practical difference in most cases.</p>
<p>After scanning cheques for deposit, image analytics reads the information off each cheque, requiring very little manual information entry. Occasional items do need correction, however. Typically this is best done immediately after scanning the items, so the original cheques are available if needed. Beyond getting quickest availability of funds as mentioned above, the next thing is to apply cash efficiently. Check with your bank to see what capabilities they offer to associate payment information to open accounts receivables. Often, capabilities are limited but still can be effective in applying cash the same day the cheque is deposited, with little operator effort.</p>
<p>Some banks provide guidance, but we’re not aware of any regulatory requirements for cheque retention. In the US, most firms destroy the items after 30 days. Since the images are available online and banks provide deposit confirmation well within that time frame, there is no practical reason to hold on to the cheques longer than one statement cycle. Keeping them on-hand increases the risk that sensitive information will be compromised or the items will be accidentally deposited a second time.</p>

<p>Remote deposit capture with desktop scanners offers companies the potential to replace the traditional cheque deposit process. By following the established deposit compilation and preparation processes, businesses can replace time-consuming trips to their bank by simply scanning and electronically transmitting the cheques.</p>
<p>But before implementing a remote deposit capture service, we recommend companies determine the level of service they’ll need from their bank. We’ve created the following list to help companies clarify their requirements and expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine the monthly volume of checks to be scanned. This information will help companies choose which type of scanner which will best meet their needs. Scanner sizes run from single feed for very low monthly volumes to scanners that can handle more than 6,000 items per month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the number of sites that will be required to transmit deposits. With this information companies will know how many scanners will be required to effectively process their work and allow them to calculate scanner service fees where applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companies should determine whether they want one person to be able to prepare, scan, review and release each deposit or whether a supervisory review prior to transmission is preferred. Most remote deposit systems allow for the breakout of responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the type of information that should be retained. Banks have various options around information reporting and storage, so companies should take the time to explore their options. Important factors to consider include: whether images of the deposited items are needed; whether data reports are required; if the image archive requires CD-rom or transmission services; and whether short or long-term storage of the data and images is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather the information around your company’s technology and internet guidelines. Technology concerning operating systems, browsers and scanner drivers is constantly upgrading and changing. Companies should enlist the knowledge of their IT staff regarding internal firewalls, security and operating system requirements upfront so there are no delays once installation has begun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilise training resources provided by the bank. Our customer service records indicate that clients who take advantage of product training experience far fewer difficulties once using the service. Companies should ask their bank whether it offers training, and if so, whether the training is web-based, instructor led, conducted on-site, or a combination of each. Determining the appropriate time to take the training will also be significant to an effective implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the bank’s RDC user guides and other documentation. These materials will outline other important tasks to plan for. One such task is the retention and destruction of scanned checks. Bank of America Merrill Lynch recommends clients safeguard original items for 14 days using reasonable commercial standards for storage. Reasonable standards include, but are not limited to, storing the items in a secure location with limited access. Items should be destroyed using a cross cut shredder after 14 days or when all reasonable attempts to collect on the item have been made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The time invested in detailing this inventory of needs will lay the groundwork for a smooth implementation of RDC into a company’s treasury department.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The most recent RDC solutions are entirely web-based, and a part of banks’ corporate banking service suites. Drivers and software libraries for the cheque scanners are usually downloaded and installed upon service activation and the user does not have to worry about application updates, as the application is maintained by the bank as part of online services, instead of residing on the local workstation. Occasionally, an operating system (OS) update or a substantially incremental application update may require the user to update the scanner drivers/application program interfaces (APIs). But a new generation of cheque scanners is emerging which are no longer dependent on APIs and OS,’ and will make integration with web-based RDC applications more straightforward and hassle-free, and even allow the scanner to operate with a mobile device (tablet or smartphone) instead of a desktop computer.</p>
<p>Once installed, the cheque scanner should be taken care of as a normal piece of office equipment, but since cheques are a form of payment the user may want to make sure that its functionality is maintained at an optimised level. This could include periodically cleaning the paper path, image cameras and magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) read head – operations which can be carried out with normal cleaning methods and supplies, or with special cleaning cards which are recommended especially for batch scanners. Documents must be stored according to the agreement between bank and customer, or delivered to the bank in the appropriate time frame if national laws or the agreement requires corporates to do so.</p>
<p>Using RDC instead of carrying cheques to the local bank branch or ATM is just the first step, allowing to save time and fuel as well as improving the availability right from the start. A mid-term possibility for the business RDC user is to evaluate whether all the banking relationships they have in place are really needed; thanks to the elimination of geographic constraints RDC allows, there may be room for consolidation.</p>
<p>If RDC is run as a stand-alone solution, deposit and posting survive as two separate actions, which is a missed opportunity. Improved use of RDC allows corporates to export deposit data from the web app into a format which can be merged with the accessory data the accounting system requires – such as customer identification and invoice number, therefore facilitating the posting phase. More advanced payments implementations allow to extract such data automatically from remittances and possibly even integrate the images of scanned documents – both remittances and cheques – with a document management system used for archive and retrieval.</p>
<p>In terms of how long the cheques should be kept, it depends on local law and, in countries where the law does not mandate a term, on the agreement between bank and customer. Italy, for example, is about to implement a system which requires storage of physical cheques for six months, despite the image acquiring legal value. RDC users are likely to be requested to forward their cheques to the bank anyway (but with no hurry because the bank will not wait for the paper to arrive to carry out the deposit) or to store those cheques on the bank’s behalf for six months. In the US – which adopted image-based truncation over ten years ago with no mandatory paper storage term – agreements between individual banks and business customers are known to impose on the latter a storage term from as short as three days to as long as two months. The average ranges between 15 and 30 days – which is usually considered safe enough.</p>

<p>Approximately 40% of those we surveyed said they plan to make changes to their investment policies given the current regulatory landscape. Additionally, almost half of respondents report that their banks have encouraged them to move non-operating deposits off the banks’ balance sheet.</p>
<p>As investors continue to navigate shifting interest rate environments globally and face regulatory headwinds, the PeerView findings will help gauge their cash investment interests, strategies and decisions in comparison to their peers. The changing environment of short-term investments means it has never been more important for financial decision makers to understand how their peers are positioning portfolios for the upcoming changes.</p>

<p>Repos are the largest, most liquid money market instrument in Chinese markets and an important investment option for RMB money market funds.</p>
<p>They offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A low-risk investment option</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good liquidity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher, market-driven interest returns</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Some RMB money market fund investors are concerned about repo market operations, collateral quality and counterparty risk. In this paper, we explain the market’s structure, safeguards and benefits, addressing and allaying those concerns, and making clear how and why repo has become such a critical component of RMB money market funds. Armed with a good understanding of Chinese repo markets, liquidity investors will be able to fully appreciate the vital role of repo in RMB money market funds.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Physical cash has existed in Asia Pacific for a very long time. Records show some of the first coins were created in India and China around 600-700BC. Today, cash is still an integral part of the economies in APAC: in emerging markets (EMs) – such as India, Malaysia and Indonesia – cash accounts for between 95% and 100% of all consumer transaction volume. More surprisingly perhaps, is that even in some of the region’s more developed economies, cash remains the most used method of payment, with cash accounting for around 70% of all consumer transaction volumes in Australia and Korea. In Japan this number rises to roughly 85%.</p>
<p>It is worth noting however, that the value of these cash payments is lower than that in the EMs. In Australia for example, cash accounts for just above 10% of the value of all consumer payments, whilst in India this number is just below 70%.</p>
<h3 id=""the-trouble-with-cash"">The trouble with cash</h3>
<p>Although cash is still widely used across the region, progress is being made towards cashless solutions in both developed markets and EMs. For instance, data from MasterCard highlights that in 2014 the number of unique contactless card users grew by 49% year-on-year compared to 2013 across APAC. This was led by the developed markets of Singapore and Australia primarily, but, in some EMs such as China, the number is also increasing.</p>
<p>A key reason behind this increase is the cost of cash for governments and businesses. In India for instance, the Reserve Bank of India and commercial banks spend roughly $3.5bn per year issuing, collecting, and handling cash. For corporates, there is also a cost, as Indrajeet Maitra, Head of Cash Management – APAC at BNP Paribas explains: “Using cash to make a transaction can cost up to 3% to 5% of its value. It has to be collected, managed, guarded and deposited into a bank, who will then charge to handle it. In addition to this, it can take between three to five days to be converted and reach the ultimate beneficiary – not including any notes that are lost in transit – again creating working capital inefficiencies and thus cost.” The payment will also need to be reconciled, which as many treasurers will confess, is tricky with cash, due to its anonymous nature.</p>
<p>Removing cash can bring a raft of other benefits for the economy, businesses and society more broadly too. These include, but are not limited to: ensuring that all money in the economy is counted towards GDP, making taxes easier to collect, providing more control to regulators with regard to monitoring movements of money, and enabling cash to reach the right beneficiaries, something of tremendous value to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) providing aid, for example.</p>
<h3 id=""driving-the-agenda"">Driving the agenda</h3>
<p>With these apparent benefits, some may ask why cash isn’t already a thing of the past. Unfortunately, the removal of physical cash from the economy comes at a cost and needs to be driven by governments. As BNP’s Maitra explains: “To be able to create a cashless ecosystem you first need to develop the physical infrastructure to accommodate this.” This includes building best-in-class domestic payment and clearing systems and having an advanced technological infrastructure utilising new technology such as the cloud. Many countries in APAC have strived to do this, for example, Singapore recently launched its faster payments platform. Countries like India have also now developed such an infrastructure that enables payments to be made readily by electronic means.</p>
<p>Just because you build it, doesn’t mean they will come, though – at least not right away. Take Japan for example, a market with advanced payment technology but one that remains extremely cash-intensive, as a report by the Aite Group highlights. A lack of incentives and a low crime rate are offered as the reasons Japanese society hasn’t moved away from cash.</p>
<p>Governments therefore must encourage the move towards removing cash by making it an unfavourable instrument to use compared to digital solutions. In Lagos, Nigeria this is exactly what is happening with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introducing a cash-handling charge on daily cash withdrawals or deposits. In doing so it is hoped that consumers and business will switch to digital payment solutions and thereby reducing the cost of banking services, including the cost of credit, and to drive financial inclusion by providing more efficient transaction options and greater reach.</p>
<p>There is a similar project occurring in Malaysia. As part of the government’s ambition to be considered a developed nation by 2020, the government is looking to increase the number of electronic payments per capita from 56 in 2012, to 200 by 2020. To do this, it will be increasing the cost of using cash and cheques and reducing the cost of digital transactions through the introduction of a lowered merchant discount rate (MDR), whilst also introducing more digital payment terminals.</p>
<h3 id=""the-alternatives"">The alternatives</h3>
<p>Today, there are many alternatives to cash, in particular given the rise of digital specialist payment services such as PayPal and Alipay. But, in most instances these are similar solutions with nuanced differences to suit particular demographics. For that reason, the alternatives to cash can be largely grouped into three different buckets: cards, digital (and increasingly mobile) solutions and alternative currencies (though the lines between these are now becoming blurred).</p>
<h4 id=""payment-cards"">Payment cards</h4>
<p>Having existed for over 50 years, payment cards are a widely used alternative to cash, allowing the user to make cashless transactions by swiping or using chip-and-pin functionality at a point of sale (POS) terminal, by entering their card details online, or giving them over the phone. These come in many guises including: store cards, rail cards, loyalty cards and prepaid cards, but the most popular are credit and debit cards. According to the World Payments Report 2014, growth in non-cash transactions were driven by debit and credit cards, accounting for $140.7bn and $62.7bn respectively. Although over half of these transactions were made in Europe and North America, there was growth in emerging Asia as consumers became more affluent and electronic payment systems became more readily available.</p>
<p>Despite this, cards are far from ubiquitous. For instance, in the US, 20% of the population have no form of payment card. Across APAC, and in particular in emerging Asia, low card penetration has been a feature of the market (Indonesia and Thailand have credit card penetrations of 6% and 5% respectively). Although in the developed markets, such as Singapore and South Korea, it is estimated that credit card ownership to be as high as 3.3 and 5 cards per person.</p>
<p>So why have cards not proved a successful medium to remove cash? Cost has a significant part in this, especially in regard to credit cards. For instance, when offering card services a merchant usually has to pay 100/200bps depending on the market to make the transaction. Moreover, for a merchant to accept cards, they have purchase the correct POS equipment and maintain this. Although this is not usually a problem for large retailers it may be for a small ‘mom and pop shop’ in the Philippines.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there is a security aspect. A recent Nilson Report highlighted that fraud losses incurred by banks and merchants on all credit, debit, and prepaid general purpose and private label payment cards issued worldwide reached $16.31bn last year.</p>
<p>Debit and credit cards also require the user to have a bank account. This is a problem for the millions of unbanked that live in the region (across developing Asia only 27% of people are banked). Pre-paid cards which don’t require a bank account, however, may be a better solution for the region. These also have potential in more developed economies, as highlighted by the popularity if the Octopus card in Hong Kong. Since its launch in 1997 the card has gained near ubiquitous status with around 95% of people between the ages of 16-65 using the card for transactions amounting to $18m every day. As a result of the medium’s convenience, over 60% of Hong Kong consumers prefer to use cards over cash for everyday spending.</p>
<h4 id=""digital-mobile"">Digital (mobile)</h4>
<p>Although cards have not yet been able to drive cash out of the system, new solutions are now attempting to do this. For instance, in recent years there has been an emergence of new providers and channels, such as mobile commerce and near field communication (NFC) payment methods have presented a challenge to the banks in the person-to-person (P2P) market.</p>
<p>Companies such as PayPal, Bill Me Later and Travelex are examples of these challengers that have a certain advantage over the banks, in that they are focused purely on payments, and can also be more flexible. This enables them to drive innovation and respond to consumer demands to bring new products to the market more quickly, especially in the world of e-commerce.</p>
<p>The second stage of this digital development has been the rise of mobile payment solutions. These again vary in their nature, for example, Apple Pay allows credit cards to have a digital wallet on their iPhone 6 or Apple Watch-compatible device, which is scanned at the POS, completing the transaction. Meanwhile, other solutions, such as Kenya’s M-Pesa, bypass traditional banking services altogether by storing money in e-wallets and then connecting with beneficiaries directly over mobile networks supported by Safaricom and Vodafone. The success of M-Pesa in Kenya has made countries around the world aware of the benefits offered by mobile solutions, including: driving financial inclusion and removing the need for companies and organisations to ship large quantities of physical cash to remote rural locations – greatly reducing the risks associated with this. In Asia’s emerging markets in particular, where more people own a mobile phone than a bank account, the opportunities are abundant.</p>
<p>Change is beginning to occur across the region in this regard and a number of projects are starting to gain traction. In Pakistan, for example, traditional card solutions were not heavily adopted because of the cost associated with the terminals, transaction fees as high as 3.5%, and slow internet connections. Yet mobile is beginning to take off thanks to a collaboration between Habib Bank and card issuer Monet, which has launched the first mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) system in the country, allowing retailers of all sizes to take payments using a mobile phone. What’s more, the system can run on a slow GPRS connection. In Myanmar, there is talk of adopting a solution similar to M-Pesa, which is already available in India. Also, in the Philippines, a joint venture between the government and the US is looking to create a single electronic payments platform for all transactions in the country – dubbed the e-peso.</p>
<h4 id=""alternative-currencies"">Alternative currencies</h4>
<p>In addition to changes in the means of payment, the currencies themselves are also changing. Much has been made of the rise of Bitcoin, a digital currency where encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. Bitcoin, operating independently of a central bank, is not bound by borders, leaving some observers to believe it has the power to replace fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Although these predictions may seem far-fetched, when correctly harnessed the transformational power of the technology is very interesting. Take, for example, Coins.ph, a Filipino financial services provider. The company was launched in 2014, having seen the need to deliver financial services to the unbanked population in the Philippines. As Scott Si, Product Marketing at Coins.ph explains: “We want to be a bridge between the financial institutions and the people that banks cannot reach. To do this, we’ve launched a mobile wallet – similar to Paypal – running on Blockchain technology. It only takes 30 seconds to create an account on your mobile phone, after which you could pay bills, top up your phone, and send funds to anyone, anywhere.” When a user sends a payment to a beneficiary, the money goes through the Blockchain – the decentralised public ledger that supports Bitcoin – to the recipient’s wallet. “This is a much more efficient means of transporting money. You can send and receive money with just an email address or phone number,” he adds.</p>
<p>Although the mention of Bitcoin may make some feel uneasy, given its negative press, Si is keen to point out how the Coins.ph solution is different. “What we really want to encourage is Blockchain and Bitcoin as a medium of transfer – it is the financial rails for people to transfer money quickly. We are not suggesting that this should replace fiat currency.” In addition, the service also strictly observes KYC and AML regulations.</p>
<p>However, cash still can’t be escaped – at least for now. In looking to meet the needs of Filipinos and to be a bridge between the unbanked and the traditional financial sector, Coins.ph allows its users to deposit or cash out across 10,000 locations, covering banks, cash pick-up outlets, ATMs, and even door-to-door delivery. But, there is opportunity for cash to be weaned away through partnerships with retailers in the Philippines allowing users to pay for goods with their phones. “We’re currently focused on delivering financial services in a more efficient and accessible way, but we also see a big opportunity in online payments since credit card penetration here is low and there is no dominant payment solution yet,” adds Si.</p>
<h3 id=""impact-on-treasury"">Impact on treasury</h3>
<p>So what does all this mean for treasurers? “Today, physical cash is not something you can do without in the world of cash management,” says BNP Paribas’ Maitra. “Even if a corporate does most of their business electronically, there will still be 10% to 20% of their wallet which is still cash based.” That being said, treasurers are always looking at ways to optimise their payments and collections processes and mobile technology is becoming more established – and useful – in this regard.</p>
<p>“More broadly mobile technology has allowed us to live our lives differently but it hasn’t yet played a significant role in how corporates manage their cash,” says Di Challenor, Head of Transaction Services at J.P. Morgan. “But it does have the potential to.” It can make treasury processes much more efficient and lean – allowing treasurers to transact on-the-move. It can also improve cash handling, and help right down to the working capital level, as money collected through mobile channels often comes in before it would through more traditional methods. Treasury functions that collect payments in mobile form could also benefit from mining consumer behaviour data, previously lost through cash transactions. “Security and how comfortable corporates become using mobile will have a big role to play in regard to how quickly this happens,” adds Challenor.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, mobile could also transform the way some corporates invoice customers. As an alternative to Direct Debits (DD), invoices with a Quick Response (QR) Code allow mobile payments that are almost instantaneous. Furthermore, these payments have a token embedded in them containing information about the customer and the bill, thus saving the corporate on administration costs, as well as making it easier for the customer to pay. This form of payment could bring particular benefits to regulated utilities in billing customers who are either unable or unwilling to pay by DD.</p>
<p>Despite all of these benefits for governments, society and corporations, the move away from cash is likely to be slow. As J.P. Morgan’s Challenor explains: “I think that Asia should move away from cash for the benefit of everyone. But it is not a simple task and there is a lot of work to do around building the correct infrastructure, once this is compete then the next task is changing the behaviour of individuals and business. And as we have seen recently, if these two factors aren’t completed correctly then cashless projects can turn into multi-million dollar failures.”</p>

<p>Rising rate environments can challenge even the most sophisticated fixed income investor. So, with UK and US interest rates poised to rise from levels that are near their all-time lows, treasurers must be prepared – and take the time to reassess their bond portfolios. For example, bonds with shorter maturities, floating interest rates and/or higher yields should experience less dramatic price declines and may be better suited to meeting companies’ liquidity needs over the coming months.</p>
<p>As our latest Liquidity Insights whitepaper explains, during periods of rising interest rates and stable credit conditions, investors can improve the total return of their bond portfolios by shifting into shorter duration and higher-income-generating strategies. The paper also highlights how a study of past rising rate cycles and dynamic scenario analysis of potential future rate moves can provide a valuable perspective to an investor managing liquidity through a rising rate environment.</p>

<p><em>André Rijs has over 15 years’ experience in banking having joined ING from 1997. After having worked for Nissan Europe for four years he started at ING Bank International Securities Lending and moved via Bank Mendes Gans to ING Central &amp; Eastern Europe as a Senior Product Manager. Subsequently he joined Payments &amp; Cash Management Product Sales in Amsterdam and is currently responsible as Regional Head of Sales of Transaction Services for the regions Central and Eastern Europe, USA and UK.</em></p>

<p>Globalisation is not a new phenomenon. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), a network was built that would eventually become the hallmark of early global interconnectedness: The Silk Road. This historically important trade route, which saw desirable goods transported from China all the way to the heart of the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean, spanned 10,000km in total and operated until the end of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>Today, with the internet granting easy access to new markets, and enormous container ships transporting goods from far-flung locations in a cost-efficient manner, corporate supply chains continue to globalise at a rapid rate. As a result of this, the international business environment, supply and operational chains, are becoming more complex. Together with diverse regulatory approaches between jurisdictions and a heightened political, sovereign and currency risk environment, this is making global cash management increasingly challenging – and at the same time increasingly important.</p>
<h3 id=""achieving-real-time-visibility"">Achieving real-time visibility</h3>
<p>Since the crisis, treasurers have been doing a great deal of work to improve their international cash management arrangements – rationalising bank accounts, centralising positions, automating processes, and setting up shared service centres in tactical locations as a means to bridge the gap between international time zones and cultures. Yet, according to Treasury Today’s European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study 2014, cash management and cash pooling structures remain the top concerns for today’s treasurers.</p>
<p>For André Rijs, Regional Head of Sales Transaction Services C&amp;EE, USA and UK, ING, this level of prioritisation continues because “cash is still king. Credit comes at a cost and is not always easy to find. So, companies naturally want to know where they have excess cash for their own funding needs. As such, visibility and control of group-wide cash remains a very high priority.”</p>
<p>With this in mind, many banks and vendors in the cash management space are currently ramping up their advisory services and investing in innovative solutions to help treasurers to improve global cash visibility and control, and achieve the ultimate goal of ‘with the sun’ liquidity – essentially a 24/7 cash management structure that enables the company to operate and make decisions in real-time, across the globe.</p>
<h3 id=""the-technology-backbone"">The technology backbone</h3>
<p>In addition to implementing notional or hybrid pooling arrangements and interest enhancement schemes to help corporates move towards this goal, “the leading banks are leveraging technology to provide a much more harmonised cash management offering to their clients, as well making their services available for their clients 24/7,” notes Rijs.</p>
<p>Standardisation is absolutely key in all of the technological developments that banks are pursuing. In fact, through standardisation, banks are providing a technology backbone for international cash management, he says. “The software vendors are then building treasury dashboards and bank agnostic capabilities on top of that backbone, ensuring that their platforms that go beyond the basic transactional functionality of the past.” These new additions include powerful analytics capabilities, multi-currency transaction functionalities, multi-bank decision tools, risk management dashboards and automated compliance and regulatory alerts or limits, for example – all of which are helping international treasurers to deal with the complexity that globalisation brings.</p>
<h3 id=""embracing-new-locations"">Embracing new locations</h3>
<p>Away from evolving technology and liquidity structures, another traditional stumbling block for those companies operating internationally has been the raft of different regulatory measures and cross-border currency controls, with trapped cash being a major concern in emerging markets. But as the balance of global economic power shifts from West to East and from North to South, governments in emerging market countries – notably China and the Latin American nations – are working hard to open up their economies to benefit from international trade.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as these developing economies embrace international business standards, and invest more in their service sectors, their ability to compete on manufacturing costs is being challenged. According to 2014 research from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), five locations traditionally considered low-cost for manufacturing are now under pressure, namely: China, Brazil, Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic. The erosion, says BCG, has been driven by a confluence of sharp wage increases, lagging productivity growth, unfavourable currency swings, and a dramatic rise in energy costs. China’s manufacturing-cost advantage over the US has shrunk to less than 5%.</p>
<p>The rising stars, says BCG, include Mexico and North America, where the overall manufacturing-cost structures have significantly improved relative to nearly all other leading exporters across the globe. The key reasons for this include stable wage growth, sustained productivity gains, steady exchange rates, and energy-cost advantages. Mexico now has lower average manufacturing costs than China – by around 13%.</p>
<h3 id=""closer-to-home"">Closer to home</h3>
<p>There are significant opportunities in Europe too, says Rijs. “One of the very clear trends we see is the rise of shared service centres (SSCs) in Poland. More and more big name companies setting up SSCs in the country – HP and Herbalife – are recent examples.” Furthermore, a 2014 research report by the Association of Business Service Leaders (ABSL) looking at the Business Services Sector in Poland found that between the beginning of 2013 and early 2014, 66 new SSCs with foreign capital have launched operations in Poland. Employment in the sector has also more than doubled since 2012.</p>
<p>“Poland is attractive for a number of reasons. First and foremost, proximity to your global markets is important. Corporates coming from Asia and the Americas to Europe are looking for a location that allows them to access all of those markets from one site. Poland’s skilled people are another draw – both the education level and professionalism of employees in Poland are at a very high standard. It is relatively easy to come to Poland and set up business, and economically, it is quite stable. So the country has a lot of factors working in its favour,” explains Rijs.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, some of the Central and Eastern European markets that are in the process of adapting to international business standards, such as Turkey – and even the transcontinental Republic of Kazakhstan, are now leapfrogging their Western counterparts. “They have quickly embraced digitisation to simplify cash management, since they are not dogged by legacy systems and infrastructure,” says Rijs. “Turkey is also a pioneer in the e-invoicing space, having mandated the practice for certain companies from January 2014, together with the electronic filing of their accounts. What’s more, the country has embraced digital supply chain finance solutions as part of its e-invoicing initiative.”</p>
<p>Turkey is also proving to be a keen rival to the textile manufacturers in Asia, as European firms sourcing from China are now looking for a low-cost manufacturing base closer to home. “The irony with the pace of globalisation and the advance of technology is that it has actually changed the ‘acceptable’ lead times on products. Buyers are no longer prepared to wait three or four months for their goods to arrive from China. In the age of instant communication and growing focus on corporate sustainability, it is far preferable to have your goods travelling a shorter distance and arriving much sooner.”</p>
<h3 id=""making-the-grade"">Making the grade</h3>
<p>For treasurers, the message here is that flexibility will be key when building next generation global cash management structures. With traditional manufacturing and SSC locations set to change, the ability to seamlessly incorporate new countries and currencies will be vital, but the added-value will be having real-time visibility over the company’s cash – and the ability to take informed decisions on the back of that information, wherever you are in the world.</p>
<p>“Achieving this will only be made easier by working with a banking partner that can follow the enormous speed of changing regulations, understand the dynamic economic environment, and leverage technological innovation, whilst grasping the challenges of global business within the context of a local market,” concludes Rijs.</p>

<br/>
<p>Cline Zhang joined Citi China in April 2004 and has worked in various roles including Country Liquidity and Investment Product Head and Trade Product Head and Regional Cash Product Manager. Zhang expanded her role to be Deputy Branch Manager of Citi Shanghai Branch in February 2013 and was appointed as Shanghai Free Trade Zone Branch Manager in November 2013. Before joining Citi, Zhang worked in the credit card centre of Bank of China for four years.</p>

<p>Given the pace at which the Chinese financial authorities are now liberalising foreign currency (FCY) activity in the country, it may soon be necessary to stop referring to it as ‘the dawn of a new era’ in liquidity management for multinational corporates (MNCs) and to start thinking in terms of a point later in the metaphorical day.</p>
<p>The fact is that as exchange controls in China bow out one by one, the threats of regulatory trapped cash and burdensome paperwork for corporates correspondingly fill the history books. The country is open for business in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Following a successful trial in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ), since 1<sup>st</sup> June 2014, companies based anywhere in China have been able to establish, with relative ease, centralised FCY cash management programmes. This move by China’s foreign exchange regulator, the State Administration for Foreign Exchange (SAFE), is yet another example of how the Chinese authorities are intelligently managing the lessening of foreign exchange restrictions rather than shocking the system with rapid-fire releases of untested programmes.</p>
<p>Indeed, although approved MNCs with accumulations of onshore foreign currency have been permitted to execute two-way transactions independent of the SFTZ since 2012, the June 2014 actions taken by SAFE further diminished the reporting burdens imposed on those companies and can be seen as a measured response to an obvious commercial need. Now, all qualified MNCs are free to establish payment-on-behalf-of (POBO) or receipt-on-behalf-of (ROBO) structures simply by submitting a single request to their local SAFE branch.</p>
<p>Citi’s Head of Liquidity Management Services, China, and SFTZ Branch Manager, Cline Zhang, has first-hand experience of the changes being implemented by the Chinese authorities. In essence, she sees SAFE as taking positive steps to simplify cross-border transactions, including those around cross-border import/export and trade services transactions. There is, she notes, also a higher level of support for capital account liberalisation for corporates and banks based in the SFTZ aimed at reducing funding costs for ‘mainland’ firms (those in the rest of China) and giving foreign capital greater freedom in accessing the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Of importance too, says Zhang, is how the authorities are now starting to move towards more capital liberalisation. “SAFE is starting to open doors to allow China companies to operate two-way cross-border pooling,” she notes. “It means they can borrow from and lend to offshore registered companies which will reduce their finance costs and provide efficiencies for their daily operations.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-real-solution"">A real solution</h3>
<p>The importance of the involvement of locally-based major institutions such as Citi in shaping the progressive foreign currency environment in China should not be underestimated. In 2012, when SAFE started to consider cross-border POBO/ROBO structures, Citi was invited to participate in regulatory framework discussions, says Zhang. The input was not just based on Citi’s own international banking perspective; at the time Citi worked closely with SAFE to help provide feedback on “real business needs” from the bank’s corporate clients; something it continues to do. The obvious end result of this co-operative approach from all stakeholders is a practical framework for companies.</p>
<p>This translates into a simplified SAFE foreign currency programme around cross-border pooling, for example, that meets the dual needs of China ‘mainland’ and SFTZ-based businesses, whereas the RMB programme (managed by the Peoples Bank of China) has divergent criteria in terms of quota, qualification and filing/approval for SFTZ and the mainland.</p>
<p>In practical terms, SAFE FCY rules on cross-border pooling apply to both SFTZ and mainland firms. The limit on borrowing for corporates, for example, is equal to the total unused foreign debt quota (FDQ). The lending cap for both is set at 50% of total equity.</p>
<p>The rules on SAFE FCY qualification for cross-border pooling requires applicants to demonstrate cross-border receipts and payments of more than $100m in the previous year, and there must have been no material violation in FCY business in the past three years. A further qualification is for all participants to fall within SAFE’s Category A. Enterprises are classed based on their foreign exchange receipts and payments and their trade compliance with SAFE provisions. A is the highest grade.</p>
<p>Filing and approval, as mentioned above, simply requires submission of documents to the local SAFE office. SAFE has branches and offices in all cities and provinces across China.</p>
<h3 id=""opportunities"">Opportunities</h3>
<p>The work that has been carried out so far by SAFE and the other stakeholders around FCY, including Citi, is not just an exercise in administration; it has real value in terms of corporate opportunity, says Zhang. The desirability of uptake depends of course on a company’s cross-border settlement currency but she notes that businesses for whom it is applicable will find that they can reduce their cost of finance where they are permitted to borrow offshore. “They can also lower transaction costs,” she adds. “For example, where they operate a USD netting programme, FX costs can be reduced significantly.”</p>
<p>Companies will also be able to improve operational efficiency by implementing a POBO/ROBO facility to centralise transaction execution and, Zhang explains, it is increasingly viable to include China in a company’s global cross-border pooling programme. Of those corporates that have seen the opportunity here, the tendency so far is to focus on USD cross-border pooling “because it saves on finance costs; it is an immediate benefit for treasurers.”</p>
<p>As a trusted service provider, Citi is geared to helping its clients understand the business impact of the rules as they change, says Zhang. “We usually hold several client webinars as soon as there is new regulation announced,” she explains. For some clients, the bank is able to help build up communication channels with local SAFE officials. From this its position as an ‘on-the-ground’ intermediary – with a long history of active engagement with the financial authorities – Citi can actively provide feedback on client demand to SAFE to help build out future requirements, and of course relay any developments around the structure of regulation, and the appropriate response, back to its clients.</p>
<h3 id=""gathering-pace"">Gathering pace</h3>
<p>The discussion between stakeholders is ongoing and certain limitations still exist around FCY accounts, such as the quota controls mentioned above. “We understand the background of these limitations,” says Zhang. “The financial industry is very new and different for China; it is natural that any innovation or move towards de-regulation must be taken step by step.”</p>
<p>That it is taking a cautious approach to opening up the markets is entirely within reason. SAFE is likely to persist along the lines of de-regulation and capital liberalisation as China realises its support of real business needs and the advantages of reduced cost of finance. Indeed, the ‘open for business’ mantra received yet another boost in mid-February when PBOC unveiled another SFTZ regulation, this time allowing entities within the zone to borrow USD from offshore banks – news it shared alongside the announcement that it is also committed to looking for more flexibility around FX conversion.</p>
<p>The step-by-step approach to de-regulation in China seems to have moved up a notch in recent months, from a walking pace to a gentle jog. Whilst an out-and-out regulatory sprint is unlikely and indeed unadvisable, it is incumbent upon those with deep local knowledge of the financial space to stay ahead of the curve. For Zhang and Citi, this not only means understanding China’s local market developments and trend towards de-regulation, but it also requires the bank to maintain its position as a trusted advisor to its clients. “It is also vital that we provide optimal service and technology to ensure clients can run their businesses smoothly,” she asserts.</p>
<p>There is more work to be done before cross-border cash flows in and out of China are as comfortable a proposition for corporates as they are in Singapore or Hong Kong, for example. As the pace of regulatory change in China gathers momentum, corporates looking to extract maximum advantage should be looking to build a long-term plan and would do well to seek out a banking partner with the reach and connections to stay ahead of the game.</p>
<p>There is no doubt now that the Chinese regulators are firmly committed to supporting trade and easing FCY transaction risks faced by businesses operating in the country. “Corporates can already benefit from de-regulation of cross-border FCY controls,” states Zhang. “China is no longer a ‘trapped-liquidity’ country. Entities here can safely include it within their regional or global treasury scope, allowing them to leverage centrally managed inter-group funding via FCY cross-border pooling.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>If you are a corporate treasurer working in Asia, short-term investment strategies will almost certainly have been front of mind in recent years.</em></p>
<p>Wherever one looks, corporate cash piles are on an upward trajectory. Right now, non-financial companies in the Asia Pacific region are sitting on more idle cash – an average of $4.2 billion each – than firms from any other region listed in the S&amp;P Global 1200. In South Korea, companies have around $270 billion idle on the balance sheet, while in China, the largest 500 companies have $405 billion. Japanese companies are the most cash rich of all, meanwhile, with a stockpile close to $3 trillion.</p>
<p>The question of what to do with such sizable cash balances is by no means a straightforward one, particularly in Asia. In this region, corporates have different financial infrastructures to negotiate; investment strategies – and the products and solutions which facilitate them – must therefore be tailored to different currency markets and different banking systems governed by different rules. Such diversity presents corporate investors with opportunities, for sure. But it also creates significant challenges.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-flux"">Regulatory flux</h3>
<p>We will turn to regulatory matters first. Asia’s famously heterogeneous regulatory regimes remain the most salient feature of the regional liquidity landscape, governing to a large extent what a business can or cannot do in terms of investment. In India, for example, interest payments on current accounts are prohibited, while in China interest is allowed but the pricing is regulated.</p>
<p>Change is in the air, however. The big story, as everyone surely knows by now, is China. Rewind several years and establishing any kind of liquidity pooling structure for renminbi (RMB) cash balances was close to impossible. In fact, moving any money in or out of China meant jumping through various bureaucratic hoops as set out by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). Not any more. Cross-border two-way sweeping – in RMB or foreign currency – is now commonplace across China, having been successfully piloted first in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) over the course of 2013.</p>

<p>“The entire cross-border commercial activity which was previously restricted in China is now completely allowed,” says Sandip Patil, Regional Head of Liquidity &amp; Investments, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, Asia. “If a multinational has a surplus in China and your subsidiary in Singapore is in deficit, they can now do inter-company lending and, vice-versa.” The increasing liberty businesses enjoy when handling Chinese yuan is reflected in the growing numbers using it for the purpose of trade and treasury funding. At the end of January, SWIFT reported that the currency overtook both the Canadian and Australian dollar as a global payment currency and, is now at number five globally.”</p>
<p>Although what’s happening in China has naturally dominated the headlines over recent months, they are not the only Asian country with a liberalisation agenda. “We have been seeing a similar trend in cross-border freedom being given to our customers across many markets including Malaysia and Thailand. It is certainly not fully liberal but it is directionally suggestive,” says Patil. What this means is that wherever your business is operating in Asia today, it is gradually becoming easier to put in place an efficient liquidity structure for corporates compared to the past. This liberalisation coupled with the growing cross-border businesses and better technology tools are the right reasons for clients to pursue treasury centralisation agenda, not just in Asia, but worldwide.</p>
<h3 id=""the-bear-stearns-rule"">The ‘Bear Stearns rule’</h3>
<p>Rules may be loosening in areas like foreign exchange, but in others – such as the banking industry – we are seeing just the opposite. The beginning of this year marked the introduction of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under Basel III, designed to ensure that banks have sufficient assets on hand to withstand any liquidity crunch the market might throw at them. It is expected that this will have a profound impact on both the structure of the banking sector across Asia and the various products and services it provides to corporates.</p>
<p>“Basel III obviously has an impact on the value of cash,” says Karin Flinspach, Head of Cash Products at Standard Chartered. The LCR requires banks to hold sufficient levels of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover their total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. This will change completely the view banks take on corporate deposits. Operational deposits will continue to be sought-after, but non-operational deposits, which have been assigned a higher run-off rate due to their perception as being less stable, are becoming a far less attractive proposition under the new rules.</p>
<p>Differences will also begin to emerge in how corporate deposits are treated from bank to bank, given the disparities we can observe in the pace of compliance across Asia’s banking sector. “There will be Basel III compliant banks, and non-Basel III compliant banks, and there will be a difference in the value of cash at each of these institutions,” says Flinspach.</p>
<p>A situation like this puts Asia’s corporate investors in quite an unenviable position. As we have seen, idle cash on corporate balance sheets is accumulating fast and banks are actively discouraging, through higher pricing, the depositing of anything other than operational balances.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-term-deposits"">Beyond term deposits</h3>
<p>Bank deposits have long been the ‘go to’ liquidity solution for corporates in Asia. Might the regulatory changes we are currently witnessing precipitate a shift away from this model and greater uptake of alternative solutions, such as money market funds (MMFs)? That is a possibility. Interest in MMFs has been lukewarm in Asia in recent years since, following the financial crisis, many treasury mandates were changed limiting treasurers to use only bank deposits insured by governments. Moreover, with the market on many local currency MMFs – Thai baht or Indian rupee, for example – not especially deep or liquid, the difference between yields was minimal. There was simply very little incentive for treasurers to invest in MMFs, even if they were mandated to do so under treasury policy.</p>

</figure>
<p>“I think that is slowly changing now,” says Martijn Stoker, Head of Liquidity and Escrow Product, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan. “The Basel III rules where the short-term deposit is seen as wholesale funding, it’s becoming much less attractive for banks and, as such, pricing is becoming less aggressive especially with the large international banks.” As a result, mutual funds such as MMFs are now beginning to regain ground lost during the financial crisis, largely as a result of funds flowing out of bank deposits and seeking higher returns. “There is definitely a shift happening, and I think it will accelerate once the regional and local banks adapt to a similar regulatory framework.”</p>
<p>However, even accounting for regulatory forces, there seems to be little chance of Asia’s MMF industry developing to size where it rivals its counterparts in the US or Europe – unless something extraordinary happens that is. According to the Investment Company Institute’s (ICI) Q314 report, Asian mutual funds represent a mere 12% of mutual fund assets worldwide, compared with 31% in Europe and 57% for the Americas. Clearly, this is an industry still in the early stages of development.</p>
<h3 id=""new-rules-new-products"">New rules, new products</h3>
<p>Rumours of the demise in bank deposits across Asia may have been somewhat exaggerated, therefore. Product design in the banking sector has not taken long to catch up with the latest rule changes, in any case. Visit any one of your bank managers to open an account today and you will be faced with an almost bewildering array of options, including newly rolled out ‘rules-based liquidity’ or ‘Basel-friendly’ products, now being used to grow balances with attractive LCR value.</p>
<p>These come in various forms and configurations, but each ultimately shares the same objective: incentivising the type of corporate deposits that will receive favorable treatment under Basel III’s LCR. J.P. Morgan’s Liquidity Management Account (LMA), for example, measures the stability of client accounts over time, and then rewards them accordingly. If the balance remains consistently above a certain level – let’s say $10m – then everything below that level will be subject to a higher rate, not the overnight rate. “That’s how we encourage clients to leave their more stable balances with us, because they add value to the bank’s balance sheet,” says Stoker.</p>
<p>Citi has implemented Basel III recommendations and as a result, also recently added a suite of LCR-friendly accounts to its product range (for example, the 31-day notice account, is an evergreen deposit account with 31 day withdrawal notice feature for breakage). “On one hand, it helps the bank raise LCR friendly deposits and on the other, helps the clients gain better yields for their short-term surplus deposits,” says Citi’s Patil. “So far there has been a good reaction from the market” he adds. Citi has implemented a number of changes to its services and offering as a result of these developments and these changes are likely to be replicated by the broader market participants.</p>
<h3 id=""a-region-coming-together"">A region coming together?</h3>
<p>All of Asia’s diversity notwithstanding, we can identify several distinct trends affecting the cash and liquidity landscape and, within that, corporate liquidity strategies and solutions. The regulatory landscape is changing with countries, liberalising restrictions around trade and FX, allowing corporates, more and more, to manage their liquidity on a par with their operations in western economies. The implantation of global banking regulation, meanwhile, is driving banks to be more creative with the solutions they devise for their corporate customers.</p>
<p>Knowing all of this, can we find an answer to the conundrum that is where to put Asia’s cash mountain? That will vary between companies. What works for a large US-domiciled corporate treasury that enjoys the most sophisticated of technological set-ups, will not necessarily play as well in the treasury of a smaller Malaysian mid-cap corporate, of course.</p>
<p>For the majority of MNCs, however, the best advice would be to make the most of cash balances across the group. Deregulation in China, particularly, has presented corporates with a fantastic opportunity to begin establishing pooling structures in RMB. Similar initiatives to increase economic competitiveness are taking place in Malaysia and Thailand. If trapped cash can be released from subsidiaries in surplus to fund other parts of the group with deficits then the corporate will be operating much more efficiently.</p>
<p>If having done all of this and there is still excess sitting on the balance sheet, however, then it may be worthwhile exploring either MMFs or what the banks call their ‘rules-based’ family of products to ensure that value isn’t being lost as a result of unfavourable pricing and low yields. The decision is for the treasurer to make, but the clock is ticking.</p>

<p>In this webinar learn how TYROLIT reduced their intercompany transactions through their banks by over 90%. TYROLIT’s cash management and payments processes were fragmented, with each of the company’s subsidiaries maintaining its own banking relationships. The introduction of the Eurozone provided a first opportunity to consolidate the banking landscape and optimise the payment processes of the company’s seven entities within the zone. In fact, the company was an early mover in setting up a euro cash pool, and has seen the potential for enormous annual savings as a result.</p>
<p>SEPA was seen as a further chance not only to optimise the company’s cash management set-up in the SEPA area, but worldwide. Again, TYROLIT was a relatively early mover in this space and saw SEPA as a significant opportunity to critically evaluate and challenge existing payment behaviours and structures.</p>
<p>During this webinar Franz Bramböck explains how this lean treasury department has been transformed from a cost centre into a profit centre by combining several solutions, including cash pooling, intercompany netting and centralised FX management. Franz also shares his thoughts on lessons learned throughout the transformation, his plans for a payments factory, as well as explaining the benefits for the company, and its business partners.</p>
<p>This webinar was held on Wednesday 11th February 2015.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Imagine a bank offering that can help rationalise the number of physical accounts held by a company and also allow that company to simplify the management of its accounts. Imagine also if that same solution enabled a business to gain superior visibility over its cash and liquidity and head off accounts receivable (AR) and reconciliation issues at a stroke. And all this without adding layers of complexity or expensive technology.</p>
<p>By most treasurers’ standards, it would seem like a rather good idea. And yet, even though such an offering already exists, the virtual account is far from being mainstream.</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-a-virtual-account"">What is a virtual account?</h3>
<p>Along with their associated account ‘numbers’ (or, perhaps more correctly, ‘identifiers’), virtual accounts are provided to a corporate by its banking partner. Essentially each account is a ‘subsidiary’ or sub-account of the client’s own physical account with the bank; they cannot exist outside of that immediate relationship, hence they are virtual. The identifier serves to segregate any funds from any other funds in the same main account and yet is inextricably linked to that account.</p>
<p>The key to a virtual account is thus the virtual account number/identifier. This may be provided to the client by the bank (in which case it will typically be structured like an IBAN) or to the bank by the client. If the client provides the identifier, it will commonly adopt customer identifiers – customer account numbers, for example – drawn from its own system of record such as an ERP or TMS. Either way, it eases subsequent integration of account data into those systems, potentially facilitating the full automation of payments and collections processes, which for in-house banks, payments on behalf of (POBO) and collections on behalf of (COBO) operations, is just perfect. It may also be possible for the client to generate virtual accounts using its bank’s online ‘self-service’ tool.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the accounts and their identifiers are created, each one will be uniquely assigned by the corporate to each of its own customers that it wishes to bring into the structure (in a large business this may be both external and internal). In theory there is no limit to the number of virtual accounts that a corporate may append to one of its physical accounts and it is entirely feasible to establish a multi-level hierarchy of virtual accounts to mirror the structure of its business relationships.</p>
<h3 id=""why-go-virtual"">Why go virtual?</h3>
<p>Typically, virtual bank accounts will be used to manage the allocation and reconciliation of high-volume, low-value transactions. According to Finnish banking technology vendor, Tieto, they may also be used in a supply chain context “to satisfy reconciliation requirements for supplier remittances and receipts”. The vendor says that virtual bank accounts can also be used “where customer pre-funding for an activity is required, such as investments”.</p>
<p>In the European market there is a serious driver for the adoption of such a solution right now. As part of the technology preparations for SEPA, many companies have been busy centralising their payments and collections processes. The pressure to re-engineer these processes has inevitably given rise to concerns around receivables, credit and risk processes. This ‘need’ is propelled further by the desire also to draw on internal liquidity rather than rely on bank funding. Anything that can enhance the mechanisms of payments and collections factories must surely be a welcome source of relief.</p>
<p>In the banking space, RBS has been offering virtual accounts to its corporate clients in Asia since 2011. Development and roll-out has taken place in the region because it is home to a number of jurisdictions where, says Vanessa Manning, EMEA Head of Payments and Cash Management, RBS, “local clearing truncates so much information that customers were unable to easily adopt straight-through reconciliation processes”. RBS is not alone in thinking this is a good idea – institutions such as HSBC, Deutsche Bank, UniCredit (see case study below), Allied Irish Bank, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), as well as providers such as Korea Exchange Bank and Indonesia’s Bank Mandiri, all offer virtual accounts in Asia, for example.</p>
<p>Wherever a business may operate, most are focused on accelerating their cash conversion cycle – applying cash faster and improving their reconciliation and DSO (days’ sales outstanding), notes Manning. Increased DSO obviously has a negative impact on working capital requirements, just as failure to reconcile remittances efficiently can lead to chasing payment from a customer who has already paid – streamlining the credit control process is vital in establishing an accurate picture of individual client and overall income, not just in being able to extend credit to good payers but in quickly tackling delinquent accounts.</p>
<p>Many businesses are also focused on the consolidation and rationalisation of their bank accounts: virtual accounts can be used to eliminate the need for many physical accounts. This can reduce counterparty risk (especially where smaller local banks are used) and remove associated account management costs. “A virtual account has a far lower impact in terms of the cost, central bank reporting and audit requirements than a physical bank account has,” comments Manning. But it is not just the immediate cost that is saved. Fewer accounts can mean increased standardisation and automation of processes which in turn facilitates automatic processing and matching which is faster, more accurate and cheaper than doing it manually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, virtual bank accounts will be used to manage the allocation and reconciliation of high volume, low value transactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BofAML is currently piloting its virtual account offering with a number of large corporate clients and, says Ad Van der Poel, Co-Head of Product Management, Global Transaction Services, EMEA, for BofAML, businesses are expressing interest in the concept, mostly around receivables reconciliation.</p>
<h3 id=""not-just-an-ar-tool"">Not just an AR tool</h3>
<p>Banks offering virtual accounts are unlikely to let the concept rest without further development. In the context of receivables reconciliation, virtual accounts may be, as Van der Poel says, “just a very granular level of reporting”, but he argues that the centralisation of treasury or set up of shared services centres to handle both COBO and POBO really does have mileage.</p>
<p>By opening virtual accounts for each entity within a group and appending sub-level virtual accounts to these, clients of those entities can effectively remit to a central account (whether national, regional or global) using their own unique virtual account identifier. “In this case it is not so much used to identify the payer but more as a tool for visibility and control over what each entity is doing,” explains Van der Poel. As a variation on (or even replacement of) the pooling concept, it can facilitate genuine benefits around liquidity management.</p>
<h3 id=""in-practice"">In practice</h3>
<p>With high-volume, low-value payments being the bread and butter of virtual account deployment, Van der Poel offers an example of how they might be used in this context.</p>
<p>A business may own real estate in three countries, with multiple properties in each country and multiple tenants in each of those properties. That business may have a single bank account in its name, or one for each country. If the tenants of each property pay their rent into the bank account, in some cases it may be difficult for the business to identify where certain payments come from and what they represent. In this example, it could be that the tenant did not complete the payment details correctly or it may be that the banks involved in the process (including the clearing bank which may limit the number of characters permissible in the reference field of a payment instruction) either did not have access to or pass on all the invoice data. Payee error tends to occur more in the consumer space than in the professional accounts payable function but errors do occur nonetheless.</p>
<p>To resolve the problem for the property owner in the example, one physical deposit demand account (DDA) could be established in the owner’s name and one virtual account could be created for each country. Below each country level, one virtual account could be set up for each property in each country. Taking this down another level, it would be possible to then create a virtual account for the tenant in each property. This hierarchy of accounts may sound complex but in reality there is only one physical account supporting that structure. In the example, each tenant pays into the account assigned to them, which is connected to the property’s account, upwards to the country account and on to the physical account. Payment at the tenant end shows immediately in the physical account.</p>
<p>As another example of how a business might benefit from the adoption of virtual accounts, consider the franchise business model, says Van der Poel. The franchisor is in a central position, supporting its network of franchisees with goods and services for which the latter must at some point be invoiced. If the franchisee is typically paid in cash (as for example a fast food restaurant would be), it will normally have a bilateral agreement with a cash collection service, there being many such agreements across the full franchise territory.</p>
<p>However, the franchisor could make a bilateral agreement with a cash collection agency to collect and deposit into virtual accounts cash from all of its franchisees across a certain territory – each franchisee having its own unique identifier and account linked to the central DDA held by the franchisor. Via the virtual accounts, it could net-off its invoices for goods and services payable by the franchisee, paying out the balance. “If the franchisor takes the idea no further than this, it will still offer savings around the cash collection process, provide it with increased visibility over all funds coming in at a centralised level, and make savings across the whole invoice-to-pay process.”</p>
<h3 id=""rules-and-regulations"">Rules and regulations</h3>
<p>“Any centralised receivables programme which would see a company regionally collecting into one account on behalf of other jurisdictions would continue to have the normal tax and legal consequences for ‘on behalf of’ traffic,” says Manning (referring to both COBO and POBO models). Adoption of the model “does not mitigate nor cause any new actions”. However, she adds, “the need remains for banks to work with customers to make them aware of transactions that can be done onshore, offshore or on-behalf of, and the considerations around that.”</p>
<p>Indeed, says Van der Poel, “it is important to consider that virtual accounts are not yet subject to direct regulation”. Although nothing has yet been formalised, industry hearsay suggests that virtual accounts have attracted the regulators’ attention around their use as a POBO mechanism (but not COBO). “Because a virtual account doesn’t really exist in its own right, this forces an interesting discussion,” he comments. “We need to keep an eye on how regulation evolves and on what the opportunities or limitations may be.”</p>
<p>Each bank will thus need to undertake “full and proper legal, regulatory and tax analysis” in each country in this respect.</p>
<h3 id=""too-good-to-be-true"">Too good to be true?</h3>
<p>As a relatively easy add-on to a normal corporate bank account, the virtual account concept can deliver a raft of efficiencies around account ownership and management. For the treasurer it means being able to centralise cash whilst retaining some segregation and delineation without the increased complexity and cost of running physical accounts. For the finance function in general it can accelerate collections and release liquidity from a corporate’s internal working capital flow by reducing the dependency on information from the payer, their bank or clearing institution. It can also give broader and deeper real-time visibility over physical account data and enhance the credit control process. Still too good to be true?</p>

<p class=""management-summary"">Through its SAP-based in-house bank and payments factory, global healthcare market giant, Germany-based B. Braun is able to receive payments files and make payments on behalf of (POBO) transactions for around 100 group entities throughout the Eurozone using SEPA and working with different banking partners. The plan is to include Singapore and the US in the near future and eventually roll this out to most of the group’s 200+ entities located in more than 60 countries.</p>
<p>As part of B. Braun’s HR function, some locally managed payroll payments are, for a variety of reasons, made in-country, not through its SAP-based payments factory. In such cases it has adopted the virtual account solution provided by UniCredit. “Creating a virtual account is very easy; the bank gives us access to an online portal, we say what we want and that’s it; we can start work,” explains Rainer Stirn, Head of Treasury – Cash Management for B. Braun.</p>
<p>Currently UniCredit is providing each in-country HR unit with its own IBAN-based virtual account number, aligned with a single ‘real’ account held by group headquarters. This enables each entity to send its payment files (which could contain several hundred individual payments) via headquarters to the bank which will make the payments (via SEPA), finally debiting the ‘real’ account.</p>
<p>“The advantage for us is that headquarters receives an electronic bank statement referencing each virtual account transaction. Our SAP system is able to post these items automatically to the correct in-house cash account,” notes Stirn. For him, the solution has quickly and easily provided a “perfect loop” for these payments. Although it handles most major currencies, he notes that SEPA has worked extremely well with the virtual concept “with few adjustments required”, SAP and the whole infrastructure having already been set up to process these payments.</p>
<p>The next phase of the roll-out of the virtual account solution will enable B. Braun to process incoming payments from customers via its centralised collections on behalf of (COBO) operation. This will use much the same system as for payments but in reverse. Each entity in the group has its own IBAN-based virtual account number linked to its own in-house bank account. This means that when an invoice is paid using the virtual account number, the system will automatically credit the in-house bank account of the relevant entity. The in-house bank is able to send to the group entity that is being paid an electronic in-house bank statement containing all the details to enable it to clear the open item on its own books. “The final goal is to concentrate the outgoing and incoming payments so that group companies only have an account with our in-house bank” says Stirn.</p>
<p>With multiple bank accounts for group companies and a multi-currency cash-pooling structure, B. Braun is working to reduce that complexity and reduce the number of local bank accounts it needs, notably those opened just to handle foreign currency receipts by group entities. Whilst he admits that it might not work everywhere, now that virtual accounts can centralise cash automatically, Stirn views cash pooling as “a product from former times”. He believes that centralisation using virtual accounts offers considerable savings in terms of time spent managing bank accounts and that most real accounts and cash-pooling transfers suddenly become unnecessary. It is a cost and efficiency saving that B. Braun fully intends to exploit.</p>

<p>At Roche, we had already established an in-house bank (IHB) and centralised our treasury operations for many years, so developing a collections-on-behalf-of (COBO) structure was the next logical step. When we were setting up our COBO in assorted countries, it was very helpful that subsidiaries were already used to working with the IHB and therefore had trust in our services. They needed confidence that we can collect customer payments at least as well as they can, and that we run reliable and robust IHB-processes.</p>
<p>In regards to COBO, the key point is fast and automated reconciliation of accounts receivable (AR). If a company runs one central euro account for many countries, in order to reconcile payments it has to be able to identify which customer is paying which subsidiary.</p>
<p>Thanks to Deutsche Bank, we were able to put in place a virtual account structure that ultimately feeds all euro-payments into our central euro account. With this solution, each customer makes payments using a unique International Bank Account Number (IBAN), allowing Roche to identify which customer is paying which entity. For us, this was the vital component to establishing a reliable COBO structure. In the meantime, this solution won this year’s Treasury Today Adam Smith Award for the Best AP/AR Solution.</p>
<p>We did encounter some local obstacles to setting up a COBO structure. For example, the Federation of Finnish Financial Services (FFFS) defines standards to optimise payments between corporates and banks, including a barcode system for invoices, allowing the customer to make an automated payment. But this barcode system only works with a Finnish IBAN. As a result, we are not able to reroute the collections of one of our Finnish entities to our central euro account outside Finland. It is an obstacle which conflicts with the concept of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) – which is supposed to harmonise the payments environment in the euro area – and one which we are currently engaging with the regulators in order to overcome.</p>

<h5 id=""basak-toprak-director-citi-treasury-and-trade-solutions"">Basak Toprak, Director, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions:</h5>
<p>The main challenges around COBO structures are similar to those that corporates face with POBO. Having said that more corporates have established POBO structures to date. The main reason for this is the fact that corporates have advanced quicker in centralising payments versus collections. Collections are generally handled by local businesses, where the knowledge of customer relationships exist. Companies have now started looking at how to further benefit from their shared service centres (SSCs) by centralising their receivables processes, and COBO is a natural part of this evolution.</p>
<p>In a COBO structure, the agent (usually the IHB entity) collects the assets belonging to other entities. A COBO set-up helps to achieve not only bank account reductions but facilitates centralisation of reconciliation activities and can lead to better credit management. There are several structural considerations related to COBO set-ups, which can be grouped into four themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Legal, regulatory and tax considerations:</h5>
<p>It is important for the corporate to find out whether the participating entities are allowed to operate under a COBO model, and what if any are the reporting or central bank approval requirements. In some countries in Asia or CIS, for example, the regulators simply do not permit COBO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Accounting:</h5>
<p>Companies who set up POBO/COBO structures do so in an IHB environment. The IHB act as a single entity under which all the business units perform their financial transactions. POBO/COBO structures result in inter-company loans, so these need to be accounted for in an IHB structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reconciliation:</h5>
<p>Automatically identifying who has paid for what invoice is a challenging area for corporates even without a COBO structure. With a COBO structure, you have the added complexity of receiving funds into a single account and therefore you rely on the sender to include details as to which entity they are paying to. Banks and technology companies can provide solutions to support this process in the way of reconciliation tools, such as data enrichment and matching services, as well as virtual accounts, where each debtor is given a unique account number into which they make their payment. Furthermore, SEPA introduces Ultimate Creditor (UC) and Ultimate Debtor (UD) fields which support POBO/COBO payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Technology:</h5>
<p>Companies who embark upon setting up POBO/COBO structures typically have a single instance ERP environment, which helps to support inter-company reconciliation, as well as real-time updating of assets and liabilities based on payment information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The migration to SEPA in particular has increased the number of companies exploring COBO. However, to date live implemented examples of COBO are very limited. We expect that once companies meet the migration requirements of SEPA, they will look at leveraging SEPA to introduce further efficiencies to their working capital management structure. At that point, COBO will be a key topic.</p>

<h5 id=""ad-van-der-poel-bank of-america-merrill-lynch"">Ad Van der Poel, Head of Payments and Receivables, EMEA, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch:</h5>
<p>Corporates will likely encounter a number of obstacles when attempting to set up a COBO structure. Firstly, receivables have always been local processes and, as a result, corporates will still have to implement different receivables instruments in different jurisdictions, which would reduce the benefits that could be gained by centralising them.</p>
<p>With the arrival of SEPA, however, this is now changing. With SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) for example, in principle there is one standardised receivables instrument across the Eurozone. So as a result, more companies are beginning to explore the COBO concept.</p>
<p>A second obstacle is the resistance that is often encountered within an organisation. Local sales entities, which are focused on revenues, will often resist because they want to retain some form of control over their revenues through receivables. Therefore, in my opinion, an internal education process needs to happen. It is for that reason that COBO has not developed as fast as payments-on-behalf-of (POBO).</p>
<p>Thirdly, the big incentives for centralising receivables are efficiency improvements, better rates and improved reconciliation. But many of these benefits take time to realise, whereas some businesses want the benefits to materialise immediately. To get it right companies need to fine-tune the process and establish the structure step-by-step.</p>
<p>When companies overcome these obstacles they may encounter more practical difficulties. A company that is introducing a COBO structure will have to consider how they are going to do mandates-on-behalf-of and what the language requirements will entail. As a corporate, it might be easier for mandates to be in one language, such as English. However, there may be regulations that require it to be in the local language. This is just one of many practical issues which may arise once a company begins attempting to implement a COBO structure.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Arn Knol"" height=""150"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/cash-management/2013-10-tt-02-qa-arn-knol-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=F15DCAF19A01BA489EA145BF6BBDC926"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""arn-knol-treasury-consultant-zanders"">Arn Knol, Treasury Consultant, Zanders:</h5>
<p>In recent years many corporates have set up payment factories, enabling them to implement POBO structures. Unfortunately, implementing a POBO model does not necessarily reduce the amount of external bank accounts required by the various business units – these accounts are not only used to make payments but also to receive funds. It is very common for corporates to have centralised their payment process in an IHB and/or payment factory, but still leave the management and responsibility of receivables at the local business unit level.</p>
<p>The COBO model can be used to overcome these issues. In this structure, a single bank account is used to receive funds for multiple business units. When the POBO and COBO model are both applied, a corporate will only require one single account per currency and/or country for all commercial payments and receivables across the group. This would enable massive savings in managing external bank accounts and the associated fees alone.</p>
<p>However, whereas the POBO model has been adopted by many corporates, the COBO model is not nearly as popular. What are the reasons for this? The biggest problem with the COBO model is that, when examining the IT infrastructure at most large corporates, the receivables data is maintained at the local business unit level. This creates a massive challenge. If one bank account is used for collections for multiple business units, which must execute the reconciliation at the local level, how do we then determine which receivable belongs to which business unit?</p>
<p>The COBO model, therefore, requires a far greater level of change compared to the POBO model. One of the strengths of the POBO model is that it can be implemented at the centre with relatively little impact on the local business units. This is not the case for the COBO model, which requires more centralisation and is therefore more difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Does this mean that a company should not consider the COBO model? No, the gains in efficiencies and the possible savings that can be achieved using the COBO model are clear. As it stands today, for many corporates the POBO model represents the “where we are”, while the COBO model represents the “where we want to go”.</p>

<h5 id=""violeta-negruta-emea-market-manager-cash-management-rbs-international-banking"">Violeta Negruta, EMEA Market Manager, Cash Management, RBS International Banking:</h5>
<p>Over the past few years, corporate treasurers have been on a constant quest for improved operational efficiency, working capital management and, most recently, increased enterprise-wide co-operation to create value.</p>
<p>With the advent of new technologies, standardised payment methods in Europe (ie the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)) and improved capabilities in ERP/TMS systems, treasurers have started exploring opportunities to consolidate payments and accounting functions into one payment/collection factory solution.</p>
<p>Corporations that have successfully centralised their payments into such a structure have certainly achieved significant benefits, including a single euro fund account structure, improved controls and risk, standardised processes, visibility over cash, and, of course cost reductions.</p>
<p>Today, through the standardisation of collection methods in Europe, driven by SEPA, corporate treasurers are seeking the next level of enterprise-wide operational efficiency. Historically, the centralisation of collections had been considered very complex, due to differences in collection methods across jurisdictions in terms of execution times, indemnities, mandates and refunds.</p>
<p>But the implementation of SEPA will now allow treasurers to operate one single collection process within the EU for both domestic and cross-border collections, reducing their costs in the process.</p>
<p>This single solution can therefore not only streamline European payments and collections via SEPA B2B and B2C direct debits, but also domestic and international payments, thereby empowering treasurers with collection predictability. Such a centralised treasury model is increasingly key to improving corporate cash flow and optimising working capital.</p>
<p>Receivables outstanding and their reconciliation (ie who has and hasn’t paid and on whose behalf the collection has been made) have their own challenges as the information is not always transmitted end-to-end, resulting in an inability to automatically execute a specific transaction. As a result, existing credit lines to a customer may be tied up.</p>
<p>The ISO 20022 XML format, however, provides an ‘on behalf of’ (OBO) structured field to identify the entity on whose behalf a collection is being processed, enabling automated reconciliation without the need to query the collection. This enables treasurers to improve collection rates, reduce receivables outstanding and ensure timeliness of payments across jurisdictions from a single collection location. It also allows central treasurers to move towards a single euro account structure, streamlining their collection processes and reducing costs.</p>
<p>However, there are still some differences in countries’ domestic payments processes, which will continue beyond the 1<sup>st</sup> of February 2014 in the eurozone; so, full centralisation may not be achieved immediately.</p>
<p>The centralisation of credit management and the ability to handle the entire direct debit lifecycle of the collection factory – from issuing the pre-notification and creating the direct debit mandate, through to documentation, calendar, customer correspondence and rejections – will enable a corporate’s sale force to realise significant additional cost benefits, as they will have more capacity to focus on strategic business development and customer relationships.</p>
<p>For a successful collection factory set-up, one of the first steps is to identify all corporate bank accounts, banking connectivity channels, credit, collection and reconciliation processes across the globe – a process that more often than not provides new cash visibility and delivers an early win for the project.</p>
<p>Introducing OBO collections requires corporate systems infrastructure – usually a single ERP/TMS for one-time change – recognise fields correctly, apply cash to the correct bank account and post it to the respective intercompany account. Replacing multiple, diverse accounts receivable (AR) operations with a single source of information, enables a business to be far more efficient in terms of moving money to where it can be most effective, reducing errors, fraud and operational risk, improving days sales outstanding (DSO) and exploiting working capital.</p>
<p>The implementation of OBO, supported by a corporate’s in-house bank, requires an agreement between the central treasurer and its group’s businesses to determine the ownership and deployment of its cash. Additionally, the organisation and legal structure of the group are important to determine the legal and tax implications of OBO collections.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>By pulling cash and trade together, André Casterman, the new Head of Corporate and Supply Chain Markets for SWIFT, hopes the bank-to-bank, corporate-to-bank and now the corporate-to-corporate sectors will become one happy family. This structural realignment within the co-operative took place in December 2012. “We’ve followed the trend of global banks: pulling the two closer together into a transaction banking unit,” he explains, which gives more visibility to the not-always-easy-to-comprehend business of trade finance. The new approach is based on four pillars, the first relying on the core SWIFT offering of multi-bank connectivity for its 1000+ corporate members.</p>
<p>For those corporates that are multi-banked and which wish to have a channel (whether direct or via a service bureau) to reach their banks, SWIFT remains “the proven value proposition”. But there is more, states Casterman. “In order to increase the quality of payments and decrease the number and cost of rejections by banks, we have now extended our reference data product, SWIFTRef, to corporate users as well.”</p>
<p>SWIFTRef is a central repository of data built around payments reference codes and updated on a monthly basis by SWIFT. International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) and Bank Identifier Codes (BICs), for example, are linked together in the solution to ensure that when a payment leaves the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of the corporate “it guarantees that the corporate will have the minimum processing cost”. Having scoured the various reference lists from around the world – including national clearing codes – and cross-referencing the results for accuracy, SWIFT is enabling corporates to upload the data to their ERP systems. Currently, coverage extends to SAP systems, but other interfaces (Oracle, Microsoft, etc) will follow.</p>
<p>Contrary to the belief that SWIFT requires users to have access to the SWIFT infrastructure, the modernisation of the society sees it delivering new solutions as channel-independent offerings. SWIFTRef, for example, will typically see the corporate become a client of SWIFT, just as it might buy market data from Bloomberg or Reuters. Of course, banks are not cut out of the loop and they can buy a global licence from SWIFT enabling them to pass the data to their own corporate clients via web portal as an added-value feature motivated by “transaction quality”.</p>
<h3 id=""security-3skey-and-ebam"">Security: 3SKey and eBAM</h3>
<p>Another motivation is defeating the cyber-threat. To this end, SWIFT’s 3SKey (a purely commercial product) and electronic bank account management (eBAM) propositions – again, both independent of the SWIFT channel – have been aligned to offer technical standards “to organise personal security services”, so security connected directly to the individual, not the corporate or institution. 3SKey’s primary function is in validating payments instructions: confirming the level of individual access, how much can be signed-off and so on. A secondary use relates to administration purposes and this is where SWIFT’s re-structure has purposefully brought its eBAM offering into the same corporate services pillar as 3SKey.</p>
<p>The eBAM solution is intended to remove paper-based bank mandate management. 3SKey is a natural bedfellow in that electronic mandates can be digitally signed and the bank can validate the request. Both solutions can also be used to manage workflows within the corporate to ensure mandates are managed internally.</p>
<p>Plans for an eBAM and 3SKey central utility, where SWIFT would provide a multi-bank portal through which corporates could liaise with their banks, have been suspended indefinitely, says Casterman. The idea did not get as far as a practical offering. “We haven’t been able to attract sufficient interest from banks so we have put this idea on hold for the foreseeable future,” he explains. “We need to work at the pace of the market and in that market we couldn’t develop a business case.”</p>
<p>3SKey has to date only been adopted by French corporates, although it has been implemented around the world by these companies. BBVA, for example, announced last year that it had implemented 3SKey in six Latin American countries as well as Spain, Portugal, UK, France and Belgium, for its client, Airbus. “We now have banks in 50 countries getting ready or having adopted 3SKey,” says Casterman.</p>
<h3 id=""tsu-and-bpo"">TSU and BPO</h3>
<p>The fourth pillar of the new SWIFT structure brings in what Casterman refers to as “certainty and efficiency in the supply chain”. SWIFT’s Trade Service Utility (TSU) was launched in 2007 as a matching system for trade documents (letters of credit (LCs) or open account) so banks could provide funding at various stages throughout the progress of the physical supply chain (from order to payment). As part of the TSU bank-to-bank offering, in 2009 the Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) was introduced. This is an irrevocable obligation by a buyer’s bank to pay a specified amount to a seller’s bank upon completion of an agreed deal.</p>
<p>Until recently, BPO rules had been limited to banks acting on behalf of corporates. These rules have now been re-written to meet the standards of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and are set to be approved in April, giving it the same legal weight as a traditional LC.</p>
<p>ICC had offered the similar electronic Uniform Customs and Practice (eUCP) for documentary credits, which was an attempt at de-materialising documents by scanning them, but this was never used. BPO is a fully-fledged electronic document capable of fitting into an automated environment.</p>
<p>The ICC BPO moves SWIFT firmly into the corporate-to-corporate space, adding another option next to the LC, the demand guarantee, credit insurance and so on. Casterman, who sits on the executive committee of the ICC Banking Commission, co-chairing the BPO project, says LCs payments terms are linked to UCP 600 rules that govern the way banks exchange documents and data when executing LC requests from corporates. “The BPO is the same; it is a payment term implemented under the Unified Rules for Bank Payment Obligation (URBPO) for banks intermediating those transactions.”</p>
<p>ICC is the legal weight behind SWIFT’s messaging and matching technology for the BPO, although once again, corporate use of the ICC BPO does not require access to the SWIFT channel as it is brought to them via their banks (they will get a copy of the MT700, SWIFT’s message format for the LC) who will charge similar risk fees for its use.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study"">Case study</h2>
<h3 id=""bpo-in-action-bp-chemicals"">BPO in action: BP Chemicals</h3>
<p><em>BP Chemicals was one of the first corporates to use the BPO, adopting it in Q1 2012 and working with its Oman-based client, Octal and banking partner, Standard Chartered.</em></p>
<p>As one of the corporate representatives on the BPO workgroup, David Vermylen, Global Credit Manager at BP Chemicals, has been involved with its progress for some 18 months.  This has given him an up close and personal view of what it is capable of.  “When I started to analyse what a BPO was and what the TSU was doing in the context of a BPO, I started to realise that there were a number of benefits for the way we do business at BP Chemicals.”</p>
<p>The fact that it is electronic marks a “giant step” away from traditional paper-based transacting and in practical terms means messaging is almost instantaneous.  Indeed, once it has been established and there has been a successful matching of a baseline in a data set by SWIFT, then the BPO becomes operational.  This means it can be established a lot later in the process than paper-documentation.</p>
<p>An LC, for example, cannot be established after shipment, at least in the way BP Chemicals is working, as it tries to avoid letters of indemnity because they reduce the depth and level of security.  Firms buying from BP Chemicals on LC are required to produce documentation five to seven days before the ship sails, at which point the use of credit has already been established and the importer is already paying for it.  The BPO, however, can be easily delayed until the moment the bill of lading is secured from the freight forwarder, giving an instant five- to seven-day advantage.  It is even possible to establish the BPO the moment the goods are discharged at the port of arrival, says Vermylen.  In this case, the BPO becomes more like a documents-against-payment arrangement, in which the exporter instructs the presenting bank to hand over shipping and title documents to the importer only when the importer pays in full.</p>
<p>Although it has very experienced staff dealing with LCs on a daily basis, there are other efficiency benefits for BP Chemicals that can be derived from the BPO.  “All that transacting, manual handling and pushing around of documents will be reduced significantly, taking the sting out of selling in a LC-based secured way,” notes Vermylen.  “What often creates pressure is being able to present documents on time.  Once you have the BPO, the documentation you need to produce is not part of the critical path to obtain secured payment anymore, relating only to certifications for the shipment, concerning its origin or quality, for example, rather than being payment-related.”</p>
<p>BP Chemicals’ only experience with the BPO to date is with its customer, Oman-based PET manufacturer, Octal, via Standard Chartered.  “Not all banks are at the same level as Standard Chartered, which has been a significant hurdle to doing more transactions,” says Vermylen.  “Another hurdle is that not many corporates understand what the BPO could mean for how they operate.”  There is, he notes, a lack of knowledge and a degree of “uneasiness” about the newness of the BPO.  Even some product managers and sales managers in banks “don’t yet really know whether to place it as an open account or LC product”.</p>
<p>The arrival in April 2013 of the ICC’s Unified Rules for BPO will be the “absolute confirmation that the BPO is a serious product”, states Vermylen.  It will certainly replace some LCs, but he feels it has the potential “to do so much more”.  Even if it is used simply as a tool to manage the timing of payments, he feels it “opens up as a conduit for all kinds of working capital optimisation”.  For now though, he comments that “we’re happy with it and it does what it should do”.</p>

<h3 id=""future-plans"">Future plans</h3>
<p>There are no additional products under development by SWIFT for the corporate community. “We are contemplating ideas such as how to extend 3SKey to mobile devices but there is no product development for the time being on the SWIFT side,” Casterman confirms. Although banks still play the major role in facilitating the SWIFT-for-corporates relationship, the task of SWIFT now is seen by him as one of “de-mystifying” and demonstrating the inter-connectivity of its newly aligned and integrated portfolio of corporate solutions. To this end, SWIFT is set to release in 2Q13 a new set of certifications for consultants on the supply chain side.</p>
<p>There is willingness for most SWIFT participants to have “implementations that are as light as possible”, comments Casterman. This understanding comes direct from corporate feedback and has driven the emergence of Alliance Lite 2, monthly fees and the service bureau movement. “They don’t want to become technical experts in SWIFT connectivity; they just want something that allows them to access it without the need for a team of engineers to understand how it works.”</p>
<p>SWIFT’s aim is to become a multi-business connectivity service for trade finance. “In the course of this year we will see the trade vendors extend their applications from cash to trade and the data elements and transactional flows will be much more inter-connected,” comments Casterman. At least one multi-bank payments vendor will announce the extension of its application into the supply-chain finance realm, specifically the BPO, allowing a single software application for cash and trade.</p>
<p>SWIFT has been angling for corporate inclusion for a long time. It is now taking steps to offer a set of products that it feels will meet the needs of treasurers without tying them into a long, complex and expensive relationship that clearly few of them want. Perhaps 2013 is the year that SWIFT for corporates finally comes of age.</p>

<h3 id=""bank-talk"">Bank talk</h3>
<p><em>A brace of global institutions talk about their relationship with SWIFT.</em></p>
<h5 id=""societe-generale"">Société Générale</h5>
<p>Société Générale (SocGen) has had a long and productive relationship with SWIFT, says Alain Grugé, Head of Payments and Cash Management for the bank’s Global Transaction Banking unit. Although cash management is one of the primary uses of SWIFT by SocGen’s clients, Grugé explains that the bank also works with it on trade services, securities and card payments. “It is an increasingly global relationship and this is because SWIFT has been able to quite quickly move from its highly specific bank knowledge to include the accommodation of corporate needs.”</p>
<p>SocGen is part of SWIFT’s Corporate Advisory Group (CAG): the only French bank representative.</p>
<p>Grugé says, from a cash management perspective, that SWIFT provides very practical action with a “good adaptation of its products to the needs of corporates”. He cites the move to make the 3SKey digital signing tool available to a wider audience, and the ongoing workshops for the development of eBAM as examples of this consideration for the end-user.</p>
<p>Regarding eBAM, Grugé believes that the need for it is clearly evident and that many large corporates are anticipating its deployment. But SocGen is cautiously allowing its own clients to discover it at their own pace because, as Grugé notes, often they do not at first glance see the level of internal re-organisation that it can generate. So, whilst he feels eBAM is an important tool, he says “let’s take one step at a time”.</p>
<p>SocGen has never felt it is left to its own devices with SWIFT’s products. “We have constant dialogue with them,” states Lajeunesse. The bank has even established a working group on trade in France. Dialogue is similarly open on the cash management side, says Grugé.</p>
<p>SocGen readily undertakes development work with SWIFT and is currently looking to establish a pilot programme for a new 3SKey webstore. This, explains Grugé, will enable corporates to order the product as a standalone offering on the bank’s website, with direct provision by SWIFT. The end of 4Q13 should see this project in action, he says, noting too that the SWIFTRef solution is to be offered by SWIFT to the corporate community with the support of SocGen, but at a later date.</p>
<h5 id=""bank-of-america-merrill-lynch"">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</h5>
<p>“SWIFT has really improved in regards to getting feedback from its member banks,” says Tom Durkin, Managing Director, Global Head of Integrated Channels at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill). A bank such as this has a number of significant corporate clients but it needs to gather viewpoints from all corporate clients and convey them to SWIFT. In “opening up the road-map discussions”, he feels SWIFT is in a position where it now reaches out to the banks to ask for feedback.</p>
<p>SWIFT is naturally a sponsor of a number of key standards forums and BofA Merrill actively participates in these, presenting on different topics and leading workgroups. Durkin feels this is a good way of getting more “community-based” involvement. The SWIFT space is not just about banks and corporates; there are also technology-providers that have a vested interest; the standards forums provide an “excellent avenue for utilising better feedback” for SWIFT.</p>
<p>Amongst the corporate community, the early adopters – typically large MNCs such as GE and Microsoft – have maintained their push for standards. But amongst the “commercial market” membership, catering to a wider cross-section of businesses, Durkin notes greater interest in “ISO 20022, XML and harmonising their bank interfaces”. For smaller businesses, he sees SWIFT’s commitment come to life in the form of its Alliance Lite2 lower-cost cloud-based model. He also views the SWIFTRef data offering as further demonstration that SWIFT is responding to corporate needs.</p>
<p>The closer integration of cash management and trade services, under the guidance of Casterman is a positive move, Durkin believes. The conversation between cash and trade “intersects at multiple points now” and with the desire to draw out certain “product synergies”, this connection has driven the way BofA Merrill has structured its GTS group, incorporating trade within its channel product offering.</p>

<h5 id=""camille-wenying-liao-director-emea-liquidity-and-investment-cts"">Camille Wenying Liao, Director, EMEA Liquidity and Investment, Citi Transaction Services (CTS):</h5>
<p>In many cases, cash can become trapped due to tax implications, restrictions on inter-company lending and limitations in foreign currency convertibility and transfers, creating a challenge for companies looking to optimise global liquidity.</p>
<p>Freeing trapped cash across an organisation requires a multi-faceted approach to ensure visibility, control and optimisation, as well as maintaining optimal account/banking structure within the confines of the tax and regulatory environment.</p>
<p>When companies make trapped cash more accessible and usable, hence increasing its value, they are able to pursue the following opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Strategic:</h5>
<p>Stretch trade payables and shorten the trade receivables terms and/or with re-invoicing centres to mitigate trapped liquidity issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Local investment/acquisition:</h5>
<p>Establish business units in markets with high levels of trapped liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Optimisation:</h5>
<p>Balances in some restricted jurisdictions can be used to offset borrowing elsewhere – interest enhancement/optimisation products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Local yield enhancement:</h5>
<p>Relevant investment instruments and liquidity management tools include domestic pooling structures, local commercial paper, treasury bills, call deposits, domestic money market funds (MMFs), time deposits and local stock exchange, among others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With reference to the specific situation in China, there are currency control policies: all cross-border transactions in the country require supporting documentations. Chinese currency is only used domestically before renminbi (RMB) internationalisation. Traditional ways to mobilise onshore cash include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dividend payment: a company in China can repatriate dividends to its holding company once or twice a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-invoicing centre, leading and lagging techniques by leveraging trade flows to minimise surplus cash onshore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local optimisations via domestic RMB and foreign currency inter-company lending and cash pooling among subsidiaries onshore.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Recent RMB internationalisation and steps taken by China’s government in liberalising capital flow open a window for MNCs to achieve further treasury efficiency.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>RMB cross-border inter-company lending (one-off loans): domestic companies can lend excess cash to overseas group/sister companies, subject to the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-border cash pooling: multinational company (MNC) groups are allowed to establish ‘cross-border cash pooling’ structures to link domestic cash pools with overseas cash pools, subject to approvals by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) (for foreign currency) or by PBoC (for RMB).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offshore financing which leverages financial guarantee: a domestic entity can pledge surplus cash with a bank in China who will issue a standby letter of credit (SBLC) guarantee to an overseas bank and that bank will extend a credit facility supported by a SBLC. A SBLC in foreign currency is subject to a quota approved by SAFE, whereas a SBLC in CNY is no longer restricted by a quota.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As most of the recent policies are still under piloting stage, corporates intending to establish cross-border liquidity structures need to work with a partner bank to prepare a joint application for regulatory approvals. Citi is a trusted advisor which maintains close dialogues with Chinese regulators to structure the most efficient solution to help clients to improve efficiency in liquidity management.</p>

<h5 id=""qilong-zhao-implementation-manager-sungards-avantgard-china"">Qilong Zhao, Implementation Manager, SunGard’s AvantGard, China:</h5>
<p>China’s strict rules on tax, registered capital and foreign exchange (FX) are the main reasons for trapped cash among MNCs. Currently, we do have a number of options to release the trapped cash such as dividend and cross-border lending. But in the current market climate, the temptation is to keep cash inside China because higher yield can be earned in China than in other markets.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese government has been taking steps to loosen regulations and internationalise RMB, such as lifting restrictions on RMB settlement for overseas countries and allowing the opening of offshore bank accounts and inter-bank transfers of RMB in Hong Kong. We have enough reasons to expect that these things will become much better in the future.</p>

<h5 id=""john-mardle-managing-director-cash-perform"">John Mardle, Managing Director, Cash Perform:</h5>
<p>As China’s economy has grown rapidly over the past ten years or so the corporate sector has actually left the small business market in China behind. Why? Because the focus has been on expansion abroad and delivering world class products (not services) to consumers throughout the world. However, now is the time for China to develop its service sector and commence the long haul of enabling its smaller and medium businesses to deliver efficiencies within its own internal supply chain. This will then generate service offerings that will deliver real cash flow enhancements throughout the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Let’s take the auto sector as an example. Chinese manufacturers have successfully integrated themselves within the western auto sector by producing high quality, low cost, high volume cars and vans. However, the area around design, marketing and the selling of vehicles has not been developed. These areas have therefore not been integrated back into the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>This means that when one reviews the whole financial supply chain, cash is being lost in some lucrative areas and is not finding its way back into the Chinese economy. The key is to establish suppliers in the Chinese economy who require working capital to fund technology, design and establishment of marketing and selling dealerships/franchises who can then market Chinese products to the working and middle classes of China and therefore stimulate internal demand for cash.</p>

<p>“What is an overlay cash pool and how is this different from a notional cash pool or a conventional target or zero balancing cash pool?”</p>

<h5 id=""eric-mueller-responded"">Eric Mueller, Head of Cash Management Corporates EMEA and Head of Global Network Banking EMEA, Deutsche Bank, responded:</h5>
<p>An overlay cash pool connects local cash pools/bank accounts held at various banks to a cross-border cash pool provided by a single regional bank. Credit (debit) balances with each local (cash pool) bank are then automatically or manually swept/funded each day with one regional cash pool bank in order to achieve a regional central cash position.</p>
<p>Key differences and challenges of an overlay cash pool in comparison to a local and regional cash pool (notional pool, target or zero balancing (ZBA) with just one bank partner (locally and regionally) are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The sweeping/funding of balances between various local banks and the overlay bank, which may require manual transfer efforts and includes risk of missing the final end of day balance after clearing cut off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no transfer of back and future value days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While overlay cash pools were rather popular in the last century, the introduction of the euro in 1999 has strongly accelerated the migration from the use of overlay cash pools to the use of one regional cash pool partner, which also provides local cash management services.</p>
<p>The single euro payments area (SEPA) enables corporates to further increase regional cash pooling efficiency. Many corporates are currently establishing central account solutions by moving the vast majority of payments and collections to one account per legal entity per region – ring-fenced within a domestic cash pool. Benchmark corporate treasuries – those with integrated in-house bank solutions, such as the SAP In-house Cash centre application – are going a step further by running a large number of payables and receivables of various group entities through a single account solution within transparent payments and collections ‘on behalf of’.</p>
<p>This means that cash pools, at least for euro within SEPA, will become history in the medium term.</p>

<h5 id=""suzanne-barry-responded"">Suzanne Barry, Head of Liquidity and Investments EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, responded:</h5>
<p>Cash pooling is an essential liquidity management technique. It brings together a number of individual bank accounts to pool balances, optimise interest and improve an organisation’s liquidity management – across multiple jurisdictions, currencies and entities depending on the type of cash pool in place. Cash pooling falls into two main types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physical pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notional pooling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Physical pooling is often referred to as physical cash concentration, target or zero balancing (ZBA) or sweeping. Balances are physically swept to a header or master account on a periodic basis and may have certain parameters, for example a minimum or maximum balance, a percentage sweep, target balance and a variety of other parameters depending on the provider capabilities. Physical pooling is available on a domestic, cross-border, cross-region and multi-bank basis and is also dependant on the provider capabilities.</p>
<p>Notional pooling is a tool for interest enhancement whereby debit and credit balances on a series of accounts owned by the same or different entities and domiciled in the same country are notionally netted for interest calculation purposes, without a physical movement of cash. Multicurrency notional pooling offers the ability to achieve a net notional position in a single currency without the need to perform traditional FX or swaps, and extends the benefit of further interest savings as a result of compensating balances in different currencies.</p>
<p>An overlay cash pool is provided by an international bank offering physical or notional pooling on a multinational, multi-entity company-level in country, in region or globally. Overlay cash pools allow changes to existing bank relationships when necessary without disrupting the operation of the cash pool and allows changes to the cash pool to take place without disrupting the underlying banking structure.</p>
<figure class=""portrait right""><img alt=""Portrait of Richard Jaggard"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2013/01/2013-01-tt-03-qa-richard-jaggard-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""richard-jaggard-responded"">Richard Jaggard, Head of Transaction Banking, Europe, Standard Chartered, responded:</h5>
<p>To start with let’s recap on the principal structures used in cash management structures: zero balancing (ZBA) and notional pooling.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ZBA requires the physical movement of funds from, or to operating accounts to achieve a single net cash position in a single, central account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notional pooling does not require the physical movement of balances between accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These structures are used both domestically and regionally/globally. Arguably to maximise the structure’s efficiency it would be good to have all cash managed with one entity. However, treasurers are increasingly dividing the cash position either by nominating regional cash management banks that can manage cash for a part of their portfolio across multiple countries in a geographic region, or they are recognising that they separate cash management into in-country banks for their operational requirements and regional/global banks for liquidity management – the latter is an overlay structure.</p>
<p>With an overlay the treasurer has a couple of structures which deliver similar benefits to ZBA and notional pooling but with somewhat more complexity. They can move the funds in local currency to the liquidity bank and then use a bank’s automated FX rate engine to swap into a single currency. With the increased transparency of FX rates, this model is becoming more acceptable as it reduces the time and cost of treasury having to transact on positions itself. Another option is a multicurrency pool where the funds remain in local currency but the bank notionally recalculates all balances to a base currency for balance offset and interest calculation purposes.</p>
<p>There are challenges with these structures and the complexity rises with the geographical scope of the overlay. Regulations are a major determinant. For example, company law in some countries restricts inter-company loan structures and prevents the use of a ZBA structure. In other countries the balance sheet reporting required by central banks may not allow banks to offset onto their balance sheet the company’s accounts, which often reduces the benefit of a pooling structure. However regulations are constantly changing, particularly in fast-developing economies where often the changes favour what the treasurer is looking to achieve. If you are operating in these economies, selecting a banking partner that has extensive presence in these markets is extremely important to ensure you can benefit from the changes.</p>

<h5 id=""hugo-parry-wingfield-responded"">Hugo Parry-Wingfield, EMEA Head of Market Management for Liquidity and Investments, Citi Transaction Services, responded:</h5>
<p>An overlay cash pool isn’t necessarily distinct from a notional, conventional target or zero balancing (ZBA) cash pool, but could contain components of all three. It is a cash management service that facilitates the aggregation of liquidity from a series of multiple underlying banks or accounts into a single bank or banking structure. This could be within a single bank, but typically an overlay structure refers to a multi-bank structure. By pooling its cash, a company benefits from improved control and cash visibility. It can improve financial efficiency by reducing interest costs and time and effort, if this process if being done manually.</p>
<p>If these balances are held at two different banks, then the cash has to physically move from the local bank to the overlay bank. This can be done by the corporate instructing its local bank to push the funds to the overlay bank – ie every day at a particular time the bank pushes excess cash into the overlay bank account structure. The other alternative is for the overlay bank to pull the cash from the local bank at a predefined time and within certain parameters.</p>
<p>A corporate has to consider the structure they have before the cash moves to an overlay structure, as well as after it is moved. For example, a corporate could have a euro cash pool in France before the cash is subsequently moved into the overlay structure. That cash pool is independent of the overlay structure, and could be a conventional target, ZBA or, depending on the market, notional cash pool.</p>
<p>The same applies to the cash once it is in the overlay bank. Once the cash has come to Citi, for example, it could then be part of a much broader cash pool which could have elements of physical or notional pooling. That is why an overlay cash pool could be all of these things at once.</p>

Ten reasons to locate your treasury centre in Vienna,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>In this article, Alfred Buder, European Treasurer of Flextronics International Ltd shares with Treasury Today his love for the city of Vienna. Not only a great place to live, the Austrian capital is also a great place to run a European treasury centre.</i></p>
<p>Vienna is a charming city offering its residents a vibrant city life and a cosy village feeling at the same time. For international business Vienna is regarded as the gateway from western Europe into eastern Europe. So why not locate your European treasury centre here? Here are ten good reasons for companies to do so:</p>
<h4 id=""1-quality-of-life"">1. Quality of life</h4>
<p>According to Mercer’s ‘Quality of Living’ report, Vienna is the number one place to be located. Mercer, an international consulting firm, performs an annual survey comparing cities from all around the world using a set of objective, neutral and unbiased criteria. The aim is to measure the quality of living for expatriates based on 39 criteria grouped into ten key categories, including political, socio-economic and environmental factors.</p>
<p>For three years in a row Vienna has been in pole position, ahead of cities like Zurich, Munich, Düsseldorf and Frankfurt. Vienna offers a safe, stable and clean environment with high quality housing, school, medical, transport and recreation facilities.</p>
<p>Moreover Vienna offers a lot to see and do. The modern public transport system operates 24 hours a day and opens up a wide range of entertainment possibilities. Nevertheless, the city has retained its unique ’village’ atmosphere, meaning that it’s not a hectic or stressful metropolis. In the summer, Vienna’s numerous parks are crowded with young people enjoying the weather. And in winter the traditional Viennese cafés and pubs are the ideal place to relax after an exhausting day. Give it a go and feel at home!</p>
<h4 id=""2-bridge-into-eastern-europe"">2. Bridge into eastern Europe</h4>
<p>Both geography and history contribute to the fact that companies have successfully set up and grown into central eastern Europe from the city of Vienna. Just look at the facts to see why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vienna International Airport flies to 43 destinations in central eastern Europe and is the leading air hub for the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anywhere in Europe can be reached from Austria within three hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travelling by car you can reach the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary in under two hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Driving from Vienna to Munich, Prague or Budapest will take less than four hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the ties of a common history have opened CEE markets to Austrian multinationals, many of them based in Vienna. International companies like Beiersdorf, Henkel and Siemens have located their CEE headquarters in Vienna. Austrian banks like Bank Austria (now part of UniCredit), Raiffeisen International and Erste Bank are among the leading commercial banks in the eastern European countries. As such, your Vienna treasury centre will be close to the headquarters of your main eastern European banking and business partners.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Overall there is a cultural and geographical proximity to central eastern Europe along with a common spirit of western Europe that makes Vienna the perfect meeting place for people from eastern and western Europe.</p>
<h4 id=""3-european-union-and-eurozone-benefits"">3. European Union and Eurozone benefits</h4>
<p>Managing pan-European business from an entity within the European Union and performing treasury activities from a Eurozone country is a precondition for many international groups. No other Eurozone country is so close to eastern Europe. No other location has turned from a peripheral region of western Europe to a central hub for a new Europe so obviously within a few decades. Austria is in the heart of Europe and strongly supports the prosperity of its eastern neighbours. Yet the local currency is euro and the legal standards fully reflect European Union laws. Thus, local conditions are no different from Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt or Paris.</p>
<h4 id=""4-taxation"">4. Taxation</h4>
<p>Currently the Austrian corporate tax level of 25% cannot be regarded as low, but a modern system of group taxation – optional for Austrian companies holding more than 50% in subsidiaries abroad – is attractive for multinational companies extending the scope to losses generated by foreign subsidiaries of Austrian resident companies. Individual income tax is charged at progressive rates from 0 to 50%, depending on the annual income. There are many deductibles!</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The good news is that the Austrian stamp tax – a 0.8% tax formerly charged on all loan transactions signed in Austria – was abolished in 2011. This means that new bank and inter-company lending contracts can be setup in Austria without triggering tax obligations now.</p>
<h4 id=""5-politics-and-society"">5. Politics and society</h4>
<p>Austria offers a stable political situation and an open, friendly society. Social standards are high and unemployment rates are low. The extent of social contentment is reflected by the extremely low number of strike days: 0.8 days per 1,000 employees from 1998 to 2007.</p>
<p>Additionally Austria is regarded as the safest place in the world as far as the protection of personal security and private property are concerned. This is according to the latest World Competitiveness Yearbook.</p>
<h4 id=""6-education"">6. Education</h4>
<p>Not only has Vienna been rated as the number one city to live in and to do business in, it has also has been pronounced as the fifth best city for students throughout the world by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), a British company known for university rankings.</p>
<p>This result refers not to university standards but rather to the high quality of life. Experts from QS stated that this high quality of life “combined with culture and affordability, [mean that] Vienna can hardly be beaten”.</p>
<p>Vienna offers three big Universities to choose from: the Vienna Economics and Business University, the Vienna University of Technology and the University of Vienna, which all offer a wide range of different fields of study. In other words, Vienna’s education facilities have something to satisfy everybody’s interests.</p>
<p>For younger children Vienna offers international education facilities like the Vienna International School, the American International School, the Lycée Français, and many others.</p>
<h4 id=""7-labour-force"">7. Labour force</h4>
<p>Young professionals trained at Vienna Economics and Business University, Vienna University of Technology and other universities are available for international companies at reasonable salary levels. Young Austrians are well motivated to work for international companies and language skills are high.</p>
<h4 id=""8-office-space"">8. Office space</h4>
<p>Office space in Vienna is available either in city centre buildings or in modern office buildings. In the outskirts of the city, new tenants are attracted by extremely competitive rents. According to a study by CB Richard Ellis, an international real estate provider, Vienna ranks among the cheapest European capitals along with Prague, Budapest and Berlin, way below Brussels, Rome or Frankfurt and only charging a fraction of the rental prices charged in Zurich, Paris or London.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""9-support-from-local-authorities"">9. Support from local authorities</h4>
<p>The Vienna Business Agency has been offering support to national and international companies settling in Austria’s capital city for 30 years. The local government agency offers comprehensive support services to international firms of any size which want to set up business operations in Vienna.</p>
<p>	For support in your personal life, the Vienna Expat Centre can assist in finding you an apartment, a school for your children and can provide whatever information you might need to prepare for your move to Vienna.</p>
<p>“We help to make the start-up in Vienna as easy as possible, from initial consulting and finding suitable office space and commercial properties to assistance with public authorities and information on public funding. The Expat Centre makes it possible to further optimise our service offering for international firms“, explains Gerhard Hirczi, Managing Director of the Vienna Business Agency, which founded the Expat Centre.</p>
<h4 id=""10-culture"">10. Culture</h4>
<p>At weekends, after an extensive breakfast in a traditional Viennese café, you might want to take your family to see the Imperial Treasury. Rather different to corporate treasury!</p>

Expensive TRM systems are worthless without the latest version ,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>Over a quarter of FTSE 150 corporates may be heavily exposed to financial volatility given the lack of effective treasury and risk management (TRM) systems in place, new research has found. According to the survey, released by Reval on Monday, 26% of FTSE 150 businesses have not implemented automated TRM systems, “leaving companies unable to adequately handle a multitude of risks.”</i></p>
<p>Furthermore, only 50% of those corporates with a TRM system in place have the latest version installed. The study, conducted in February and March this year, surveyed 95 of the FTSE 150. “The financial world is getting more risky, not less,” says Nigel Sirett, EMEA Managing Director at Reval. “Therefore the importance of accurate, timely information is critical to managing the treasury business.”</p>
<h4 id=""conflict-of-interests"">Conflict of interests</h4>
<p>The report’s findings also highlight the difficult position in which many corporates find themselves: the need for an effective TRM investment becomes ever greater as the Eurozone crisis worsens; yet the very same troubled market conditions restrict the corporate treasurer’s financial room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>More worryingly, if the FTSE 150 cannot attain best practice, then what does this suggest of other companies? The reality is that many corporate treasurers must still contend with old systems and using good old Excel files as the basis of daily reports. Moreover, not every treasurer or company has the resources – time, cash or otherwise – at hand to implement a TRM system.</p>
<p>“This report does not surprise me,” says Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer of Vivartia. “There are a number of reasonable factors behind a company’s decision not to proceed with the implementation of a TRM system.”</p>
<p>“Take Vivartia for example. Structural stability within the group has played a significant role for not adopting a TRM system yet. Our group has undergone many administrative and shareholding changes in recent years. But in order to prepare and start a TRM system effectively, the business needs to have a very fixed structure in place. Since arriving at Vivartia in 2006, I have had stable periods of six months approximately that the company was not changing.”</p>
<h4 id=""holding-back"">Holding back</h4>
<p>Long nights at the office desk. Weekends spent at work. The implementation of a TRM system can be arduous at the best of times. But a treasurer’s workload is heavy enough as it is in the current economic climate. Indeed, all this is before cost enters the equation. According to one treasurer, who preferred to remain anonymous for the article, a TRM system can easily set even a small business back £100,000 (€125,000).</p>
<p>Reval’s findings should be viewed in a long-term context, however. An up-to-date TRM system is the backbone of any effective treasury risk management strategy. But that is the long run. Sustained market volatility means that treasurers must focus on short-term considerations for now.</p>
<p>If that means playing tactics at the expense of strategy, treasurers argue, then so be it.</p>

<p>With the treasurer now playing a more strategic role within the business, highlighting and improving the performance of the treasury department is paramount to the company’s success. In fact, treasury activities previously perceived as mundane have now been elevated to tasks of major importance in terms of delivering growth and a competitive edge. They therefore receive the full scrutiny of those at executive level.</p>
<p>Moreover, the repercussions of the economic downturn, notably the ongoing liquidity crisis and the drive for transparency, have brought to the fore critical areas that must be continuously running – visibly – at optimum levels. These include cash visibility, forecasting, funding and financial risk management, not to mention counterparty exposure analysis.</p>
<p>As such, treasurers are implementing a formal measurement framework, whether or not it is dictated from Board level, and are using a scorecard method built on appropriate KPIs and metrics to gauge productivity and encourage growth.</p>
<p>The 2011 European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study conducted by Treasury Today reveals that over 80% of corporates are already using KPIs to measure performance in at least one area of their treasury function. For overall treasury efficiency, the most widely used KPIs are noted as cash visibility and cost as a percentage of total business cost, but in other treasury disciplines, foreign exchange losses and counterparty limit breaches are also areas where metrics are frequently employed.</p>
<p>The table left identifies the top three KPIs used against each of the eight disciplines addressed in the Treasury Today Study.</p>
<h3 id=""understanding-the-concept"">Understanding the concept</h3>
<p>First conceived by Kaplan and Norton back in 1992, the balanced scorecard is a concept that embodies four ‘perspectives’ to provide the most holistic and transparent framework to optimise business growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>financial perspective</strong> is the measurement that is perhaps most naturally linked to treasury KPIs. There are three domain areas that apply to most corporate treasuries – cash management, foreign exchange (FX), and funding. Yet analysis cannot be made on financial data alone. The premise of the scorecard is that all four areas are explored to discern a true and balanced measure of business performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Measuring the development and self-improvement</strong> of employees allows managers to establish where training funds are most effectively allocated. Furthermore, a corporate can encourage the sharing of learning and best practice across the board, fostering the spread of shared corporate cultural values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The function of treasury is the management of financial assets and liabilities and financial risk within an organisation – these are <strong>the internal business processes</strong>. Yet, in the simple management and execution of these processes, operational risk is created (ie through human error, system glitches, etc). There are a number of KPIs that are specifically used for measuring the efficiency of treasury processes and the performance of those processes in mitigating this operational risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then there is <strong>the customer perspective</strong>. A positive result from customer satisfaction metrics can indicate future financial gains. But who exactly are the customers of corporate treasury? They are not only external – any internal unit or team or individual involved in the strategy and potential growth of the company is also a customer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the traditional balanced scorecard does not suit every organisation in every way, and it must be tailored to the company’s business model and needs. For example, cash rich businesses will be more geared towards return on capital than diversification of funding and this will be reflected in their KPIs.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id=""the-technology"">The technology</h3>
<p>Automation of the balanced scorecard system adds structure and discipline to its implementation. It helps translate disparate corporate data into information and knowledge, communicate performance information and, ultimately, offers quick access to actual performance data.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury management systems are increasingly building in this scorecard functionality. This can help to eliminate the operational risk that stems from financial transactions by imposing key controls on the business processes within treasury (ie four eye principle on any new static data that is being used, second pair of eyes to authorise deals, authorisation panels on settlements etc.) They aim to give treasurers the tools to make their exposures visible and quantifiable; manage the financial instruments they are going to use; produce core reporting of cash and foreign exchange positions. The latest software also offers the functionality for performance reporting.</p>
<p>The integration and control that the latest software releases provide are specifically geared towards allowing treasury to operate in an integrated and efficient way. There are many balanced scorecard and/or performance management automation development companies. Some of the options are specifically dedicated to measuring performance management while others include tools which are designed for business intelligence, analytics or data warehousing, etc.</p>
<p>For example, within the software solution provided by IT2, the treasurer can access a library of best practice processes and key controls. That library applies across many treasury domain areas and has additional wide-ranging functionality, according to Patrick Coleman, Regional General Manager, IT2 Treasury Solutions. “The IT2 system also documents treasury procedures, with workflow functionality that can be used to drive the system. This is a highly sought after feature since Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) was introduced and has matured in the last decade to accommodate other regulatory, accounting and operational reporting requirements.”</p>
<p>As suggested by the popularity of KPI usage in this area, a topical discussion in treasury at present is counterparty credit risk management. The origin of this for many was the debate around IAS 39 and the FAS 157 initiative in the US, which required corporates to adjust the market value of their assets to reflect counterparty credit risk. Pre-Lehman Brothers’ collapse, most people were using credit ratings to measure counterparty credit risk and learnt (the hard way) that they weren’t really an effective indicator – at least not in isolation.</p>
<p>Much of the latest technology now gives treasurers the capability to define their own counterparty credit ratings which can be based on default swap spreads or equity price volatilities, or any combination of those and anything else the treasurer chooses can be used as indicators. Those indicators can then be used to adjust the market value of the instruments and that then feeds through to management reporting and hedge accounting and counterparty limit policy and so on.</p>
<p>The successful adoption of balanced scorecard software from any of these providers will depend on whether the solution is easily accessible in terms of simplicity of use and in terms of company culture. A strategy map that communicates routine objectives clearly in familiar company ‘lingo’ will be most welcomed by employees across the organisation.</p>
<h3 id=""rising-to-the-challenge"">Rising to the challenge</h3>
<p>An effective KPI programme underlying the treasury scorecard brings with it significant benefits, and more and more treasurers are jumping on board. However, adoption of this measurement method and its related technology is not without its challenges. We look at how corporates can address these potential issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>The accurate selection of a relevant set of KPIs.</h5>
<p>Too many metrics can be as detrimental as too few. However, the most important thing for corporates to remember is that they should always be appropriate to the business agenda. A third-party facilitator is often engaged to provide an unbiased view of the KPI selection and scorecard development process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Strong technology support.</h5>
<p>Collating, verifying, analysing and eventually generating valuable reporting on essential data requires a robust and modern IT infrastructure. A simplistic but powerful web based solution that requires minimal IT maintenance and operation will allow the balanced scorecard to integrate more effectively into the corporate. Sensitive introduction.Staff may feel slighted at the concept of performance measurement. Therefore, it is important to emphasise the end goal to employees – and the fact that it is generally the processes and not the individual that is being assessed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Board level needs to be involved and aware.</h5>
<p>These measurement standards are essentially treasury policy, which is set by the CFO or a risk committee. Therefore, while the treasury team has the responsibility of executing that policy, the executives need to understand the processes to enable accurate supervision of those processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Regular review of the scorecard framework.</h5>
<p>To minimise disruption, an annual review is advised for most corporates once they have the flexibility to react to significant market developments as they arise.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>Market stress began in 2007, claimed numerous casualties in 2008 and 2009 and continues unabated, despite the concerted efforts of regulators and monetary authorities. Since this time, corporate treasurers have faced increasing difficulty in balancing risk and return when dealing with treasury surpluses. In this article, we examine the available options.</i></p>
<p>After years of extending and disintermediating their balance sheets, banks are now perceived as considerably more risky than ever before. The credit rating agencies have, with very few exceptions, downgraded the banks and regulators have responded by imposing much more restrictive ratio requirements on banks and other market participants.</p>
<p>At the same time, the authorities have engineered a low interest rate environment through the provision of liquidity to the markets in the form of short and medium-term market assistance. This has been done through various mechanisms that include the Bank of England’s Special Liquidity Scheme and Discount Window Facility, the ECB’s standing facilities and long-term refinancing operations and the Fed’s Discount Window, in addition to rounds of quantitative easing.</p>
<p>Whilst record amounts of liquidity have been pumped into the banking systems of the developed world, much of it has been recycled back into central bank coffers and there is little evidence that the cash has left the financial system to benefit the ‘real’ economy.</p>
<p>Lower capital investment, maintenance of operating cash flows and general uncertainty against a backdrop of widespread economic and monetary fragility has helped provoke a significant rise in corporate liquidity. Whether or not required immediately, some corporates have also taken the opportunity to issue longer-term debt in the capital markets relatively cheaply.</p>
<p>However, the cost of maintaining liquidity and of restricting counterparty credit and maturity limits – a perfectly rational response in times of stress – is reflected in the paltry returns currently available on short-term investment. Typically, the better the credit and the shorter the maturity, the lower the return.</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-short-term-investing"">What is short-term investing?</h3>
<p>This depends on who you speak to. To an institutional investor, short-term might mean anything less than one year, maybe even two years. Cash funds and short-term bond funds, for example, might have duration profiles that range up to two years. To a corporate treasurer, however, short-term will conventionally mean maturities of up to one year, although there will normally be a distinction between liquidity investment and term placements, with liquidity managed in time buckets of up to three months.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury balances could result from short-term frictional or operational cash flows, structural surpluses or core cash. It will depend upon individual circumstances as to how long the balances are available for investment. Even where core and structural balances may be available for longer-term investment, a treasurer may (as now) feel an increased need to maintain higher levels of liquidity and maturity selection may be kept short.</p>

<h4 id=""where-do-companies-invest-currently"">Where do companies invest currently?</h4>
<p>According to J.P. Morgan’s 2011 Liquidity Survey of nearly 500 corporate treasurers (45% of which were from the EMEA region), bank deposits accounted for 56% of cash investment and were the most common investment destination for treasury surpluses. Cash allocation to money market funds was 21% and direct investment in securities such as repurchase agreements (repos), certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper (CP) and other bonds amounted to 11%.</p>
<p>As a rule, the larger and more sophisticated the treasury operation, the more likely it is that direct investment in debt securities will feature. This is unsurprising given that investment in anything beyond vanilla bank deposits or money market funds implies a requirement for a treasury to have a more highly-developed credit process and delivery/settlement infrastructure, together with an internal accounting and management information capability necessary to accommodate a range of market instruments.</p>
<p>Predictably, since the banking crisis took hold, there has been a notable reduction in investment demand (and issuance) for structured investments such as asset-backed CP, for instance, and a corresponding increase in investment in government securities both directly and through mutual funds. That said, continuing low money market yields, particularly in short maturities, has led some to revise their credit policies to permit investment with a wider range of adequately-rated issuers.</p>
<p>Rating agencies have been engaged recently in a widespread reassessment of bank financial strength and the trend is for lower ratings across the board. The danger is, of course, that market participants come to blithely treat lower ratings as the new benchmark (eg “AA is the new AAA” as was remarked when the US’s long-term rating was downgraded to AA+ by S&amp;P in August last year) without considering the full ramifications of the re-rating.</p>
<p>Consideration of these matters is crucial in setting corporate treasury investment policy and any decision to expand a counterparty approval list, re-instate maturity limits or increase risk tolerance budgets in pursuit of improved returns should be very carefully weighed and could be premature.</p>

<h3 id=""where-to-go-for-yield"">Where to go for yield?</h3>
<h5 id=""bank-deposits"">Bank deposits</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, in today’s market, even less well-rated banks are unprepared to bid aggressively for deposits that may be categorised as wholesale markets funding. This is because regulatory impositions will increasingly require them to maintain high quality liquid asset buffers that, themselves, generate returns at or below official rates.</p>
<p>This represents a structural market shift that will see all banks willing to pay a premium for longer-term, assured funding; in particular to corporates that are existing customers with an established, operational relationship. Depending upon the jurisdiction and the funding mix of a bank, the pricing of corporate deposits will have natural breaks at one month, three months and one year. Evergreen deposit arrangements (ie call and notice accounts) are valuable in terms of bank liquidity planning and anything over one year, whether fixed term or subject to notice, is highly desirable in the new world.</p>
<p>Relationship banking has taken on greater significance in recent times for many reasons. From a corporate perspective, re-pricing of wholesale credit by the banks will reflect increased scarcity of credit although a more holistic approach to relationship pricing for ancillary business – such as treasury deposits – should enable a bank to justify a better bid for cash deposits.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the bank, repeat business from a corporate depositor supports an argument that the client is loyal and deposit is ‘sticky’, the objective being to demonstrate to a regulator that a smaller liquidity buffer (and avoidance of associated opportunity costs) can be justified. As a result, it can be worth rebalancing treasury policy to permit increased placement with relationship banks.</p>
<p>Spreading short-term (say less than one month) wholesale deposit business around the market enables counterparty risk to be diversified and can improve returns. But, it can be counter-productive, particularly where there is no obvious relationship angle and the improvement in returns for short-dated cash might be marginal at best. It can also be highly time-consuming for any thinly-staffed treasury. There are, however, occasions when banks are prepared to pay well for short-term cash; the difficulty is in knowing which banks and when. Current knowledge of relative appetite and capacity among the banks is central to the management of short-term cash and requires constant monitoring.</p>
<h5 id=""certificates-of-deposit"">Certificates of deposit</h5>
<p>CDs are widely used by corporates – particularly in the UK and Europe – in place of clean, fixed term bank deposits. They are issued by banks and are typically fully negotiable (ie transferable by delivery) which enables them to be bought and sold in the secondary market with relative ease and, for this reason, they will normally be issued at yields below those available for clean deposits.</p>
<p>Generally fixed rate, CDs can also be floating rate and even pay returns geared to external reference rates. They can be issued bilaterally or under established note programmes. The majority of CD issuance is now in non-materialised form, being deliverable electronically though Euroclear (or Crest) although it is still possible to request physical (security printed) primary issuance. In the UK, the term ‘certificate of deposit’ (so-called ‘London CDs’) is closely defined and cannot be applied to other notes and short-term paper issued by banks.</p>
<p>As with any instrument that can be traded, secondary market pricing can be affected – sometimes dramatically – by market sentiment. This means that bad news (or bad press) for any bank issuer can result in withdrawal of demand for, and an increase in, supply of paper in the secondary market. Improperly handled, either directly or by brokers acting for vendors, secondary market pricing can be highly volatile. A corporate investor intending to hold the paper to maturity will probably not need to be concerned with secondary market pricing unless the instrument had been purchased with a view to trading it on prior to maturity. In this instance, auditors may require market valuation of the instrument which would otherwise be accounted for as a deposit with a maturity value of par.</p>
<p>Apart from a possible yield differential, the main drawback of CDs as compared with clean deposits is the need to be able to accept delivery of the dematerialised form of the CD. This poses no issue for a treasury operation that has a regular custodian with accounts at Euroclear but, for those investors that do not, custodial arrangements will need to be made, managed and paid for.</p>
<h5 id=""treasury-bills-government-securities"">Treasury bills/government securities</h5>
<p>Most companies have, at some point, invested in short-term government securities and will be familiar with the operational features associated with such instruments. Treasury bills are short-term instruments issued by national monetary authorities through dealers that participate in regular primary auctions at a discount to par for maturities up to one year (most commonly, maturities do not exceed six months).</p>
<p>Investors would typically acquire bills through the dealers and settlement would be into a depositary or custodian account. In the UK, the minimum investment is £500,000 and issuance is aimed at institutional and corporate (crudely, wholesale) investors. In contrast, the US market encourages retail level access with bill denominations as low as $1,000.</p>
<p>As short-term money market instruments issued by central monetary authorities, they are considered (credit) risk free in their national markets and, as a consequence, are the first option of any treasurer wishing to minimise risk at times of market stress. Equally, markets for all the leading countries’ bills are deep and liquidity is generally undoubted. The downside is low yield which, although designed to mirror official rates, can be negative. Famously, in January 2012, the primary yields on German 6 month Bubills turned negative as investors became willing to pay for the privilege of parking cash outside the banking system. There are also moves afoot in the US to permit auction bids of less than zero to be accepted for primary issuance.</p>
<h5 id=""medium-term-and-floating-rate-notes"">Medium Term and Floating Rate Notes</h5>
<p>Medium Term Notes (MTNs) and Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) are generally continuously issued through appointed dealers for original (credit) periods exceeding one year although the structure of individual notes may well provide for coupon resets periodically (one month, three months and six months most commonly). MTN issuance can be by corporates and banks although banks tend to be the most prolific issuers of FRNs. Issuance is dematerialised (as with CDs and T-bills) and delivery is through a central counterparty (CCP) such as Euroclear, with a requirement to enter into a custody agreement either with the dealer/vendor or separately with a dedicated custodian.</p>
<p>Most note programmes permit the issuance of a variety of instruments and can be designed to accommodate note issuance tailored to individual investor requirements. In some cases, they can also provide for the issuance of short-term commercial paper although CP maturities tend to be longer (say 180 days plus) than for regular CP.</p>
<p>Short-term corporate investors in MTNs or FRNs are unlikely to be participating in the primary market in view of the longer-term nature of the issuance. Instead, they will be looking to invest in secondary paper offered by the programme dealers that maintain a market in the issues or by holders/vendors directly.</p>
<p>Much of the secondary demand for such paper is represented by the professional market (eg mutual funds). Secondary market liquidity is notoriously fickle, in particular where the MTN is anything more complex than a vanilla FRN tranche and where time to final maturity is longer than six months. Short residual life bank-issued FRNs that are into their final fixing period tend to fare best in the secondary market since the repayment obligation has, by this time, the same status as a bank deposit (ie fixed maturity and fixed rate.)</p>
<p>Generally, however, paper with short residual credit life is difficult to find and, where it does exist, would not necessarily offer yields superior to where the bank may bid directly for cash. For short-dated FRNs, secondary market liquidity may be less than for CDs issued by the same obligor depending upon market conditions; occasionally, lack of familiarity with an issuance programme may cause a trading desk to discriminate in favour of CDs regardless of the market status of a particular issue.</p>
<p>For corporate investors with a suitable risk appetite and credit process, longer-term bank – and even financial corporate – issuance can offer a significant yield pick-up but secondary liquidity (if required) could be an issue.</p>
<h5 id=""commercial-paper"">Commercial paper</h5>
<p>Commercial paper (CP) can be issued by commercial and corporate issuers or by banks. Bank issuance is most regularly associated with securitisation programmes wherein bank assets are transferred into a conduit vehicle and from which CP is issued to investors. Whilst there may be little direct name association between a bank and its conduit(s), the CP issuance is generally considered to carry full faith and credit of the bank sponsor, not least given credit, servicing and liquidity undertakings by the sponsor to support an external credit rating. That said, such asset-backed CP (ABCP) programmes have to be explained (and understood) and secondary market liquidity can be patchy.</p>
<p>However, for corporate investors that have the capacity both to assess and manage such assets and that are willing to live with the possibility of constrained liquidity, investment in ABCP can generate improved investment returns.</p>
<p>A further aspect of CP that is often overlooked is that most highly-rated corporates (ie non-banks) have active CP programmes, whether in the US or offshore. In the US, the domestic CP market is highly developed and is a mainstay of short-term money markets. In contrast, Europe is not so well placed. France and the UK both have relatively modest domestic CP markets and the concept of non-domestic, cross-border issuance (ie euro commercial paper or ECP) is well established.</p>
<p>It is generally felt that if the European domestic and ECP markets were better promoted and more widely supported, then liquidity would improve and enable CP to enjoy a status similar to that which it holds in the US. Direct investment in well-rated corporate CP by other corporates would avoid bank balance sheets (freeing up limits) and could offer a considerable improvement in investment returns.</p>
<h5 id=""repurchase-agreements"">Repurchase agreements</h5>
<p>Investment in reverse repurchase agreements (repo) by institutional investors and large, sophisticated corporate treasuries has increased considerably since 2007, reflecting the confluence of two imperatives. First the need for less well-rated counterparties to utilise assets otherwise owned to finance their balance sheets and, second, the desire of investors to invest short-term liquidity in a low risk and highly liquid environment.</p>
<p>A repo is the sale and contractual repurchase of qualifying securities for cash with delivery and settlement though a CCP on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis. Collateral provided is typically government securities or other assets subject to an agreed additional collateral margin (or ‘haircut’).</p>
<p>Repo maturities can be overnight or term and, depending upon the agreement reached, collateral may be substituted during the course of a transaction. The key feature is that underlying collateral is legally owned by the investor who would have a right of sale if the repurchase counterparty were to default. The risk is that the collateral haircut is insufficient to cover market risk at a time when the counterparty had defaulted on its obligation to repurchase the securities.</p>
<p>Operationally, repos can be administratively burdensome which is why investors are typically institutional market participants with an infrastructure to suit. Repo pricing tends to mirror the underlying cash market for the term of the repo with adjustment for collateral quality. Accordingly, for example, overnight sterling investment in repo collateralised with general collateral (ie government securities) would normally trade around 0.05% per annum below LIBOR.</p>
<h5 id=""money-market-funds"">Money market funds</h5>
<p>Money market fund (MMF) returns have generally held up well since the crisis gripped the market. Although regulatory change is on the horizon and threatens to impact either or both of the structure and economics of the funds, the proposition remains compelling.</p>
<p>As we have observed previously, money funds are not bank deposits. They are asset management products where, subject to strict investment guidelines, fund providers will manage the proceeds of sales to investors of shares in the fund. This is actioned through the purchase of a narrow range of highly-rated (largely bank) money market obligations and offers same-day dealing and liquidity. The main risk faced by investors is that of a ‘run’ on a fund caused by too many investors seeking to redeem at the same time and not being able to liquidate assets, either in time or at book value.</p>
<p>Superior fund returns are made possible by the funds’ investment in term instruments longer than overnight but with a weighted average final (ie credit) maturity of no more than 120 days and a weighted average (ie interest rate) maturity of less than 60 days. Investors accept the liquidity and credit transformation inherent in the MMF structure in return for higher returns that they might otherwise earn from overnight or very short-term investment. Funds are awarded a AAA fund rating (as distinct from a pure debt or credit rating) by one or more of the rating agencies.</p>
<p>Once an account is established by an investor, the operation is similar to that of a bank call account with share subscriptions and redemptions effected directly with the fund provider, through contact with the fund administrator or by using a portal.</p>
<p>MMFs now operate under a tighter set of rules than that which prevailed prior to the collapse of the Reserve Primary Fund in 2008. Nevertheless, they are perceived as remaining exposed to a weak banking sector and regulators are concerned to avoid a repeat of the Reserve collapse (albeit that the final dividend to shareholders exceeds 99 cents on the dollar).</p>
<h5 id=""exchange-traded-funds"">Exchange traded funds</h5>
<p>Ultra short-term exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a relatively recent development designed to offer (mainly retail) investors an ability to establish intraday value on their fund holdings and to buy or sell fund shares at a price that fluctuates during market hours – just as with any listed stock price. This contrasts with mutual (ie MMF) valuation which is dependent upon closing values for underlying assets and upon whether the fund is structured as a constant or floating NAV fund. ETF share prices fluctuate around par with an expected divergence of no more than +/- 3%. In contrast, variable NAV MMF pricing and constant NAV shadow pricing has remained comfortably within +/- 0.25%.</p>
<p>Although the objective of money market ETFs was originally to track money market benchmarks, the outlook is for more active management through the use of some leverage, derivatives and repo within the funds. Equally, the ETFs are likely to accept marginally more curve, liquidity and credit risk in a bid for out-performance vis-à-vis MMFs. The largest money market ETF (which is US-based) currently has only $1.4 billion in assets under management – considerably smaller than any established US MMF.</p>
<p>Promoters of ETFs argue that their product extends the parameters of regular MMFs so as to unlock potential that is constrained by regulations and rating agency strictures but not so as to threaten those adopted by short duration bond funds or enhanced cash products. In fact, promoters of enhanced cash products would argue that their products (mortally wounded as they were in 2008) were filling exactly the same space as that occupied by money market ETFs currently.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The markets remain in a state of flux and corporate liquidity is high with fewer outlets and increasing pressure from shareholders to improve investment returns but without foregoing liquidity or taking risk. At the same time, regulatory pressure on banks has reduced appetite for short-term deposit funding and we are in a low interest rate environment with little prospect of change in the near term. Money markets funds are doing well but are, themselves, challenged by regulatory and economic pressures.</p>
<p>The task is to find additional yield yet avoiding adding risk. One strategy might be to cut out the middle man and undertake more investment directly in harder-to-deliver money market instruments such as CDs, CP and maybe ABCP. Another might be to restore or extend bank deposit maturities beyond the magic 90 days and to manage more closely the utilisation of (or to become more imaginative in the management of) available bank placement limits to unlock relationship benefits. New product developments will inevitably follow regulatory impositions although it is premature to come to conclusions.</p>
<p>In the interim, it may be wise to re-examine treasury policy and to ask whether the reaction to the banking crisis has been overdone or whether sufficient uncertainty remains to justify maintenance of a risk-averse posture. The answer is that it is probably a bit of both.</p>

<p><em>After a slow start, SWIFT for Corporates is finally gaining ground. In this article Treasury Today examines the evolution of SWIFT for Corporates and its core components.</em></p>
<p>SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) for Corporates allows companies to access the SWIFT network, a standardised communication platform. It is seen by many corporates as a highly secure and reliable solution, but one that has struggled with a slow and costly infrastructure in the past.</p>
<p>There are currently over 900 corporates registered with SWIFT worldwide. These businesses are able to connect to over 8,500 financial institutions on the SWIFT network. Corporates based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa make up the majority of SWIFT participants – some 71% – while businesses situated in the Americas and Asia account for the remainder.</p>
<p>Originally the preserve of large, heavyweight corporates, such as Microsoft and General Electric, SWIFT membership has now evolved to encompass smaller businesses, ie those with less than €1 billion in turnover. This change can be largely attributed to the co-operative’s efforts to tailor its services to suit the requirements of small-to-medium sized corporates, such as the introduction of Alliance Lite (see below). Recent initiatives, such as 3SKey and eBAM, aim to further capitalise on this development. In this article, we look at the evolution of SWIFT for Corporates and its current services.</p>
<h3 id=""a-not-so-swift-start"">A not so swift start</h3>
<p>The origins of SWIFT stem back to 1973 when major banking institutions agreed that an industry-wide co-operative should be established so as to facilitate the secure transfer of financial communications. The platform soon proved a tremendous success. It was only in 1998, however, that SWIFT launched its first service to corporates.</p>
<p>With its Treasury Counterparty (TRCO) model, a system facilitating FX deal confirmations and money market trades, SWIFT hoped to attract a large amount of corporate business. Banks, for their part, were happy to allow SWIFT to carve a market niche for itself because the TRCO system did not directly compete with their cash management services. These hopes were to quickly dissipate however. Encumbered by an expensive framework, SWIFT’s initiative was not popular. In the end it attracted the business of just 15 corporates. For the overwhelming majority of corporates, the costs of using SWIFT’s facility far outweighed the benefits on offer.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s new corporate offering was to prove more popular. In 2001 the co-operative launched Member-Administered Closed User Groups (MA-CUG). These entities were established and maintained by individual banks that offered a treasury and cash management solution to corporates. Although less expensive and unwieldy than their predecessor, the system was still orientated around the bank’s interests. The bank was the medium through which corporates could tap SWIFT’s services. Corporates had to agree to the bank’s terms and conditions, often stringent, in order to avail of MA-CUGs. Furthermore, corporates with multiple banking counterparties required the same number of MA-CUGs. This was an expensive undertaking. Still, for many corporates, MA-CUGs were the first opportunity to make use of SWIFT’s network.</p>

<p>In 2007 SWIFT introduced Standardised Corporate Environment (SCORE). The advent of SCORE was a ‘game changer’ for SWIFT and its development of a corporate solution. For the first time corporates could access SWIFT’s financial network through a single gateway. While MA-CUGs were structured in such a way that allowed banks to determine the corporates’ access to the SWIFT network, SCORE established a direct relationship between the corporate and the co-operative. This meant that corporates could now manage a number of counterparty relationships by means of one secure channel rather than joining multiple MA-CUGs. A consequence of this was that corporates no longer had to be ‘sponsored’ by a bank to access SWIFT. The number of corporates registered with SWIFT rose to over 680 by late 2010.</p>
<p>Nevertheless SWIFT’s solution still seemed expensive, involving the incorporation of a hefty infrastructure. Many small corporates could not afford to join SWIFT despite initiatives such as SCORE. This situation was changed in late 2008 with the launch of SWIFT Alliance Lite. A low-cost, portable solution for corporates, Alliance Lite allowed businesses to connect to SWIFT via a USB stick plugged into a computer. It was an initiative that removed costly barriers of SWIFT implementation.</p>
<h3 id=""adapting-to-corporate-needs"">Adapting to corporate needs</h3>
<p>With the exception of Alliance Lite, however, connecting to SWIFT places a heavy strain on limited resources. Furthermore, effective maintenance of such a network requires specialist knowledge. Treasury operations, however, are often restricted with limited manpower and means. The emergence of service bureaus in recent years has sought to address this problem. Corporates are able to ‘outsource’ the task of establishing and maintaining SWIFT to an external team of experts. This has proved to be a cost effective solution for many businesses, as service bureaus can also offer value-added services such as format validation and enrichment. As a result between 80% and 90% of all new comers to SWIFT now connect via a service bureau.</p>
<p>The drive to adapt to corporate needs has also taken on other forms. The recent launch of 3SKey, SWIFT’s ‘multi-network personal digital identity’, allows individuals within corporates to use a USB signing device that enables them to sign off financial messages and documents when sending to banking counterparties. Beforehand, corporates were forced to use several devices and passwords for different banks. 3SKey introduced an international standard that is simple to use, leading to cost reductions and efficiency gains. The development of electronic bank account management (eBAM) is also promising. SWIFT hopes to ‘dematerialise and automate’ bank account management – an area of business that is still dominated by manual paper work and inefficient. eBAM offers to reduce both time and cost and improve STP and customer satisfaction rates. The process is still in its early stages, however, and pending revision based on the feedback of early adopters in the corporate and banking worlds.</p>

<p>Nearly four decades have passed since the creation of SWIFT. The co-operative’s steps into the corporate world since 1998, however, have been difficult ones. SWIFT has struggled to lose its reputation as a communications platform ‘made by banks, for banks’. And, in a sense, the evolution of SWIFT’s corporate solution can be seen as the gradual realisation that more must be done for its corporate clients. Companies, for their part, now realise the genuine benefits offered by SWIFT, and are taking full advantage of the option to outsource maintenance. SWIFT’s early TRCO model attracted just 15 corporate clients. Now, thanks to offerings such as SCORE and Alliance Lite, over 900 corporates are registered with SWIFT.</p>

Understanding trade finance,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>The tools and methods of trade finance form the basis of every domestic and international trade transaction. Raising capital, mitigating risk exposure and executing payments all fall under its domain. With Basel III regulations on the horizon, trade finance is back in the headlines.</i></p>
<p>It can involve raising finance, reducing risk exposure, or completing payments between the buyer and seller. Often third parties, such as banks, are involved in facilitating the exchange, however there is also a growing number of non-bank entrants in the trade finance space.</p>
<p>Trade finance has been around for a number of years; but recently, in particular since the eruption of the financial crisis, it has undergone substantial stresses and strains.</p>
<p>Major developed economies, such as those in the Eurozone, are in trouble, damaging trade volumes; counterparty risk remains high; and Basel III regulations are set to boost capital reserve ratios and further restrict trade services, if passed in their current form. These factors (if an exemption is not granted for trade finance) will likely reduce banks’ capabilities – or appetite – for facilitating trade, pointing to an uncertain future for trade finance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, exporters are reducing their risk exposure, with some eschewing open account and returning to more traditional, secure forms of trade finance – even for countries within Europe that were once deemed ‘safe’.</p>
<p>In this article we will explore the various means of raising finance, explain risk mitigation, and delve into the different methods of executing payments relating to trade.</p>
<h3 id=""methods-and-tools"">Methods and tools</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two main types of trade finance: pre-export and post-export. This distinction is important given that the time of payment determines the viability of the supplier’s cash flow and the amount of working capital required by the business.</p>
<h3 id=""pre-export-financing"">Pre-export financing</h3>
<p>Suppliers must first finance the production of their goods and services in order to export. They have several options available to them:</p>
<h4 id=""payment-in-advance"">Payment-in-advance</h4>
<p>Payment-in-advance involves the buyer sending full payment (or at least a significant part of it) prior to the delivery of goods. This method allows the supplier to mitigate credit risk and non-payment risk, and eases cash flow constraints considerably. On the flip side, however, the risk of the transaction is shifted entirely to the buyer who, until the goods are received, must treat the exchange as a donation. Wire transfers constitute the most popular method of payment-in-advance.</p>


<blockquote>The advantages of using an overdraft facility are its flexibility and ease of use, but these pros should be weighed against the often heavy interest rate charged.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""overdraft"">Overdraft</h4>
<p>An overdraft is a common and popular tool to fund trade. It allows the business’s account be overdrawn up to a certain limit. In other words, it is an extension of a business’s credit line. The advantages of using an overdraft facility are its flexibility and ease of use, but these pros should be weighed against the often heavy interest rate charged.</p>
<h4 id=""working-capital-loans"">Working capital loans</h4>
<p>Working capital loans can be raised to fund operating costs such as labour and raw materials. The loans are short-term, usually up to a year, and can be secured against a company’s assets. In certain cases, such as large, low-risk companies, the loans can be raised on an unsecured basis.</p>
<h3 id=""post-export-financing"">Post-export financing</h3>
<h4 id=""factoring"">Factoring</h4>
<p>Factoring is a form of receivables-based finance, often used by suppliers in need of cash in the short term. It involves a factor – a financial institution, usually a bank – that provides finance through the purchase of the supplier’s accounts receivables or invoices. Receivables involved are short-term and the amount paid upfront by the factor is usually 80%. The factor then chases down payment from the buyer. Once payment is secured, the factor forwards the remainder to the supplier minus a discount for its services. In contrast to forfaiting, factoring can be done with or without recourse.</p>


<blockquote>Invoice discounting is a similar tool to factoring – only this time the onus of chasing down payment remains with the supplier.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""invoice-discounting"">Invoice discounting</h4>
<p>Invoice discounting is a similar tool to factoring – only this time the onus of chasing down payment remains with the supplier. As before, a discounter provides finance to the supplier for anything as much as 100% of the invoice’s face value. This again helps to alleviate any cash flow problems for the supplier. The buyer then pays into a dedicated bank account, also known as a trust fund. In this scenario, the buyer may or may not know the invoice is being discounted. After the bank trust receives the payment, the sum is collected by either the discounter or supplier. If the former does so, then it forwards the remaining amount of the payment to the supplier minus a fee for its services. The discounter usually makes a thorough assessment of risk exposure before committing itself to the transaction.</p>
<h4 id=""forfaiting"">Forfaiting</h4>
<p>Forfaiting is another tool for receivables-based trade finance. It differs from factoring in that the accounts receivable involved are medium-term and there is no recourse to the exporter. Forfaiting allows the supplier to virtually eliminate risk as long as the goods have been delivered to the buyer according to the terms and conditions outlined. Receivables are usually guaranteed by the buyer’s bank, allowing the supplier to remove the transaction from its balance sheet and in turn improving its financial ratios.</p>
<h4 id=""supplier-finance"">Supplier finance</h4>
<p>Also known as ‘reverse factoring’ supplier finance is a relatively new solution, sometimes referred to as ‘supply chain finance’ or SCF. It adopts a more collaborative approach between buyer and supplier. The former, through its bank, initiates the transaction (which is unusual as it is usually the supplier initiating these kind of arrangements), and continues to support the latter’s finances to complete the trade. Reverse factoring is useful as it allows large buyers, with solid credit ratings, to sustain smaller, but potentially vital, suppliers in times of economic difficulty. Another advantage is that the buyer can extend the payment terms it wants from its suppliers.</p>

<h3 id=""managing-risk"">Managing risk</h3>
<p>Every trade is characterised by exposure to risk – a fact that has become more pronounced since the advent of the Great Recession. In the table below we examine four varieties of risk. They range from economic to exchange rate, from transportation to political risk. The buyer and seller have several means at their disposal to mitigate exposure, such as letters of credit or export credit agencies.</p>

<h3 id=""methods-of-payment"">Methods of payment</h3>
<p>The most common methods of settling a trade deal include: payment-in-advance; letters of credit; documentary collection; and open account trading. We have already touched on the former – see above – so in this section we will examine the latter three. Each payment method has its own advantages and disadvantages, some favouring the buyer over the suppler (and vice versa). Their relative appeal often depends on the circumstances of individual companies and industries.</p>
<p>Given recent economic troubles, importers and exporters across the globe now place a heavy emphasis on cutting risk exposure through the use of trade finance instruments. Although open account trading still accounts for a significant volume of global trade – believed to be close to 80%, safer, more costly, forms of trade finance, such as letters of credit, have made a comeback due to counterparty risk concerns.</p>
<h4 id=""letters-of-credit"">Letters of credit</h4>
<p>Letters of credit (LCs) are among the safest ways of securing payment for a trade transaction. They are particularly attractive in the current climate of international trade. Nevertheless, letters of credit still make up less than 10% of international trading.</p>
<p>Banks are used as intermediaries, facilitating the transaction between buyer and seller. After the commercial contract is agreed, the buyer’s bank sends a letter of credit outlining payment conditions to the supplier’s bank. Payment is guaranteed to the supplier as long as it meets the terms outlined in the letter of credit.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The evolution of letters of credit points to a more promising future. E-letters of credit – where scanned, secure documents are sent instantly online – offer the best of both worlds: security and speed in the transaction. Initially popular in Germany, e-LCs are now spreading throughout Europe and the United States. Yet the term ‘letters of credit’ itself encompasses a variety of forms. The following are just some examples:</p>
<h4 id=""confirmed-letter-of-credit"">Confirmed letter of credit</h4>
<p>A confirmed letter of credit involves the guarantee of not one, but two banks supporting the payment of a transaction. This further benefits the supplier who must contend with the risk of non-payment. These are useful for when the supplier has concerns about the credibility of the buyer’s bank.</p>
<h4 id=""transferable-letter-of-credit"">Transferable letter of credit</h4>
<p>The exchange between buyer and seller is facilitated by a third party. There are two stages: first, the third party provides payment to the supplier under the conditions outlined in the transferrable letter of credit (issued by the buyer’s bank); secondly, having received the goods, the third party completes the transaction with the buyer. Since the intermediary buys from the supplier at a small discount, it earns a profit when it sells to the buyer at full-price.</p>
<h4 id=""revolving-letter-of-credit"">Revolving letter of credit</h4>
<p>A letter of credit with a ‘revolving clause’ attached. This clause means that the cumulative cost of the supplier’s shipments can be drawn against the document. Little to no amendments need be made by the buyer. As a result, this arrangement is ideal for regular trading partners.</p>
<h4 id=""documentary-collection"">Documentary collection</h4>
<p>Documentary collection, like letters of credit, is a payment method that involves intermediary banks facilitating the transaction. The supplier ships the goods prior to payment, but sends the delivery to a third party, such as a shipping line. At the same time, the supplier also sends specific documents and details to its (remitting) bank requesting payment from the buyer. The remitting bank forwards this material to the buyer’s (collection) bank. In certain cases, goods can be inspected by the buyer prior to payment.</p>
<p>At this point, documentary collection can involve the buyer either paying the face value of the payment on the spot (‘document against payment’ – D/P) or at an agreed future date (‘document against acceptance’ – D/A). The former option favouring the suppler; with the latter offering a distinct advantage to the purchaser. But while the two banks act as conduits for the transaction, the method itself offers no verification process. And there is limited recourse available to the supplier in the event of non-payment, given that the delivered goods might now be located in a foreign jurisdiction. Nevertheless, documentary collection remains an attractive option. It is often cheaper and quicker than letters of credit, and safer than open account.</p>
<h4 id=""open-account"">Open account</h4>
<p>Open account is by far the most widespread payment method where trade is concerned. Its popularity is correlated with the fortunes of the global economy: in times of plenty, open account trading flourishes; but when recession hits, traders turn towards more secure forms of payment for trade.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to payment-in-advance, open account heavily favours the buyer: goods are shipped and delivered prior to any payment. Usually, the buyer then has between 30 and 90 days to meet payment conditions. During this interval, exposure to risk of non-payment lies solely with the supplier who, in effect, finances the buyer until cash is received. In order to mitigate this risk, the supplier can choose to use trade finance techniques, such as export credit insurance.</p>
<p>Open account is best suited to long-term trading partners and often works around a reliable, trusted relationship. Suppliers that trade on open account often offer buyers more competitive trade terms than sellers who do not. But they are more susceptible to economic and political risks as a result.</p>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Where are we with SEPA right now?</p>

<p><span>Frank Taal (ING):</span> Well, we’ve seen the start of the credit transfer at the end of January, but today the statistics show that less than 1% of the payment traffic is currently using the SEPA Credit Transfer, mainly as a result of the banks routing cross-border European payments to the SEPA Credit Transfer.</p>

<p><span>Alan Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> I agree it’s been a slow start for the larger corporations with more established payables processes. But interestingly, you take a smaller market like Luxembourg and you’ll see they’ve shifted the vast majority of their payments over in one fell swoop. It’s a modest but healthy start.</p>
<p>We’ve enjoyed over two years of dialogue with organisations of all sizes on the subject of SEPA, but just recently we’ve started seeing a number of US corporates begin to adopt SEPA on our web channels. Smaller corporates that didn’t have as much volume to risk are also beginning to shift. We’re talking to a number of airlines that do business in the region about shifting their payments to SEPA. But I do think the vast majority are still waiting. And they’re waiting for clarity around some of the burgeoning industry issues; issues like the impact of the Payment Services Directive, what the SEPA Direct Debit will really look like, and when businesses can expect it to be introduced. With this greater clarity, I expect that corporates will begin their payment process re-engineering activities. And I think for the most part, the public sector institutions will begin their re-engineering activities too, but maybe not until the latter part of 2009.</p>

<p><span>Simon Colboc (Fortis):</span> I am with you there. We are seeing a little bit of movement in the public sector. The pension and European public sector seem to be the first users to at least make the right noises. I agree, it’s been a relatively slow start. We found ourselves in the position of being, I think, one of the biggest movers of SEPA volumes, because others have been even slower to take up. In part this is probably because we had already moved our payment systems into a shared service centre. We’re very happy to have done it, but it’s not something that the clients are jumping up and down about yet.</p>

<p><span>Mark Hale (PricewaterhouseCoopers):</span> That’s not surprising if banks aren’t promoting it. The 2008 Banking Banana Skins survey shows that concerns about liquidity, credit, risk products and risk management are at the top of the CEO/CFO agenda; not SEPA. When it comes to what’s hot and what’s not, then payments simply isn’t up there. It’s only 27 out of 30 on the list. A crisis, a compulsion or a compelling business case would make SEPA more visible.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> If I may, may I be a little bit controversial? I think that to some degree, SEPA actually benefited from the market turbulence. While earlier this year, eyes were on liquidity and risk management, the banks actually had a little freedom to really bed in the functional side of SEPA. There has been the odd teething trouble. On the SEPA Credit Transfer side, we don’t have a full product yet. When we have additional payment flags that all come in at the beginning of next year, then we will have the vendor payments and the payroll components and all the pieces that will make up the whole credit transfer product. And, hopefully, the direct debit product will go in as smoothly as the payments have.</p>

<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> Absolutely agree with that. Why do daily banking when you can do juicy loans? Now that has turned around a little bit. It has got the attention of the sales force, and it has got the attention of the corporate clients as well, because they are no longer only focusing on getting that extra layer of leverage. They are having to think hard and smart about how you best change the structure to make best use of your working capital. So back on the earlier point, why is the thing relatively slow in picking up? It’s not going to have any impact on corporates as long as the ERP systems are not following. And that has been the weak link in the chain so far. You get to your client and say, “look, this is going to make it easier for you to reconcile.” They say,”to reconcile what? My ERP is not ready for it.”</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> I think that the ERP vendors might be further ahead than you think. When I was an ex-officio office holder of the European Payments Council, I discussed SEPA with many of the principal ERP vendors, all of whom were addressing the requirements of the new instruments and reviewing their development roadmaps accordingly. Certainly, if the MNCs and larger SMEs are going to migrate to SEPA, then it needs to ‘land’ in an ERP accounting environment.</p>
<p>However, because corporate IT development programmes also have lead times to change and ERP vendors are customer driven, I see the issue more on their demand side than their supply side. In my conversations with companies, there is a consistent complaint about poor communication from the banking industry and therefore their lack of demand for SEPA is unsurprising. Interestingly, when I test those claims, they tend to know and have seen more than they would initially claim. Something else is missing. SEPA must become less optional or more compelling if it is to better succeed.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> But that is changing rapidly. I will be speaking about SEPA tomorrow at a meeting organised by the larger Dutch employers together with the Central Bank and the other banks. There was a little bit of a wait and see attitude. Will it really happen? It has taken some time before people really understood that SEPA is here to stay. But have the ERP vendors already adapted their systems? No, they haven’t. When do they have to actually adapt them? They don’t know yet because they are waiting for specification of the SEPA Direct Debit, so it’s a little bit of a chicken and egg situation.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> I think these ERP vendors don’t develop until there are standards. You have a scheme like SEPA which is only about 30% rolled out. With the credit transfer, half the capabilities are really live, the other half will come live next year. We don’t have the collection component yet, so this is a natural evolution, it’s a ‘when not if’ conversation. That’s why the ERP vendors are reacting in this way, and that’s understandable. When we talk to corporates about it, they say, “OK, tell me if it does this, this and this?” Then we reply “Well, not yet.” So they then say “Fine, come back and tell me when it’s better, faster, cheaper.”</p>

<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> And in some cases, it is.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So can we get into a little bit of detail on this? Let’s start with the credit transfer, which you say is not doing everything it should do?</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> The bottom line is, you’ve got what they call a core basic transfer. So if you want to make a payment to a supplier or if you want to make a payroll payment, it’s simply not possible right now. You cannot yet make a payroll payment which carries the appropriate flags. As a result, that payment wouldn’t be prioritised in the way it would in any other ACH today.</p>


<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> The good news is that the next version of the SEPA Credit Transfer scheme addresses many of these issues and the purpose of the payment can be specifically added into the payment instruction. In my negotiations with the European Association of Corporate Treasurers, agreement was reached on a number of other important changes for the 2009 version too. As well as being able to identify the purpose of a payment, corporate identifiers will be able to be added as will beneficiary ‘reference party’ descriptions. These descriptions support complex group accounting structures, enable efficient cash management structures and allow innovative payment factories to be deployed for SEPA.</p>
<p>Gaining agreement to the first version of a SEPA scheme is always the hardest challenge because you are negotiating against many competing national legacy schemes. The second and subsequent versions are much easier, because then you are negotiating against the previous version. The debate about whether SEPA will happen is now over and since it has gone live, people are realising that there is no turning back. The advocates of the Single Market should be congratulated on the fact of the change, and shouldn’t get too disheartened about its initial pace.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> And I think the faster we can roll out more capability, and the faster we can settle the direct debit differences and bring the collection part of the equation to market, the sooner we can set an end date. This should help build a much more competitive landscape for processing payments transparently throughout the market. I think that’s all corporates are asking for, to easily make payments in a fully domestic European environment.</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> The market needs that from an investment point of view. One of the cost pressures inherent in the overall roadmap is the co-existence of legacy systems and the new. The last thing that the market wants to do is to have to invest in both.</p>

<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> We have pretty much burnt our bridges in a way by setting up a new payments engine. We’ve moved our different domestic payments and the interfaces to payment systems onto the same platform instead of processing separate payments in each country. So the good thing is we have a platform that we can immediately extend to customers. When you talk to corporate clients, they’re probably not directly interested in SEPA or when you talk to them about SEPA, the first thing they say is, “Well, we don’t know what’s in it, we’re not informed.” And then you start scratching, they actually know about it, but they just don’t really see what it directly means for them. If you can say very simply, “Look, what are you interested in? Are you interested in setting up payment factory? Are you interested in setting up a collections factory? Are you interested in having end- to-end processes and is your reconciliation to the accounts payable, to accounts receivable, something like that?” That talks to corporate treasurers rather than SEPA in itself. Now, can you do that more effectively with SEPA? Would it be better with SEPA than it was before? I think the answer is yes. Is it already visible today? Only partly.</p>
<p>What will really make a difference is XML.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We have pretty much burnt our bridges in a way by setting up a new payments engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> The best thing that ever happened to XML was SEPA, and you are seeing many corporates that are beginning to take advantage of XML standards, but I think we’re still years away from XML being the corporate standard for processing payments. At present, corporates simply expect banks to route payments via the most expeditious route. We’ve built flexibility into our systems to perform this so-called ‘intelligent routing’, but corporates really don’t want to be involved in that part of the process.</p>

<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Frank Taal"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/09/2008-09-tt-05-ttf-frank-taal-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>

</figure>
<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> For large corporates with a centralised treasury, cash management banks have already created a kind of semi SEPA by using pooling structures and payment factories. So you’re really left to take it from where we can further enhance the structure by having fewer accounts or less complexity with all these various formats. It is more an enhancement on top of an already efficient structure in most cases, rather than a major step forward. But, for corporates with a decentralised treasury the situation is different.</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> That depends. SEPA is intended to change the status quo after all. As some banks use the opportunity to put new platforms in place, they should find it easier to offer services outside of their traditional geography within their new domestic marketplace, which is SEPA. The new legislation facilitates this, and it also motivates organisations to respond by creating a new regulatory category of Payment Institution. The new legislation makes it easier for Payment Institutions to enter the market and also to have access to the core infrastructures to give them reach. I believe that they will innovate more effectively than many existing players, and I therefore think that the customer is going to be a winner. Reach is going to be less of a differentiator than before.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> I think you’re right. We have done the same as Fortis did to create one group platform instead of changing all the domestic systems in the countries that we are in. We both have the big differences in prices between, let’s say, the southern countries and Belgium and The Netherlands where we are more or less for free. We see a potential opportunity in countries like Italy or Spain or France, also to some extent Germany as well.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> I agree, while SEPA in isolation may not be exciting the masses, it is transformational. That to me, from a banker’s perspective, is the exciting part about it.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> Absolutely.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> I think transformational is a good adjective, and I see three dimensions for the entrepreneur. One, it’s intended to change the rules of the market; the Single Market. Policy makers will continue to intervene to address indicators of market dysfunction, such as price variation between Member States. This makes them very concerned to drive up innovation and competition. That’s what gets them up in the morning.</p>
<p>Two, it’s about innovating new sources of value for the customer. The commodity element of the payments is something of a margin race to zero, which means that a few Payment Service Providers will thrive on scale, whereas the others will have to move up the value chain. This is where it’s going to get really interesting for individuals, companies and banks alike. New services such as mobile account and payment management for all, electronic invoice presentment and payment for companies, or electronic bill presentment and payment for retail customers, are the things that are going to become increasingly important.</p>
<p>Three, it’s about understanding that payments is a vital part of a wider transaction banking business and leveraging that opportunity within the organisation. The credit crunch and associated liquidity issues are driving investors and analysts toward businesses with more stability, easier to manage risks and closer to the real economy. It is also putting a premium on the value of those businesses where they are separately identifiable. If you pull those three things together, there is a real moment of opportunity for a courageous and visionary leader.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> The change will be incremental. On this, I think we all agree. My concern is that it will be too incremental. What I mean to say is that if everybody is waiting, everybody will keep waiting.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> That’s where the majority of the corporates are right now.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> I’m concerned that if there is no real volume in the system and there is no real usage that, in the end, the development will not happen. So I think we should work on improving, enriching and enhancing the payments and the services surrounding it. It doesn’t take away the need to find launching customers which can now benefit from SEPA. SEPA is a politically driven ambition.</p>
<p>I think the government and the semi-government organisations should now stand up and really start implementing because they make 30% of the payments volume in Europe. It would be a shame if they wouldn’t start, let’s say, before the end of the year, at least a number of them.</p>

<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> There’s something I keep hearing from our clients in the pension funds, for instance. They are among the biggest issuers of payments and they have pensioners that have retired on the Costa Del Sol or in the south of France and you need to send them the payment. Part of the reason they are holding fire at the moment is they are waiting to see what’s going to hit them with the PSD, which will have as much of an impact on them as SEPA.</p>

<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Alan Koenigsberg"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/09/2008-09-tt-05-ttf-alan-koenigsberg-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>

</figure>
<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> I think that if we’re all representing the best interests of our customers, we would implement Payment Services Directive on schedule and consolidate the systems in Europe, pure and simple. I talk to corporates all the time, not only here in the region but those doing business all over the world and their question to me constantly is, “What’s taking so long?”</p>
<p>Which brings me to the Payment Services Directive and how SEPA will be legally institutionalised by the PSD implementation, and for good reason too. It’s the PSD that will bring the required level of transparency and dependability, and also the terms around handling of that payment by the banks. This all has to happen in order for there to be a fully transparent market.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’m concerned that if there is no real volume in the system and there is no real usage that, in the end, the development will not happen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> It doesn’t make sense at the end of the day to talk about an integrated European market if you don’t have an integrated European payment system. Without SEPA or something equivalent, the Treaty of Rome is a bit of a charade. I think we were absolutely right to launch that initiative at SEPA. That has prompted the legislator to elaborate the PSD which has taken on a life of its own.</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> Absolutely, but the changes do strike at the heart of core accounting systems. Many accounting systems have a premise of a single bank account number and with the existence of two (BBAN v IBAN), we go into a different set of risks.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> We spent months with our customers discussing IBAN and BBAN. The first piece of feedback they provided us with was, “I can’t manage multiple account number formats in my ERP or my traditional accounts payable system, no way.” So how is that going to work? And so now we’re making headway into the BBAN to IBAN conversion issue, and we’re helping customers manage that critical task.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> You said the customers have difficulties in working with systems next to each other. We have one customer who is a very large customer in direct debits, that issues several million direct debits per month. This customer has run through a very extensive SEPA programme. They have decided to go for a big bang approach.</p>
<p>They have said, we are not willing to have the various payment types in the various forms next to each other because it’s too complicated for us. We know that we will suffer some pain in the first two or three months, but we feel that it is a better approach to do it in one shot rather than do it in a kind of step by step approach. And we also have some customers who have started IT projects because they don’t run a supplier-built ERP system, but they have home-built systems.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What are the learning points here for a corporate? You have been saying the Payment Services Directive is the cornerstone of SEPA but does it matter to the corporate?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Once we determine how our infrastructure must adapt to those laws, then it will be time to engage the corporate community about how that impacts them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> The Payment Services Directive provides a legal framework for SEPA but has a much further reaching impact than just SEPA. It impacts all payment service provision across the EU, impacting non-euro services too.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And what should the corporate be worried about?</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> The Payment Services Directive is going to impact banks significantly. But also, corporates should be seeking advice from their banks and their treasury consultants to figure out exactly what the impacts are. If they’re in the consumer to business collections market, they may want to evaluate whether or not they’re deemed to be a payments institution. I think that they need to consult with their bankers and they need to have those conversations pretty quickly, because banks have already evaluated all of the articles in the Directive.</p>

<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> I don’t think we’re saying all companies should move in this direction, or all companies should move in that direction, but I think what I’m hearing from both of you is that companies have to seize the moment, to grab the opportunity to re-think their financial supply chain. It will certainly have different impacts in different businesses.</p>
<p>If I’m in the B2C space, say I’m a utility, I’m now supposed to be able to sell electricity cross-border. Now, can I do that easily without a SEPA Direct Debit? No, because I have to set up all those direct debits. I need to rethink my commercial strategy. Do I embark on European growth in a different way because it certainly makes it easier for me to do that? Then you start thinking, OK, how does that impact my financial supply chain? Does it change the way I buy or does it change the way I sell, and then, only then, how do I change my treasury system? Sometimes you have people who have thousands of employees dealing with reconciliation. These people are going to be impacted by a change in financial supply chain event. Ask yourself the question at board level, is it something that’s going to change our strategic business model or not?</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> I completely agree with everything you’re saying. I think the question is, “When?” If we think, as bankers, that corporates now in this financial environment, are going to actually wake up, turn around and be all singing and dancing ready for the Payments Services Directive and SEPA by November 2009, we’ve all been in banking way too long! So, it’s not realistic and that’s why I say, “When?” The time is now for us to be educating corporates.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Why is the Payment Services Directive so important to a corporate?</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> I think this is a banking activity right now until we bed down the law. Once we determine how our infrastructure must adapt to those laws, then it will be time to engage the corporate community about how that impacts them. I think that large corporates should be asking questions now and getting to grips with the impacts. They should be asking how the current text that’s been released across the EU impacts them. Broker dealers are asking questions, fund managers too, saying “Am I a payments institution?” There are channels that have been opened up to answer these questions, by the EC, in the UK by the FSA, by Treasury, etc.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> To give you an example, I think, especially for the customers using direct debits, PSD can have a major impact. The ability to return a direct debit for up to eight weeks, that is a big difference in most countries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think direct debits are going to launch in 2010, not 2009, to get away from the change freeze over the Christmas period.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> It’s also not related only to euro payments, it is for all 27 countries and it relates to all the currencies, so it’s the sterling, the Swedish krona, the Nordic kroner.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> Based on the PSD there are also changes with respect to value dating and processing time lines.</p>


<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> And the direct debit mandates.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> And the mandates. Now let’s say, there is a lead time of perhaps at least a year if you want to change your systems, because these are huge systems, you’d better start now in combination with your bank or your consultant, looking at what’s going to change.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Because, in 18 months’ time, the system is going to change?</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> We think. Except for direct debits.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> No, also for the existing direct debits,</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> There’s one of the PSD and approach factors in action!</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span>In other words, it’s impacting the domestic system, because it’s changing the law. But the problem is we’re aiming at doing something in November 2009 but we’re not sure exactly what shape it’s going to take.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> We’re not even settled down on the direct debit programme yet. And we’re not settled down on how much it’s going to cost and whether there is going to be an interchange fee. Are banks going to accept it? If there is an interchange fee, large markets like Germany and the UK may just take issue with that, and large corporates will as well. There are still a lot of rocks in the road that we’ll need to clear and I think that when we talk to corporates we must make sure they’re not unnecessarily burning a lot of calories on delivering to time lines that may yet change.</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> I’d agree with that. I think direct debits are going to launch in 2010, not 2009, to get away from the change freeze over the Christmas period.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> We care for what happens to our customers and we all want this to be resolved in an efficient way. But I think what we’re finding is that there’s a lot of developments that are being front-loaded here. But if I don’t receive final PSD law by the end of first quarter ‘09, then it’s going to be very difficult to have something properly ready for market by November.</p>

<p><span>Colboc (Fortis):</span> We are already seeing the risk materialising that the SEPA formats don’t quite seem to translate properly in every European language.</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> It’s a tough problem. On the PSD side, of course, the intention was harmonised, consistent legislation and what you’ve now got is a number of derogations in each Member State. It’s highly likely you’re going to have some inefficiencies and inconsistencies as a result.</p>

<p>I’ve had the benefit of spending a lot of time in Brussels working ‘at the European level’, and therefore have a good understanding of the ‘Brussels way’. Getting it 100% right or ensuring operational consistency is not their first consideration. Getting it consensually moving in broadly the right direction is. When we implemented the euro the mandate was much clearer, the commitment was more evident and the collaboration between the key stakeholders was more effective. The change and risk is harder with SEPA and yet this time we have much more uncertainty, not least no clear end date to mitigate co-existence risks!</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> My customers are worried about dates, they’re worried about things happening when we say they’re going to happen, so I think we’re all careful to say ‘around Q4 2009’. The other thing is that I’m not sure if a corporate necessarily needs to worry right now about the arbitrage issues between implementation of countries, ie one country implementing PSD before another. We, the banks, need to worry about that in protecting our customers.</p>
<p>The other is the arbitrage between the actual implementation – the derogations. You could in the future see a payment institution start up and then, naturally, want to go to where the laws are most flexible.</p>

<p><span>Hale (PwC):</span> Banks should now look at the market differently and how to service their customers differently. This is important because customer expectations are changing as is their voice. And I do see a few banks and a number of new entrants really responding to their call. It is not only SEPA that is disrupting the market though; it is also things like technology. If you go right back to why we’re here, the politics of it, it’s about destabilising the market to bring about a number of changes that can’t actually be architected. Let new actors come in and, notwithstanding market safety etc, see what happens. Today’s leading names in the market are in many cases not the same as existed 10 years ago.</p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (J.P. Morgan):</span> I think everything that you mentioned benefits the customer; the expansion of information reporting, the introduction of mobile devices and additional optional services. I come back to a very simple event providing a standard collection service electronically across the Eurozone. And banks are still debating the finer points of that. If we can’t get beyond these false debates then we’re not going to be able to purvey complex, pan-European technologies that actually create a single market. And I think that’s the big concern, right? We see that all of these complex disruptive projects going on are demonstrating the lack of leadership in the payments business and I think probably, over time, corporates can see that pretty clearly.</p>
<p>But this lack of leadership is perhaps understandable when you consider that communities from the finance industry, regulators, the European Commission and consumer groups have all had a hand in shaping the position we find ourselves in today. What’s important right now is that the banks strive to complete the payments value proposition, then complete the picture with a compelling collection instrument for Europe’s businesses to use.</p>
<p>Once these propositions are in place and functioning as they should, the path to legacy system closure will be a much easier one to navigate.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Thank you everyone.</p>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Please can we start by asking what IBOS is?</p>

<p><span>Angelika Ertl (HypoVereinsbank):</span> First of all it is a partnership – a partnership of associate banks – and our intention is to offer our customers the best services, with maximum proximity between the market and the customer. The best services meaning a full bank service and, for us, it’s important that we work together with a market leader in markets where we are not represented by own branches or own subsidiaries.</p>

<p><span>Lisa Ferbing (Nordea):</span> IBOS is the oldest bank club in Europe and that means the partnership banks have known each other for many years and have really integrated their services. All the banks have IBOS desks where we have dedicated people who know each other very well. It adds value for our customers because it’s a partnership among banks which is very easy to operate. We know each other so very well and our services are so integrated and we know about the differences in our own local services and so on.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But I hear other banks saying, ‘I can deliver this service because I have a branch there or because I have a banking partner there. I’ve had correspondent banking partners for many years and in fact I’ve bought some of them so they are real partners of mine now.’</p>

<p><span>Steen Madsen (Nordea):</span> The closeness of the cooperation is the core of what IBOS is. It’s an extension of our own being in the market and our own strategy in the market so it’s a perfect fit.</p>

<p><span>Ferbing (Nordea):</span> And I think the important point is that we have a very intensified partnership that means that we have committed to specific service levels and our intention is to make it as easy as possible to open accounts abroad. So if, for example, a customer of HVB would like to open an account with Nordea and we say, ‘this is our important customer too’, this makes it so much easier for the customer to get familiar with Nordea and the whole account opening process.</p>

<p><span>Bob Lyddon (IBOS):</span> Some of the most basic things turn out to be the most difficult to achieve quickly – like getting an account open. And that is the core product, the core service – easy account opening. Not only getting the account open, but creating the relationships between the company’s subsidiary and the people in that bank that the account has been opened with so that it runs smoothly at all points.</p>
<p>Parent to the introducing bank and subsidiary to the account holding bank, that’s the core service and everything else spins off from that. That is really very basic but not often achieved by general partner-banking. There’s an awful lot of discussion about bi-lateral exchanges of MT101 (SWIFT messages) but that doesn’t necessarily involve account opening. That still has to be negotiated, pricing has to be negotiated… and value dating.</p>
<p>You also have political problems inside some of these banks that say, ‘here’s a customer, how much am I earning out of that?’ That isn’t a question that ever comes up in IBOS. If it’s an IBOS referral, the account gets opened, end of story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“An advantage I got from IBOS is that you can open a new account quickly with all the paperwork done before it comes to the customer.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Okay well let’s ask the users how they find it.</p>

<p><span>Siegfried Drawell (Kennametal):</span> For us, we use IBOS for cash pooling. IBOS has the only system which allows me to arrange cash pooling from different banks without any loss in value dating. This is, for us, the best advantage which we have. We have other cash pools as well with different bank groups and we always lose one day. We collect the money locally during the day and the next morning we get it centralised, but with IBOS we get same day value. Of course we don’t see it the same-day. We see it in our account a day later, but it doesn’t matter: we have it for value purposes a day earlier. This makes IBOS unique for us. Other banks, international banks, with similar systems can make cash pooling within their own systems without any delay, but as soon as we go from one bank to another we have this one day delay, but not with IBOS. This makes IBOS unique.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And you’re able to use the money that you don’t see until the end of the day effectively? You don’t know about it until the following day, but it comes in to an interest bearing account or is used in some way?</p>

<p><span>Drawell (Kennametal):</span> Yes.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Bo Madsen (IC Companys):</span> For me it’s more about the local service our shops need. From my perspective, IBOS has been a little invisible. Sitting here and hearing of your cash pool knowledge I’m a little disappointed that I haven’t had the opportunity to choose the right banks around the world because I haven’t got IBOS banks all over the world. But it’s been invisible to me and that’s my criticism. I think it should be on your business cards so that people know it’s an IBOS member that you are dealing with.</p>

<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> That’s a well-taken comment. IBOS’ brand should not be lead brand towards the customer. The customer’s relationship with the individual bank is paramount and that bank should be the lead brand to the customers. At the same time, the IBOS brand should not be invisible.</p>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Should you position IBOS a bit like ‘Intel Inside’?</p>

<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> Yes, that’s how it should be. We should mark that point down as an ‘even better if…’.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What are the other aspects of IBOS that you do or do not like?</p>


<p><span>Drawell (Kennametal):</span> I think that individual banks are not able to offer, in all the different countries, all the right services and the same level of service through their own branches and subsidiaries, whatever they claim. We are located in all big Western European markets; like Germany, Italy, France and the UK. Spain as well, although this is a smaller market for us, and also in central European countries like Poland and Hungary. In all countries we have different kinds of services we need.</p>
<p>For example, in Italy, the so called ‘ricevute bancarie’ which are a kind of draft, a lot of our customers use them, and it is a typical Italian thing and from my experience the Italian banks can handle these things better than international banks. We tried this, for example, with an international bank in Milan and it didn’t work, so we went back to Intesa Sanpaolo because they did it so much better.</p>
<p>We saw that our international bank in Ireland was not able to give our Irish company cheques in US dollars, even though our suppliers in the US requested dollar payment by cheque. They refused wire transfers so we needed an account with an Irish bank just for this payment to the US and things like that.</p>
<p>On the other side, I think competition between our banks is good for business and is good for pricing and everything like that. We have strong competitors in our own business. We are forced by these competitors, and I think if we have more than one bank then the banks are also forced to give us the best service and the best price, of course. And that’s the reason why we prefer more than one bank relationship.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Bo, how do you find opening accounts for all your subsidiaries?</p>


<p><span>Bo Madsen (IC Companys):</span> An advantage I got from IBOS is that you can open a new account quickly with all the paperwork done before it comes to the customer. So, it just has those small coloured arrows saying ‘sign here’. That is really helpful for a lot of corporate customers, because you don’t invest that much time in it you just say, ‘I have to have an account there, because we are now opening there’.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Drawell (Kennametal):</span> What is key is that it’s one single point of entry and it’s near to me, so it should be faster, and it’s harmonised and standardised with service level agreements.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Can I ask about credit lines? How does it work from a credit line point of view? You might be operating as a branch in the country so in other words it’s still in the name of the parent, so it’s a question of will you extend credit to the parent? The other scenario would be a separate legal entity in the country. How does the whole credit process work in IBOS?</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> We have an inter-bank agreement that a small line of credit in the country where the account is being opened can be set up immediately on the credit risk of the introducing bank without any further questions. But that’s only meant to give operating credit for the operational services like direct debit or for riba (the ricevute bancarie) or something like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Instant availability of a small line of credit to just get the operating business off the ground.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Or a foreign exchange line?</p>

<figcaption>
<h6>Bob Lyddon</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> Yes. But it isn’t meant to be a working capital line. Instant availability of a small line of credit to just get the operating business off the ground. The companies are often good enough to stand up in their own right. So, to us, it’s just a question of time to go through the analysis. The alternative route of banks constantly issuing guarantees to one another consumes capital at an enormous rate and creates costs that are completely redundant really.</p>
<p>So the first main line of attack is to make sure that the discussion between the account holding bank and the local subsidiaries, facilitated by the parent treasurer and the introducing bank, should get off the ground quickly because the banks in IBOS are big commercial banks. The question is simply. ‘is the subsidiary good for it standing on their own feet, or is a letter of comfort required from the parent? Or is a guarantee required from the parent?’.</p>
<p>This is the normal discussion which should just happen quicker and with a greater openness and is easier than if you were just walking into, say, Intesa Sanpaolo off the street and they never heard of you.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And is the small operating line of credit indemnified by the introducing bank?</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> Yes it is. It isn’t that a larger amount cannot be negotiated but that, up to that small amount, the local bank has to do it because they’re committed to doing it.</p>


<p><span>Drawell (Kennametal):</span> But, for example, when you talk about Italy. In Italy, we have a one million line of credit. Our colleagues in Italy can use the account for one million because one million is covered by HVB on a daily basis and if one million is not enough, we can just call HVB and say we want to increase it for the next day to three million because we want one extraordinary transfer. Once a month we really have an extraordinary transfer for three million. I just make a call to my partner with HVB and then it’s fine. It’s very easy.</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> The difference is that’s within the operation of the DZero cash pool product, there is a credit line, an overdraft line, effectively built in. But if it’s, say, a mediumterm loan or building finance or leasing, each country has its own particular way of offering financing.</p>


<figure class=""portrait right"">
<img alt=""Portrait of Jasper Savelkoel"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2007/11and12/2007-11and12-tt-13-ttf-jasper-savelkoel-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>
<figcaption>
<h6>Jasper Savelkoel</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Jasper Savelkoel (KBC):</span> This goes to the heart of the IBOS model. We’re still independent banks acting together to gain additional business and if there are significant loans to be given or to be done in certain countries it all depends on how the company is organised. Is it organised centrally? Or are the treasury and financial functions decentralised? A lot of times we see, and with middle sized companies most of the time we see, it’s decentralised so there is a need for a strong local banking relationship between the local company and the local bank. At this level, you have negotiations about longterm loans or whatever kind of investment projects. We offer the full range of lending services that are available.</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> I think a point about foreign bank branches in any country is that they often don’t have real substance. So they’re limited in what they can do. Also if any lending product has some tax aspect to it, like leasing, you have to have a tax base in that country to offer it. Local banks do, branches of foreign banks by definition don’t, or in only a very limited amount.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Is there such a thing as a typical IBOS customer? What are the characteristics that make a typical IBOS customer?</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Madsen (Nordea):</span> From my point of view as a cash management advisor in Nordea, it’s a matter of having collection accounts with the IBOS banks. So it’s customers who don’t have any subsidiaries in the country, but they need an account with this special bank in this special country to get their customers to pay into. It’s medium sized companies generally.</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> That’s one typical profile, medium sized, requiring non-resident accounts with the IBOS banks to do collections. The other principal kind of customer is the one that has both substance and autonomy, and needs local services that can only be delivered locally, like cash, cheque, card. These can be very large groups in aggregate, but let’s stress again that their operating structure and their business line defines the banking needs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Within seven to ten years it will lead to centralisation of accounts.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Ferbing (Nordea):</span> And the reason for the decentralisation could be because you have retail customers in the specific countries where you need to use the retail way of handling their payments; it could be that you have a philosophy about your subsidiaries that they should be more independent of the parent company because they should be more in charge of their own economic resource, that could be another reason.</p>
<p>So I would say a typical IBOS customer is someone who really has a need for having some of the banking decentralised due to different ways or reasons or philosophies on how to do business.</p>


<p><span>Ertl (HypoVereinsbank):</span> I think a typical IBOS customer is someone who needs local services, most of them would like to use the DZero automatic end-of-day sweep in order to get the money back to the home country where they are catered for and they appreciate a global account management approach. That means they like to have the coordination through the host bank, but they hold accounts abroad and appreciate the existence of differing local business practices and payment – holding those accounts with IBOS banks enables these differences to be reconciled efficiently to a global approach.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> How does IBOS respond to requests for proposals (RFP) when you have somebody with needs in several different countries?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Where they have special questions or their special focus, then you can really work with those details.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> Well the RFP document is usually very thick and there are certain pieces that only the main bank needs to answer. You’d expect to get some kind of profile of each subsidiary and the needs in each country, with some stats of payment values and volumes and types. So the host bank receiving the RFP completes a customer referral sheet for each IBOS bank with the data from the RFP, stating needs for just that country and the subsidiaries in it, and anything else they know that’s relevant to that country. That’s a few pages per account holding bank. In many cases, we already know what the pricing and terms will be because they’re the IBOS terms for that volume and value and so on. Hopefully there’s only three or four points per country that need to be clarified and so by having most of the terms pre-agreed we can spend the time looking at the really key points and the cash pooling or whatever.</p>
<p>Then there is a response deadline whereby each account holding bank has to go back and give it the thumbs up or their answer and then the host bank puts it together. You can rely on the answers from your partners.</p>

<p><span>Ferbing (Nordea):</span> We have worked for so long with IBOS that we can do this in one week or less even very, very big RFP’s covering many, many countries. Where they have special questions or their special focus, then you can really work with those details. It used to take weeks and weeks five or six years ago, but today this is a very quick process. We are aware of the standardised conditions which are connected to volumes.</p>


<p><span>Savelkoel (KBC):</span> And it’s also predefined and this is very important. When account managers talk to customers they can talk about the conditions that other IBOS banks can offer and this is a completely different situation from a thirdparty bank.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Are you saying that you will provide the same pricing from all the different units? Will I see the same pricing?</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> Ah but there you see Richard, you fall into a fallacy that it’s better to get the same pricing, this is one of the real bits of spin in this game. Is one price for Europe better than having credit transfers or business priced country by country? In several countries it’s more or less free. In other words the answer is no, you get the local pricing for the local business, but we have consistent and attractive pricing for the cross-border business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“They need an account with this special bank in this special country to get their customers to pay into.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Second question is, does my volume buy me discounts in aggregate or does each bank look at the volume it’s getting and price it according to that? In other words, do I get buying power with IBOS or do I get buying power with individual IBOS members?</p>

<p><span>Ertl (HypoVereinsbank):</span> The pricing of the local business depends on the development of the local business you have as a customer with the local bank and we are aiming at increasing this business even at the cost of maybe of the host bank. So, for example, if I refer a customer to Nordea in the beginning it’s maybe just an account, but after that it develops to something more because Nordea and the customer, they do some further business and it’s good because it adds to the relationship we have with this group.</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> With regard to pricing, you have to look at the combination of item pricing and value dating. Some of these clearing systems route payments in such a convoluted manner that where you have your account is extremely important; how soon does the money reach your account after it leaves the sender’s bank, and then the value dating when it hits your account, when it is really available and how much the item charge is.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> We ought to turn to SEPA and if I could start with our corporate guests, what your thoughts are on SEPA and do you see it changing your banking?</p>


<p><span>Bo Madsen (IC Companys):</span> We still need the local banks because I need cash payments and cheques cleared and the local cards or whatever, so we’re going to need the local banks but the transfers would be easier as I see it.</p>


<p><span>Drawell (Kennametal):</span> We don’t see any change in our relationship with banks because of SEPA. We have our bank accounts, we will not increase them, we will not reduce them.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Okay let’s turn to our banking colleagues here on the SEPA issue, how do you see the SEPA and IBOS?</p>


<p><span>Savelkoel (KBC):</span> I think the main opinion is that within seven to ten years it will lead to centralisation of accounts. I’m pretty sure about it, but that does not mean that there aren’t still many, many reasons for customers to maintain multiple banking relationships. Also banks will still require fee business and payments are the core of fee business so I don’t think that there will be a lot of corporates that will actually have one account for the whole of the European Union in 2015.</p>


<p><span>Ertl (HypoVereinsbank):</span> There is also the point of risk diversification. Plus competition is very important in order to get the best service, so I think they will use several banks in order to get the better prices and to get the best services. Not to be dependent on one bank. The accounts will be reduced and the number of banks will be reduced, but the customer will be more aware of the service and the quality. IBOS has got a future because we offer – and keep on offering – best services and best pricing and we can gain customers.</p>


<p><span>Ferbing (Nordea):</span> The key values of IBOS will be there regardless of SEPA and they will still be needed. We have the knowledge of the local environment, the proximity and can break down language barriers. In fact, IBOS customers will benefit less from SEPA than others because so many of SEPA’s intended benefits are already achieved within IBOS.</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> Well, that’s true because IBOS payments already move quicker than the Prieuro service under the EBA Priority Payment scheme, and have done for some considerable time, so we have a live Prieuro service. From our examination of the Payment Services Directive, the IBOS services are already compliant. The Directive brings the rest of the market up to the level which IBOS has already been at for some time – same-day value, no deductions from principal, visibility immediately at both end. It’s all there already for IBOS customers.</p>


<p><span>Ferbing (Nordea):</span> Then we have all the soft issues and we know that soft issues always take a very long time to create a solution for. There’s this knowledge about the local environment. There’s this knowledge between the banks’ key people who are working together and they know each other. Every one of our banks has its own IBOS office to handle IBOS issues so they are very experienced and professional about account opening in different countries. Also, on the field of compliance, we know the requirements on customers around Anti-Money Laundering and these are becoming more and more important, and difficult for customers to deal with without support.</p>


<p><span>Lyddon (IBOS):</span> You used the word ‘professional’ about account opening. It is a professional activity, not a clerical one, and so many banks handle it as if it’s a clerical activity. With all the different requirements and foreign languages, it is a professional activity and that’s the only way to handle it.</p>


<p><span>Ferbing (Nordea):</span> And for us I think it’s also an important point that you have knowledge in our organisation, especially concerning tax issues. For example, we have stamp duty in different countries so if you have members in the IBOS organisation who have experience with stamp duty, we can recommend some things that customers should consider. That’s what customers appreciate. We are not allowed to give any legal advice, but we can say what is important, what you have to consider and that’s the combination; not only account opening, but you get a full package and full service and I think that’s the big advantage.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Thank you everyone.</p>

<p class=""management-summary"">Malév Hungarian Airlines is a medium-sized airline in Europe operating one of the youngest fleet on the continent. It is a traditional network airline offering services to 59 cities in 36 countries outside Hungary.</p>
<p>Characteristics of a traditional network airline are to maintain local sales activity on the local markets and to provide instant passenger transfer management on every destination. Beside the sales and customer service activities the local financial tasks are also managed by the representative offices. They are responsible for collecting the direct sales income and handling the payments of local suppliers’ invoices like fuel purchase, airport fees and marketing related costs.</p>
<p>The decentralised operational structure requires local banking services preferably close to the airports and strong Group Treasury control of the local payment flows and liquidity positions.</p>
<p>With these main objectives in mind, Malév decided to maintain banking partnership with IBOS association whose members are leading banks within their home markets and thus able to offer a full range of domestic services, on the other hand gaining from the standardised remote account opening procedures, uniform conditions and account reporting tools IBOS member banks provide to their mutual Corporate customers.</p>
<p>The following structure has been implemented by K&amp;H Bank, the Hungarian associated bank of IBOS and the international cash management partner of Malév:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Account maintenance with IBOS banks for the local Malév operations in Belgium (KBC), Czech Republic (CSOB), Poland (Kredyt Bank), Germany (HVB), Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark (Nordea), UK (RBS), France (HSBC), Spain (Santander), Italy (Intesa Sanpaolo) and in the US (JPMorganChase).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralized cash management service implemented in the e-banking solution of KBC Bank Group called w1se. The daily account statements of every foreign bank account are available in w1se and it also facilitates payments handling from the local office or the Hungarian Group Treasury from a single platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Liquidity reporting to the Malév Group Treasury allows better control of liquidity positions and funding requirements. This leads to savings for Malév and a satisfied customer for the IBOS banks.</p>
<p>After the successful implementation Malév seeks future potential of the IBOS association. Cross border cash pool service of the IBOS banks might be a good solution for the company’s further working capital optimization.</p>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> There’s been a lot of talk about Basel II in the last few years. Where are we on this and how is it going to impact users of money funds?</p>


<p><span>Joanna Cound (BlackRock):</span> We believe it will have a significant impact on the ability of financial institutions to invest their balance sheet cash in money market funds. I think most of the industry is trying to think through how attractive money market funds will be compared to other asset classes and at what speed the banks will start investing in money market funds.</p>


<p><span>James Finch (BGI):</span> Yes, that’s a fair comment, I think the thing with Basel II is that there’s still a lot of unknowns in terms of the application of it and how the individual banks themselves are going to adopt it.</p>


<p><span>Kathleen Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> And even the individual banking commissions in each country don’t yet know how. They’re still being educated, they don’t know what their requirements will be under the two risk rating scenarios that banks can apply.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So basically IMMFA has done its job. The lobbying has worked and you’ve got money funds approved as an investment with a 20% weighting like inter-bank deposits. Now you’re working on the detail of how it’s going to happen, not is it going to happen.</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> We’re working on it in two ways. We’re working directly with the underlying clients, but in terms of the regulation, we’ve won the battle at the EU level and now we have to work at the national implementation level – working with the prime regulators on how they’re interpreting the directives and how they’re looking to implement them.</p>


<p><span>Richard Norval (RBS):</span> There’s a huge process of client and prospect education that we are undertaking. There are two aspects to this. The first is how we put this message across to our clients, that these are attractive investments and how do we get them to accept that at board level so that they can be added to a portfolio of instruments that they’re entitled to use. The second, which is where we’re starting to do even more work, is what do we have to do internally in terms of publication of fund data that we’re not doing at the moment. This is for those banks that want to meet the requirements of the IRB approach<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> to risk rating their investment in funds.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> I guess this doesn’t bother a corporate investor though does it?</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> To a large extent, this makes funds more attractive to financial institutions and the by-product of that will be larger funds with more liquidity, a wider investor base and therefore more attractiveness to corporates. A corporate shouldn’t worry about getting the detail of the underlying assets in the fund. This is something the banks are going to have to go through simply to get it in the right bit of their balance sheet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It will have a very significant impact on the ability of financial institutions to invest their balance sheet cash in money market funds.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What are the banks going to be using it for? Their day-to-day liquidity? Isn’t that what you call ‘hot money’? Aren’t you going to have a lot of money flowing in and out of the funds?</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> Quite possibly yes. Having spoken in-depth to our money market teams, this isn’t the panacea that we all thought it might be. There are still huge issues, with the fund size, and issues with the cut-off time of the sterling fund. Having a fund that cuts off at one o’clock when your bank is trying to settle up positions at four o’clock in the afternoon, isn’t actually a great deal of help. It simply adds to the tools that the banks have at their disposal, but that doesn’t actually mean that you’re going to get a waterfall of cash flowing into funds as a result. But they do, inherently, become more attractive.</p>


<p><span>Ian Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> Immediately, it is likely to be the banks with smaller treasury desks and less sophisticated risk systems who will be interested in money funds, as it gives them immediate access to a highly rated product with a low risk weighting. Under the new rules, placing cash with single A and AA banks may have higher risk weightings than a money market fund depending on the duration of the trade. So money market funds are a more viable option. The larger banks are unlikely to use funds in the same way.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> There are times when money fund rates are very attractive and there are times when money fund rates may be marginally less attractive. It strikes me that a bank will be very aware of these opportunities and will try to arbitrage the funds.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> I think with all our clients it’s just an education process and this is, for us, another client type that is being opened up. You explain how the funds are structured, how to utilise them etc. I think in the majority of cases, we’ve been very pleased in terms of the way in which new clients treat these vehicles – because they know that by coming in and out of the funds on a large scale, they’re potentially damaging the yield for themselves if they want to come back in at a later point.</p>


<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> And the fund providers themselves should set limits in terms of, the actual maximum level of the investment any individual underlying client can make. That inherently is the prevention of having one client coming in and out and skewering the fund return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Funds are rated and abide by a code of practice but were relatively unknown by regulators in a number of EU countries. So IMMFA has been working very hard at getting triple-A rated money market funds recognised by regulators.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> Paradoxically, I’ve actually found that it’s our corporate clients who are more sensitive to rates. Our financial institutions client base has been far more stable.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Why is that?</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> Because they’re seeking alpha elsewhere. What they’re seeking from their cash is first of all capital preservation, then liquidity coupled with a decent yield. They worry about ten or twenty basis points, not two or three.</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> What’s the point? It really makes a very small impact on an overall basket return.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What has IMMFA (Institutional money market funds Association) been doing recently?</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> Well IMMFA has had a very good 12 to 18 months and most of it is on the regulatory side. We’ve talked about Basel II already and then there’s MIFID (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), which, for the first time, is opening up client money – an area where money market funds have never been allowed to be used; funds are now the equivalent of bank deposits. Money market funds have also been recognised by CESR’s (The Committee of European Securities Regulators) advice to the European Commission. This is of fundamental importance for corporate investors as well as financial institutions. This means that amortisation has been recognised in UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) legislation, which is fundamental to having a stable NAV (Net Asset Value) fund. When the legislation first came out in consultation form, the ability for amortisation was drastically reduced and that would have eradicated the whole of the stable NAV money fund business in Europe in a single stroke.</p>
<p>A potential threat was turned into an opportunity. IMMFA Funds are rated and abide by a code of practice but were relatively unknown by regulators in a number of EU countries. So IMMFA has been working very hard at getting triple-A rated money market funds recognised by regulators. When CESR put out their first consultation paper, we said that what they were proposing would wipe out our industry and so we worked with them, the Irish regulators and others to get amortisation written into UCITS, which now means that our funds are recognised and that straight line amortisation of income is a recognised valuation method throughout Europe. This helps both the clients because they can say yes it’s recognised by regulators, but it also means that a lot of asset managers who are managing enhanced funds for example, can see that rating is now a valuable thing in legislation. So you’re seeing continental European providers starting to rate their funds as well, which is helping the whole of the industry – both AAA-rated funds and enhanced funds.</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> One of the things I’ve seen when speaking to potential clients in continental Europe is that many are not aware of IMMFA. When explained, it tends to give them a higher level of comfort and differentiates the product a little from the many non-IMMFA providers in the market. IMMFA is made up of 20 or 25 providers of solid, good money market funds who actually meet on a regular basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The by-product of that will be larger funds with more liquidity, a wider investor base and therefore more attractiveness to corporates.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> All IMMFA member firms adhere to a code of conduct that must be recertified annually and provides more detaield guidance to members on process.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> Part of the education as we go into the new markets is discussing the best way to reflect money market funds within a corporate treasury policy. Whilst the corporate might currently limit bank deposits per counterparty with a fixed amount, say €100m, when using money funds, they should limit exposure as a percentage of fund size, say 10%. By using a fixed currency limit, you can actually increase risk by forcing yourself to add more and more money market funds as your cash balance increases.</p>


<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> And also the fact that a fund is separate from the provider’s on balance sheet bank deposits. It’s making that distinction that is important.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Isn’t there a danger that you end up with a more grossed-up exposure than you think you have because all the funds are investing in the same underlying assets?</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> This issue came up with a client we saw recently who is just changing the whole structure of their treasury operations. They were interested in creating a fund of money market funds for their internal cash and they wanted to use at least eight providers. Firstly, we suggested they look at the IMMFA providers. We also consulted the rating agencies to see if rating a fund of money market fund was viable. They said this is very difficult because funds tend to buy the same investments and the client could become extremely exposed to one particular underlying issue within the portfolio. So we advised them against adding more than about five different providers and even then it is going to be difficult to look through and see the potential exposures – even if we start providing portfolio holdings lists.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Can we talk some more about regulation of money funds. You’ve all been saying that various pieces of legislation are coming and you’ve lobbied and made sure they are money fund friendly, but what about actual regulation of money funds? Where are we on that?</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> We’ve drafted a consultation paper that we’ve discussed with regulators in Ireland and Luxembourg. Now we’re in the process of setting up meetings with a range of other regulators to try and find out what their views are; what the pros and cons are and then we’ll take it from there. So we’re in the midst of considering whether we should move to local regulation or not at the moment.</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> I think there is now more appetite from the fund providers to accept a regulation that gives us a 2a-7 style badge that we can use. Not that I’ve come across a huge number of corporates who think it really matters, but if it can be done without compromising your investment policy, without comprising the way in which you manage your funds, then there is a grudging acceptance within the money fund providers community, because it ticks a lot of boxes that might be in somebody’s treasury policy.</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> All the lobbying was a phenomenal amount of work, but definitely worth it!</p>


<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> Yes, the improvement is more on the lobbying side than on the corporate treasury side – we’ve never run across a corporate treasurer that said, ‘oh I can’t buy this fund because you know there’s not a 2a-7 badge on the fund’.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> I think the other overlay is that the providers themselves should self regulate in terms of the actual policies and procedures they have in-house. That’s the final link in the chain really. So you have rating agencies, the UCITS Directive, the prospectus and then the individual policies which each fund manager should be adhering to.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But the real independent teeth in all that is the rating agencies. What are they doing, what changes are we going to see with the rating agencies?</p>


<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> Well, we’ve seen more funds that have traditionally been unrated seeking AAA ratings – that’s one trend. Another is that they’re always looking at new securities. One of these is extendable notes and CP (Commercial Paper). It’s a big market in the US, it’s very liquid and it’s proven. It’s less developed over here, but I think it’s a chicken and egg problem &amp; as it won’t become a bigger market until you know more funds are buying these instruments. So I think Moodys recognises it in the US, it’s a proven market and I think we’ll see it become more significant here.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Now let’s define what we’re talking about here, we’re talking about instruments that, at the borrowers request, can be extended for a further period?</p>


<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> Yes and the investors can put it back or they can extend it. It’s usually issued with maybe a five year plan maturity and the first maturity is 13 months so to be suitable for the funds that can invest in 13 months paper. We’re looking at how that fits the Moody’s matrix right now, but it’s only going to be a very small percentage of the portfolio, so we’re not talking about a large amount of money piling in.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> I think a lot of the funds are approaching a common view. Previously having more than one ratings agency could well have cost you some yield. That’s because the rating agencies view your funds fundamentally quite differently, depending on which rating agency you were rated by. However, my instinct is that there is a degree of convergence about rating agencies’ views on how a fund should be rated.</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> S&amp;P and Moody’s had differing views on money market funds and their investment in ABS (Asset-Backed Securities). Moody’s allowed funds to invest up to 10% of the portfolio in ABS with a four-year average life, whereas S&amp;P rules stated a two-year legal final date.</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> That was a difference on yield, a few basis points of performance.</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> And then Moody’s went through a very large consultation process and they’ve now amended it, where they have introduced an ABS matrix, which depends on various things: whether the security is AA or AAA rated, what type of instrument it is and how long it’s going out – based on that you can put in different percentages. So, this way of evaluating the ‘risk’ of a fund has become stricter.</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> So there’s been a move towards increasing the number of ratings agencies that rate your funds.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Ian, you are only rated by S&amp;P?</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> We haven’t had any specific requests for ratings from any other agencies. If we get a request we will consider adding another rating agency.</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> S&amp;P is more restrictive on ABS, but it’s more flexible in other areas.</p>
<p>With us, when we carried out analysis on this with our client base, we wondered whether we should go for one, or if we should go for two or even three! We talked to our clients and it was just short of 50% who said they needed dual-rated funds owing to their investment policies.</p>


<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> A lot of corporates do require that and there are certain clients who require Fitch as well. If it’s important to the client, it makes sense economically.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> I think it’s just as important that the individual managers themselves have a credit process, so that they’re not taking the views of the rating agencies as the holy grail and they’re doing their own due diligence on the underlying instruments that are being put into the portfolio. I think sometimes our whole market is maybe doing itself a slight disservice by talking about these funds as a commoditised product which can be selected simply on a fund rating. What we should do, is actively encourage clients to spend more time understanding the investment process and how much effort we put into credit analysis. You can find broad differences between money market funds by how much resource they have dedicated to it. Credit agencies should not be the sole provider of influence with regards to the instruments in a portfolio.</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> Not all providers of money market funds have internal credit analysts. The credit analysts produce approved lists that are more conservative and reduce significantly the universe of securities the fund manager can invest in. Practically everyone around this table would be able to say that of any security downgraded, we pulled it off our approved list months before the rating agency action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is exactly why an investor should understand the provider, the credit research process and how their approved list is derived.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> I think with the larger providers, you won’t find that level of differentiation, but I think what it comes to is the understanding of what the actual management of these underlying funds is.</p>
<p>Another topic which we should probably talk about is portals. An area of interest for corporates is as you remove the level of dialogue between the corporate and the underlying asset manager – ie by trading through a portal – you can have a tendency to reduce that level of conversation on that very important topic. That’s a key point where I see that with investor education you may lose that level of dialogue, because you’re not speaking to the client!</p>

<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> There’s a whole bunch of assets that we could comfortably purchase and maintain the fund’s AAA rating, but these don’t pass the strict criteria set out by our credit research department.</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> There’s a couple of providers who would buy those particular instruments.</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> This is exactly why an investor should understand the provider, the credit research process and how their approved list is derived – and the process around an issuer being added or removed.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But there’s an underlying premise here that therefore the other ones are riskier?</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> I think a lot of corporate investors look at the name that’s standing behind the fund. A lot of corporate clients will want to take comfort in the size of the organisation and the standing of the organisation that’s promoting that fund.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What’s going on in the portal’s space?</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> It’s a function of what’s happened already across FX and depo markets. The clients want simplicity and they want to be able to access a number of providers in a straightforward way.</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> Trading via portals has become very popular in the US and is becoming increasingly popular over here. It’s much, much smaller at present, but we would expect it to go the same way.</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> It’s only ever going to appeal to a certain slice of the clients, those who are comfortable dealing online, comfortable dealing with a third-party potentially between themselves and the final fund providers. I think it’s funny that the portal providers are literally telling me primarily that corporate clients may use two or three funds. My feeling is that ultimately, they will have more success with financial institutions who could be dealing on behalf of 20 or 30 different counterparties, where actually them being able to log on to a site and place and invest on behalf of the 20 or 30 accounts that you’re managing does genuinely save you time. If you’re a corporate and you’re dealing with one or two funds consistently and you place money once a week, then right now, is a portal going to bring you a great deal of advantage?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The term ‘enhanced’, can really be anything. All of our enhanced funds have diff erent benchmarks, diff erent guidelines etc.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> And portals are all different. Some come in through an omnibus relationship so you don’t know who the underlying client is and for a corporate client that’s sometimes not attractive. They want their bank to know that they’re actually using the funds, having monies in the funds, placing monies in the funds. So whether its disclosed or undisclosed can make a difference as well.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> We’re on a select number of underlying portals and it’s on the back of client requests. I think that’s the important point – just listening to the underlying clients and helping them facilitate how they want to trade. Certain clients want a direct relationship and some clients want to trade through portals. If you provide a number of options, that can only be good for the clients – it just gives them choice.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Is IMMFA going to do something in this space?</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> It’s not been discussed yet.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Enhanced funds, super funds, whatever you want to call them, what’s going on in this space?</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> Its a big catch-all term really. I think the one thing to point out is that AAA funds, because of the nature of the rating, all look similar in the sense that they use the same benchmark, the same restrictions. The term ‘enhanced’, can really be anything. All of our enhanced funds have different benchmarks, different guidelines etc. So I think it’s a catch-all term which can mean a variety of different things, but certainly I think they’re gaining in popularity for a bunch of reasons. They’re not cash, they’re really the first step to short-term bond funds. But they do make a nice compliment to AAA funds if you can determine you’ve got some cash that’s got a longer investment horizon and is a bit more stable.</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> If you spoke to 10 clients about what they wanted from an enhanced cash fund, you’d get 10 different answers, you’d get 10 different performance regimes, you’d get 10 different liquidity requirements and you’d get 10 different credit requirements. So in fact, all you can ever do as a provider of an enhanced fund is try and blend something that appeals to most of the client base that you are going to. An enhanced fund is never going to appeal to all of your clients. And the second problem is that at certain points during any interest rate cycle, there is a strong possibility that your enhanced fund is going to be under performing your AAA fund and so morally – and from the point of view of client service – your best advice to your client is actually to redeem from that enhanced fund and place that money to the same-day fund which, is of course, exactly what the fund doesn’t need at that particular point in the cycle – it needs more cash coming in.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> We’ve seen strong demand from corporate investors for our enhanced funds. These funds are still focused on preservation of capital and are rated –AA or above, so fit with their treasury policy in terms of bank counterparty risk. The main point is that this is a longerterm investment, not a cash fund. There are times in an investment cycle when it will under perform, but over the cycle, you should see a yield benefit from these vehicles. Clients who understand this have been very positive and we’ve seen a tremendous amount of growth from corporate clients in these funds.</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> I think the holy grail for the corporate client is something that gives them a AAA type fund, yield plus 50 basis points for example. There are times in the yield curve environment when it is nigh on impossible to achieve this out performance of a AAA rated fund with minimal additional risk.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Looking to the future, what’s going to be going on?</p>


<p><span>Norval (RBS):</span> Five years from now I would expect to see less providers than there are at the moment.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> We will also see further interest from the corporate pension funds due to shifts in the way they invest to match liabilities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What we’re seeing now, due to LDI mandates, is a big increase in absolute levels of cash to collateralise the swaps.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So this in relation to liability driven investment (LDI)?</p>


<p><span>Cound (BlackRock):</span> Yes, and you need to have something like a money market fund or an enhanced fund to produce the returns for the swap.</p>

<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> We’ve always had corporate pensions using money market funds for the 4% to 5% of residual cash in the portfolio, but what we’re seeing now, due to LDI mandates, is a big increase in absolute levels of cash to collateralise the swaps. So a pension fund could see cash levels rise to a very significant level and in this environment, its management becomes a very important consideration.</p>


<p><span>Hughes (JPMorgan):</span> If you ask a corporate treasurer what their main concern is, on their list is pension under funding, because the rating agencies are putting the liability back on the balance sheet. So it’s inhibiting the corporates ability to raise cash or finance something. So they’re paying big attention to that and increasing their expertise – so in some way we could see a corporate familiar with funds and the use of funds increasing.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> Also, because of the length of a pension funds time horizon, it lends itself more towards enhanced funds as well.</p>
<p>They’re generally not using money market funds for short-term cash flows, these are long-term multi year ones, so the development of specific LDI cash vehicles or enhanced funds fits squarely in that type of conversation.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Any final comments on where the fund industry is going?</p>


<p><span>Lloyd (Rabobank):</span> I think you’re going to see some local currency funds emerge. Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen funds have been set up by a few providers. You will see more providers enter these markets especially Yen as interest rates begin to rise in Japan.</p>


<p><span>Finch (BGI):</span> One of the important considerations for corporates will be in terms of the liquidity available from these new currency funds. They may offer next day liquidity rather than the same-day if they’re managed out of London, but yes new currencies definitely. In short, wherever there are big pools of cash, you’re going to find new funds emerging. So there’s a theme – new currencies.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Thank you.</p>

SEPA – the impact on corporates ,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>SEPA is the single most important development in European payments in current times. It will have a major impact on the payment infrastructure and the banking industry. It will enable corporates to pursue very different cash management structures and benefit from lower banking fees. But, it is still not clear how it will all happen, when the existing systems will be phased out and exactly what it will mean for corporates. We invited these leading bankers to debate these issues and this is what they said:</p>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Today we’re talking about the impact of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) on corporates and the first question is what are the big opportunities for corporates with the introduction of SEPA?</p>


<p><span>Brendan Reilly (Deutsche Bank):</span> The hope is that there’s going to be a lot more standardisation. So the corporates who have activities in several countries will be able to take advantage of that standardisation and be able to use that single set of standards across those countries to gain much more reliable information flows. The SEPA credit transfer provides the guarantee that up to 140 characters of remittance information must flow end-to-end – corporates have never been certain of that before, but will be certain of that with the SEPA schemes. Similarly, they can rely on return codes and their standardisation, so they can review this and their back office processes in order to take advantage of those codes and the reliable flow of information. Those are just a couple of benefits.</p>


<p><span>Alan Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> I would first characterise the changes in Europe not unlike many of the changes around the rest of the world. It provides corporates with more ease of use and the possibility of straight through processing. I find today that, with many of our corporates, the client experience is challenged because they have to go through multiple experiences and separate clearing systems for urgent and non-urgent payments. SEPA provides, in the end game, a consolidation of those clearing systems so they can have reliable standards for the origination of payments. They can leverage, as applicable, their ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems for the production of their standard file format in XML (Extensible Mark-up Language) and then, on the other side, be able to receive returns and to automate them fully end-to-end.</p>


<p><span>Frank Taal (ING):</span> I would like to add to that – I think there is the opportunity to reduce the number of bank accounts. There is, of course, an organisational issue that companies have to keep in mind, namely what their administrative setup is. But basically, the opportunity to reduce the number of bank accounts will be there. This is beneficial to cash management, but of course, this is only the first step. In the longer run – and this is also the view of the European Commission – we can create a uniform platform upon which we can develop our new products and services. Products such as e-invoicing and e-payments, from where in the end, the real benefit should come. We’re at the starting point now of enabling more end-to-end European processes, enabling us to simplify cash management. The real benefit will come from new services based on the harmonised payment landscape we will then have in Europe.</p>


<p><span>Michael Turner (Fortis):</span> Ultimately, SEPA will be domestic. For example in Belgium, they’re already saying that the ACH (Automated Clearing House) will disappear, so therefore SEPA will be domestic. We also need to look at the real benefit for corporates. It’s not just about bank account structure. It’s a good time for them to look at their working capital procedures and how it will effect their liquidity management and cash flow management. So corporates can use the opportunity of SEPA as a catalyst and they should start reviews with this in mind.</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> There are two big obstacles still in the way that even the Payment Services Directive doesn’t fully acknowledge or cover. These are tax harmonisation issues and all those central bank reporting requirements. We don’t really have any firm commitments that it will change, so from a corporate’s perspective, one of the first questions they ask is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How can I begin to consolidate the number of accounts that I have throughout the Eurozone market, because that’s really where I’m going to reap benefits from a liquidity perspective first and foremost.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then secondly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How can I look at the consolidation of my collection business and that of course, is direct debits.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p><span>Reilly (Deutsche Bank):</span> It’s also worth adding that definitions are really important here. So you do have to be clear that SEPA actually only applies to the banks that have signed the adherence agreements, or indeed the banks that will sign.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What are adherence agreements?</p>


<p><span>Reilly (Deutsche Bank):</span> The adherence agreements are key, they are actually part of the scheme documentation – ie the credit transfer scheme documentation or the direct debit scheme documentation. It basically says that you, as a bank, agree to adhere to the rules of the scheme and only by agreeing to adhere to these rules do you become reachable through the scheme. For example, I can’t send a SEPA credit transfer to a bank that has not signed an adherence agreement.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And do all the banks have to join?</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> Well inevitably they’re going to have to join in order to participate. I think that part of this is a technicality. We talk about 28<sup>th</sup> January 2008 like it is this magical date, when the world will change. However, nothing much will change on 28<sup>th</sup> January. It’s a threshold date for the beginning of a consolidation.</p>
<p>Targeting the third quarter 2009 for the final adoption of the PSD (Payment Services Directive) throughout the market is aggressive. So you’ll likely have challenges in creating and managing a direct debit programme in early 2009 if you chose to do so. So you have to look at other markets around the world to see how they consolidated their businesses. It took the United States 30 years to get the ACH system that they have today – 30 years! The Australian market took over 20 years as well. For us to think that in just a couple of years’ time we’re going to have a fully operable, well governed, fully adopted programme is very optimistic. We have to be honest with corporates because what they’re reading in the newspapers – and even in the FT – sounds very optimistic. Not all banks may be lit up and on the network and on-line to be able to participate.</p>


<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> I fully agree with that, I think there are also country differences. For instance, in Belgium, the banking community has decided to give up their clearing house and have a very quick conversion to SEPA. Their very aggressive migration plan ends in 2011, so in approximately three year’s, they want to have migrated from all the existing domestic solutions to SEPA products. So you can imagine that the impact of SEPA for, let’s say, international trading corporates – and also for the domestic corporates – is quite direct. So in the Belgium market, let’s say half of the market is expecting to start using SEPA products and to migrate to SEPA in the first two years. But if you ask the same question to a Dutch or perhaps French corporate, I think you would get a totally different picture.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: By moving the introduction date for SEPA Direct Debits, the original end date for introducing SEPA from 2010 also moves, but has not been confirmed yet.</em></p>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> What’s interesting is that the Belgian market moves its current domestic programme to SEPA compliance and so corporates in that market will say that they will leverage SEPA products, but they may not be able to leverage them outside Belgium.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So how will this work if my bank is a member of a Pan-European Automated Clearing House, but not all the other banks in Europe are members of it? Some may not have joined at all and some are going to be members of another PE-ACH (Pan-European Clearing House). How will payments get made?</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> I can only speak for ING, but we have thought of this question because I fully agree that not all the banks will have signed the adherence agreements by the end of this year. We will have banks, perhaps hundreds and thousands of banks, small banks, who are formally not reachable according to the SEPA adherence agreements. This is something that you can’t explain to your customer. You can’t publish a table every day or every week in which you list all the banks which are reachable.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So what happens if I tell you ‘pay this bank, this account number’ and the bank is not in a SEPA clearing system?</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> What we will do is what we do now. We will route the payment instructions via other clearing mechanisms, correspondent banking arrangements, or our own network and process them on a ‘best effort’ basis. So that could mean that the majority of payment instructions are going exactly according to the SEPA rulebooks, but a number will be processed according to other rules. The ordering customer won’t have too much trouble with it because we won’t reject anyone, but we will re-route some payments and the beneficiary will not get a SEPA compliant payment order on his account.</p>


<p><span>Reilly (Deutsche Bank):</span> Deutsche bank, a while back, took the step of sending a letter to CSM’s (Clearing Settlement Mechanisms) asking them to confirm that they would be able to send SEPA credit transfers (SCTs) to Deutsche Bank or any of its branches through the EBA’s (European Banking Association) STEP2 system which is a PE-ACH. So in other words, we have nominated the EBA as our PE-ACH SCT CSM! Or in plain English, essentially what we’re saying is we’re not going to join the local clearing schemes for the purposes of sending or receiving SEPA credit transfers on day one.</p>

<h6>Alan Koenigsberg</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> Corporates ask us, ‘which clearing settlement mechanism is more effective on day one?’ and I’ve got to say the EBA, in many cases, may not be the most effective clearing settlement mechanism on day one and they may choose to carry on using legacy clearing and settlement mechanisms until such a time as we see the consolidation.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase has sent a very similar letter asking for all of our payments to be routed through EBA. We’ve made the decision that the EBA is our clearing house of choice because we believe that they have the furthest reach.</p>
<p>A bank may not be a direct member and the performance of that payment may not be as effective as the current legacy environment. Our corporates need to know that, because it’s being handled two or three times before it gets to the end financial institution and therefore it may take two or three days longer for the payment to clear. We need to develop, for example, more dynamic tables which are continually updated and look for low-cost routing or ‘best time’ routing.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Will D+3 apply payments to banks that are SEPA compliant, but may be reachable through a different PEACH than your bank uses?</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> This relies very much on the route the payment is taking. In some of the European countries we have already D+1 today; in some others the average processing time is D+3. If the first ACH in line receives that payment and then has to turn around and find the beneficiary bank through another ACH or send it to a legacy clearing system, this will then certainly add another day or two to the process. So it’s unlikely to be out of compliance for some of the payments from day one.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What will happen to pricing?</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> There are some countries – for example Italy, France and Spain – in which corporates pay much more for banking services than, for instance, in Belgium, the Netherlands or Finland. So I can imagine that in some countries you can expect quite a dramatic reduction of the fees at short notice. I don’t expect that to happen in the lowcost countries, because it’s virtually zero now and there’s not much to reduce. Large payment users could use a payment account, a special payment account for instance in Belgium or the Netherlands so that would, of course, create a price pressure in a country such as Spain or Italy. Actually, it is part of our strategy and the European Commission wants us to create a larger payment market in which there is more competition in the end.</p>


<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> But at the same time, you’ve got the Payment Services Directive (PSD) which will reduce value dating. The PSD is determining the execution cycles – so ultimately there will be only a one-day float on the debit side. For example, in some countries at the moment, clients pay a fee on individual transactions, whereas in other countries the banks do not charge a fee, but rely on the value of the float. Once this float is removed, potentially there will be a lot of negotiation to be done with regard to pricing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Because its being handled two or three times before it gets to the end financial institution… it may take two or three days longer for the payment to clear.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> On the electronic ACH side, there is value dating and it does exist predominately in Southern Europe and somebody is paying for the transactions and it’s typically the receiver. I think that there will be a shift in who’s paying for what and how the fees are assessed.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What should corporates be aware of with regard to the PSD?</p>


<p><span>Karsten Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> You have to keep in mind that the PSD is not only for SEPA products, it also concerns the existing products which are regulated by the PSD so that it will affect us first and foremost on existing work. Take authorised direct debit as another example in relation to PSD, where the period is harmonised on eight weeks.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Is that the period during which the payment can be returned?</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> Yes, the new rules will be that it can be returned within eight weeks. Those utility companies or other corporates, which are not internationally operating companies, and which use European direct debit, will find that it also affects their existing direct debits, products and systems in their domestic locations as we use them today.</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> In the Netherlands, the documentation and mandate is another major issue for the big corporates because this has to be changed. There is a lot to be done for the corporates before they can, on a legal basis, join the SEPA scheme. We are currently investigating how we can minimise the hassle for corporates.</p>


<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> This is where we’re going to be helped by the corporates, because the Payments Services Directive didn’t effectively say, ‘your existing mandate for your local direct debit scheme will transport into the SEPA scheme’. There is a different country by country approach as to how to move the existing direct debit contracts to SEPA ones. However, there is an opportunity for countries to take account of this when they embed the PSD into their national legislation. So if corporates, along with others, were to say to their local government, ‘when you’re incorporating the PSD, could you also ensure you include the statement that existing mandates will apply a SEPA scheme’, then that would be exceptionally helpful.</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> We have had many discussions with corporates in Germany. This is the one reason why they are saying, ‘thank you very much, but it is too much of an effort to switch to the new scheme.’</p>


<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> But if a German corporate is going to be able to take a direct debit from a company just south of Naples, rather than wait for a draft, that potentially could open up different opportunities. So moving away from the local direct debit to cross-border direct debit, are we going to see collection factories ultimately alongside payment factories? Of course, this initially will only be valid for a select group of multinationals, but it is conceivable that, in time, these services may be outsourced.</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> I think for the type of business corporates have, there is a need for close credit control on the payer and I believe that it will be local business. Although it will remain local business, I can imagine that in the same way in which you could create a payment factory, why could you not create a collection factory with multi-lingual expertise which collects debts for you all around Europe, or you do it on behalf of others?</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> This happens in other markets. You see Mastercard RPPS (Remote Payment and Presentment Service) in the United States is essentially that – a collection factory across 50 states.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But the SEPA direct debit scheme as it stands now is not particularly attractive to the end user, is it?</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> For a German or Dutch user no, because their direct debit programmes today are efficient. They are very easy to use and do lack bureaucracy.</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> There’s the problem. I think you can have a group, a segment of companies who want to collect crossborder for which the SEPA direct debit could be a perfect instrument, but at the same time, you have the majority of the direct debits running in the domestic schemes. I think it will be very difficult to migrate the very efficient, German, Dutch or other efficient domestic schemes, to the new SEPA direct debit scheme. That will be extremely difficult. But in the longer term, it’s a no brainer, we will migrate, there is no alternative.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> You’re in danger of having to close down very efficient systems that the customer likes and pushing them on to a system that in some respects may be inferior then!</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> The direct debit model will need to evolve to a point where that product has the feature and functionality and the value added services that make it attractive. So that consumers and corporates – as well as B2B (Business-to-Business) and C2B (Consumer-to-Business) – are willing to participate. Otherwise we’re going to have an infrastructure that will be underleveraged.</p>


<p><span>Reilly (Deutsche Bank):</span> The EPC is already developing a separate scheme which would be voluntary as opposed to mandatory. It would apply to B2B transactions where you need a scheme that provides greater certainty and removes the possibility of a refund if a valid mandate is in place. It’s quite likely that it’s going to be introduced in parallel with the standard scheme.</p>
<p>What you don’t want is to have an emergence of local communities within SEPA schemes which make it very difficult for you to move from one local community to another because then we just get back to where we are today. Sometimes, when you talk to some of these CSM’s, they’re starting to mention having the flexibility to provide specific communities with special services and that might make life very difficult in terms of sending transactions from local community to another.</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> If the five banks round this table get together and decide for every transaction destined for any one of us we want to have special rules and value added services as well as packaging and features and functionality to make us more competitive – and we don’t need to go through a clearing house because of the switch so we can save that expense – that’s fantastic. The bad idea is 20 clearing houses and many PE-ACHs all over the place, then we continue to modify rules and try and impose those rules outside their networks on banks that aren’t even members.</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> With SEPA, there is another difficulty with relation to e-invoicing because of the delay of the SEPA direct debit, which in turn, relates to the PSD. Given the lack of clarity about the detailed product features, because the discussions are still ongoing, you will see e-invoicing and electronic presentation of bills for payment coming through in a three to four years timeframe, which is, of course, a form of substitute for direct debits. This is, either way, one of the products the European Commission wants the banking industry and other share stakeholders to develop. If that is an attractive payment method on a European scale, it will also be a kind of competitor to the SEPA direct debit system which will take at least another one and a half to two years before it gets off the ground. Thus, there will be competing products, substitutes most likely, in a similar time framework as the direct debit and which will reach the markets by the end of perhaps 2010 or 2011.</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> Why do we think that by doing all of this work around e-invoicing that the adoption will be any greater than it is today in each individual market, which of any markets, is not high at all?</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> No, but it’s not idle, it is starting off now.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> If I’m a corporate, what am I going to see as I go into next year? What should I be doing?</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> Well, if you’re moving to a new ERP system or if you are dissatisfied with the clearing structure or if your organisation is changing, then I think you should have a close look at SEPA and see where you can benefit.</p>


<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> I think the other thing corporates should be doing – and whether that’s now or in a few month’s time – is have a conversation with their bank or banks about a migration path. At some point, they are going to need to try and migrate their payments and direct debits. Which means looking at where the gaps are. So in summary, identify the total impact time involved and implement as appropriate.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Am I’m going to have to migrate because I have to or because there’s a value in migrating?</p>


<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> Well first and foremost, there may well be a value in corporates migrating – particularly on the direct debit side, where we are talking about the potential of setting up collection factories and achieving economies of scale. But secondly, as some institutions do migrate – and especially when we can get the public institutions to migrate as well – volume will move away from the local infrastructure. So sooner or later, you will be encouraged to move whether it’s because the services are better or due to the fact it’s going to be cheaper (as the banks will have a fixed amount of volume from the new infrastructure).</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But this is a bit like fixing a problem that I don’t have!</p>

<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> I am not implying the multinationals are ‘broke’, but they still have to check they are not. They need to make sure they can actually benefit from SEPA. So if it’s taking them eight days to get cash and it can be three, they need to check and analyse what value this can bring.</p>
<p>However, I think it depends on whether you are multinational in the true sense of the word or multi-local (for example, somebody that’s got lots of subsidiaries around Euroland). Too many UK corporates borrow sterling when they’ve got Euro assets not working for them. In Continental Europe, this doesn’t happen so much because they’ve got one currency and they realise that they can do something with it.</p>
<p>It’s up to the banks to try and provide as much information as possible to the clients, and provide them with some sort of working outline that they can work to – and if they’re struggling, they can come back to us and talk again. One size doesn’t fit all. There’s discussion about the potential demise of cash pools, but unfortunately the legal, fiscal, insolvency, and regulatory requirements have not changed. I think now we need to support the corporates in the process, given that we’re starting to understand where we, the banks, are going in the process.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So what can I do from day one?</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> Okay, so let’s get very basic. On the 28<sup>th</sup> of January, corporates and financial institutions will be able to take advantage of the new SEPA credit transfer product across the Eurozone market. SEPA credit transfer will provide a standard file format, rule book and a more flexible XML standard. End-to-end usage of XML will be gradual. The conversion of MT and proprietary formatted files to XML for clients will be in place until complete adherence and adoption takes place. Value added services such as low-cost routing to legacy versus SEPA ACH’s will also be attractive as changes occur in the market.</p>


<p><span>Turner (Fortis):</span> I think in the long-term, SEPA is about the SMEs (Small Medium Enterprises). For example, those businesses who are currently only transacting domestically and who all of a sudden find there is demand from companies in the next country. They will want to start making and receiving payments cross-border. In today’s world, SMEs may find it difficult to get the complex service that some large banks offer. However, in tomorrow’s world, it’s exactly the same payment. In other words, the only payment type will be an SCT (SEPA credit transfer). So SMEs will have to make no changes whatsoever to their system. I think this is what it’s all about fundamentally. It is about creating a landscape that isn’t any different for the consumer, the SME or the corporate.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> I can see all that, but what I’m also hearing is multiple systems still in existence, which means you have a much higher cost base as an industry, whilst you have to charge less because you’ve got a political directive to do that. That will be fundamentally unhealthy and will give the industry a problem.</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> I believe that in the long run, in every banking community, you will see that at one stage or another, the vast majority of the payments will have been migrated. Recently, it has been said that it will take three to five years to complete the migration period. Of course, there will be pressure to get the last users off the old systems, as well as off the old products in most of the countries. Belgium again is very ambitious in that they have already set the end date of 2011. This has just moved somewhat, but there will be discussions as to what the realistic termination date is likely to be for all countries concerned.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> If we’re not going to have completion by 2010, what’s the EU going to say?</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> Civil servants appreciate the fact that you have to migrate within a firm timeframe and it should not take too long because it would otherwise create additional complexity as well as additional costs for all parties concerned. I do not believe that there will be many corporates which will switch immediately from the existing product range they use in the various markets for their various subsidiaries to SEPA. They will require a certain period of time, or it will be on the basis of country by country or subsidiary by subsidiary. It is unlikely that all products or payments will be switched over in one big bang to the new SEPA products. But to add to that, if SEPA does not make sufficient progress, the European Commission will no doubt issue new regulations to ensure a timely completion.</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> We have to almost get beyond SEPA and I’m sort of getting weary of SEPA in a way. This is domestic European collections and there has to be continuous progress. We’re becoming domestic, the euro in terms of country coverage, will grow year over year, and these products must be competitive or they won’t survive. Legislation’s not going to fix that. I think the European Commission will take a look and say ‘what’s lagging?’ ‘Are countries lagging?’ ‘Are there clearing systems that are lagging, is there demand that’s lagging?’ And then, perhaps, surgically address it.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> There seems to be a general agreement around the table that the SEPA products are going to be improved over the course of the next few years and you’re hoping that that will encourage a transition. Now what about transitioning for a corporate, how are you going to offer to help me transition to these new instruments?</p>

<p><span>Reilly (Deutsche Bank):</span> Most banks will say that they will offer to help. You’d be crazy not to, but what the corporates really need to do is test their banks’ knowledge and readiness and dig into the detail. Can the bank help you to do a gap analysis over what instruments you can use today versus what can you use in SEPA? If you send an IDOC file, can the bank convert it to XML for you, or what about if you send it as a CSV file? The ability of the bank to provide specific answers and demonstrate readiness is key.</p>
<p>The IBAN and BIC (Bank Identifier Code) question is a lot trickier because you can go one way, but not the other. So you can take an IBAN and you can work out what a local account number is, but it’s very dangerous to do it the other way. That will work for some countries, but not for others. So then you may be into acceptable business risk with your customer, but I wouldn’t recommend a creation of an IBAN from other details because you can not reliably get to an IBAN in all instances and establish the right routing. So again it’s really about digging into the detail, going along to your bank and saying ‘Well what are you going to do to help me to migrate, what are the services that you offer?’</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> We launched value added services this year that basically took IBANs and re-routed them back to BBANs. There are still many of the legacy ACH’s in the Euro zone that don’t take IBAN.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And there is no fix for creating IBANs from BBANs – domestic account numbers?</p>


<p><span>Reilly (Deutsche Bank):</span> SWIFT were talking about creating a database which would specify all the exceptions, because if you know the exceptions and you know what the rule is, you’re okay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corporates really need to… test their banks’ knowledge and readiness and dig into the detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> Well, this directory under development will still be limited to confirm valid IBANs and their corresponding BICs. The EPC is already aware of issues caused by inappropriate derived IBANs and I think their approach is really right to support straight through processing needs: A fully automated process to request and store IBAN from the account holding bank rather than calculating them.</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> And the other thing apart from IBAN and BBANs that we haven’t discussed of course is that you will have to adapt your systems for better reconciliation because the information provided by the banks, especially for the customers using file transfer in which they have a full STP. The process of reconciling the account data and the transaction data into their systems will change as well.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Please can we turn to cards? What is the message to the corporate in this area?</p>


<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> The users of pan-European domestic debit products will be able to use their payment cards anywhere, in any shop, and in any restaurant, and every outlet you can think of across Europe. I think that this is the real benefit for a lot of corporates. Firstly, they can standardise the products from a retail perspective. Secondly, it is a way to eliminate the use of cash in various countries, especially since it is still the major cost factor in the payments industry in all the countries involved: the heavy users of cash.</p>

<p><span>Wenk (Commerzbank):</span> One thing that I would like to say, having discussed a lot of uncertainties and difficulties, is that despite the growing pains there are a significant number of customers who will really benefit from day one of using SEPA. I have met with customers who are waiting to kick off with the system because they have numerous bank accounts and numerous formats and who are convinced that they can benefit greatly from this standardisation. In spite of the many difficulties, we will need to improve the products and processes so as to make them acceptable to the vast majority of users. It needs to be stressed that SEPA will benefit numerous corporates, and I believe that we need to get this message across.</p>


<p><span>Koenigsberg (JPMorgan):</span> From an intraregional trade perspective, these standards will create a new level of efficiency. SEPA removes country based barriers to create a more seamless experience to enhance trade and convenience. The changes also create a global effect reaching beyond the eurozone, inviting more business to be based in a efficient environment.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Thank you everyone.</p>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> What do you think will be out there for corporate customers at the beginning of 2008?</p>


<p><span>Frank Taal (ING):</span> There will definitely be something because everyone is working very hard to get new payment systems to the market. But, it will be immature because the banks have developed the existing systems and products over the past 30 or 40 years. The big banks will be ready but I am less certain about some of the smaller players. To change to a totally new system in one or two years is very ambitious.</p>
<p>There will be systems and there will be products but what the market take-up will be at that time is difficult to predict. There will be early adopters perhaps some governments and governmental bodies who will take the lead. I hope they will do, actually, because they should and gradually we will build and improve and enhance and try to get more customers and users on board. I think that will be the process.</p>


<p><span>Geoffroy de Schrevel (SWIFT):</span> The first thing to say about 2008 is that there are going to be a large number of banks capable of issuing credit transfers and direct debits within the SEPA scheme. That is less than 65 weeks from now, so it is very short. The European Payment Council (EPC) has come up with the rulebooks and, although one might disagree about the extent and the beauty of these, and the completeness of those rulebooks, at least they are there. To put 70 banks around a table in Europe and get them to agree on something that will transform the industry and actually deliver product rulebooks is a major achievement.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges everyone has is how long the coexistence of the current systems of the legacy products and the new SEPA products will last because coexistence is going to be expensive for everybody. The shorter this transition period the better, but the number of legacy systems to be adapted at banks and market infrastructure, at corporates, at government, institutions etc, etc, is huge. I think that one of the biggest question marks is how long will this transition period last and how much is it going to cost the community at large?</p>


<p><span>Gianfranco Tabasso (EACT):</span> I agree, and maybe I should say something from the corporate side. The basic question is will this be a big SEPA or a small SEPA? Will corporates move to SEPA systems for their domestic business or will they simply look at SEPA in 2008 as the products to be used for cross-border payments?</p>
<p>There are discussions going on between the EACT and the EPC about what can be added to the core schemes to make them more attractive but whenever we say we want something else the famous words ‘AOS’ – additional optional services – comes out. They say “oh don’t worry it will be there, the banks will be offering it.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left"">

</figure>
<p>It will not be in the basic scheme but banks would be offering it as AOS”. It used to be described as ‘value added services’ but for some reason it has been changed to ‘additional optional services’ so as to make it clear you have to pay for this option if you want it.</p>
<p>So this leads to another big question which is about pricing. Corporates will not expect to pay more for the same or similar services simply because we move from an old different or legacy standard to an XML system. They will expect to pay more if they get something more in terms of service, which potentially XML and the new network TCP-IP will give compared to the current situation, but maybe not immediately.</p>

<p><span>Philippe Lambrecht (KBC):</span> We are likely see a slow adoption in 2008 because I think that the common belief now is that the SEPA products described in the rulebooks are more of the lowest common denominator than best of breed systems. For a lot of corporates, adopting SEPA instruments as they are now, and will be in 2008, would mean a step backwards for the quality of information that is provided.</p>
<p>Then you go to the big discussion, what are the additional optional services? Is that a competitive space or is that a co-operative space for the banks?</p>
<p>The fact that you have standards that allow much more room to put commercial data is not going to help if every bank is doing it differently. There is not a single bank in the world that is covering all their customers payments end to end (from ordering party to beneficiary) and not all of the banks will be supporting all of the additional optional services that will be offered by some of the regional, global and smaller players.</p>
<p>The big issue is what will happen on the infrastructure side. Once we start embarking on necessitating additional optional services to make reconciliation possible, in replacement of data components in national systems that are well embedded, we will have made it less attractive for the corporate to switch to the new SEPA infrastructure. This will slow down the adoption by corporates of SEPA solutions.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> It doesn’t sound very attractive does it?</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> To get this thing running we should focus on corporates and institutions who can benefit from a European SEPA solution. Companies selling cross-border today.</p>


<p><span>Maurice Cleaves (JPMorgan):</span> The real interesting thing here is on the direct debit side, because if you look on the payments (credits) side, I just see the payments side a much simpler process to get to 2008 and much easier to get to the end point. But if today you want to make a direct debit to Germany from Belgium you have got all sorts of complexities of systems and interfaces. It’s not just the scheme, it is also legal and regulatory barriers so the hurdles we have to get across for 2008 are considerable. So a new solution to this would be good.</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> There are still quite a number of hurdles in the direct debits solution that have to be addressed. When we talk to some big direct debit issuers in Belgium they are a bit uncomfortable with the fact that a move to the SEPA scheme, as defined, will mean a move from a very cheap, next-day value system with excellent reconciliation and only four days for complaints to a system where it is going to be more expensive and it will take longer to get the funds and you have up to six weeks to ask for your money back. Plus mandate handling which is another big issue.</p>


<p><span>Tabasso (EACT):</span> Yes, I agree that the problem is the direct debit rulebook being so different to every other scheme and most national schemes offering better conditions and better terms. Will the large billers adopt it domestically? Or, as long as the national schemes are in place, will they stick to the domestic schemes until they see that the EPC scheme becomes more similar to what they are using today?</p>
<p>There is no room for discussion today. The rulebooks are frozen and I understand that if you want to get systems in place in 2008 you cannot keep changing the formats. But I think that work should go on continually so that a number of features which are not currently in the basic scheme will be adopted as standard and not as optional additional services.</p>
<p>SEPA really only covers the inter-bank space and the use of ISO 20022 standards are being recommended for the corporate payment initiation and the bank reporting. We have to see if the banks will follow this recommendation and change what they have. Today, every bank has its own payment standards and there are big differences from bank to bank, country to country. Let’s not forget that for reconciliation and improving our efficiency bank reporting is even more important than payment initiation.</p>
<p>We need the information to come to us in a certain way, in a unique and uniformed way from all the banks in order to do reconciliation. We should also agree that whatever is considered additional optional services should be standardized. We should design standards for the services which are considered optional so the optionality will be whether a bank does or does not do this service not how it does it. We don’t want to end up with 10, 20 or 100 different proprietary systems.</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> The commonality of those additional optional services, or at least the basics that will allow reconciliation, have to be common to all banks.</p>


<p><span>Cleaves (JPMorgan):</span> I think most of the additional optional services should be geared around what other things can be done outside of that particular payment, such as supply chain finance and additional reporting elements. Those kind of things which are really competitive. If you are not able to use the existing payment information to do that then you do need a standard but we all know how some standards are established and we all know how standards evolve. We are in danger of evolving these additional optional services either industry by industry or country by country so that we finish up with multitudes of these additional services.</p>
<p>The XML nature of the payment may assist in this in that the additional optional services can be serviced by a data dictionary type approach. So you could have multiple ways of embedding information within the payment message, which could be preserved as standards for a particular industry, a particular type of activity or a particular country because it is in the data dictionary. As long as you use XML it can be machine readable all the way through.</p>
<p>So we finish up in 2008 with just the basic and then the thrust of the additional optional services will come after that.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Can we focus on direct debits, because what is going to be in place in 2008 is a scheme that is being described as based on the lowest common denominator with lots of features that are not going to be very attractive. So, if I am a corporate, I am just going to stay with what I have got now and not move my domestic business to a SEPA scheme.</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> Although, in the beginning, the product might be perhaps in some areas not completely compatible to the current product, on the other hand there is an upside. There are markets in Europe where you don’t have a sophisticated system at all, where there is no direct debit introduced so far or only in a very immature stage. There will be countries or perhaps industries where SEPA is definitely new and also innovative compared to what they do today.</p>

<p><span>de Schrevel (SWIFT):</span> We should avoid falling into the trap of thinking everything is perfect in Europe right now. There are a number of countries where corporates are pretty happy with the direct debit schemes, but in other countries the banks are starting to say this direct debit scheme is not what we want for the future.</p>
<p>The simple fact that the new SEPA products will be based on open global XML standards is going to give the corporate a tremendous improvement in bargaining power with respect to their banks. They will be much more capable of bargaining with their banks on a number of services. I think that is provided by SEPA.</p>
<p>In terms of standards. On 12<sup>th</sup> July ISO published the ISO global standards for direct debit and credit transfer in the bank to bank and the corporate to bank space. Standards for reporting and cash management will follow later in the year. The Implementation Guideline is also available. So it is there and it is very important that we keep telling the market it is there. Corporates need to know that, software providers need to know that, banks need to know that. We all need to be a bit better at communicating and get ready for testing.</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> I tend to disagree. But I agree with your first point. For some countries there will be huge benefits from switching to SEPA. For others there may be no benefit. But, definitely XML is the future. How long is it going to take before it is going to be adopted in all the systems in the banks? I think we’re talking about a very long period of time.</p>
<p>I sometimes get a bit of the feeling that XML is being hyped like EDIFACT which was going to allow everything and then never got adopted.</p>
<p>Indeed, you can start programming based on the rulebooks but, again, based on the rulebooks as they are now; hence not based on the edition that will be dealing with the bank to corporate space and that is unlikely to cover everything that is required. If I talk to a corporate they are asking me: “What will happen with my structured message as I have it now in Belgium, in the Netherlands; what is going to happen with my Tag86 that I have at this point in time in Germany?” These things are so embedded in their ERP systems that the clear benefit for a corporate to switch and to get away from that to a pan-European standard will have to be proven. They will not just do it because we are creating a new standard. It is our responsibility as an industry to make sure that this happens. But I think in 2008 there is going to be slow adoption.</p>


<p><span>Tabasso (EACT):</span> XML by itself will not sell SEPA. If it comes with a service, with a product – a banking product – which is better than the current ones then, yes, it will be adopted. But this doesn’t seem to the case right now and certainly not in 2008.</p>
<p>There is another problem. Not only the issue of mandates for direct debits and so on but, at the same time, we have to use IBAN and BIC. A major worry of corporates using b2c direct debits is not so much the return rate as the technical rejects due to having the right IBAN. I hope we will eventually not have to specify the BIC. I hope the banks will find a solution to translate the IBAN into a BIC. They are the only ones who can do it. So I don’t think we will put both the IBAN and the BIC but just the IBAN. But to get the right IBAN for all our clients from the banks is going to be quite a job.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So there is going to be slow adoption but, if I understand it correctly, the Commission wants the existing systems to be disbanded by 2010?</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> Nobody in the industry believes that. Even the commission doesn’t believe that is feasible. Initially they said existing national systems should be discontinued by the end of 2010. Now they are saying by the end of 2010 there should be critical mass on the pan-European systems that will allow disbanding of the national systems. I think the banking community has been very straightforward, from the start, that total disbanding by 2010 is not realistic.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But if I’m a major utility using a domestic direct debit system to collect my bills and I’ve got to start getting IBANS from all my customers before moving to a new SEPA system – am I going to do it? It is hard to see how the new systems will ever get critical mass?</p>


<p><span>Cleaves (JPMorgan):</span> There has to be some benefit for the upheaval that corporates will have to go through to make the change and I think the danger is having this interim step of multiple systems interlinking before we get to the ultimate – sometime after 2010. The first phase is making sure that the BICs and IBANs are always there and available.</p>
<p>The second upheaval is just the pain of trying to make some systems interoperable across Europe, because that will be the element where those transactions are passed but then the next phase of that will be to disband some of those systems. So, for the direct debit piece anyway, we’re probably in danger of having two major steps until we get to the ultimate.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And so, just so I understand this from a corporate point of view, as of the beginning of 2008 there will be some systems that can handle pan-European cross-border direct debits. I will have the ability to reach anyone, anywhere?</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> I don’t know whether you will have 100% reachability to every bank at that time.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But that’s what the Commission is asking for?</p>

</figure>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> Yes – even though most banks will be ready it remains to be seen if every bank will be reachable, since there is so much work to be done.</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> If you look at the large banks in most of the countries in Europe they will be there. I think there is no doubt about it. If you talk about savings banks, or if you talk about some niche banks in some countries, they may not be there but their customers may not be overly concerned by the fact that they are not there. They may not even notice it. Most of the banks that corporates are dealing with will be there in January 2008, without a doubt.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So, where does that leave Mr. Corporate as he looks at all this? He knows that the new clearing mechanisms are coming down the road in 2008 but the exact shape of them is not certain. Which banks will belong to which system is not certain. And, he is finding it difficult seeing the big gains that will encourage him to be thinking, I’ve got to be there, I’ve got to move all my payments onto these new SEPA systems.</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> I think basically the corporate is going to look at: “What is my investment cycle? Do I need to change my systems now? If I don’t have to invest now, maybe I’ll just keep on doing what I have been doing if it is working fine. If I am dissatisfied with some pieces, I will look at it. Can I change it? And if I change it, do I have to do it through a SEPA-compliant instrument, because it is adding value or do I do something else?”</p>
<p>“If I want to start up a shared service centre that I haven’t got yet, what is the benefit of adopting SEPA’s schemes as compared to having connectivity with 25 different national standards?” This is the type of thinking that you will see.</p>
<p>For the corporates, I think it is essential to know what is happening in the payments industry and to try and understand what the ultimate objectives are. But, first and foremost, to try to define what is in there for me now?</p>


<p><span>Cleaves (JPMorgan):</span> The other thing that the corporate should be well aware of, because banks should have told them, is that you’ve got to get your databases up-to-date with the BIC and IBAN. And, of course, as Gianfranco already said, only 2-3% of corporate payments are cross-border.</p>
<p>So, what is the advice to a corporate who once in a blue moon makes a cross-border payment, where none of the national clearing systems are going to a system of using BIC and IBAN? Is he going to go out to all his counterparts and say can you make sure I’ve got your BIC and IBAN information? Or is he just going to carry on doing what he does today?</p>
<p>I think the ‘carry on doing what you do today’ is a little bit dangerous. Because as the national schemes migrate across, the unknown is how quickly will they migrate just to a single system or to a separate system which is all SEPA-compliant and therefore BIC and IBAN standard? So the first thing they must do, is to make that decision to go to BIC and IBAN standard and then start collecting BIC and IBAN numbers and start using them in their regular activity.</p>
<p>I think the other area corporates should get involved in is being involved in the standards setting and in the dialog as what are the services that they really require because the messages that come back from the corporate community are different and they are also fragmented.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What about cards? We have talked a lot about direct debits but we have not thought much about cards. Obviously for some corporates that’s quite a big issue and it is also seen as the payment method that will replace cash over time.</p>


<p><span>de Schrevel (SWIFT):</span> In the past, if you had a card carrying a certain brand the transaction had to be processed by the dedicated specific network. A cross-border transaction, for instance, a cross-border MasterCard transaction always had to go through the MasterCard network, authorisation, and inter-bank clearing. This cannot be the case anymore. So what we are going to see is that I can send that transaction to any network, they will be ready to process it. And so you really have flexibility in that sense of looking at the network or the process that can give you the best choice.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So I would split my transactions out and send via any network I choose direct to Visa or MasterCard and cut out the ‘merchant acquiring service’ or whatever you call the service, the intermediatory service that I used to use?</p>


<p><span>de Schrevel (SWIFT):</span> That is a possibility. The processing for MasterCard and Visa is really coming into the competitive space. They can now compete with any local processor owned by their own members.</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> There will be a tendency that domestic systems, currently in the various markets, will be replaced by two/three major global brands. This is also a concern of the European Commission. But I’m afraid that the United States will end up ruling Europe if we can’t get this to work. Looking at some of the comments of the bankers giving a report on the EPC’s work, they felt it was impossible to build a European scheme. The United States might therefore end up ruling Europe if we can’t get this to work.</p>


<p><span>Tabasso (EACT):</span> What about the telecom’s companies? Could they enter into this arena in the retail end of the payment market unless legislation forbids them from doing this? The new legislation seems to allow new players to come in.</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> Legislation will not forbid them to do so. Legislation is only going to tell them that, as a payments service operator, they’ll have to comply with all the regulatory and legislation bits and pieces that banks have to comply with. I think that most of them at the moment realise what is the cost of doing that. It’s so prohibitive that they don’t want to be actively involved in the payments business.</p>


<p><span>Cleaves (JPMorgan):</span> The other thing is the high cost of fixed infrastructure that you’d have to put together to be able really to operate those telephone schemes as a payment infrastructure versus the size of the transaction that’s going to go through and how much fee you could charge. You’d have to get it to SMS type proportions to make it valuable.</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> There is also the same problem as with the debits cards, the marketing costs to convince the broad audience that it is reliable, that it is user friendly. It is not only the actual systems hardware and software costs but especially the branding and everything that goes into making it a generally accepted system.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> How will everything we have been talking about impact the structure of the industry. I’m hearing about the need for investment and the Commission is insisting on domestic level pricing for cross-border payments. This must have an impact on who survives? Could you share your views as to the shape of the banking industry going forward?</p>


<p><span>Tabasso (EACT):</span> Fewer banks.</p>

<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> I think we will see a huge consolidation. Of course over the past couple of decades if you look to the Dutch market there have been lots of mergers. Let’s say 90% of the market share is with three banks. You will see the same cross-border.</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> I think we will see the emergence of a number of large payments processors in Europe, that is one of the major changes that I see in the industry, not necessarily a large reduction in the number of commercial banks.</p>


<p><span>Tabasso (EACT):</span> Well, the name of the game is specialisation. You have to concentrate by specialty and one wonders how far along the road of outsourcing a bank can go. At the end they only retain their name and their sales people. Everything else has been outsourced!</p>


<p><span>de Schrevel (SWIFT):</span> Processing payments will be transformed. One can hardly see how SEPA will deliver its ambitious benefits in terms of cost reduction and higher efficiency if payments are being transported and processed tomorrow in essentially the same way as yesterday.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What are your closing recommendations to somebody who has been reading this?</p>


<p><span>Lambrecht (KBC):</span> I’d want my customers to have a very watchful eye about what is happening in the market and try to see where the value is for them in the changes that we are facing. I believe that increasingly the quality of the services is going to be the major key buying factor for a corporate deciding what bank they go to because the competition will be a lot more open. The decision will be less dependent on the size of the bank and where the branch is located as we gradually move to a more pan-European landscape.</p>


<p><span>Cleaves (JPMorgan):</span> I would say that there may be some scepticism as to whether SEPA will actually deliver any benefit. I think SEPA is an evolution not a revolution. What we have currently got as what might be called SEPA practices is only the first stage to what turns out to be the future. The banking industry has got a lot of work to do and there is a lot of money to be spent but hopefully a single euro payments area will be of major benefit to corporates in the long-term. It has started, it is moving. Whether it is moving fast enough is open to debate but it is moving and the benefits will come.</p>


<p><span>Taal (ING):</span> I would like to add to that that I think it takes two to tango. We will see the first products coming, entering the markets in 2008 but to make them, to finalise them, we need a very good co-operation with the corporates. If we are to really make it fly. There will be ‘quick’ wins. There will be early adopters. There will be situations in 2008 in which you have real benefit in switching to SEPA products but, making it a real transition that it is beneficial to all parties involved will imply that banks and corporates cooperate to make that happen.</p>


<p><span>Tabasso (EACT):</span> I couldn’t have said it better myself. I think that we have to give corporates the impression that SEPA is not just a one step adventure. It will be going on after 2008 and after 2010. Maybe taking a bit longer than originally planned in the original EPC plan but the direction is that we are moving on and co-operation is the name of the game so we don’t waste time, money and investments. We must keep an eye and try to define what should be within the standards and what should be left to non standard open competition.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Thank you.</p>

Optimising Centralisation of Cash Management,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>Every company wants to control its cash.  But how?  Is it simply a matter of centralising control of the bank accounts?  If you listen to the experiences of those companies that have undertaken projects to centralise cash management, they will tell you it is not simple.  Gaining control of the bank accounts and getting control of the balances is only one part of the story.  So what else needs to be considered?  In this business briefing we look at cash management in an international context and examine the trade-off between central and local cash management for corporates.  In the wake of corporate governance legislation, demonstrating control may be an imperative in any company but how can this be achieved centrally without increased costs and inefficiencies?</i></p>
<h3 id=""central-vs-local-cash-management"">Central vs. local cash management</h3>
<p>The objective of centralising cash management is always to make better use of the company’s liquidity. It makes no sense to have cash balances sitting on a subsidiary’s bank account if the cash can be used more effectively elsewhere in the group – either reducing the need for borrowings or being invested more effectively. And if the company is cash poor with subsidiaries that need funding, this may also be better centralised with all the economies of scale that will result. Put another way, good cash management is also part of good working capital management.</p>
<p>However, achieving control by centralising cash management is not easy. Physical movement of cash from one company to another creates inter-company loans that can give rise to corporation tax, withholding tax and many other legal and regulatory issues – such as thin capitalisation, VAT and transfer pricing considerations. Notional pooling may be no easier.</p>
<p>Then there are practical issues as to what else should be centralised as a company centralises cash management. What happens to accounts receivable and creditor control; supplier relationships and accounts payable? These functions may be left at local level, but they still create entries on the bank accounts and have an effect on the cash flows.</p>
<p>Some companies choose to centralise these functions into shared service centres, but there is still a need for information and input at the local level. Payment creation will always involve input from the local unit. Has the supply been received as ordered? Is it satisfactory? Is the invoice correct?</p>
<p>Often it is useful to start with an introducing netting to set-off receivables and liabilities. This procedure results in a reduction of payment creation.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of the operating unit still having an incentive to generate cash when it no longer has the cash and ‘looses’ control to the centre. This can be addressed relatively easily if financial targets and incentives are aligned, but it is still an issue.</p>
<p>At the extreme, centralisation of cash management means that all control over an operating unit’s cash passes to the centre. This includes control of all collections and payments/disbursements. However, few companies achieve this. In practice, partial centralisation is often the pragmatic solution – which facilitates some of the benefits of centralisation without many of the difficulties. The degree of this centralisation will depend on the structure and the culture of the company.</p>
<h4 id=""relevant-factors-for-deciding-a-companys-appropriate-degree-of-centralisation"">Relevant factors for deciding a company’s appropriate degree of centralisation</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Corporate culture</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How is the company structured?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the operating units autonomous or is there already a large degree of central control?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are they all in the same business?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they have similar needs and characteristics?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Resources available</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How is cash managed today?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What systems are available to assist in the process of centralising cash management?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do the company’s bankers offer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the necessary skills and resources available centrally?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Business requirements</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What amount of cash is needed and where?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where are surpluses and shortfalls?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are they permanent or seasonal?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Size of cash flows</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the average balances on subsidiaries accounts?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""different-forms-of-organisation-for-cash-management"">Different forms of organisation for cash management</h4>
<p>Then a decision can be made on what degree of centralisation is appropriate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Decentralised cash management</h5>
<p>A few companies find that the costs of centralising are simply too great or the gains too small. They prefer to remove surpluses from operating units periodically and may organise some central funding but day-to-day cash management is left to the operating units. Most corporates, which have only recently become international, also fall into this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Regional cash management</h5>
<p>Most companies operating in multiple locations move quite quickly to some form of regional cash management, responsible for treasury activities in a defined set of countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Global cash management</h5>
<p>The largest companies are moving or have already achieved a global cash management capability.</p>
<p>Often companies would like to establish a cash management solution with a single bank but, in practice, it may be necessary to maintain one or two local banks for country specific needs. However, with the use technology, visibility across global and local cash flows can be achieved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""outsourcing-the-next-step"">Outsourcing – the next step?</h3>
<p>Outsourcing of cash management has fallen out of fashion but is far from dead.</p>
<p>The high costs of implementing a treasury management system or having a full in-house treasury team mean that some corporations will look to outsource the basic functionality. Others see it as a means to meet corporate compliance requirements.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class=""management-summary"">ERCO is a leading manufacturer of lighting equipment, including indoor and outdoor luminaires, as well as lighting control systems. The company is the global market leader in museum lighting. Its lighting technology is used in the world’s most famous museums – such as the Louvre in Paris or the Guggenheim in Bilbao. The company has 1,000 employees, most of whom are based in the headquarters in Lüdenscheid, Germany, working in the fields of R&amp;D, production, sales and administration. In addition, ERCO has wholly-owned subsidiaries in all major markets globally, charged with sales and the distribution of the group’s products. The family-owned business generates a consolidated turnover of €140m.</p>
<p>ERCO runs a centralised treasury at the group’s German headquarters, but traditionally much of the company’s finances were managed in a decentralised structure. This meant that subsidiaries worldwide not only managed their cash, but were also exposed to currency exchange rate risks. The subsidiaries were billed by the group in euros, but received most of their sales income in local currency. Intragroup payments were effected via banks using regular cross-border credit transfers. This incurred high charges and the bank float reduced liquidity.</p>
<p>The company wanted to achieve a more efficient and centralised financial management structure by implementing a cross-border cash pool. Urs Müller-Ortolf, Deputy Head of Finance, explains the different steps the company had to take: “At first we started with the development of an info-pool. In order to get a consolidated view of our cash, we collected the bank statements of the subsidiaries using Commerzbank’s COTEL program. This information was then processed further in our ERP system.”</p>
<p>In a second step, ERCO implemented a cross-border cash pool, which included zero balancing for all subsidiaries banking with Commerzbank. Based on historic cash flows, Müller-Ortolf agreed specific cash levels with the other subsidiaries that were using third party banks and Commerzbank connected the accounts in a target balancing pool.</p>
<p>“This works very well and Commerzbank is also willing to work with other banks. We have spoken to competitor banks that would only set up cash pools using their own accounts, but we could not force our daughter companies in all these countries to change their bank relationships.”</p>
<p>According to Müller-Ortolf, the main obstacle to the implementation of the cash and information pools was to convince the management in the participating countries to give up some of their responsibilities. However, the new cash management structure offered a number of benefits for ERCO on the group level, as well as for the subsidiaries.</p>
<p>“Due to the automation and improvement of processes, our subsidiaries came to realise that they would not miss any cash discount deadlines and would always have enough cash to meet their liabilities. In addition, the savings in terms of bank interest and charges are significant. It is important to know that now, due to the implementation of the cash pool, we are no longer in need of any bank loans. The group is self-sufficient as far as its funding is concerned and this of course saves a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Subsidiaries in need of funding are now funded via the cash pool. Payments within the group are netted and the group bills its subsidiaries in their local currencies. As a result, the currency exchange risk is transferred to the mother company, which is in a better position to manage this exposure. Overall, the group has more control over its finances worldwide and its liquidity situation has improved significantly.</p>
<p>While the implementation of the information and cash pools was decided from the outset, Müller-Ortolf admits that initially he was not entirely certain how far the centralisation would go. “We started with a euro cash pool to exclude any currency issues and to learn how the system works, but when everything went fine, we included other currencies.</p>
<p>“However, we did not take away the subsidiaries’ ability to make and receive payments locally. This means that payments necessary to run the business in the different countries – such as salaries, payments to suppliers and payments from customers – are still effected locally. This is necessary because (for example) Spanish customers do not want to make payments to Germany. They would like to make the payments in Spain, where they bought the product from what they believe is a Spanish company. In my opinion this is where centralisation has to end. You should not interfere too much with the business locally.”</p>

<p>Each company must maximise the advantages but pay attention to the possible costs and risks that arise.</p>
<h4 id=""potential-benefits"">Potential benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Better overview and optimised use of the company’s cash. Funds deposited to the pool by companies in a cash surplus position will be used to fund companies in a cash deficit position before drawing against external lines of credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency, visibility and control, less opportunity for fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal economies of scale as control is centralised and automated wherever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External economies of scale in banking charges and borrowing costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased income from higher investment income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better control of cash flow as well as subsidiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardised pricing, terms, and conditions for banking services. Bank relationships managed centrally will result in more consistent pricing across the group. The company will be in a position to offer a significantly larger portion of business to its preferred banking partners and thereby gaining volume discounts and other cost savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralised administration of all bank records and documentation permitting instant and efficient access to information without having to request and consolidate data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forecasting can be improved if actively managed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction of the number of bank relationships and bank accounts.</p>

<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Many companies need to manage cash both centrally and locally, which provides banks with some interesting opportunities. The most important point in optimising centralisation of cash management is to convince the subsidiaries of the advantages and get them involved in the process. Banks can help companies to achieve this goal by designing systems to meet the needs of the local operating units while providing the centre with visibility over all the cash, allowing it to exercise better control.</p>
<p>Every company has to consider what degree of centralisation is appropriate in order to benefit from controlling its cash more effectively.</p>
