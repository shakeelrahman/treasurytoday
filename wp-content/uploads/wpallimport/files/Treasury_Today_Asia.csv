<p>The latest issue of Treasury Today Asia comes in the wake of some large regional events, including the recent and very distressing assassination of former President Abe in Japan. The ripples of this will be felt in the country for some time to come. We explore Japan in this edition’s Regional Focus piece, and the complex and at times challenging relationship that exists between Japan and South Korea when it comes to trade and to collaboration in general.</p>
<p>Our Adam Smith Awards Asia 2022 are open for nominations and we would like to invite all our corporate readers to look at this year’s new and existing categories and see whether you might submit to be part of best practice in the industry. We will be back with a physical evening celebration in Singapore this November and look forward to greeting all this year’s winners as we return to our regional calendar highlight.</p>
<p>We explore the career journeys and mindsets of two fantastic corporate professionals within our Corporate View and dedicated Women in Treasury This Much I Know feature. First up is James Zhixin Zhang, Head of Treasury &amp; Corporate Finance, Asia Pacific &amp; China at Siemens Energy and then Cecelia Li, Head of Global Treasury at BeiGene shares her story.</p>
<p>We explore sustainable treasury elsewhere in a feature which addresses natural capital and our Insight and Analysis feature looks at China’s ever evolving regulatory landscape, taking into account the latest developments. All this alongside our Question Answered feature addressing issues of talent competition, a challenge facing all industries at the moment as the job market becomes heavily in favour of employees across the board.</p>
<p>As we look forward to hosting our APAC community at our upcoming Women in Treasury APAC Forum and Adam Smith Awards Asia 2022 celebration dinner, we are excited to celebrate and share with our corporate community in Asia Pacific and welcome your feedback, thoughts and concerns as we move into a new era for us all, for your companies and for the business world at large.</p>
<p>Until we meet again, we hope you enjoy this latest issue.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""a-season-of-reflection"">A season of reflection</h3>
<p>As we reach our third issue of 2022 we are also approaching our Adam Smith Awards Asia season, with nominations opening in June. Recent years have seen treasurers across Asia Pacific tested and many of you triumphing with innovative and collaborative solutions to the problems of our time. We would like to invite you to nominate yourselves and your teams for our best practice in corporate finance Adam Smith Awards Asia, the industry benchmark for excellence.</p>
<p>In this edition we explore China’s lending practices as lending to the Belt and Road Initiative slows and conversely Chinese lending is purportedly far higher than previously estimated. What does this mean for future relationships and how has this developed? In a separate China focus we also take a look at China’s crackdown on companies fundraising via IPOs. Given this restriction, what are the other options?</p>
<p>We focus on money market funds, the trajectory of which has been complex. As they are put under a microscope again from global regulators what does the future hold in store for these funds and what alternatives should treasurers be cognisant of?</p>
<p>The payments space is explored, with ISO 20022 put under the microscope as we assess how treasuries can get prepared. We also look at the practice of treasury integration following merger or acquisition in our treasury practice feature and assess the latest technological tools in modern treasury and their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Finally we explore the circular economy and its link with international trade as sustainable practice and trade co-exist. This development has the potential to transform the manufacturing process and we take a look at which treasury teams are getting involved.</p>
<p>As ever we are excited to bring you the latest industry developments and look forward to hearing more about your new challenges and successes as the season continues.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""springing-into-step"">Springing into step</h3>
<p>As we bring you our March/April edition of the magazine we explore the essential issues for the APAC treasurer against a backdrop of global disruption and unsettling political developments.</p>
<p>In times of challenge and uncertainty it is never more important to come together as a community to share best practice and to learn from one another. So, we are delighted to bring you our features for this edition as well as updates on our programme of activities for 2022. The Adam Smith Awards Asia 2022 will open for nominations on June 6th and we are planning a physical/virtual hybrid celebration to take place at the end of the year in Singapore. We are also preparing for a physical return for our Women in Treasury APAC Forum and associated activities at the end of the year, as well as continuing to deliver hybrid/virtual events to ensure wherever our community members are located that they can access our resources.</p>
<p>There is no one size fits all approach for the region and we explore the specificities of an exciting country with bold plans, which is Japan. Long known as being very paper based, with practices like the hanko ‘chop’ or seal, the country has been forced to digitise by the ongoing pandemic and this has brought unforeseen changes and altered the future vision of the island country. We look at the rise of digital currencies, a trend in all industries and a topic of conversation in many restaurants, cafes and bars across the world, what do the peaks and troughs associated with these new types of currencies mean for corporate treasurers and how can they fit into your plans?</p>
<p>In recent years, Singapore has become synonymous with innovation and is pioneering innovative approaches to, well, just about most things. What does this mean for treasury based there, as the drive for collaboration and new ideas extends to all things financial and technological as well as sustainability and more? Elsewhere in this issue, alongside our Corporate View and This Much I Know features, we assess global trends including funding and investing and take a deep dive into sustainable treasury, exploring the role that treasurers play in the variety of activities associated with corporations’ efforts in sustainability.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this edition and, as ever, we exist to serve our readership and our corporate community. Therefore, if you have any feedback, ideas or topics you would like to see us explore, then please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""welcoming-in-the-year-of-the-tiger"">Welcoming in the Year of the Tiger</h3>
<p>Welcome to the first issue of Treasury Today Asia this year. In this January/February edition we celebrate the new year and welcome in the Year of the Tiger. Optimism may be in short supply following the last two years and in the wake of new travel restrictions across the APAC region. However, there are certainly welcome signs that the worst of the pandemic may be behind us and opportunities for corporates across the region.</p>
<p>We will continue to celebrate the achievements of our phenomenal Adam Smith Awards Asia 2021 winners who triumphed against the backdrop of the most competitive year of our awards programme to date. Their stories will be shared throughout 2022 in our podcast series and case studies, delving deeper into their winning solutions.</p>
<p>In this edition we take a look at China’s energy crisis as China rations power amid dwindling supplies owing to the rising price of imported coal. We explore the root causes of the crisis, how long is it going to last and what it means for companies manufacturing in the region. Supply chains have been in frequent conversation in recent times, we assess the topic from the angle of sustainable supply chain solutions and look at how treasury is integrating ESG into corporate supply chains.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we take a look at investing and focus on digital assets. Beyond their mainstream fame, we explore what they are and what their role within a corporate investment strategy is, as well as a deep dive into Risk Management in China and a Treasury Talent feature which explores the latest in recruitment trends in the industry.</p>
<p>We wish you a prosperous Year of the Tiger and look forward to collaborating in 2022.</p>

<h3 id=""immense-strength-and-resilience"">Immense strength and resilience</h3>
<p>This, our November-December issue, comes to you hot off the heels of our 2021 Adam Smith Awards Asia live winners’ announcement. The spirit of this year’s animal, the ox, is seen in the record-breaking number of outstanding submissions, demonstrating immense strength and resilience amidst our challenging times.</p>
<p>We are proud that whilst a lot has changed around us, some things stay true, in particular our community’s commitment to each other and to celebrating achievement. Collaboration and commitment typify the spirit of the Adam Smith Awards Asia and the regional corporate finance community in general. This now kicks off our official awards season and we can’t wait to share this year’s fantastic winner stories with you all.</p>
<p>This is our last edition of 2021 and within it we explore the key trends of the moment, looking at the digital journeys of corporations, the evolving fintech landscape as well as digital currencies, which will be a huge focus for us heading into 2022. Beyond that we explore the soft skills of modern treasury leaders, including empathy in action within our regular Treasury Talent feature. Our Question Answered feature looks at the COP26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, cutting through the mass of coverage to answer corporate critical focus. We also take a look at New Zealand in a country focus for corporate finance professionals.</p>

<h3 id=""mid-autumn-festival-and-an-era-of-common-prosperity"">Mid-autumn festival and an era of common prosperity</h3>
<p>In this edition we are happy to be addressing our APAC community at a time when the end of travel limitations may be approaching. More and more of us are now fully vaccinated and Europe and the US are soon to end the majority of restrictions.</p>
<p>However, there is still much turbulence in the Asia Pacific region and we know that for many 2021 has presented numerous challenges so far.</p>
<p>It was our pleasure this summer to host our virtual Women in Treasury APAC Forum and to have a record breaking number of submissions in the 2021 Adam Smith Awards Asia. Please watch this space, as we will announce the winners at our live announcement on October 14<sup>th</sup> 2021.</p>
<p>Our APAC community has stayed connected and communicative during the pandemic and we are grateful for your support, not just of us as your trusted content source, but of each other. We look forward to hosting physical as well as virtual events with you in 2022 and to celebrating your various successes throughout the remainder of this year.</p>
<p>In this edition of Treasury Today Asia we are delighted to bring you a varied selection of articles and insights which we hope you enjoy.</p>
<p>Until we meet next, happy mid-autumn festival to our audience across Asia Pacific, and we welcome seeing what China’s ‘common prosperity’ approach will mean for the country and the region.</p>

<h3 id=""trade-risk-regulation-and-much-more"">Trade, risk, regulation and much more</h3>
<p>As we publish our July/August edition, we are closing the door on the first half of 2021. In this issue we look at a breadth of topics, from a feature on plugging the trade finance gap, which explores the latest in trade finance from across Asia Pacific to the latest in risk and regulation.</p>
<p>Elsewhere we continue with our acclaimed series of profiles of senior women from across the industry. July/August’s This Much I Know feature looks at Louise Watts who is a leadership coach and future of work expert jointly running her own business with Karen Thomas from Sydney, Australia. We also catch up with another Sydney based Australian business leader, Jonathon Hirst, Corporate Treasurer of SunRice, who is the subject of this issue’s Corporate View.</p>
<p>Our Adam Smith Awards Asia are open for nominations as of June of this year and we welcome submissions from across the Asia-Pacific region that demonstrate commitment to original ideas and unique collaborations. Our nomination forms are online along with a list of all this year’s categories which include some which are new for 2021! Nominations will close in September and we look forward to seeing many engaging submissions from across different industries, locations and company sizes.</p>
<p>We look at the impact of new US corporate tax laws and how this impacts corporates operating across APAC. We also assess the risk management landscape and latest developments in the region as well as a deep dive on regulation.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the latest issue, stay safe amidst the ongoing pandemic and invite you to please consider nominating yourself in the Adam Smith Awards Asia.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""cautious-optimism"">Cautious optimism</h3>
<p>Recent anti-Asian racist attacks in America have renewed focus upon xenophobia towards Asian people in the US and the Western world. We want to make sure that we support our readers who may be feeling anxious about this worrying trend. Calls for racial equity for black people in America have been supported the world over and likewise protections for Asian people facing rising xenophobia and terrifying attacks must be extended everywhere. Although when walking on the streets of Singapore and Hong Kong it is easy to feel inured from such actions, particularly during a pandemic where business travel is at a minimum, we are all so globally exposed and globally connected that this trend must concern us all. We will be addressing this issue throughout the year and in particular will discuss at our upcoming Women in Treasury APAC Forum taking place in June, to which we invite all of our Asian treasury community to attend.</p>
<p>Elsewhere spring 2021 is tentatively ushering in an air of new optimism alongside blossoms blooming in some parts of the world and plans for the end of the pandemic. We are busy preparing for the first of our digital events and look forward to 2022 and the start of new physical events.</p>
<p>In this issue we take a look at Singapore and its approach to sustainability. This comes at the same time as we close our 2021 Global Sustainability Study and we look forward to analysing, assessing and sharing the results of our findings this year. The pandemic has only served to highlight the problems caused by a lack of sustainability and we hope to emerge from 2021 with companies across the board in a far advanced position on such issues when compared to their positioning at the start of 2020.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing these articles with you and to hearing from you at our digital events throughout this quarter. If you have any concerns or suggestions please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>

<h3 id=""preparing-for-spring"">Preparing for spring</h3>
<p>Welcome to the March/April edition of Treasury Today Asia. With the Year of the Ox now in full swing, we are all looking forward to the end of the pandemic and to resuming our community events in person in Asia.</p>
<p>We are preparing for our upcoming Women in Treasury Asia Forum which will take place this June digitally and we look forward to keeping our community in APAC connected and further advancing the dialogue around inclusion in the industry. We mark this month’s International Women’s Day by addressing the heritage and symbolism of this day.</p>
<p>This quarter we will also be sharing our coverage of our Adam Smith Awards Asia 2020 winners in our case studies and dedicated podcast series. Amidst the most challenging time for all of our community, both professionally and personally, the level of achievement was totally remarkable amongst the winners. We are delighted to be able to delve into their stories over the course of the series.</p>
<p>In this issue we address treasury challenges in a diverse regulatory environment. With regulations that change from country to country, from region to region and from time to time, we assess how to balance this hard to navigate space with the day to day demands of your corporate job. We assess how to find some certainty whilst spinning plates.</p>
<p>We also take a look at Hong Kong in a feature assessing what’s next for the city state. Very few parts of the world have experienced as tumultuous a recent history as Hong Kong. As the powerful multicultural gateway city region rapidly changes, we look at what to expect next from Hong Kong and what it means for all those operating with and within it. Elsewhere, we investigate digital currencies, demystifying the fads and frenzies to show the intellectually curious treasurer what you need to know.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this issue and look forward to bringing you the latest and most thorough insight and to coming together as a community over the course of a year of recovery and opportunity.</p>

<h3 id=""2021-a-year-of-leadership-and-community"">2021: A year of leadership and community</h3>
<p>This is the first edition of Treasury Today Asia of the new year and we approach 2021 with the experience and insight that 2020 has brought to us all. 2021 will be a year of rebuilding and coming together with a focus on leadership and community.</p>
<p>Firstly we want to extend our well wishes for yourselves, our readership, your colleagues and your families. Secondly, we would like to thank you all for your ongoing engagement with Treasury Today Asia and your corporate community. We will continue to do all we can to keep you informed, engaged and connected in 2021.</p>
<p>In this edition we look at the lessons to be learnt by the year that was 2020 and look ahead to our shared future. We celebrated our Adam Smith Awards Asia 2020 winners at the end of last year, with a record-breaking number of submissions. We look forward to sharing the stories of our 2020 winners with you this year in our podcast series and case studies and will also be bringing you insights from previous year winners as we create our alumni groups in 2021. We also want to start 2021 by encouraging everyone to look ahead and think of this year’s award submissions which will open in June. Be part of the best practice community.</p>
<p>The intersection of geopolitics with corporate finance and leadership has grown in recent years and 2021 will be a year that seems sure to be defined by large scale global geopolitical events. Intellectual curiosity has never been more important as we navigate the demands and complexities of our organisations, industries and selves.</p>
<p>Stay safe, take care and let us know if there is anything you would like to read, see or hear in 2021 from Treasury Today Asia.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""embracing-change"">Embracing change</h3>
<p>As 2020 draws to a close this seems an apt moment to reflect on a most extraordinary year for all of us. The Asia-Pacific region, although the first hit by the pandemic, has been spared the lockdown measures that have occurred in much of Europe, North and South America.</p>
<p>That being said, there has been now almost 12 months of working from home and disruptions to business. Over the course of the year we have sought to offer a community space to bring our APAC readership together. The power of this connection cannot be understated and has only been highlighted by a year in which all of our personal and professional relationships have been impacted.</p>
<p>Our Women in Treasury Singapore Forum took place digitally in the summer of this year and in October we hosted our Adam Smith Awards Asia 2020 live winners announcement. Although we have missed hosting our regular events in Asia and our usual Adam Smith Awards Asia Lunch, it has been fantastic to be able to come together digitally and to support and celebrate our corporate community across Asia Pacific. With that in mind our Adam Smith Awards Asia 2020 season is in full swing and will feature the success stories of all our winners within our Adam Smith Awards Asia podcast programme which goes live later this month. Please sign up to our podcast channel wherever you get your podcasts from so you can hear the stories behind each winning solution.</p>
<p>In this new edition, the last of 2020, we look at the impact of this year’s pandemic on the payments and collections space as the pandemic affects Asian exporters’ payments and technology shakes up the trade payments space. We also assess the evolution of the cybercrime space and its refined focus on treasury as a target. 2020 has certainly done nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of cyber criminals as they optimise any weaknesses in corporate technology.</p>
<p>Elsewhere we discuss the importance of corporate purpose and the role that treasury can play in delivering it. We also speak with Mumtaz Dole of Vestas in our Corporate View segment and assess both open banking and the risks and opportunities of China’s new BRI infastructure.</p>
<p>As the world hears news of Pfizer’s development of a vaccine and Joe Biden becomes the President elect for the USA we can be hopeful that there will be improved global relations and an end to the pandemic in sight that give us cause for optimism in 2021. And we look forward to providing the latest news and insight and continuing to offer a platform for community and information in Asia Pacific for our corporate readership.</p>
<p>Stay safe, be well and see you in 2021!</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""adapt-and-thrive"">Adapt and thrive</h3>
<p>“When the winds of change blow, some people build walls and others build windmills,” so the Chinese proverb goes. As the world continues to change, businesses that adapt to take advantage of the new environment will be the ones that will gain the most.</p>
<p>As millions work from home, becoming accustomed to the ‘new normal’ that they hear so much about, treasurers across the world are working to build metaphorical windmills in order to continue to stay ahead.</p>
<p>In this edition, we look at some of the ways treasurers are doing exactly that. In times of uncertainty, one thing is most important: liquidity. The Investing feature takes a look at how treasurers can develop and maintain an effective investment strategy in times of extreme volatility – and keep the focus on that ever-important available liquidity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Insight &amp; Analysis piece looks at what challenges and opportunities there are when banking in Asia, with bankers and treasurers alike weighing in. Down a similar vein, in the Point of View feature, David Blair, Managing Director of Acarate Consulting, offers his view on the topic of treasury hubs in Asia.</p>
<p>With cash management fundamentals currently front and centre for most companies, our Cash Management feature focuses on effective cash segmentation, looking at how this seemingly simple process can be enhanced to become a means of optimising current and future cash holdings.</p>
<p>Of course, no edition of Treasury Today Asia would be complete without a look at technology. In the Question… Answered segment, three experts tackle the topic of what treasurers should be aware of with the ongoing digital revolution in the supply chain finance space.</p>
<p>Last but by no means least, in the wake of Japanese firm Takeda Pharmaceutical’s success in the 2020 Adam Smith Awards, we spoke with SVP, Group Treasurer, Amit Singh for the Corporate View. Offering plenty of wisdom and another Chinese proverb, “treasurers sweat more in peace so they bleed less in war,” Singh shares his main challenges and his tips for keeping teams motivated and successful.</p>
<p>To end on another proverb, “Pearls don’t lie on the seashore. If you want one, you must dive for it.” Indeed, treasurers seeking the best opportunities must be proactive in searching for them.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""darwinism–of-business"">Darwinism – of business</h3>
<p>Understandably, many are tired of hearing about what new problem 2020 is heralding. Be it murder hornets, bush fires or trade wars, or the eponymous pandemic, the year has certainly taken its toll.</p>
<p>We’re now seven months into the year, and most of us have spent at least half of that working remotely. It’s certainly not a situation we thought we’d be in a year ago. But the human race continues to evolve and adapt, and the reaction to the global COVID-19 pandemic is no different. Life continues to move forward – albeit at a slower, and often socially distanced pace.</p>
<p>Singapore has headed to the polls for the general election, the build up to which became a global subject of interest. With a pandemic risking a recession, and a dramatic family contest (Lee Hsien Yang, the brother of incumbent prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong joined the opposition party), the election in the world’s fourth-best financial hub (according to the Z/Yen and China Development Institute ‘Global Financial Centres Index’) has proved one to watch.</p>
<p>For treasurers, the turmoil in Asia could prove problematic. The World Bank reported that growth in East Asia and the Pacific is expected to slow to 0.5% in 2020 – the lowest rate since 1976. All major economies are implementing huge stimulus packages – but will they be enough? Treasurers are having to work overtime to ensure their businesses are kept safe from the economic fallout that so many experts say is inevitable.</p>
<p>Key for a treasurer’s preparations is, of course, cash flow forecasting. In this edition we take a look at just how accurate is accurate enough, and we speak to experts and treasurers to find out what businesses could and should be doing to get the most accurate and efficient forecasts.</p>
<p>Keeping with the ever-important cash management focus, our Question…Answered feature quizzes both a treasurer and a banker on what they think can help treasurers to overcome the major challenge of forecasting and liquidity planning and help gain the information needed.</p>
<p>In the spirit of remote working and adapting to technology, our Insight &amp; Analysis delves into the payments space, and how Asia is leading the digital revolution. Meanwhile, the Technology feature looks at APIs, whether or not they’ve truly delivered on what was promised to treasurers – and what the future holds for their use.</p>
<p>Lastly, this edition features an Industry Insight with Zarine Swamy, who recently transitioned out of treasury to pursue her own ventures. She discussed her experiences as a woman in the industry, what she’s learned from treasury and what she will take with her in her next role.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""challenges-continue"">Challenges continue</h3>
<p>Five months into 2020, the world continues to face a crisis no one could have foreseen. Since the last issue of Treasury Today Asia, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic has moved from China to Europe, and then to the United States, with millions of people and businesses affected. While the Wuhan lockdown has been lifted, and several countries in Asia Pacific are beginning to focus on rebooting their economies, considerable challenges lie ahead.</p>
<p>For many treasurers, one of the most immediate challenges brought by the pandemic has been the need to adjust rapidly to a working from home model. While many companies already offered flexible working patterns to their employees, other have had to transition overnight to a completely different method of working. In this issue’s Technology article, we take a look at the benefits of working remotely, as well as exploring the challenges that the ‘new normal’ has brought for treasurers. We also discuss the role that different technologies can play in smoothing the transition from working in the office to working from home.</p>
<p>Treasurers will know all too well that robust liquidity management is particularly critical during a crisis. In The Corporate View, Siang Chee Chew, Head of Treasury at JERA Global Markets, explains how the lessons he learned about the need for strong liquidity management during the 2008 global financial crisis have resonated throughout his career. He also delves into the challenges faced by treasurers as their roles continue to evolve, as well as the potential application of technologies such as blockchain in supporting trade.</p>
<p>Turning to geographical considerations, when companies seek to centralise their Asia Pacific treasury activities via a regional treasury centre, it’s essential to choose the location that best fits the company’s business needs. In Insight &amp; Analysis we review the options available to companies facing just that decision, from frequently cited locations like Singapore and Hong Kong to other markets which may also offer attractive tax incentives and benefits, such as Thailand and Malaysia. Industry experts review the options available and explain what factors companies need to consider when making a decision.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this issue’s Country Focus article takes a look at the island nation of Mauritius, from its varied history over the last 500 years to its banking landscape. The article also discusses some of the factors that treasurers need to bear in mind when managing cash in Mauritius.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""black-swans"">Black swans</h3>
<p>Coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2008 book, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, the term ‘black swan’ is understood to describe an event that is unexpected; that brings major consequences; and that later comes to be rationalised as something that could have been predicted. It has been applied to various events, such as the dotcom crash of 2000, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the term is being applied by some to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, Covid-19, that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan but has already had widespread consequences for people and businesses around the world. Tens of thousands of people have been infected by the disease, while millions have been subject to lockdowns in China. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the outbreak.</p>
<p>Treasurers across the region will be keeping a close eye on these unfolding events. While the outbreak only began a matter of weeks ago, the economic impact is already being felt, with countries across the region downgrading their economic growth forecasts. Supply chains are being disrupted, with factory closures in China affecting companies around the world, while sectors ranging from travel to luxury goods are seeing a considerable impact. Where workforce matters are concerned, many businesses are also taking steps to minimise travel for their staff.</p>
<p>As they navigate these uncharted waters, treasurers will be working to understand the impact of the outbreak on their own organisations, from supply chain interruptions to the implications for FX risk, liquidity management and cash flow. At the same time, they will of course continue to focus on their existing challenges and responsibilities.</p>
<p>This issue, we take a close look at some of the areas that fall within the treasurer’s remit, from managing bank relationships to mitigating operational risk. We also explore the treasurer’s role in managing the company’s capital structure, and how this activity may be affected by ongoing market conditions.</p>
<p>Delving into the challenges faced by commodities businesses, Nitin Jain, Head of Treasury and Capital Markets at Agrocorp, explains how the company developed a distributed ledger technology platform to unlock supply chain value and support thousands of farmers in Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this issue’s Insight &amp; Analysis article takes a wide-ranging look at the broader challenges that treasurers face in Asia’s diverse markets, and what they can do to overcome the obstacles and operate as efficiently as possible across the region. In this challenging time, actions like streamlining processes, managing risks effectively and maintaining strong bank relationships will be more essential than ever. Treasury Today Group will be bringing the APAC treasury community together via our webinars, events and content throughout the year.</p>

<h3 id=""treasury-in-the-year-of-the-rat"">Treasury in the Year of the Rat</h3>
<p>As we begin a new year, many corporate treasurers will be pleased to see the back of 2019 – particularly those operating in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that 2019 was a year full of uncertainty. From the continuing trade war between the US and China, to violent protests in Hong Kong and fresh conflict in the Middle East – not to mention concerns surrounding Brexit and a new UK government, it’s hoped that many of these issues will be resolved this year.</p>
<p>With that in mind, 2020 is the Chinese ‘Year of the Rat’. As the first in the Chinese zodiac, the Year of the Rat traditionally signals new beginnings. Regardless of the geopolitical landscape, and looking ahead to the coming year, corporate treasurers across the APAC region will be weighing up a whole host of new challenges, trends and opportunities. Many will include inefficiencies arising from legacy structures, risks in the current macroeconomic market and opportunities brought by new technology. With this in mind, what will treasurers be focusing on in the year ahead?</p>
<p>Trade finance may not traditionally have been regarded as a hotbed of innovation. But while some digitisation initiatives have failed to gain critical mass, recent months have seen considerable focus on the potential application of blockchain and distributed ledger technology in this area. How much progress has been made so far – and what could the future hold for trade finance?</p>
<p>We then look towards the latest trends in cross-border payments and correspondent banking. Whilst most treasurers will be interested more in the timeliness and cost of their payments, rather than how the bank executes them, if correspondent banking is showing its age, it may be time to explore other options – and that may mean stepping beyond the banking realm.</p>
<p>But with corporate social responsibility (CSR) high up on many companies’ radars, investment in green bonds continues to flourish, year after year. Last year for example, global green bond issuance topped US$200bn. However, demand for green bonds far exceeds supply, with many issuers being oversubscribed the moment a green bond is launched.</p>
<p>Although ‘being seen to be green’ is imperative for investors and stakeholders alike, just what is holding green bonds back from reaching their full potential? And finally, in our ‘Back to Basics’ feature, we examine the complex subject of how to manage commodities risk, assessing the current crop of tools available to treasurers.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, as we leave the volatility of 2019 behind and move into the New Year, treasurers simply have to remain alert. It seems that the ancient Chinese proverb ‘solve one problem and you keep a hundred others away’ could not be more apt.</p>

<h3 id=""the-digital-spice-of-life"">The digital spice of life</h3>
<p>India. One of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>
<p>Four years ago, the Indian government made a decision that would change the lives for its 1.3 billion citizens forever. In making digital services available for all, the Indian government has not only improved the country’s online infrastructure, it has increased internet connectivity and widened opportunities for business.</p>
<p>As a result, treasury has had to keep up with digital developments. To take an example, the government digitised the sharing of cross-border documentation between trade counterparties and customs offices through the ‘fourth industrial revolution project’, an online import/export portal that goes some way to easing the previously paper-heavy processes underpinning any trade involving foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In addition to this, e-commerce has become India’s fastest growing channel for commercial transactions. The Indian e-commerce market is expected to grow to US$200bn by 2026, up from US$48.5bn in 2018. With core systems up and running, such rapid progress has forced treasurers to keep tabs on how a new digital India will impact their business and how best they can respond.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, banks will be able to support that exploration, but at the end of the day it will be down to treasurers to stay on top of all available options. After all, there is a lot that can be gained from a digital India, but there is still so much work to do.</p>
<p>But digitalisation is not an electric switch that a government can switch on at any time. Indeed, whenever we turn on the lights or drive to work, we are contributing towards increased carbon emissions and climate change – a hot topic for today’s corporates.</p>
<p>We have a number of options when it comes to halting and possibly reversing the damaging effects of climate change. We can run around like headless chickens, panicking about it. We can refute the claims of scientists. We could do nothing because someone else will fix it. Or we can do something to help.</p>
<p>In this edition’s Risk Management feature, ‘Climate change and the treasurer’, we look at the latter option from a treasury perspective, exploring the kind of affirmative actions and preventative measures that the community can take to help make a difference. The options here are greater than you’d perhaps think.</p>
<p>Of course, climate change is the ‘Big One’, but risks abound (as they always will). In our Technology article, we explore the hot topic of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Blockchain and DLT has hit the news of late, particularly given recent developments over cryptocurrencies such as Facebook’s Libra.</p>
<p>We explore just how blockchain has evolved in recent years, and whether or not it will become industry standard – it is certainly making waves in the shipping industry.</p>
<p>And finally, keeping the digital theme in mind, our ‘Question Answered’ article explores the hot topic of what does your IT department need to know about treasury? After all, it’s a question that is so often asked in boardrooms across the globe. So, as the year comes to an end and we move into 2020, it’s clear to see that the future of treasury will be a digital one.</p>

<h3 id=""central-reservation"">Central reservation</h3>
<p>When a business grows and reaches into a different region, setting up a regional treasury centre may be seen as a logical next step. After all, having somewhere closer to the action that can support business growth, cover the local footprint, and have treasury experts on tap, should be appealing. And what about the favourable tax regimes established by key locations; surely a major benefit?</p>
<p>Whilst the tax incentives are undeniably attractive (albeit usually with a time limit of around five years), when taking the regional treasury centre path it’s better to think more in terms of how such a structure can help the company achieve its objectives such as enhancing operational efficiency, centralisation of funding, liquidity and risks, and optimisation of capital.</p>
<p>However, any business considering this path will rapidly be made aware of the considerable need for local knowledge to achieve all this. The demands of the process for some may even put the brakes on any such plan, encompassing as it does swathes of regulation, in-depth knowledge of local business practice, payment systems, taxation, legal requirements and so on. Building a regional treasury centre is thus not something a business can take lightly, and reservations may abound.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Asia presents a number of realistic options for companies seeking treasury centre efficiencies.</p>
<p>There are two obvious candidates in the region. Singapore is easily the largest FX trading centre here, with a mature banking sector to match. It offers political stability, a strong technological infrastructure, and a deep talent pool for businesses to draw upon. Furthermore, it is currently ranked second among 190 economies by World Bank annual ratings on ease of doing business.</p>
<p>The other contender, Hong Kong, despite its current difficulties, is a convenient gateway to China, offers interesting tax incentives and a favourable environment in which to do business (it takes fourth place in World Bank annual ratings). What’s more, it offers a dynamic financial structure, and one of Asia’s largest stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Whilst these two financial colossi may be strong magnets for APAC treasury centres, they are not the only options for companies in the region. Other demonstrably suitable locations currently include China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Australia and New Zealand (the latter taking the number one spot in the 2019 World Bank ease of doing rankings).</p>
<p>With the trend of relocating treasury centres having seemingly picked up speed in the last few years, these alternative locations may well be serious challengers to the dynamic duo. With more options, any reservations about taking the centralisation pathway begin to melt away.</p>
<p>In our main feature this edition, we explore in depth the options open to those seeking to establish a regional treasury centre, opening up the options beyond the obvious (but giving the obvious credit where it’s due).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we look at opportunities for treasurers seeking to expand their short-term investment strategies, we cast a critical eye over the role treasury can play in M&amp;As, and even explore the contentious notion of zero-based budgeting.</p>
<p>Whilst it sometimes pays to be circumspect, treasury options are opening up in many fields; being aware of what’s out there is essential if informed decisions are to be made.</p>

<h3 id=""advantage-asia"">Advantage Asia!</h3>
<p>The payments revolution is a truly global affair yet, at the regional level, Asia undoubtedly stands at the forefront of payments innovation. Driven by e-commerce, it is a position that requires close management if it is to deliver on expectations.</p>
<p>Extraordinary rates of growth are predicted for e-commerce across the region by Worldpay, with five-year compound annual projections of 21.3% in Malaysia, 20.2% in Vietnam, and 18.6% in the Philippines and Indonesia telling a compelling story.</p>
<p>China remains on a path towards widespread adoption of digital wallets, led decisively by Alipay and WeChat Pay. These app-based payment tools are seemingly redefining the scope of the possible. Certainly, Chinese consumers favour the seamless integration and trusted environment offered by these all-inclusive apps.</p>
<p>Indeed, wallet use is ubiquitous in online China, accounting for nearly two-thirds of e-commerce transactions. But Worldpay also notes that eWallets are so popular among Chinese consumers that they also lead payments at the point of sale, representing more than a third of card-present market share.</p>
<p>Worldpay is forecasting growth and dramatic shifts in payments in India too. The world’s second largest population is far from saturated in either internet access or mobile phone penetration. This translates into projected e-commerce growth at 21.2% CAGR for the next five years.</p>
<p>The rapid upgrade of payment rails across Asia Pacific is accelerating the trend towards mobile payments. The use of overlay solutions such as QR codes are key features of real-time payment schemes in the region, far more so than in other schemes around the world.</p>
<p>The push for financial inclusion is also fuelling the growth in real-time payments across the region as governments see an opportunity to use new technology to provide financial services to citizens who previously did not have bank accounts.</p>
<p>However, as payment rails proliferate and diversify across the region, so do the challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>On the downside, with payment methods varying widely across the region, both between and within countries, and across the spectrums of development from urban to rural, a complicated and demanding payment landscape is emerging. The major positive is that Asia seems to be offering almost infinite promise for commerce and payments, and this is something that businesses across the world can leverage.</p>
<p>The bottom line for Asian payments is this: for critical mass to be reached, regulators, banks, payment solution providers, and large corporates must work together. The prize for getting it right is surely too big to ignore.</p>

<h3 id=""promising-future-for-bank-fintech-collaborations"">Promising future for bank – fintech collaborations</h3>
<p>When fintechs first began to appear ten years ago, born out of the maelstrom that was the Great Recession, they were seen almost purely in terms of their potential for taking away business from banks.</p>
<p>Payments has proved an especially strong hunting ground for them versus the banks, especially with retail end solutions for cross-border transfers, micropayments and card payments, where incumbents have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced products.</p>
<p>It’s arguably been tougher going for fintechs in providing solutions for corporates due to the higher barriers to entry but that hasn’t stopped them tackling the space with gusto, particularly across corporate payments, working capital management and peer-to-peer lending.</p>
<p>In recent years though banks and fintechs have grown to recognise that there are considerable merits in their working more closely together through collaborations and formal partnerships. As our article on fintechs and banks in this issue shows, after years of warily circling each other, both now recognise each other’s strengths, with agile fintechs contributing innovative platforms and solutions, and banks the equally important client relationships, global footprints and regulatory and licensing expertise and know-how.</p>
<p>There is an awful lot of mileage left yet in the two parties working together to provide novel solutions for existing retail and corporate pain points. But, as we note in this issue, what might cement the relationship between the two even more going forwards is the relatively new and fast-growing phenomena of multi-sector collaborations that have begun to pop up globally. These are webs of collaborating and competing firms that offer connected products and services and include the industrial ecosystems forming around autonomous vehicles, connected cars and car sharing services.</p>
<p>Another example is Microsoft and the BMW Group launching last month an initiative aimed at speeding up innovation in the manufacturing sector and making it more cost-effective. Their “Open Manufacturing Platform” is designed to break down barriers caused by proprietary systems, and to create an open technology framework backed by a cross-industry community.</p>
<p>The future, it seems, will be co-created and as such could open up many new, rich opportunities for banks and fintechs to tap into. With such a win-win proposition to aim for, it will be surprising if we do not see an acceleration in collaborative efforts.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""the-asian-century-will-be-about-much-more-than-just-china"">“The Asian Century” will be about much more than just China</h3>
<p>Evidence continues to mount that China’s economy is faltering, though it is uncertain as yet how serious its retreat will turn out to be. With hindsight, it was surely unrealistic to expect that after two decades of stunning growth that has propelled it to the second largest economy in the world, China could continue to grow three times faster than advanced nations.</p>
<p>The slowdown will have global repercussions, certainly, and present yet another challenge for corporate treasurers to manage, but its impact is unlikely to alter the shape of the future to come. For there is a growing consensus that by around 2030 China will succeed the US economy as the world’s largest economy. It’s an expectation that ensures China is more often than not foremost in mind whenever discussions turn to the proposition of “The Asian Century”, the projected 21st century global domination by Asian economies.</p>
<p>Yet, as the recently published and widely acclaimed book, The Future is Asian by Parag Khanna, stresses, Asia is far more than just China – 3.5bn of the region’s 5bn strong population are not Chinese. It’s the whole of Asia that needs to be factored in when assessing its potential future economic status.</p>
<p>The region, which Singapore-based Khanna sees ranging all the way from the Arabian Peninsula and Turkey in the west, to Japan and New Zealand in the east, and from Russia in the north to Australia in the south, already accounts for 50% of global gross GDP and over 60% of global economic growth.</p>
<p>The rather bright prospects for the South East sub-region of Asia, the ASEAN group of countries in particular, underline the fact that “The Asian Century”, if there is to be one, will be about more than just the heavyweights, China and India, the latter itself tipped to overtake Japan, Germany, UK and France to become the world’s number three by 2030.</p>
<p>Even as global foreign direct investment has slumped due to the US tax reforms, South East Asian countries have continued to see healthy levels of FDI inflows and are forecast to grow annually by more than 5% on average over the medium term. The Philippines is a case in point, as we report in this issue. With proactive policies aimed at attracting foreign corporate investment; a US$180bn five-year public infrastructure programme in train; a 107m strong population with a median age of just 24; and expectations of more than 6% growth annually over the next few years, the Philippines is making corporate executives more than just sit up and take notice.</p>
<p>According to Khanna, of an estimated US$30trn in global middle-class consumption growth between 2015 and 2030, only US$1trn is expected to come from today’s western economies, with most of the rest coming from Asia. Such an outturn would amount to a colossal global reorientation in wealth generation and consumption and inevitably, dramatically impact corporate investment decision making.</p>

<h3 id=""apac-2019-us-china-trade-war-a-big-risk-factor-for-treasurers"">APAC 2019: US-China trade war a big risk factor for treasurers</h3>
<p>As it stands, the year ahead is shaped to be rather interesting, if not challenging, for treasurers across Asia Pacific, with politics a key theme as elections will take place in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Australia.</p>
<p>But despite the uncertainties that elections anywhere always encompass for businesses, it can be argued that at least they are certain events, with (one hopes) a certain level of transparency and intelligence available on policies to enable at the very least some semblance of planning and preparedness.</p>
<p>Which is not something we can say at all about the US-China trade spat, the single biggest risk to the APAC region entering 2019. Any escalation of the dispute will likely lead to the slowdown in China being exacerbated, which in turn would have large knock-on effects across the region, given the interconnectedness of Asian trade.</p>
<p>The two countries have called a truce for now, after President Trump announced a 90-day delay in increasing US tariffs on US$200bn worth of Chinese goods to allow negotiations. But even if they go well, most analysts believe the kind of fundamental changes the US is demanding of China are almost impossible to agree on in such a short negotiating window.</p>
<p>As we note in this issue, the trade war has led to companies in both countries relocating to escape the fallout. A prime beneficiary has been Southeast Asia and South Asia, with their economies enjoying a boom in foreign direct investment, even as, mainly because of US tax reforms, global FDI has slumped.</p>
<p>Treasurers and trade chiefs in companies affected by the trade war have therefore been kept on their toes over, for instance, investment strategy, financial supply chain management, capex spend and cash management generally. With uncertainty over how the trade dispute between the US and China will evolve, the early months of the new year at least will likely remain challenging on these fronts.</p>
<p>Despite the threats posed by the trade war, investment analysts are generally predicting a stable to positive 2019 outlook for APAC, with forecasts of around 5% for GDP growth for the region versus rather more muted outlooks for the US, eurozone and Brexit-challenged UK. The hope is that even if the US-China trade war is not resolved, the region will manage to rise above the fallout. Under the circumstances, APAC-exposed corporates will likely be content with such an outcome.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""global-economy-under-threat-as-politicians-lose-the-plot"">Global economy under threat as politicians lose the plot</h3>
<p>Corporate treasurers are no strangers to managing risks to financial and liquidity management but with fears growing that the global economy is heading for another downturn, they are coming under pressure to monitor an increasingly wide array of threats.</p>
<p>There are several potential financial triggers for another recession. Among the most notable are rising US interest rates threatening to call time on emerging market debt – the experience of Turkey being a case in point.</p>
<p>China’s debt of around 250% of GDP is seen by some as an even bigger threat. Yet with China’s debt overwhelmingly attributable to state-owned enterprises and banks and local government, Beijing is well placed to rewrite its national balance sheet.</p>
<p>Beijing is certainly not averse to such action: three such major restructurings have been actioned since 1980, while its central bank bailed out a number of lenders in the 2000s after they had become saddled with bad loans. Furthermore, risks to the global economy from any such debt restructuring should be limited by China’s relatively closed banking system and current account surplus, and high domestic savings rate.</p>
<p>But while financial risks to the global economy are palpable, it’s arguably geopolitics and trade policies that are increasingly driving them, or at the very least exacerbating them. The IMF in its latest Financial Stability Report, one of the most detailed analysis of global banking and markets since the financial crisis, warns that “dangerous undercurrents” are now a rising threat to the world economy.</p>
<p>Trump’s trade wars and the undermining of global co-operation by nationalist policies have become a real threat to global growth, with the likes of Brexit, the crisis in Argentina and Turkey and the US standoff with Iran over its nuclear programme adding to the turmoil.</p>
<p>The global synchronised upswing of 2017 is over, with the IMF predicting 45 of the least wealthy countries – accounting for 10% of the global economy – will see their living standards fall further behind those of rich countries over the next five years.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, politicians and institutions like the IMF placed the blame for the crisis squarely on the shoulders of “irresponsible” banks and “weak” regulators. This time around it looks like it will be more the result of geopolitical miscalculation and misguided trade policies, leaving us, oddly enough, to rely on central bankers, to pick up the pieces again.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""is-the-crypto-gold-rush-over"">Is the crypto gold rush over?</h3>
<p>The internet is slowly becoming a crypto-graveyard. This is after cryptocurrency after cryptocurrency, often created as part of an initial coin offering (ICO), lose their value, rendering them worthless. In fact, one website which tracks failing cryptocurrencies claims that there are over 800 cryptocurrencies that trade for less than a cent.</p>
<p>This raises serious questions about the legitimacy of the ICO market, which is largely unregulated. Yet despite this, money continues to pour into ICOs. Companies raised US$3.8bn via ICOs in 2017 and by July this year fundraising through ICOs had hit US$11.9bn.</p>
<p>The problem is that for every legitimate fund raising there are several ICOs that are scams or jokes. Some of these are obvious, such as BUTT-Coin and Koindashian. Others, however, seem legitimate. Take LoopX, for example, the coin was created as part of an ICO to raise money for what seemed like a promising lending platform. Then just after the ICO they took down the website, left Twitter and cleared off with the money. As a result of these scams, investors lost US$233m in 2017 – much more was lost due to the proceeds of ICOs being stolen by hackers as well.</p>
<p>The fact that ICOs have gone this way shouldn’t be a surprise; ICOs are like the California Gold Rush or DotCom bubble in the sense that people think they can get rich quick and ignore the risks. It is a shame that ICOs are being tarnished though, because legitimate ICOs offer businesses an innovative way to raise funds quickly and without the costs associated with traditional forms of fundraising. ICOs also democratise finance, allowing retail investors to access a wider range of investment products.</p>
<p>It’s not just the cryptocurrencies created through ICOs that are having a tough time. The grand-crypto-daddy itself, Bitcoin, is also struggling and has fallen around 70% since it reached its record-high of US$20,000 in 2017. Morgan Stanley states that Bitcoin’s decline is happening 15 times faster than the bursting of the DotCom bubble.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? Is crypto-mania over? Has the cryptocurrency experiment been a failure? Probably not, the likelihood is that cryptocurrencies are here to stay in some shape or form. In fact, they will likely develop over time as technological advancements, enhanced security and greater regulation rebuild confidence and enhance the coins utility.</p>
<p>So, whilst cryptocurrencies shouldn’t be the number one topic of discussion within the treasury department, it would be remiss to ignore them. If the last few years have proven anything, it is that technology trends evolve quickly and something can become widely used almost overnight. Treasurers, therefore, don’t want to miss the opportunity to perhaps issue an ICO or receive payments using a cryptocurrency if that is what customers want. Ultimately, like with most things, treasurers must proactively monitor what is happening, ensuring the business is ready to act when the time comes.</p>

<h3 id=""there-can-never-be-too-many-banks"">There can never be too many banks</h3>
<p>Treasurers have never had so many banks competing for their business. Indeed, a recent Bain &amp; Company report has found that the transaction banking space is more saturated than ever. This comes as bank executives place their bets on the fee-based income gleaned from the business driving a new era of growth for their institutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, new entrants, in the form of niche technology companies, are emerging. These companies tackle specific business issues unsolved by the banks and promise treasurers a better user experience. Areas currently impacted include payments, supply chain finance and FX.</p>
<p>This is great news for treasurers. Increased investment and competition should manifest in improved products and services. It could also see costs reduce as banks use new technology to streamline operations and are forced into more transparent pricing models by fintech entrants. Indeed, Bain &amp; Company predicts the correct application of blockchain could reduce trade finance operating costs by as much as 80%, for example, which should be passed onto the customer.</p>
<p>There are risks that may emerge, however. Bain &amp; Company highlights that as the transaction banking space becomes more crowded and prices fall some banks may be negatively impacted. This may cause certain banks to retrench, or it may lead to a round of consolidation.</p>
<p>Treasurers must therefore continue to be vigilant when deciding who they do business with. This means avoiding the fintech marketing hype and selecting partners and solutions that will be there for the long term.</p>
<p>Treasury Today Asia explores the effect technology is having on financial services in more detail in this magazine. We cut through the noise and explore the macro impact it is having in reshaping financial services.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we dismantle China’s Belt and Road project and ask what it will mean for corporations and their corporate treasury teams. We also take a tour around the region’s leading corporate treasury centres and find out how increased competition is creating opportunities for treasury departments looking to centralise.</p>

<h3 id=""what-goes-up-can-stay-up"">What goes up can stay up</h3>
<p>Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, is renowned for his colourful quotes on all manner of topics. One that stands out is his comment on flying pigs. “First of all, a pig can fly in the wind, but when that wind dies down it’s the pig who’s going to fall to his death, because he’s still a pig,” said Ma in a 2015 interview with Sina Tech.</p>
<p>Curious imagery aside, Ma’s comment holds a deeper meaning. What he was suggesting is that any business can have some success when following the latest trends. However, it is only by being innovative and driving the trends that true long-term success can be achieved.</p>
<p>The rest of Ma’s quote brings this idea into context: “What everyone has to think about is how to control the wind, how to grasp that wind and push yourself up. I think we shouldn’t seek the next strong wind; we should make ourselves into people that can fly at even the slightest breeze, people who can soar.”</p>
<p>His point should resonate for all operating in today’s business environment. Ma’s own great success has been driven by his ability to look beyond the hype of the present and build companies that are ready to harness the trends of the future. This is a lesson for all business leaders shaping the strategy that they hope will bring their company future success.</p>
<p>But this is equally valid for treasury too. Indeed, it is the responsibility of the department to make sure that the business has the means to thrive in the now, whilst pushing the limits of incoming trends and making sure that the resources are there to harness these in the future. This is something that Adam Smith Awards Asia winner and Group Treasurer at AIA, Scott Engle, talks about extensively in this edition’s Corporate View feature. His story is captivating and highlights the real added-value that treasury can bring to multiple areas of the business.</p>
<p>Carrying on with the theme of harnessing emerging trends, in this edition’s Insight &amp; Analysis we take an in-depth look into the shift away from cash as a method of payment in many markets around the world.</p>
<p>We also explore how treasury teams operating within tight budget constraints can achieve impressive results and find out how to make substantial savings by driving down bank fees.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""will-asia-thrive-in-the-year-of-the-dog"">Will Asia thrive in the Year of the Dog?</h3>
<p>Countries across the region celebrated the Lunar New Year in February, ushering in the Year of the Earth Dog. According to the Chinese Zodiac, the Earth Dog is kind, efficient and skilled in communication. It holds the notion of fair play and social justice dear and, given the dog’s role as a protector of the home, could be interpreted as time for a shift geographically and politically from predominantly offensive positions to more defensive positions.</p>
<p>In a period of great geopolitical unrest and uncertainty, this is certainly a welcome notion. We may have already seen the evidence of these ancient mystic forces at work with the cooling of tensions in the Korean peninsula during the Winter Olympics – a combined Korean ice hockey team was unimaginable for much of the Year of the Fire Rooster.</p>
<p>Whilst one threat subsides – albeit marginally – others increase. For corporates across the region, the risk posed by cyber criminals gets scarier every day. Asia is the world’s top destination for cyber criminals, who are taking advantage of inadequate systems, processes and controls to extort millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Although businesses are aware of the risk they face, many are still not doing enough to combat it. To help, Treasury Today Asia explores the various methods that can be used to combat cybercrime, explaining why quantifying the financial impact of cyber-risk can be the best way to highlight the problem to the board.</p>
<p>Another risk that has certainly grabbed the headlines in recent months has been the staggeringly high levels of corporate and household debt in China. The IMF has cited China’s credit boom as being on a dangerous trajectory that may be the makings of the next financial crisis.</p>
<p>This view should certainly sound an alarm bell for any treasurer, with the memories of the last great financial crisis still strong. However, in our deep dive analysis of what is currently happening in China, we find that whilst these debt levels are not ideal, the danger of the bubble bursting and bringing down the global economy is low. Indeed, rather than a bad news story, our analysis of China paints a positive picture, telling the story of a country and economy in transformation as it looks to fulfil its promise as a leader on the global stage.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we investigate the evolving corporate treasury landscape in Japan and hear how Japanese corporates are looking to re-establish global treasury centres in their home country. Treasury Today Asia also learns from Amit Baraskar, Vice President &amp; Head – Treasury at Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. about his career and how he manages the treasury of a constantly evolving business.</p>
<p>Treasury Today Asia wishes all our readers a very happy and prosperous Lunar New Year.</p>

<h3 id=""singapore-to-drive-pan-asean-digital-agenda"">Singapore to drive pan-ASEAN digital agenda</h3>
<p>Singapore is taking digitisation seriously. This was evident at its recent fintech festival, which saw over 25,000 attendees from all over the world descend on the city-state to take part in a week of festivities designed to push forward the future of financial services.</p>
<p>At the festival, Ravi Menon, Managing Director at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) outlined the pillars of Singapore’s strategy to become a ‘Smart Financial Centre’. Core to this is the creation of an ‘open API economy’ that will allow financial institutions, corporates and fintechs to build a digital financial ecosystem using standardised APIs.</p>
<h4 id=""spreading-the-message"">Spreading the message</h4>
<p>As well as its ambitions to become a ‘Smart Financial Centre’, Singapore is also keen to spread its digital ambitions to neighbouring countries in the ASEAN region. This was made clear in November, when Singapore officially took over the chairmanship of ASEAN at the 31st ASEAN summit.</p>
<p>At the summit, Singaporean officials announced that ‘resilience and innovation’, with a particular focus on the digital economy and eCommerce, were to be key themes of the country’s chairmanship. “We can find new ways to manage and harness digital technologies, and equip our citizens with skills and capabilities and keep ASEAN a vibrant and dynamic place for our people to live, work and play,” said Singapore Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
<p>At the core of Singapore’s plans is the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network (AFIN), a joint project of the MAS, IFC and ASEAN Bankers Association (ABA). AFIN is designed to provide an integrated platform for collaboration between ASEAN banks, microfinance institutions, non-banking financial institutions (NBFI) and regional fintechs. The overall aim is to make ASEAN’s regulators comfortable with and adopt this new technology, for the benefit of the whole region.</p>
<h4 id=""corporate-encouragement"">Corporate encouragement</h4>
<p>Singapore’s desire to digitise will surely come as good news to the corporate treasury community, given the city-state’s status as the region’s leading location for treasury centres.</p>
<p>Also, its ambitious plans to encourage other countries in ASEAN to digitise at a similar pace will give encouragement to businesses trying to expand their operations in the region. The hope is that this will remove barriers to this growth, namely inefficiency brought on by paper-based processes. This will enable businesses in ASEAN to realise their full potential in the market.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""china-outlines-its-global-ambitions"">China outlines its global ambitions</h3>
<p>All eyes were on Beijing in October as the 19th Communist Party Congress took place. Staged in the Great Hall of the People every five years, the congress brought together over 2,000 party members to shape policy, decide on political positioning and set the agenda for the years ahead.</p>
<p>The headline event at this year’s Congress was President Xi Jinping’s mammoth three hour and 23-minute speech where he signalled the arrival of a “new era” in Chinese politics. At the heart of his speech was the notion that now is the time for China to truly rise up onto the global stage and lead the world on political, economic, military and environmental issues.</p>
<p>The good news for investors in China is that Xi is committed to pushing ahead with market-oriented reforms of both the financial system and foreign exchange rate. He announced that the government will “clean up rules and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition, support development of private firms and stimulate vitality of all types of market entities”.</p>
<p>Xi indicated that China is also committed to further opening its doors to foreign businesses. “China’s open door will not be closed – it will only be opened wider,” he declared.</p>
<h3 id=""debt-spectre"">Debt spectre</h3>
<p>While this rhetoric sends a positive message to everyone that has a stake in China’s success – treasurers may be especially buoyed by the promise of a more open economy, allowing them to integrate China more effectively into their global treasury operations – concerns regarding the levels of debt in China continue to persist.</p>
<p>Indeed, high levels of corporate debt were one of the reasons for S&amp;P’s recent downgrade of China. Although Chinese authorities stated that S&amp;P made the wrong decision, the Central Bank has recently voiced its concerns that corporates may have taken on too much debt.</p>
<p>Reports from Bloomberg show that some Chinese companies are increasingly struggling to carry their debt burden. The news outlet announced that there were 17 defaults between June 2016 and June 2017 in China’s bond market, nearly three times the number of defaults recorded in 2015. Bad corporate debt levels in China have also reached a ten-year high.</p>
<h3 id=""a-bright-future-but"">A bright future but…</h3>
<p>China therefore stands at an interesting juncture in its modern history. On the one hand, it has set out grand global ambitions that few would argue it will meet. On the other hand, however, there are concerns that China will not be able to adapt to its ‘new normal’ quickly enough, potentially resulting in a crisis that will send shockwaves across the world.</p>
<p>One thing is certain though, the eyes of businesses around the world will continue to be focused on the world’s second-largest economy for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""fifty-years-of-being-one"">Fifty years of being one</h3>
<p>There is a peculiar irony in the way that, as one side of the world seeks to close its doors and adopt an isolationist stance (cf. Brexit and Trumpism), another celebrates openness and welcomes a co-operative future.</p>
<h4>Which viewpoint will win more friends and influence more people?</h4>
<p>In Jakarta on August 11th 2017, the ASEAN Secretariat celebrated the Association’s Golden Jubilee. ASEAN Secretary-General, Lê Lương Minh talked of the pleasures and pains of aligning the hopes of, initially, five very different countries, and then accommodating the views and expectations of five more members. “Five decades on, the region is now in a much better shape than when it first started,” said Minh.</p>
<p>Indeed, ASEAN has matured into a community focused on economic integration and growth, and consensus-building. It has, as Minh noted, “been able to foster deeper understanding, and build trust and partnership to pursue common interest in the context of diversity and in full recognition of its varied but shared interests and aspirations”. This landmark anniversary, he added, “sets the tone for the next 50 years”.</p>
<p>As an economic community, ASEAN, with a population of around 630m, is now the third largest market in the world after China and India. It is the seventh largest in the world and the third in Asia in terms of GDP. This currently stands in the order of US$2.5trn, with actual growth of around 4.8%. Projections for ASEAN to become the fourth largest economic bloc by 2030 are already on the table.</p>
<p>As the Philippines became the chair of ASEAN in 2017 its theme of “Partnering for Change, Engaging the World” talked of promoting unity “with and among ASEAN member states and its global partners”.</p>
<p>Maybe the volume of that message should be turned up loud enough to drown out the fractious posturing of those who seek a less co-operative model in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Just a thought. Happy birthday ASEAN!</p>
<p>ASEAN was founded in Bangkok, Thailand on August 8th 1967 upon the signing of the ASEAN Declaration by its five original members of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. ASEAN membership now includes Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam.</p>

<h3 id=""hong-kong-20-years-since-the-handover"">Hong Kong: 20 years since the handover</h3>
<p>In July 1997, the United Kingdom transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China after 150 years of British control. The event marked a new era for Hong Kong and the effective end of the British Empire. In his farewell speech, Governor Chris Patten said: “The story of this great city is about the years before this night and the years of success that will surely follow it.”</p>
<p>In the 20 years since the handover, ‘Asia’s World City’ has thrived. The population has expanded from 6.5m to 7.4m and its economy has grown from strength to strength as its housing, tourism, trading and finance sectors have boomed.</p>
<p>The latter remains Hong Kong’s primary industry. Buoyed by its economic strengths, including a sound banking system, virtually no public debt, a strong legal system, ample foreign exchange reserves and rigorous anti-corruption measures, Hong Kong is home to the highest concentration of banking institutions in the world.</p>
<h4 id=""two-way-relationship"">Two-way relationship</h4>
<p>Whilst these attributes have certainly aided Hong Kong’s success, it is arguably the territory’s role as the gateway to China that has been its most valuable asset since the handover. Its position has seen multinational organisations from around the world flood into Hong Kong, using it as a springboard to take advantage of the boom in China.</p>
<p>This has also turned the territory into one of the world’s leading treasury centres. Corporates from the US and Europe with a significant presence in China have set up regional treasury centres in Hong Kong giving a permanent treasury presence in the market and gaining greater visibility and control over their cash flows.s</p>
<p>Although remaining a gateway to China, Hong Kong’s role is changing. More than simply acting as a springboard for multinationals heading into China, Hong Kong is now a conduit between China and the rest of the world and a base for Chinese corporates going global. And just as international corporates set up regional treasury centres in the territory, Chinese multinationals are doing the same. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has recognised this opportunity to further enhance Hong Kong’s treasury centre credentials. It has revised the taxation rate for locally domiciled treasury centres, making the territory more attractive and staving off its long-time rival, Singapore, and its emerging challenger, Shanghai.</p>
<h4 id=""one-country-one-financial-system"">One country one financial system</h4>
<p>Hong Kong’s role as the gateway for mainland China’s trade, investment and finance only looks set to increase over the coming years. China’s ambitious ‘Belt and Road’ will see the territory become a key financing hub and M&amp;A destination for Chinese corporates.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, initiatives such as the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and the recently launched China-Hong Kong Bond Connect, highlight the important role the Chinese see Hong Kong having as a link to the rest of the financial world. Hong Kong’s position as the world’s foremost RMB hub also demonstrates that China sees the territory acting as a vital cog in its plans to internationalise the currency.</p>
<p>But the territory’s biggest advantage may also be its biggest disadvantage going forward; Hong Kong’s fortunes are becoming even more intimately intertwined with what happens in China.</p>
<p>The recent downgrade of China by Moody’s, and the subsequent downgrading of Hong Kong, highlights this. Explaining the downgrade, Moody’s said that “credit trends in China will continue to have a significant impact on Hong Kong’s credit profile due to close and tightening economic, financial and political linkages with the mainland”.</p>
<p>Some commentators have also raised questions about what Hong Kong’s position will be once China fully opens, making its megacities, such as Shanghai, potential finance centres that will eat into Hong Kong’s market share.</p>
<p>A lot needs to happen before this is the case though. Indeed, from a treasury perspective, Shanghai remains a viable treasury centre location for only a handful of foreign corporations. Hong Kong, therefore, remains just as important, if not more so, than it was 20 years ago.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""china-inc-spreads-its-wings"">China Inc spreads its wings</h3>
<p>The ‘One belt, one road’ initiative has been widely spoken of since it was first unveiled by President Xi Jinping in 2013. As part of the government’s drive to transform its economy from one based on manufacturing to one based on services, the ambitious initiative aims to restore the country’s old land and sea trade routes and to boost economic connectivity between Asia, Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>Four years since its unveiling we are beginning to see evidence of the initiative in action. In 2016 China’s investment around the world in non-financial assets grew almost 50% in 2016 from the previous year to approximately US$175bn. A lot of this money has been invested by private enterprises who are spreading their wings for the first time into international markets.</p>
<p>At present, property and infrastructure projects like toll roads and railways are popular areas of investment, but we are also seeing some consumer facing Chinese companies make headway overseas. Technology companies like Huawei, for instance, are becoming household names in Europe as they penetrate the mobile market.</p>
<p>It is an exciting time for many of these companies moving overseas, but it also creates numerous challenges. This is especially true from a treasury perspective given that companies will now be exposed to multiple markets and currencies. The need to establish a professional treasury department is therefore a must – a lot of domestic companies in China still do not have a standalone treasury function.</p>
<p>From this base, there will be a need to draw up a well-informed and well-defined treasury policy, put in place various cash management structures, understand the regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions and to leverage technology so that processes can be automated and streamlined. This will be a familiar narrative for many of our readers who have set up regional treasury operations in Asia for western multinationals.</p>
<p>Another decision that will have to be made is where to establish a treasury centre to manage the group’s international operations. Unsurprisingly, Hong Kong is a frontrunner here, given its lack of currency controls, low taxation and its dominant role as an offshore RMB centre. Singapore is another strong contender for similar reasons and there is a littering of Chinese regional treasury centres in the city state. Of course, the decision-making process behind where to locate a treasury centre is multi-faceted, and all locations have both positive and negative aspects, meaning that in many respects there is no correct answer.</p>
<h4 id=""more-to-come"">More to come</h4>
<p>What is clear is that we are only at the beginning of the road and there is more to come from China’s OBOR initiative. A lot more will become clear in mid-May when 28 heads of state and many other dignitaries will gather in Beijing to discuss China’s new Silk Road initiative. Treasury Today Asia will stay abreast of these developments and what impact it might have on treasury departments around the world.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""flying-the-flag-for-free-trade"">Flying the flag for free trade</h3>
<p>Thirty years ago, whilst deep in the grip of the Cold War, the United States became the head cheerleader for globalisation, a trend driven largely by capitalist enterprise and free trade. Meanwhile China, on the other hand, was busy staunchly adhering to the communist principles of central control. The country’s economy was still largely closed, with Deng Xiaoping’s ambitious financial reforms and economic overhaul just beginning.</p>
<p>Thirty years on, the picture looks very different, and the world has seemingly turned on its head, particularly during the last three months. Trump has begun putting walls up, ripping up free trade agreements and hammering home an ‘America First’ philosophy, in a direct attack on globalisation. At the same time, China, still governed by the Communist Party, is poised to potentially emerge as a beacon for globalisation and free trade.</p>
<p>This was implied by China’s President Xi Jinping’s impressive speech at Davos, the World Economic Forum’s annual winter jamboree. Although the speech contained no direct reference to then US-President-elect directly, it packed a heavily veiled message. “No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,” Xi said. Whilst acknowledging that economic globalisation had become a “Pandora’s box” for many, he stressed that it is not the cause of the world’s problems.</p>
<h4>Behind the rhetoric</h4>
<p>Despite Xi’s words and obvious intent, the reality is that China still has some way to go before it can develop into a bastion of free trade and enterprise.</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China showed that a growing number of US companies operating in China say they plan to move their business out of the country. The reason for this being that they feel “less welcome” in China than they have previously. The report also found that foreign companies often feel like they are not competing on a level playing field.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, businesses stated that labour costs, regulatory challenges and the threat of intellectual property theft were the main factors driving US businesses to pack up shop in China.</p>
<p>It is not just US companies that have left China. The Japanese electronics company Panasonic, for instance, stopped all its manufacturing of televisions in the country in 2015 after 37 years of operating in China. In November of last year, British high-street retailer Marks &amp; Spencer announced it was closing all its China stores, amid continuing China losses.</p>
<h4>Leading the way?</h4>
<p>Whether China can assume the role of a world leader in globalisation over the next few years remains to be seen. The country, after all, is facing some fundamental challenges. It is also unclear how far Trump will act on his anti-globalisation rhetoric and what damage this may do to the US.</p>
<p>What is certain is that more instability is on the horizon. Businesses are becoming ever more focused on geopolitical risk. In a shifting world there will be opportunities. Being ready to seize them when they arise will be the challenge.</p>

<h3 id=""coming-home-to-roost"">Coming home to roost?</h3>
<p>As 2016 passes we welcome in the Year of the Rooster. 2016 was certainly a year to remember and the reverberations of its events are being felt around the world.</p>
<p>As we enter 2017 with this issue, we begin with a positive bang, looking at the triumphs of 2016’s Adam Smith Awards Asia winners in what was a fantastic year of achievement and excellence. In the busy arena of corporate life, outstanding achievement can often be overlooked. Shifting business needs and an ever-changing and increasingly complex macroeconomic environment mean that once one project finishes another one (or more) begins. The time to celebrate success is short. But in a world defined by increasing demands on the treasury department and limited resources, it is important to shine a spotlight on the achievements of treasury practitioners and how they have not only managed to improve their own department, but also driven value across the entire organisation.</p>
<p>The Treasury Today Asia Adam Smith Awards, proudly supported by ANZ, ensures that extraordinary achievement is celebrated. Now in its third year, the Adam Smith Awards Asia has already established itself as the pre-eminent awards programme in the region and a highly sought after prize. In 2016 we received 203 nominations from companies of different sizes operating in the Asia Pacific region, ranging from multinationals to emerging local champions.</p>
<p>The Overall and Highly Commended Winners highlight the very best and brightest in the industry, and each solution demonstrates a high degree of strategic planning, collaboration and innovation. Our judging panel commented on the calibre of each nomination and the difficultly in selecting the winners. In their view, this is the best set of nominations they have seen to date.</p>
<p>Whatever this year delivers, we wish all our readers a very happy, prosperous and healthy new year and look forward to servicing the community throughout 2017.</p>

<h3 id=""asia-pacific-where-next"">Asia Pacific – where next?</h3>
<p>Whilst Brexit and the US presidential race have been dominating the headlines for most of the year, Asia has, for the most part, been quietly getting on with business. That isn’t to say that the region hasn’t been facing its own challenges, however.</p>
<p>China, for instance, remains a key area of focus and concern for businesses as the country continues to adjust to the “new normal” and morph into a domestic consumption and service-led economy. In this edition’s corporate view, Cefi Chen, Regional Treasury Director, China and Russia at Cummins provides a unique insight into what operating in this environment is like and why it may be time for the corporate treasury profession to make its mark.</p>
<p>Regulatory changes have also continued to provide a headache to treasurers operating in the region this year. From new accounting rules to more robust KYC obligations the rate of regulatory change is not relenting. For treasurers staying abreast of new regulations continues to be a challenge and is an area that has to be approached proactively. We speak to some of the region’s leading practitioners to analyse these develops and find some practical ways for treasurers to stay on top of the regulatory changes.</p>
<p>Both these articles are timely because China and regulation will certainly remain key areas of concern for corporate treasurers as we move into 2017. A keen eye will also be kept on how the region seeks to maintain its position as the growth engine of the global economy in light of subdued external demand and slowing global trade. Treasurers will, of course, also be wise to continue to closely monitor the changing technology landscape. Asia Pacific is a region ripe for digitisation and there are promising signs that treasurers may be reaping the full rewards of technology change very soon.</p>
<h4 id=""congratulations-to-our-winners"">Congratulations to our winners</h4>
<p>The winners of our 2016 Adam Smith Awards Asia, proudly supported by ANZ, have now been selected. The winning solutions reflect the array of talent that the region has to offer and it is not just the big companies that are excelling. Our judging panel commented on the calibre of each nomination and the difficultly in selecting the winners. In their view, this is the best set of nominations we have ever seen.</p>
<p>The full list of Winning and Highly Commended solutions can be viewed on our website. We will also profile all the winners in our 2016 Adam Smith Awards Asia Yearbook, published early next year.</p>
<h4 id=""seasons-greetings"">Season’s greetings</h4>
<p>Treasury Today Asia would like to thank you again for your continued support throughout the year. Next year we will continue to deliver the research, insight, and analysis that you have become accustomed to as well as introducing some new features that are designed to highlight the latest trends impacting the profession.</p>
<p>We wish you a wonderful festive period.</p>

<h3 id=""looking-beyond-bank-deposits"">Looking beyond bank deposits</h3>
<p>For corporates in Asia Pacific, bank deposits still remain the number one short-term investment option by some distance. Yet, this is not typical elsewhere in the world. In Europe and the US, for instance, corporate short-term investment portfolios are more balanced between bank deposits and money market funds (MMFs), and then supplemented with a handful of other investment options.</p>
<p>This is changing, however, as regulation, such as Basel III, is slowly forcing banks to have difficult conversations with their corporate clients about their cash deposits and how these may no longer be welcome in the new regulatory paradigm. At the same time Asia’s asset management industry is gaining momentum as various factors converge, including further market liberalisation and the deepening of the capital markets.</p>
<p>Yet there is still some way to go. Many of the region’s markets are nascent and there are significant hurdles to overcome before they become a mainstay of the investment toolbox. A large number, for instance, still lack a diversified underlying market of high-quality, liquid paper for funds to invest in. The low interest rate environment may prove another issue for the corporate investor and for the future development of MMFs.</p>
<p>In this edition, we explore the short-term investment landscape in Asia Pacific in detail, looking at the growth of the region’s MMFs and how these may develop further in the coming years. We explore other developments across the region, including the regulation impacting the OTC derivatives market and the potential opportunities and challenges for corporates in China, India and ASEAN.</p>
<p>Nominations for our 2016 Treasury Today Asia Adam Smith Awards, proudly supported by ANZ, have now closed. We would like to thank everybody that entered and we look forward to hosting all winners and their partners and providers to the Adam Smith Awards Asia Gala Presentation Lunch at the South Beach in Singapore on Thursday November 17<sup>th</sup>. We will share full details of all winning entries online in early November with additional coverage rolling out in the first quarter of next year.</p>

<p>Our Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Studies have been leading the industry since 2009. Thanks to the 3,500 of you who have taken part, we have built up a very clear picture of the key issues and challenges affecting corporate treasury and, importantly, provided some of the KPI metrics against which you have been able to benchmark yourselves.</p>
<p>We have developed and improved our research with a new, exclusive ‘Voice of Corporate Treasury Study’ for 2016.</p>
<p>We are in a unique position to carry out this research and we sincerely hope you will continue to support us by participating again.</p>
<p>The primary aim is to build up a clear picture of what you are doing now and how you view the outlook for 2017 in the key areas of corporate treasury and finance. This will enable you to see how you compare to your peers and, importantly, deliver clear direction to your banks/service providers on the solutions you need to manage your treasuries more effectively and efficiently in the future.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the study will be to identify the hot issues, key trends, strategies and future solutions you require across the cash, liquidity, working capital management, trade, payments, collections, foreign exchange, funding, investments and cards solutions.</p>
<p>We are conducting the study concurrently across four key regions so we are well-placed to highlight any major regional differences.</p>
<p>So, whether you are based in Bangkok, Brisbane or Beijing and haven’t yet completed the study, please do so now to have your voice heard and to receive your copy of the results when they are published.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support. Your participation will help us to serve you better.</p>

<h3 id=""2016-no-time-for-monkey-business"">2016 – No time for monkey business</h3>
<p>Monday 8<sup>th</sup> February 2016 will see the world’s most populous country celebrate Chinese New Year and welcome in the Year of the Monkey. People born under this sign of the zodiac are believed to be: smart, quick-witted, frank, optimistic, ambitious and adventurous.</p>
<p>Given the economic outlook for 2016, let us hope many of you were indeed born under this zodiac sign. It is perhaps too coincidental that the best-suited careers for such individuals reportedly include accounting, banking and stock market trading.</p>
<p>Without doubt, smartness, ambition and adventure were already abundant in the world of corporate treasury in 2015. Nowhere was this more evident than in the nominations for our Adam Smith Awards Asia – a true barometer of the industry. In November, we celebrated the achievements of no fewer than 40 corporates based in the Asia Pacific region at the Gala Presentation Lunch in Singapore. Some very impressive projects were recognised in the cash, trade, working capital, risk, foreign exchange, liquidity, investments, funding, relationship management and technology categories.</p>
<p>Our Top Treasury Team Asia 2015 winner, Flex Group, stood out for the innovation and teamwork shown, as well as its approach to pushing the boundaries. All these winning solutions are showcased in the Adam Smith Awards Asia Yearbook which accompanies this issue. We hope you find these case studies interesting and informative – and that they inspire and help you to navigate the uncertain environment ahead in 2016.</p>
<p>Our Insight and Analysis article in this issue evaluates the outlook for 2016 and we also incorporate the thoughts and opinions of five senior transaction bankers based in the region in our Talking Treasury Forum Asia. Again, there are some very interesting observations which we hope will help you to plan, prioritise, innovate and be prepared for over the coming year.</p>
<p>Although much activity in the treasury department can be planned for in this way, there are inevitably external forces that cannot be predicted. International relationships, for example, are extremely fragile and this is making the global geopolitical landscape difficult to forecast.</p>
<p>Whilst the future remains uncertain and challenging, there is no better time to embody the personality traits of those born in the Year of the Monkey, aiming to approach 2016 with optimism and ambition. With that in mind, Treasury Today Asia wishes all our readers a very happy and prosperous New Year.</p>

<h3 id=""asean-the-creation-of-a-regional-powerhouse"">ASEAN: the creation of a regional powerhouse</h3>
<p>As our November/December issue hits your desks thoughts are turning to the completion of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the deadline for which is set for 31<sup>st</sup> December. Since its founding in 1967 the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has aimed to foster economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region; to promote regional peace and stability and to provide assistance to each other, amongst other aims.</p>
<p>The diversity of the region, from the lavish wealth of Singapore through to the emerging economies of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, has thrown up various issues for corporates operating across it. Yet it also offers significant opportunity in a market where the certainty that China could deliver endless growth opportunities has diminished and doubt has crept in, this means that corporates are looking elsewhere and attention is moving to ASEAN.</p>
<p>The AEC seeks to transform the region into a place of free movement of goods, services, investment, skilled labour and a more free flow of capital. Signed by all ASEAN members back in 2007, the charter set out the goal of regional economic integration by 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015 and this could change everything for this region as the removal of restrictions on trade, investment, people and capital flows provide huge opportunities for the countries, the corporates operating in them and the banks lending to them.</p>
<p>It must be noted however that for now big challenges for corporates still remain. For instance, cash remains non-transferable, both in and out in a number of countries, regulation remains diverse and complex, and a lack of harmonisation in technological systems is making integration of these challenging.</p>
<p>Despite this, the momentum is clearly growing around the AEC, whether the whole of ASEAN can exceed the sum of its parts remains to be seen. However, no matter how the AEC develops, creating a dialogue around harmonising the region can only lead to good things and we look forward to see what happens after 31<sup>st</sup> December deadline passes. For a more in depth view of ASEAN please refer to our <a href=""/2015/11/asean-a-game-changer-ttktr"">Know the Region section</a>.</p>
<h3>Celebrating success</h3>
<p>On 12<sup>th</sup> November our Adam Smith Awards Asia Gala Presentation Lunch was held in Singapore at the Four Seasons Hotel. We would like to congratulate all this year’s Overall Winners and Highly Commended Winners and to thank everybody who submitted. The Adam Smith Awards Asia have become the benchmark for industry excellence in the Asia Pacific region and we are delighted to celebrate the accomplishments, creativity, determination and resilience in treasury transformation and growth.</p>
<h3>The future of treasury</h3>
<p>Treasury Today Asia was delighted to hold our first Talking Treasury Forum in the region at Sibos this year. The forum brought together a number of the region’s most senior transaction bankers to discuss the major trends in cash management and what corporate treasurers should be focusing on in the coming years. It is a must read for all corporate treasurers operating in the region and will be featured in full in the January/February issue of Treasury Today Asia.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id=""we-live-in-volatile-times"">We live in volatile times</h3>
<p>As we head to Singapore for SIBOS 2015, the front pages of the financial press are still dominated by China’s stock market rout and the impact of the country’s decision, on 11<sup>th</sup> August, to devalue the renminbi by 2%. The statistics paint a sorry picture: since June 2015, China’s equity markets have dropped by almost 40% and China’s foreign currency reserves shrunk by $93.9bn at the end of August – the largest monthly fall ever recorded.</p>
<p>Many emerging market currencies have depreciated off the back of China’s policy regime shift, with the Indian rupee weakening by more than 4.2% against the US dollar during August, the Russian rouble down by over 8.5%, and the Brazilian real weakened by 10.7%. Elsewhere, the Indonesian rupiah has lost 14% against the dollar during the course of 2015, with the Thai baht down 8% over the same period. Whilst in Malaysia, the ringgit recently hit a 17-year low.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, rumours of a ‘currency war’ are rife. Rather than this being seen as a welcome depreciation that will boost exports, analysts are now firmly viewing this as volatility that needs to be stabilised. All eyes are on the central banks in Asia as they work to defend their respective currencies, and seriously reconsider interest rate moves. The effect on these nations’ growth assumptions is obvious, and already the downwards revisions are coming in.</p>
<p>There are clear red flags here for corporates around revisiting business models and strategies, and for treasurers, hedging policies and practices should be scrutinised. For some companies, the impact runs much deeper. Spare a thought for ASEAN companies, for instance, who have taken on increasing amounts of foreign-currency debt in recent years.</p>
<p>According to Standard &amp; Poor’s’ review of credit quality among 100 of the largest companies in the region, currency depreciation has, on aggregate, “added the equivalent of close to $30bn in the local currency debt load of the largest companies in ASEAN since 2010.” With a refinancing wall looming for many ASEAN corporates in 2017, the debt challenges only look set to get tougher.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of this year should act as a catalyst for growth. Nevertheless, this is very much a long-term aspiration. In the near-term, with currency market volatility continuing, treasurers would do well to engage closely with their strategic business partners, both within the organisation and externally.</p>

<h3 id=""stabilising-chinas-stock-markets"">Stabilising China’s stock markets</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, investors across the globe are watching the Greek debt crisis unfold. Yet China is experiencing a crisis of its own, with the Shanghai and Shenzen Indices having lost almost a third of their value since the highs set on 12<sup>th</sup> June this year.</p>
<p>In order to help prevent the country’s stock markets from plummeting further, and to prop up investor confidence, the Chinese authorities decided in early July to suspend initial public offerings (IPOs). This is not a new tactic from Chinese officials, as a similar move was seen in 2012, but this time around, the ban is expected to cover a far larger pipeline of deals. In fact, reports suggest that as many as 28 IPOs that were due to go ahead on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have now been (voluntarily) suspended.</p>
<p>The hope is obviously that such a move will help preserve liquidity, as well as stabilising the markets by encouraging investors to get behind stocks that are already listed. What is not yet clear is how long the IPO ban is set to last. Judging from past experience, it could remain in place for over a year, or as little as three months.</p>
<p>Alongside this IPO suspension, Chinese officials have also moved to create a so-called ‘market stabilisation fund’ – which is the first of its kind in the country’s history. This will be funded in part by the top brokerages in China, who have reportedly pledged to buy at least RMB 120bn ($19.3bn) of shares between them. In a separate move, 25 Chinese mutual funds have also announced that they will invest a portion of their capital (amount not yet specified) into stocks in order to help reverse the downward trend.</p>
<p>Whilst the Chinese authorities appear to be doing all they can to help turn the situation around – these latest measures come in addition to an earlier interest rate cut, a relaxation of margin-lending rules and extra bank liquidity – many analysts believe the moves are too short term in their outlook and could seriously impact the long-term health of the country’s stock markets. That said, Beijing is very much stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to do whatever it takes to restore confidence before other parts of the Chinese economy are impacted.</p>

<h3 id=""a-step-in-the-right-direction"">A step in the right direction</h3>
<p>All eyes are on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as the ten-member bloc continues to work towards the creation of a single market. Designed to allow a free flow of goods, services, and investments, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) should also allow companies based in ASEAN to secure better access to raw materials, and to leverage a freer flow of capital and labour. In fact, a report released by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Asian Development Bank last year suggested that the AEC could create 14 million new jobs and see the region’s annual growth rise by 7.1% over the next decade.</p>
<p>In an effort to meet the 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015 deadline that has been set for the launch of the AEC, ASEAN finance ministers and central bank governors have recently signed a landmark agreement to allow member nations’ banks to operate in each other’s markets. They will also be accorded flexibilities similar to those of domestic banks in the host country.</p>
<p>The ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF), as the agreement is known, took five years to prepare and looks set to deliver numerous benefits, including greater access to secure funding across the region, and help to stem hot money inflows. Of course, as ASEAN moves closer to the realisation of the AEC, ABIF will also help to accelerate the pace of regional financial integration and boost cross-border trade and investment.</p>
<p>Before any ASEAN bank can begin to operate in another member’s jurisdiction, regulators from both countries must agree on a set of rules that will bind the institution – which, if approved, will be known as a ‘qualified ASEAN bank’. The aim of the collective finance ministers is to have at least one QAB up and running by 2018.</p>
<p>Talk of a single currency across the bloc surfaced again on the back of the ABIF, but has since been played down. In the words of Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Malaysian Central Bank: “We are too diverse and we don’t have the preconditions for a single currency. We are going to approach it differently via financial integration to achieve the same objectives of greater growth, collectively.”</p>
<p>And whilst full financial and economic ASEAN integration by the end of the year might be a stretch, for now, the ABIF represents an important step in the right direction.</p>

<h3 id=""year-of-the-ram-economic-impact"">Year of the Ram: economic impact</h3>
<p>As the pivotal holiday in the world’s largest economy and most populous country, Chinese New Year has an increasingly large impact on corporates across the globe. Prompting the most significant mass migration of people on the planet, the Spring Festival leaves factories empty and sends ripples through supply chains the world over. It also leaves the financial markets quiet, not least because the majority of indices in the Asia region shut for at least a day to mark the event.</p>
<p>We are now entering the Year of the Ram (or goat, or sheep – there is some debate around the animal represented in the Chinese imagery) and people born under this sign of the zodiac are said to be, among other things, calm and stable. They are also said to enjoy good health. Many investors find that they too enjoy good financial health under this sign, as the Year of the Ram has traditionally seen some strong returns.</p>
<p>What’s different about this Chinese New Year, however, is that there are serious question marks hanging over the country’s future growth rate. As we know, 2014 saw GDP growth cool to 7.4%. Although impressive when contrasted against European and US figures, this was the slowest rate of growth that China had witnessed in almost a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>But President Xi Jinping has clearly indicated that analysts should get used to this level of growth as the ‘new normal’. His message is that necessary structural changes taking place in the economy will keep growth below the stellar levels of yesteryear, but will also help to avoid bust and boom cycles. One such change is that the service sector has become increasingly important as an economic driver, and according to KPMG, accounted for 48.2% of China’s economic output in 2014. What this means, of course, is that a shift is taking place away from manufacturing, construction and agriculture.</p>
<p>For countries supplying raw materials to China, in particular Australia, the implications of these changes are significant. And for those companies using China as a cheap manufacturing base, it may soon be time to consider whether other locations in the APAC region now offer the same benefits that China did a decade ago.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, China’s outward direct investment (ODI) is now rivalling foreign direct investment (FDI) – not because FDI is falling, but because more and more Chinese companies recognise that to become increasingly competitive, overseas investment is critical. Not only are they accessing overseas markets, technology and brands; they are also making the most of human capital in these new markets to help them to upgrade and transform their businesses. In short, Chinese companies are adapting to the ‘new normal’ in the best way they know how: innovation.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that whilst it might seem to the outside world that China is slowing down, in fact the country is taking time to stabilise and to act on strategies that will lead to sustainable growth in the future. Like those born in the Year of the Ram, calm and stable is the name of the game.</p>

<h3 id=""mobilising-the-apac-markets"">Mobilising the APAC markets</h3>
<p>The ascent of mobile is arguably the greatest innovation that the payments industry has seen in recent memory. Nowhere does the mobile revolution hold more promise than in Asia. After all, the region accounts for over half of the world’s mobile devices. There is also a significant move towards m-commerce in APAC, with over 50% of all Asia-based online transactions in 2015 set to be made by mobile, according to Criteo.</p>
<p>Yet, as we frequently see in the region, there is great disparity between individual nations. This is not only as a result of varying levels of smartphone penetration, but also because of payment infrastructure challenges in rapidly growing markets, as well as certain cultural barriers.</p>
<p>Japan and South Korea are widely recognised as advanced markets for mobile shopping with Criteo reporting that over 45% of online retail transactions are made via mobile devices. In fact, Japanese e-commerce sites have mobile conversion rates that double those seen in the US. Australia is another mobile leader in the region, with impressive uptake of contactless payments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and China – although possessing an infrastructure that is more than capable of supporting mobile payments – have yet to encourage widespread adoption. Others, such as Malaysia, remain largely cash-based societies.</p>
<p>While governments, national payments associations and internet providers are working furiously to increase mobile adoption, more must be done by banks and treasurers too. According to EY’s recent global commercial banking survey, almost 70% of banks’ commercial customers in Asia are using mobile banking channels each week. But when asked about the reasons for not using online and mobile channels more often, the most commonly cited obstacle in the region was security. This was closely followed by slow speed and poor functionality. In short, banks have some work to do in 2015 and beyond to provide security enhancements around their mobile solutions, as well as improved user experience.</p>
<p>Treasurers, on the other hand, should take the time to consider how mobile might provide growth and efficiency opportunities for their business. Mobile is not just for banking on the go, or a smart solution for merchants to improve consumer interaction. It can ultimately assist in improving your working capital metrics, whilst presenting many opportunities for cost-cutting too. So, in an ever-competitive market, mobile is surely worth a second look.</p>

<h3 id=""leveraging-change"">Leveraging change</h3>
<p>Throughout 2014, there have been a number of major economic, infrastructural and political developments in countries across the Asia-Pacific region. These changes have both challenged treasurers and created opportunities for innovation and efficiency.</p>
<p>Inevitably, a large degree of focus has been on slowing GDP growth in China. Although the figures still remain impressive compared with developing markets (7.4% as forecasted by the World Bank) some are questioning whether the slowing economy will distract Chinese officials from the reform agenda. Nevertheless, a significant amount of progress towards renminbi internationalisation has been achieved this year, with Beijing appointing three new clearing banks in London, Frankfurt and Seoul. Corporate activity onshore has also been liberalised with companies now able to purchase renminbi-based swaps and options when looking to hedge risk. The Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) continues to be a hot, although somewhat divisive, topic and 2015 is sure to see further innovative cash management solutions coming out of the SFTZ.</p>
<p>Away from China, other APAC economies have also witnessed slowing growth, not least India. Political uncertainty has been an additional feature of 2014, with a military coup in Thailand and much controversy over the elections in India.</p>
<p>In more positive news, this year has also seen one of the world’s most closed countries take a step onto the international stage, with Myanmar making significant efforts to attract foreign business to the country and issuing banking licences to a number of international banks, which is good news for corporates. Elsewhere, there has been a great deal of progress in the APAC payments space. Singapore, for example, launched its Immediate Payments G3 scheme in March, while in Australia, faster payments will soon be ushered in, as we explain in this Issue’s Country Focus article.</p>
<p>Of course, regulation remains a key theme and treasurers must keep an eye on changes to derivatives regulation in the coming months. One of the main challenges here is that each country in the region is taking its own approach to implementing derivatives reform – there is no co-ordinated, integrated approach – meaning that there is no silver bullet for corporates. Similarly, integration challenges still exist in the ASEAN region. Although progress is (slowly) being made towards the establishment of an ASEAN Economic Community, it remains to be seen whether the region will meet its deadline of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015.</p>
<p>Finally, it is expected that global trade will remain sluggish in 2015. This will undoubtedly affect the growth of economies in the region and impact the strategies that corporates operating there must adopt in order to thrive. Against this backdrop, and alongside their business-as-usual duties, treasurers must aim to be nimble enough to take advantage of appropriate efficiency or optimisation opportunities arising from challenges and change. Working closely with industry bodies and business partners will be invaluable here, as will knowledge sharing among peers. Treasury Today Asia will continue to support you throughout 2015, reporting on the latest industry developments and analysing the issues that matter to you.</p>

<h3 id=""now-thats-an-option"">Now that’s an option</h3>
<p>In August the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) relaxed the rules surrounding the use of options in the onshore market. The new rules allow domestic corporates to purchase renminbi-based swaps and options – increasing the range of risk management tools at their disposal.</p>
<p>Previously, corporates had limited choices around how to hedge the risks posed by currency volatility – namely forwards and buy options. In addition, the cost of these vanilla instruments often outweighed the rewards. This welcome relaxation of the rules will see corporates trading more exotic structures, although they will still need to adhere to certain guidelines.</p>
<p>To help corporates understand the impact of the new changes, Guan Tao, Director of the Balance of Payments Department at SAFE offered the following tips: “First, enterprises should adapt to the new normal of bi-directional fluctuations of the RMB exchange rate by changing their linear and unilateral thinking, shifting from merely managing risks associated with a unilateral RMB appreciation to comprehensively managing risks from the RMB bi-directional fluctuations, and focus on their main business by changing the uncertainties of bi-directional fluctuations into certainties through hedging activities.</p>
<p>“Second, enterprises should understand their deals and not make unfamiliar deals. They should assess the value of derivatives and determine the level of risk limitations before conducting deals. Third, the financial departments of enterprises should not function as profit centres but should regard derivative transactions as a tool to lock up risks, not a tool to make profits. Fourth, enterprises should properly conduct hedging activities as excessive hedging is a form of speculation and can be risky,” noted Tao.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the onshore options market is still very much in its infancy, and that the full impact and scope of the changes will take time to be seen, the initial reaction has been broadly positive. The move is seen as another step in the right direction – opening up the Chinese market yet further and offering corporates in the country more choice when it comes to hedging.</p>
<p><em>Treasury Today Asia will be closely monitoring the impact of the changes and will report on these in more detail over the coming months.</em></p>

<h3 id=""nurturing-human-capital"">Nurturing human capital</h3>
<p>The job of the treasurer is never just about numbers. It’s a multi-faceted role that, today more than ever, demands an increasing level of emotional intelligence. Not only must treasurers use their persuasive abilities to help secure budget for technology investment, but they are expected to interface with the C-suite on a regular basis and embrace the culture of the corporation in which they operate, whilst also selecting and retaining the best possible treasury team.</p>
<p>In the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, the war for treasury talent has always been fierce. But as some of the biggest APAC economies cool off – China being front of mind – and salaries in the region continue to rise, companies of all sizes are being put under increasing pressure to deliver strong revenue growth and profitability. With high staff turnover a well-recognised feature of the APAC recruitment market, and recent statistics indicating that the financial cost of replacing a key employee can be as much as twice their annual salary, it’s little surprise that many companies in the region are therefore taking the time to redevelop their talent strategies.</p>
<p>More than attracting new talent, corporates are looking to identify innovative yet sustainable ways to both reward and retain skilled employees. Nowhere is this kind of initiative more important than the treasury department. Professionally qualified personnel are hard to come by – and a good team really can be a treasurer’s best tool.</p>
<p>One interesting trend in this respect is the creation of training institutes or ‘talent academies’ by corporates and banks across the APAC region. Samsung Electronics and Unilever are two very recognisable names that have invested heavily in such initiatives. And in March 2014, BNP Paribas actually opened a talent hub on a large ‘Campus’ in Singapore. According to the bank, the centre “is a place for sharing, reflection and collective learning, fostering the growth and development of all group employees.”</p>
<p>Naturally not every company will have this level of resources to invest in talent, but this certainly highlights the value that companies are placing on their human capital today. So, the next time you revisit your treasury function’s KPIs, spare a thought for the contribution that people make to overall performance.</p>

<p>Whilst the treasury profession remains largely male-dominated, there are remarkable women enjoying remarkable careers in the treasury sphere, not least in the Asia Pacific region. At Treasury Today, we believe that it is important to recognise female innovators in the corporate treasury profession, which is why we founded the Women in Treasury (WiT) initiative. It aims to bring female treasury practitioners together to share their experiences, challenges, successes and failures, as an inspiration for all operating in this field.</p>
<p>Following the resounding success of the inaugural Women in Treasury Forum in London last October, the first Women in Treasury Asia Forum takes place on <strong>Thursday 8<sup>th</sup> May 2014</strong> at Raffles Hotel in Singapore. The Forum will commence at 12 noon with registration and a drinks reception, during which Angela Berry, Publisher of Treasury Today will present a summary of the key findings of our Women in Treasury Study. This will give you the opportunity to discover how female treasurers’ job prospects and pay compare to those of their male counterparts – and what the impact of having a family is on a treasurer’s career path.</p>
<p>We will then be holding a panel discussion moderated by Eleanor Hill, Editorial Director, Treasury Today Asia, followed by an open question and answer session. Areas of discussion will include the importance of making your voice heard within the organisation, as well as the role of mentors in promoting gender equality. This event will provide the rare chance for women in our industry to network, share their experiences and hear their peers discuss the key issues affecting their work within treasury.</p>
<p>A growing number of women are finding their voices and inspiring others to achieve progress – you can be one of them. If you are interested in attending the event, please contact our Head of Events, Lisa Bigley, <a href=""mailto:lisa.bigley@treasurytoday.com"">lisa.bigley@treasurytoday.com</a>, telephone: +44 (0)13 0462 9016.</p>
<p>In addition to the annual Women in Treasury Forum, we also run frequent Women in Treasury articles within Treasury Today Asia. If you would like to be profiled, or have a female treasury professional in mind that has inspired you in your career, please let us know by emailing <a href=""mailto:editorial@treasurytoday.com"">editorial@treasurytoday.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""what-are-we-offering-you-in-2014"">What are we offering you in 2014?</h3>
<p>Our job is to research, analyse and report on what is going on in corporate treasury and finance in Asia and elsewhere in the world. This issue reflects that and is a mix of basic, yet crucial, treasury and cash management content coupled with some specific pieces as well as news of our new initiatives in the region.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) is particularly topical right now and we have some interesting contributions from several industry experts. We explore Vietnam in our Country Focus. Our Insight &amp; Analysis addresses the best way to raise the profile of treasury at Board level and in Corporate Finance we investigate best practices in refinancing; definitely worth reading if you are considering refinancing. Our Risk Management focus this issue is on mitigating FX volatility; particularly topical of late especially where some of the emerging markets currencies are concerned. Our ‘Back to Basics’ feature looks at a subject on the agenda of every treasurer; cash flow forecasting and offers ten top tips to get better forecasting.</p>
<p>It also gives us great pleasure to announce our industry recognised Adam Smith Awards are coming to Asia in 2014. These Awards recognise corporates who are demonstrating best practice in treasury and finance. Nominations don’t open until June but we want to give you all plenty of notice so you can think about submitting your entries. There are 15 categories in total so you should find at least one category that covers the project you have been working on. In what will be the Chinese Year of the Horse, what better way to recognise talent and achievement than nominating yourself for an award?</p>
<p>Finally we are organising the first of our Women in Treasury Forums in May at Raffles in Singapore. This follows the inaugural Forum at the Four Seasons in London last year which was attended by over 150 women from around Europe. We will be sharing the results of our Women in Treasury Study and hearing thoughts from several senior professional women. More details to follow but put the date in your diary now – 8<sup>th</sup> May 2014.</p>
<p>We look forward to a busy and exciting 2014. If you have any comments or suggestions on what we are doing please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<h3 id=""addressing-the-issues"">Addressing the issues</h3>
<p>India is the main focus of this edition of Treasury Today Asia. 2013 has not been kind to the tenth largest economy by nominal GDP and member of the exclusive BRIC circle. The Federal Reserve’s hint at unwinding quantitative easing (QE) early in the year caused the Indian rupee to fluctuate wildly; it hit an all-time low against the US dollar in August. This issue contains a special report on the causes and consequences of the rupee volatility, including an interview with the treasury team at Larsen &amp; Toubro, a technology, engineering, construction and manufacturing company based in Mumbai.</p>
<p>After a protracted rocky patch, the Indian government stepped in to contain imports and placed restrictions on importing gold – both of which are methods to help narrow the country’s current account deficit. And its commitment to address structural issues is strong: in October, Indian Finance Minister Shri Chidambaram stated that the government was committed to the path of fiscal consolidation and aimed to bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% by 2016 to 2017.</p>
<p>Encouragingly, the trade deficit has narrowed in recent months, led by slower domestic demand, a weaker currency and policy steps to curb imports. These factors should help narrow the current account deficit this and next year. According to HSBC Global Research, it is important for the government to keep macroeconomic policies tight and step up the implementation of structural reform to further reduce vulnerabilities ahead of Fed tapering and make the current account deficit sustainable over the medium term.</p>
<p>In the Corporate View, Gunjan Dhawan, Treasurer at Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Private Limited, India, provides insight into the quick-changing Indian environment, as well as imparting his knowledge with regards to rolling out innovative cash, supply chain finance and risk management solutions. He is undoubtedly one of the new breed of corporate treasurers in India that are developing a more strategic and global approach to treasury.</p>

<h3 id=""the-sibos-jamboree-heads-for-dubai"">The Sibos jamboree heads for Dubai</h3>
<p>Sibos is the annual banking conference organised by SWIFT, the bank owned provider of secure financial messaging services. Sibos has become the ‘must-attend’ conference for bankers, technology suppliers and consultants who are involved in all aspects of the transactional banking business. The conference is held in different parts of the world each year and there are 6,000+ attendees most years. What do they all do? Well, there are some serious debates at Sibos and informative conference sessions but it is also a big party as banking friends get together and the booze flows from the stands.</p>
<p>The real world also intrudes. Those that attended Sibos in Vienna five years ago will always remember ‘Sibos Monday’ as attendees learnt of the demise of Lehman Brothers. The lasting and stark image of that event is of massive stands empty of content and people, as well as disappearing keynote speakers.</p>
<p>Last year the empty stand spaces at Sibos in Osaka, Japan reflected a different reality. The Chinese banks, who have had a growing presence at Sibos in recent years, all withdrew from the conference in Osaka over the dispute with Japan over the sovereignty of eight uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>Nonetheless SWIFT claims to have had 6,250 attendees in Osaka, the largest ever attendance in Asia Pacific. Those that were there are sceptical as to whether they had all turned up but Asia Pacific is still predicted to supply 45% of this year’s attendees. This is a clear sign of the growing importance of SWIFT in the region and just as importantly of this region to SWIFT. EMEA is next in significance with 42%.</p>
<p>It is the ME bit of EMEA that Sibos is visiting this year, with the conference going to the Middle East for the first time. It will be interesting to see attendance levels in this new location. SWIFT expects more than 6,000 attendees including a few corporate treasurers to descend on Dubai from 16<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> September.</p>
<p>To attract corporates Sibos has, for the sixth consecutive year, included a dedicated two-day Corporate Forum as part of its programme, under the main theme of “accelerating innovation in treasury and trade”. Anita Prasad, General Manager – Treasury at Microsoft and Alawi Al-Shurafa, Treasurer at Saudi Chevron, will join the opening panel to discuss best practice in centralising treasury functions and there are a few other corporate speakers over the following two days. But Sibos is not really a corporate forum and the corporate attendees will typically be from big companies with the larger and more complex transactional banking requirements who use SWIFT messaging to communicate with their banks.</p>
<p>Sibos is as much about the chats outside the formal sessions as it is about the agenda topics. The conference attracts the main decision-makers in banking and payments. In many ways, that is the secret to Sibos’ continuing success – as a networking event for the banking industry, it is unrivalled, allowing participants to meet the people they need to in order to do business.</p>
<p>Treasury Today will be in Dubai, reporting on the conference and uncovering what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h3 id=""welcome-to-the-fourth-edition-of-treasury-today-asia"">Welcome to the fourth edition of Treasury Today Asia</h3>
<p>In this issue, we explore the global approach to supply chain finance (SCF). Different markets approach the issues surrounding settlement differently, with India and China noted as leading regions with the greatest SCF market potential. The rapid growth that many Asian companies are experiencing is driving a need to establish the financial infrastructure to support it.</p>
<p>Our Country Focus is Indonesia. Indonesia’s rapid growth is fuelled by its manufacturing and exports industries. This year has, and will continue to, see changes in the country’s regulatory environment to ensure that the growth it represents filters down to its population. With a growing, yet complex, consumer market we look at the opportunities and difficulties this market represents.</p>
<h3>Adam Smith Awards</h3>
<p>The 2013 Adam Smith Awards gala event, sponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, was held in London in late June. Now in its sixth year, we were delighted to welcome more than 200 guests, including all our winners and highly commended recipients, to what is the largest corporate treasury awards programme in the world. This year saw the introduction of our Asia Pacific Regional Award for Best Practice. We were honoured to welcome to the event the Winner – Ping Chen of Pfizer and both Deepak Kini of PepsiCo India Holdings and Linda Zhang of Honeywell who were both awarded Highly Commended. We are showcasing all three case studies in this issue.</p>
<h3>Corporate Treasury Benchmarking</h3>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> July saw the launch of our annual Asia Pacific Benchmarking Study for 2013. We would encourage all of our corporate readers based in, or with responsibilities for, the Asia Pacific region to take part. Only those corporates participating in the study will receive a confidential report summarising the headline findings.</p>
<h3>Women in Treasury</h3>
<p>In this edition of Treasury Today Asia our Women in Treasury series profiles Lelaina Lim, Chief Financing Officer from Royal Sporting House. We continue to push forward our Women in Treasury initiative which speaks of the need for women to become more visible in their professional roles both within and outside of their organisations. If you are a woman working in the corporate treasury space please make sure your views are included in our Women in Treasury Study which will chart the treasury profession’s path to diversity. The results of this study will be available in October and we look forward to sharing them with you all then. To learn more and to participate in the study go to <a href=""/women-in-treasury"">treasurytoday.com/women-in-treasury</a></p>

<h3 id=""welcome-to-the-third-edition-of-treasury-today-asia"">Welcome to the third edition of Treasury Today Asia</h3>
<p>Singapore is our Country Focus in this month’s edition. Singapore has experienced a meteoric rise following its independence from Malaysia in the mid-1960s. The following five decades can be characterised by a steady growth and influx of foreign talent and investment as Singapore has swelled to become one of the world’s most developed countries. As the government pushes for a curb in foreign workforce growth and an increase in productivity, we bring you the latest insight on Singapore’s future and what that means for treasurers in the region.</p>
<p>Singapore is the region’s most popular location for establishing a regional treasury centre (RTC). In this issue we analyse the trends surrounding Asian multinationals increasingly beginning to establish RTCs. Although historically lagging behind their Western contemporaries, is the tide beginning to turn?</p>
<p>Nominations for this year’s Adam Smith Awards have now closed. We were delighted and overwhelmed by the quantity and calibre of nominations for our new category of Asia Pacific Regional Award for Best Practice. We look forward to celebrating the successes of all our winners in June at the Adam Smith Awards Lunch in London and we would like to thank all those who submitted.
