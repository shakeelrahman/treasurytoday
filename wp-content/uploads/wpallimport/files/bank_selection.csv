<p><em>Nothing lasts forever, and the same is true of banking relationships. With the COVID-19 pandemic putting both corporates and banks under immense pressure, whilst also prompting the development of new, digital opportunities, we evaluate how the process of switching banks might change – and whether those changes will benefit the treasurer.</em></p>

<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>For a treasurer, changing banks can be a daunting prospect. The idea of switching over sometimes hundreds of accounts is off-putting enough that many simply choose not to do it. The 2019 PwC report, Digital Treasury – It takes two to tango, found that nearly one-third of respondents only review their core banking relationships on an ad-hoc basis, or not at all – although 7% review core banks on a monthly basis, 9% do so quarterly, and 48% annually. The report issues a call to action for treasurers to conduct “systematic, regularly scheduled reviews” of bank relationships, adding that such reviews should emphasise both quantitative and qualitative elements.</p>
<p>As various technologies are introduced to automate manual processes and centralise treasury systems, banks are having to adapt to keep themselves and the products they offer ahead of the curve and relevant to the modern treasurer. The 2019 CGI Transaction Banking Survey found that client satisfaction is at an all-time low, with just 49.5% of respondents rating the service they receive as a ‘4’ or ‘5’ on a five-point scale (‘1’ is not at all satisfied and ‘5’ is very satisfied) – a 6.5% decline from 2018.</p>
<p>The report also found that 46.3% of respondents cited ‘improving digital customer experience/service’ as a driver behind the review of banking relationships. Meanwhile, when establishing a banking relationship, ‘bank continually improving their products and services and providing innovation ideas’ and ‘bank conforms to industry standards, systems and processes’ were the joint highest rated as ‘very important’ or ‘quite important’ factors considered – each at 84%.</p>
<h4 id=""the-drive-for-digital"">The drive for digital</h4>
<p>The social distancing measures forced upon everyone by the COVID-19 pandemic have had the unexpected benefit of also forcing digital solutions on those who were previously reluctant. This has particularly been seen in the banking sector, explains Etosha Thurman, Head of Treasury Management Sales and Client Engagement at Capital One. “There have been many clients that have been very resistant to moving forward with digital processes, but in this ‘new normal’, many are asking how they can move away from paper and cheques, and leverage digital solutions instead,” she says.</p>
<p>Likewise, a key challenge for corporate treasurers that became evident at the beginning of the pandemic was the frequent need for wet signatures, says Brice Zimmerman, Global Head Treasury at Alcon. He adds that banks that offered flexibility in this area have had a clear advantage. Treasury is more likely to steer towards banks that make account opening, KYC and deposit confirmations digitally easier, than those who continue to insist on wet signature, postal/courier services and time delays while documents are checked and verified.</p>
<p>Thurman is of a similar view, and notes that the importance of IT support when tackling this manual and paper-based challenge is often underestimated. “I think that’s because historically, IT has not been a function that people associate with treasury, as many of the processes are manual and paper-based,” she explains. But in this day and age, when most best in class treasury management solutions and processes are digital, involving IT is essential.</p>
<p>Banks are also facing similar challenges when onboarding new clients: gaining and verifying client signatures, and coordinating document requirements between different functions for due diligence processes, is a struggle when both parties are no longer centrally located. However, for treasurers, Thurman says they shouldn’t be left alone by their banks to struggle with this. “For us, it’s important to not just focus on getting solutions out there, but to really look at the full client experience, which includes the onboarding effort.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-cost-of-switching"">The cost of switching</h4>
<p>For Carrie Reyna, Director, Global Treasury Operations at Sysco Corporation, a key thing that treasurers should keep in mind when changing banks is the cost of doing so. “Transition costs can be high or low, depending on your processes,” she explains. “While it may not be intuitive, the more automated your processes, the higher the transition costs may be.” Indeed, whilst the long-term benefits of automation can be substantial, it can significantly increase the costs associated with moving business to a new banking partner.</p>
<p>She gives bank statements as an example. If a treasury accesses its bank statements manually – for example, one person in the team logs into a bank’s portal, accesses the statements and distributes them to the required parties – the transition cost comes only from establishing access to the new bank’s online portal for the appropriate team member. However, if bank statements are received through SWIFT for Corporates, with a service bureau automatically distributing the files to multiple systems, the transitions costs can be significantly higher. This is because multiple teams and third parties will be needed to perform configuration and testing activities to convert from one system to another.</p>
<p>Zimmerman is of a similar view, and notes that this consideration for systems integration is a necessity when considering changing banks. “Treasurers should ensure that sufficient internal resources are available for the projects, as banks tend to jump at the new opportunities with large project teams to support,” he says. Indeed, treasury teams tend to be on the smaller side, and so can struggle to match the size of team needed and supplied by the bank.</p>
<h4 id=""switching-during-a-pandemic"">Switching during a pandemic</h4>
<p>A global pandemic isn’t an ideal time for most things, and as Zimmerman points out, that includes switching banks. “During the worst period of the pandemic, I definitely would not have recommended to change banks,” he says, noting that organisations were rightly focusing their attention on ensuring ‘normal’ operations and having sufficient liquidity. “Adding the complexity that comes from changing banks would not have been advisable,” he says.</p>
<p>However, Zimmerman also notes that the picture will be different when things settle down post-pandemic: changing banks can bring new ways of working, with opportunities to improve and automate internal processes and bring additional efficiencies.</p>
<p>Thurman, likewise, explains that the pandemic has presented an opportunity for companies to reassess their account and operational structures. With many companies operating outside of their usual structure anyway, she says the opportunity has arisen to “challenge the status quo” and also to evaluate which bank can best move the company forward. “It gives an opportunity to simplify treasury management, to reconsider the mix of payment channels,” she adds.</p>
<p>The re-evaluation of payment channels is something that Reyna is also optimistic about. “Customers and vendors are more willing to discuss electronic and automated payment methods,” she says, adding that payment types that require employees to be in an office setting or use specialised equipment are being reconsidered for safety reasons. “Electronic payment methods can be executed in remote locations, are usually less expensive, and the settlement timing is easier to predict,” she points out.</p>
<p>Additionally, automatically scheduled electronic payments can save time related to tracking down delinquent invoices, increase the accuracy of cash forecasting and improve working capital. “As you explore these options, you may discover that new banking partners are better suited to executing automated electronic payment transactions that integrate well with your existing systems,” she adds.</p>
<h4 id=""utilise-the-rfp"">Utilise the RFP</h4>
<p>When it comes to choosing a new bank, the value of a formal request for proposal (RFP) cannot be underestimated. Reyna supports this and says that if a bank that takes the time to answer a RFP thoughtfully and discuss the requirements, it could be a good indicator of a positive long-term relationship. “A RFP also provides to you, in writing, what the bank is willing to offer. If the bank fails to deliver on the promises they made in the RFP, you have a written document you can reference in your negotiations to resolve the issues or to gain concessions,” she adds.</p>
<p>Similarly, Zimmerman says it’s important to choose a bank with a local presence in the necessary markets. “Local presence should always be the preferred option, as working with partner banks adds complexity in the onboarding processes and in the daily interactions,” he says. Additionally, treasurers should consider and evaluate all services on offer by the bank, even if they will not be used immediately, he adds.</p>
<p>For Thurman, the banks’ perspective should be similar. Banks should always keep a focus on helping their corporate clients get what they need out of the banking relationship. “We’re not just here to sell a solution, we’re here to be part of that solution,” she says.</p>
<h4 id=""insider-top-tops"">Insider top tips</h4>
<p>Offering a few top tips from a banking perspective, Thurman begins with one previously mentioned: leveraging IT as a key partner to help manoeuvre the journey to digital treasury management. “Even if you’re not ready today, have an IT perspective for what you can do in a technology sense to enhance your cash management processes, even if it’s just a foundational understanding,” she says, explaining that this will pave the way for further digital growth and transformation.</p>
<p>Keeping with the theme of partners, she says it’s also necessary to engage internal stakeholders “early and often”. One of the things she thinks is always underappreciated is the breadth and scope of treasury management. “What treasury does touches many teams, so they need to actively engage and create a partnership with those key internal stakeholders.” Thurman believes this will not only make the switch more efficient and effective, but also yield more robust conversations, more best in class practices and will ultimately accelerate the achievement of the cash management, risk management and payables management outcomes that the business is looking for.</p>
<h4 id=""keeping-the-change"">Keeping the change</h4>
<p>When it comes to hopes and predictions for the future, Reyna wants to see a change in KYC processes. “I would love if the banks would get behind a consolidated KYC platform,” says Reyna. “Currently, most banks are either developing a proprietary platform or still processing documents manually. An electronic system with standardised KYC forms by jurisdiction would benefit customers by reducing redundant work and allow for standardisation.” There are of course various initiatives underway for this, most notably SWIFT’s KYC Registry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both Zimmerman and Thurman are hoping to see the continuing adoption of digital processes. Zimmerman wants to see fewer exchanges of physical documents and greater acceptance of PDFs as valid forms of a contract, as well as wider acceptance of electronic signatures.</p>
<p>Thurman, meanwhile, wants to see a change in the philosophy of banks. “We’re not just supporting the treasury group, but the broader payables team,” she says. “Banks need to recognise that there’s a wider team that needs support, and we’ve been really investing in training, how-to guides, best practices and operational instructions because we know how critical this multi-stakeholder alignment and awareness is for clients’ success.” She expects and hopes that post-pandemic, this focus on exceptional client service will continue.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Amid all the talk of disruption, disintermediation and ‘dumb pipes’, the imminent demise of the traditional bank – and its relationship with corporate treasurers – have been greatly exaggerated.</em></p>
<p>Amara’s Law states that the effect of a technology tends to be overestimated in the short run and underestimated in the long run. Advocates of open banking will certainly hope this is the case, since there is little evidence to date that APIs and non-bank competition have made a significant impact on treasury departments.</p>
<p>Fintechs have gained traction among companies with straightforward operating models where their cash account is in a single country. However, they have struggled to win business from multinationals.</p>
<p>“Cheaper cross-border transactions are obviously appealing, but even the largest fintechs have a pretty basic business model that is not sophisticated enough to deal with complex corporate treasury requirements,” says Eric Li, Head of Transaction Banking at business intelligence provider Coalition.</p>
<p>There is of course the possibility that consolidation could eventually lead to the emergence of large scale fintechs with the resources to develop sophisticated treasury products. But, Li suggests that fintechs will continue to struggle to take business off incumbents in areas such as supply chain finance, which can be a major overhead for companies making large numbers of payments to suppliers and customers.</p>
<p>Open banking should make the market more competitive as banks allow third parties to explore alternative products and costings. Yet the involvement of third parties adds another layer to the relationship with the bank and creates issues around governance, data privacy and security. Although the concept of a third-party intermediary may be helpful, safeguards and KYC rules need to reflect the role of the third party and whether there would be a conflict in recommending other bank’s products. If the objective is to open the market then this should drive down costs, but the reality is that this commoditisation comes at a cost of losing the relationship with one particular bank.</p>
<p>That is the view of Len Jones, a chartered accountant who has worked at senior finance levels in a number of businesses. He warns that banks will have to adapt their existing processes to cope with third-party systems and that open banking does not mean open season on data. “Banks’ systems need to be able to respond quicker and be scalable, otherwise we get into a race to the bottom with compromises on service standards – assuming that banks are able to invest in back end systems that will enable access to data,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""banks-face-technology-challenge"">Banks face technology challenge</h4>
<p>Jones suggests that banks will have to significantly invest in their existing IT systems to enable them to be a market leader in service, and expresses doubt as to whether they can keep up with the pace of technological change necessary to provide real time information across multiple platforms. “We have already seen a number of disasters with bank IT initiatives and customers being denied access to their accounts,” he continues. “The biggest obstacle to banking innovation is the trade-off between the cost of upgrading legacy systems and the pace of change brought on by fintechs.”</p>
<p>While the UK has been the most enthusiastic proponent of open banking, similar initiatives are being explored in a number of countries including Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Singapore and the US.</p>
<p>However, the regulatory impetus behind open banking is not the same across the world. In Europe it has been driven by regulators, whereas in Asia regulators have yet to commit to mandating open banking, despite encouraging the banking sector to move in that direction.</p>
<p>There are also nuances in relation to demand. “If we look at the oil and gas sector, there has been a focus on cost savings and improvements in recent years through reducing the cost of payments and liquidity management across subsidiaries,” explains Sen Ganesh, Partner at management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company. “For other corporates, interest in open banking may be motivated by growth factors and the need to work with multiple currencies.”</p>
<p>The disparity in the pace of open banking implementation has implications for corporates with operations across multiple continents. For example, a treasurer with significant European operations might be looking at leveraging the new payment service providers, whereas in Asia that treasurer would still be reliant on the incumbent banks.</p>
<p>According to Ganesh, if a corporate takes the view that all the banks it works with will be operating in an open banking environment, it would have to invest in a set of APIs and set aside at least six months to get to the point where it is able to plug into the banks.</p>
<h4 id=""treasurers-adopt-conservative-approach"">Treasurers adopt conservative approach</h4>
<p>Then there is the challenge of whom to work with – most of the fintechs in this space are relatively immature and unproven, so would a corporate trust them to manage half a billion dollars of liquidity? In this context, many corporate treasurers could be expected to adopt a conservative, ‘wait and see’ position.</p>
<p>Ganesh is also unconvinced that multinational companies might be tempted to shift treasury centres from countries where open banking hasn’t gained traction to locations like the UK where it has been heavily promoted. “Services are often co-ordinated and executed in different locations,” he explains. “A corporate could establish a treasury centre in the UK from which it could co-ordinate its European payments, but for local payments in Asia it would still be necessary to send instructions to a local bank.”</p>
<p>Few local banks in Asia – with some exceptions such as DBS in Singapore, which has published some APIs – believe that open banking will be mandated in the near future.</p>
<p>Another barrier to wider adoption of open banking is that there is currently no ‘API standard’, so corporates have to create multiple APIs for similar solutions. API standards, services and geographic scope differ substantially between banks, which impedes interoperability and creates inefficiency and risk. In essence, each new API requires a lot of implementation work for corporates and licensed third-party providers.</p>
<p>A report released by the Open Data Institute in July noted that the UK’s Open Banking Implementation Entity plans to create ‘premium’ APIs that will sit above the mandatory regulatory APIs, and are expected to provide a commercial incentive for banks to grow the open banking ecosystem and improve the performance of their APIs. These premium APIs would be offered by banks under contract to third-party providers and could be paid for by those providers.</p>
<p>There are other initiatives to improve standardisation, such as the API Standardisation Industry Group founded by NACHA, the non-profit membership association charged with overseeing the automated clearing house (ACH) system. “Partnerships between banks, fintechs and infrastructure providers are a precondition for successful standardisation initiatives and these initiatives offer platforms for such collaboration,” says Job Wolters, Director Corporate Clients at treasury consultancy, Zanders. “It is difficult to say how many years it will take for us to arrive at a truly global, standardised set of APIs for corporate banking requirements, although the good news is that we are moving into the right direction.”</p>
<p>PSD2 and UK open banking regulations do not require banks to offer APIs for corporate accounts, although many banks supply these APIs for market-driven, competitive reasons.</p>
<h4 id=""platform-for-the-future"">Platform for the future</h4>
<p>Despite the challenges outlined, there is support for the view that API-enabled platforms and ecosystems represent the future of business banking. Non-banks and fintechs have long sold solutions such as treasury management systems, FX brokerage, accounts payable and receivable automation, and supply chain finance directly to corporate treasurers. Connecting to open banking portals via APIs offers the prospect of easier integration with real-time information and transactions. “We are seeing disruptors such as OakNorth Bank and Tide signing up substantial numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises,” notes Benjamin Ensor, a Research Director who covers the banking sector for Forrester. “While the absolute number of customers these firms have won won’t worry many large established banks, the speed at which credible competitors have not only entered the market but started winning customers should worry them.”</p>
<p>Independent of open banking, there are significant cost pressures on transactional activities and corporates’ expectations of enriched data are already high and growing, so it is necessary to capture very specific information to secure a mandate. Therefore, banks are experiencing some of the impacts of open banking even where it has not been implemented.</p>
<p>In the middle of this decade the financial media was awash with analysts debating whether banks would become ‘dumb pipes’ as their services were unbundled. However, the technology budgets that the largest banks have at their disposal are in some cases many multiples of the turnover of the fintechs trying to win business from them, and leave them well placed to grasp the opportunity to become orchestrators of services.</p>
<p>McKinsey describes ecosystems as an attractive play for any service business that can claim ownership of the primary customer relationship. Those entities that have the strongest relationship with the customer enjoy the highest profit margins in ecosystems and thus the most sustainable and lucrative business model. It would be hard to find any bank that would admit to being resigned to a reduced future role in the financial services landscape where it does no more than process payments. Those that fail to adapt risk becoming relegated to the role of capital provider and transaction processor.</p>
<p>These are not unimportant roles and banks with scale will continue to profit from providing such services. However, banks that don’t transform their operations risk losing their advisory relationship with corporate customers who will migrate to providers able to meet their needs faster and more efficiently.</p>
<p>Open banking has already improved access to information and markets, helping corporates get better pricing for banking products and services says Sankar Krishnan, Executive VP of Banking at consulting services provider, Capgemini.</p>
<h4 id=""accelerating-digital-development"">Accelerating digital development</h4>
<p>“The world’s top banks have a problem with legacy costs of operations and technology,” he adds. “With APIs, they are able to change the direction of their operations and technology strategy and enable digital transformation at a more rapid pace.”</p>
<p>Digital business ecosystems should provide access to better, faster and cheaper business services that are easier to integrate with other business systems – such as CRM – delivering operational efficiencies for many larger companies. In this scenario, Ensor believes treasurers, CFOs and their teams will spend less time trying to understand their current positions and cash flows, releasing more time to focus on optimising financial decisions.</p>
<p>Aite Group Senior Analyst, Enrico Camerinelli, says banks can improve their prospects of becoming orchestrators of services if they join forces to create platforms that become marketplaces for banking services empowered by standardised and common APIs. An example of this approach is the Nordic API Gateway, a data sharing utility supported by DNB and Danske Bank that provides unified API access to both personal and business accounts from all Nordic banks.</p>

<p>Lending platforms are one element of the financial ecosystem that is rapidly expanding, although they have a number of limitations compared with conventional bank borrowing. For example, while both banks and lending platforms perform a screening function by acquiring information to facilitate the decision of whether or not to lend, only banks engage in post-lending monitoring of borrowers. This manifests itself in the different kinds of contracts that banks and lending platforms offer. Bank loans are overwhelmingly secured by collateral, while loans extended by lending platforms are usually unsecured.</p>
<p>The main implication is that banks and lending platforms cater for different kinds of borrowers, observes Dr Sonny Biswas, Lecturer in Finance at University of Bristol. “Banks will probably keep lending to safer borrowers who can put up collateral to secure their loans, while the lending platforms will make loans to riskier and more innovative firms.”</p>
<p>There will be greater transparency on pricing for deposits and loans and this will help treasurers optimise across multiple banks, but that is just one part of the corporate treasurer’s relationship with their bank. Long-term financing is crucial and having long-term secured funding or working capital financing is likely to be of more importance than a reduction in some of the day-to-day costs associated with payments. Ganesh notes that banks are still far and away the largest provider of capital to companies, particularly those who are not large enough to issue their own bonds. Banks also provide advisory services to corporate treasurers on how to optimise their working capital and even set up treasury centres.</p>
<h4 id=""the-power-of-relationships"">The power of relationships</h4>
<p>Further good news for banks is that corporates continue to value their relationship. A November 2018 report on SME banking published by EY found that 43% of small-to-medium sized businesses had used their branch in their past three months (compared with 29% that had used mobile banking) and 17% had interacted with the relationship manager over the same period.</p>
<p>Corporates still value the stability and security of solid banking relations, particularly when it comes to keeping cash on deposit to provide for funding and processing transactions. This trust factor differentiates corporate banking from consumer banking, where the fintech revolution has proceeded much more rapidly.</p>
<p>The stability of a supplier, and support and development of solutions are of key importance for corporate treasuries, says Wolters. “A bank provides stability and security and is therefore generally considered a more reliable technology partner than a fintech. By teaming up with fintechs, banks have the possibility to offer their clients technology solutions beyond traditional basic cash management services. This is expected to be supportive to maintaining and growing the corporate client relationship.”</p>
<p>Patricia Hines, Head of Corporate Banking at financial services technology advisory firm Celent, is also unconvinced that we are moving towards a future where corporate treasurers and Chief Finance Officers conduct all their banking business virtually.</p>
<p>“The primary purchase decision by a treasurer is whether a bank offers its corporation credit lines and facilities,” she says. “Credit granting currently requires a lot of traditional interaction as the lender gathers the information required to make a credit decision.”</p>
<p>Stephen Lane, Finance Director of mechanical engineering firm Xtrac, says he likes to know that the company’s relationship manager understands the business and wouldn’t welcome a future where corporate treasurers and CFOs conduct all their banking business virtually. “I want to be able to sit down and talk to a relationship manager across a table about what is happening in our business,” he concludes.</p></div>

<h5 id=""linda-pullan"">Linda Pullan, Head of Payroll Alliance:</h5>
<p>There are huge changes taking place regarding HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) processes, in particular implementation of real-time information (RTI), which has had a major impact on UK employers. This new system of communicating information to HMRC has meant that employers have had to review their payroll and BACS software to ensure it is up to the task. Unfortunately many legacy payroll systems have either not been upgraded to RTI, or the cost has made employers reconsider their options.</p>
<p>As a result of RTI and the introduction of auto-enrolment pensions, a number of employers are considering outsourcing their payrolls. In this respect, they have two choices: they can either outsource the technology and use a payroll bureau but retain their payroll team, or opt for a fully-managed service.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to both options, so it is important to consider the choices carefully.</p>
<p>An employer should be aware that the cost of providing a bureau or fully outsourced service is never advertised. This is because each solution is tailored to the individual client’s requirements. As a result, this means they will need to send out a RFP to the providers they are interested in. But before an employer drafts a proposal, they should think about what they want from the payroll system. As payroll is usually an employer’s biggest cost, an accurate and efficient payroll service is fundamental to employee relations.</p>
<p>Many employers make the mistake of changing software but not updating their requirements. Instead, what they should be thinking about is how they want the payroll function to develop, using blue-sky thinking.</p>
<p>So before taking the plunge in issuing a RFP, here are my top tips for success:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose a reputable company that is established in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you work in a specific industry, such as retail, then choose a company that is experienced in offering payroll services in this field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large providers will be able to offer advanced technology, but smaller providers are usually able to provide a more personal customer service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include everything you want the system to do now and in the near future to fulfil your requirements, as it will be more costly to add them later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An accurate payroll specification is invaluable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ad hoc reports can be very expensive, so consider a report writing function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t underestimate how long this process will take from start to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay particular attention to ‘exit’ clauses in the contract, otherwise it may be cheaper to stay in and suffer than to get out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always do parallel runs before going live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you opt for a fully-managed service, don’t be too quick making your internal expertise redundant because if it doesn’t work out you have no one to bring the service back in-house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the providers for a list of customers that you can speak to before you make your final decision.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5 id=""mike-edwards"">Mike Edwards, EMEA Head of Market Management, Global Transaction Services (GTS), Bank of America Merrill Lynch:</h5>
<p>To a certain extent, best practice for payroll services RFPs is no different to the approach taken with any cash management RFP. However, when dealing with payroll, the fact that the payment of employees’ salaries is at stake makes it is even more critical that you choose the appropriate solution from a suitable payroll provider for your business, and that the implementation process is seamless.</p>
<p>In preparing for the RFP, the first element is to engage the correct internal stakeholders. The core RFP working group should be comprised of representatives from different geographies and functions to ensure that feedback and buy-in is sought from a range of people who will be affected by changes to payroll – including the commercial teams and HR.</p>
<p>The next stage is to consider the scope of the services required. Payroll is sometimes treated as a bolt-on component to a company’s broader cash management programme but this approach risks missing a significant opportunity. The effective management of payroll payments can help improve a business’s overall cash efficiency and contribute to a better working capital position. For this reason, it’s worth considering how it can be combined or aligned with a broader cash management or working capital solution.</p>
<p>The geographic scope of the RFP is also vital. A harmonised global solution brings greater efficiencies and may enable payment accounts to be rationalised. However it’s difficult to find a one-size-fits-all service from payroll providers because of the considerable local nuances that exist. The European marketplace is particularly fragmented, for example. Many payroll providers are focused on enhancing their formats in order to comply with the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in time for its 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 migration deadline, but these formats are largely being developed at a local and in-country level first, rather than at a pan-European level. It can therefore be challenging for companies to attain a holistic payroll solution from providers and may have to support multiple in-country solutions.</p>
<p>Payroll data is highly sensitive, and an additional element to consider is the level of security to be expected in the data delivery process, irrespective of whether the data will be delivered as part of a bulk payments file (which may include other payment types), or a dedicated payroll file. Individual payment items can be masked to increase privacy, but it’s important to decide how much information masking is required and to ascertain whether providers can meet these needs. Once the payroll file is created, there is also the challenge of establishing who and how the file is approved to go to the bank or direct clearing payment process, and controlling the risk that surrounds this.</p>
<p>Any RFP process related to payments is an opportunity to review the wider picture. By using one global payment solution, you can make your payments process more efficient and increase control over your working capital. It can be time-consuming, but thorough preparation can lead to a better outcome and end solution, which will benefit all employees.</p>

<p>Outsourcing your payroll to an external provider can provide many benefits including freeing up time, reducing costs and utilising the expertise of experienced payroll professionals. With recent complex legislative changes, such as Real-Time Information (RTI) and automatic enrolment, an increasing number of companies are looking to outsourcing as an option for their payroll. It is important to remember, however, that the level of service you will receive from an outsourcing provider can vary greatly, so the decision of which provider to go with is not one that should be rushed or taken lightly.</p>
<p>Before you begin looking at providers, you should have already decided exactly which parts of your payroll you wish to outsource. While some outsourcers may only take on the entire payroll process, this may not be the best option for some businesses. Some outsourcing providers will give you the option of outsourcing a part of your payroll, if you wish to control certain elements yourself. This can often prove to be a more cost-effective option.</p>
<p>When you start looking at outsourcing providers, one of the first things you should be considering is their track record with other clients. Do they have any easily accessible case studies or testimonials? Don’t be afraid to ask them what their customer retention rate is. With RTI and automatic enrolment having a major effect on the way payroll is processed, seeing some evidence of how your prospective outsourcing provider successfully handled these requirements should be a vital step in your decision-making process.</p>
<p>As well as the company in general, you should also consider the staff who work there. Is the outsourcing provider staffed by Chartered Institute for Payroll Professionals (CIPP) qualified professionals? You also want to ensure they are BACS accredited, as this is a main part of payroll which many people decide to outsource. One of the main advantages of outsourcing your payroll is the ability to leverage the expertise of others, so you want to make sure your payroll will be handled by professionals you can rely on.</p>
<p>There are many other questions you should be asking when considering outsourcing your payroll. What is the pricing structure for the services provided? Are there any ‘hidden extras’ for changes, new starters, leavers, etc? Where is the service based? What support will they provide during the transition phase?</p>
<p>The most important step to take is to decide which questions you want to ask before you begin looking at different outsourcing providers. By having a clear plan of exactly what you want to achieve by this partnership, you can ensure you are getting the best possible service at the best value for money.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>The request for proposal (RFP) process is all about starting a formal dialogue with a pool of potential banking partners that you feel may be best placed to respond to your needs. It takes time and consumes resources, but it can provide far better results than an unstructured approach. If the need to at least review your banking partners has been established, the process that follows must lay bare the exact set of priorities that are driving change. From the outset it must be decided which priorities are fixed and which have a degree of flexibility. In short, you must know precisely why you are doing it.</p>
<p>Often an RFP results in a different banking structure, processes and technology. So it is also important to secure senior-level buy-in for the change, bringing on board the different functions and entities that will be affected up and downstream, explaining why it is necessary and what the expected outcome is.</p>
<p>The process of bank selection may be led in-house or, if there is insufficient experience of the selection process or the project is complex, an external consultant may be called in. If opting for an internal team, it is essential to afford them sufficient time to discharge their duties. It may be worth dedicating an individual to manage the process for the duration. Doing the day job at the same time may induce an element of nervous tension that may not yield the best results.</p>
<p>However, the existence of job titles such as treasury project or programme manager within large corporates indicates that this is a role dedicated to change and a bank RFP would slot perfectly into this portfolio. If such an individual is not available, the best compromise is to take blocks of time out of a more traditional role. This means, however, that there should not be any one individual on the team who cannot afford to be out of the office – cover may need to be arranged for critical roles (interim treasury management has gained in popularity in recent years).</p>
<p>In a multinational corporation (MNC) there are typically three sets of stakeholders with overlapping requirements to consider, which makes collaboration key:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Treasury has a set of needs focused around bank relationship management, liquidity and, to a degree, technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business functions have requirements around getting the money in and paying out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared services (if deployed), as an internal service provider, will straddle both.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The needs of the IT function, as the fourth estate, should also be considered as this may be seeking to overlay a structure on all other stakeholders.</p>
<p>In essence, the first phase should define exactly what the business is trying to achieve, what its range of options are and how the business decides between these options. A bank selection has potential to be complex but this stage should not drag on for months.</p>
<p>It may take time to collate all the required information, service definitions and data, but once gathered this discovery stage should be afforded a day or two of intense discussion, involving relevant representatives from all stake-holding functions to enable agreement upon the intended direction.</p>
<p>Co-ordination of the project tends to fall to treasury rather than procurement or any other function simply because treasury has the financial services background and the eventual task of managing bank relationships.</p>
<h3 id=""starting-the-selection"">Starting the selection</h3>
<p>Once a steering document has been published, only then should the business start thinking about which financial institutions might be able to help. The golden rule is that the bank or banks chosen have to be able to meet all genuine business requirements. This is why it is so important to have a requirements document with buy-in from all stakeholders and have all the relevant information to hand; no bank should be expected to figure it out itself.</p>
<p>Where a company operates a decentralised model, the selection team can struggle to get all business units engaged. But if business requirements suddenly appear when it’s too late to make changes to them, then the team will have a battle on its hands. To try to counter this, it is possible to explain the intention to all although it may not be possible to talk to each and every business unit. The project team can then ask for volunteers to be involved in the review – on the understanding that if an individual business is not represented, its place at the table will be taken by a representative from a similar business that has volunteered, and that its view will only be taken at the decision-making stage on the basis that it has shown commitment from the outset.</p>
<h3 id=""straight-to-rfp"">Straight to RFP?</h3>
<p>Once the big picture has been established and the necessary detail has been added, a long list of institutions that are apparently capable of doing what is required can be generated. It may be desirable to go straight to RFP but often it is advisable to reduce that long list. The reduction process can be formalised using a request for information (RFI) in which the fundamentals are laid out and sent to banks, which then respond with high level information confirming or otherwise their suitability.</p>
<p>It is also possible to approach, in an informal manner, a set of institutions that have a fairly close match to your requirements. Here you may state that there is a need to go out to tender, that you have a number of potential banking suitors, and then, putting everything up front, ask directly whether each has the capacity to deliver on your high level requirements. It is preferable to have a bank self-disqualify than find out later that it cannot meet the criteria. Some may still be tempted to provide inaccurate answers but their stock will decline as a result when their inadequacies are revealed. It may even prove to be a major issue at a later stage of assessment if the offending bank has taken the place of a genuine contender and the selection has been reduced to a final short list.</p>
<p>If you are seeking new ideas, or if you feel there are services or products you might not be aware of, the early stages are where it must be done. You should not limit the banks’ ability to bring good ideas to the table but the RFP stage is where you will be looking for structured evidence of their capacity to deliver; the process should not be clouded by giving the banks carte blanche to throw everything at you, as it will make assessment very difficult.</p>
<p>The number of banks needed on the short list is open to debate. Obviously more candidates provide greater opportunity to find the most appropriate partner; but the bigger the list, the more difficult it is to make a comparison, which may detract from the attention required to make the best decision.</p>
<h3 id=""drafting-the-document"">Drafting the document</h3>
<p>In terms of ground rules for drafting an RFP, the simple advice is to be frank and open but omit irrelevant information. Fear of divulging sensitive information should not prevent the revelation of key points; a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) can be put in place if necessary. Explanations of company structure and other background detail should be included only if it helps the banks understand what is needed. The requirements definition itself must be expressed in a clear and concise manner, with a logical progression between points.</p>
<p>Whilst pre-formatted RFPs exist and provide excellent checklists for basic capabilities, every project is different and has its own objectives and nuances that cannot be conveyed in a standard form. But it is nonetheless essential to discover how each bank proposes to handle these, going beyond overly broad objective statements which will elicit from the banks either very little or something approaching a ‘kitchen-sink’ response.</p>
<p>Whilst there will be a number of yes/no responses designed to clarify basic points, the key elements of your own unique needs must be translated into a clear and open document. This must ask the right questions to be able to draw out critical detail from the banks’ responses. The RFP offers banks the opportunity to express the depth of their solutions and is a way of seeing if they can do what you want them to do. Their responses also demonstrate how well they understand your needs, how far they are prepared to go to meet those needs and how they propose to offer follow-up support on a day-to-day basis. It is also vital that they demonstrate their commitment to future deliveries of their products, services and technology because these will have to match your own plans to progress if an early re-selection process is to be avoided.</p>
<p>A typical banking RFP may extend anywhere between 15 to 40 pages. The responses will be at a minimum 40 pages and maybe as many as 200. Give the banks time to respond, as multiple specialists may need to consider their respective responses. A window of opportunity should be opened where dialogue can take place, but remain transparent about the process: whatever responses you give should be given to all participants, thus maintaining a level playing field. To this end, ensure the rules of engagement are set in advance so that the bank’s project co-ordinator (who will handle your RFP) knows who they can and can’t talk to within your company. It is advisable to log all communication.</p>
<h3 id=""analysis-of-returns"">Analysis of returns</h3>
<p>When you do get the responses, read them all – another good reason not to send it to too many banks. When making a comparison you are basically assessing the adequacy of service provision offered by each bank for each key area. Because many corporates, especially the largest MNCs, spread out across the world to such an extent, even the top ten biggest banks could not hope to fully support that reach. Given that there may not be a 100% fit, usually there is a trade-off which may involve taking the best aspects from two banks. The decision regarding acceptable compromises is one for the stakeholders, but this can be aided by the use of weightings – giving each response a numerical value according to its relative importance to avoid the outcome being unnecessarily swayed by something that has low value.</p>
<p>At this stage most project teams will want to meet the banks’ teams. The human element should not be underestimated, especially as treasurers will often have to work closely with these people. This can be the point where you ask for evidence of their proposal claims (quantifying cost savings for example).</p>
<p>These meetings will typically be between two to three hours and there needs to be a team-discussion afterwards. Slotting one in the morning and one in the afternoon may not be a good idea if that discussion is to be of any value. If you take the time and trouble to call them in, give them the space to expand their response, and do them the courtesy of allowing a full discussion of what they have to say.</p>
<h3 id=""a-last-look-before-deciding"">A last look before deciding</h3>
<p>Having seen the responses and met the shortlisted banks you should now be in a position to create an order of preference. But there are other elements that also need to be tackled. As an extension of meeting the presentation teams, it is also worth meeting their customer services representatives. If there is new technology coming in that you are not familiar with, then you should arrange for a demo, structured around your needs. Contacting references is also advisable. The expectation that these will always be unreservedly positive is not too far from the truth; however, diligent questioning will often throw up some interesting points, some of which may be to your benefit. At the very least such a meeting can give some assurance that the bank is capable of doing good work.</p>
<p>The decision is now yours but if an RFP has been executed well it will be one made with an appropriate level of due diligence. RFP responses may even be retained as the basis upon which the implementation of the bank solution is measured and monitored. But beyond providing the right banking solution for today, a well-prepared RFP should also go a long way towards providing the right banking partner, which is hopefully one that can be retained for many years to come.</p>

<p>Selecting a banking partner is like most other activities: it is best to have clearly defined objectives. The main points to consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can the bank provide seamless service across all the countries in Asia? Typically, this means using an international bank. Some Asian banks are building networks across the region, but few have fully functioning structures as of yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the bank provide credit support, if needed, in each country? International banks are often reluctant to provide access to their balance sheets. Using Asian banks will usually mean a multi-bank structure. While the situation has improved, some Asian banks are still reluctant to provide MT940 reporting; and, if you have operations in remote locations, not all branches are on SWIFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is cash pooling and sweeping needed? Many Asian countries still have exchange controls (different in each country, of course), so physical cash sweeps are usually not possible. Some international banks do provide notional pooling arrangements – but it is not necessarily plain sailing to use these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance sheet strength: many Asian banks now have stronger balance sheets and capital ratios than their Western counterparts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there services needed which can only be provided by local banks? This means using local banks and therefore will require a series of relationships, with the challenges of visibility and control. A company running a centralised operation using modern cash pooling techniques with daily information on cash balances in the centre will find itself gravitating towards international banks.</p>
</li>

<h5 id=""alain-bridoux-responded"">Alain Bridoux, Senior Advisor, Transnations, responded (with a focus on China):</h5>
<p>The first question I would ask is how reliable is this bank worldwide and in China? Prudence would immediately disqualify any bank for which there is the slightest doubt about creditworthiness. Ratings might have some limitations but there is no reason on earth – including the strong recommendation of a local business unit manager – that should outweigh the credit rating established by reputable agencies.</p>
<p>The second question should verify the experience of the group in dealing with that bank in other countries. It is preferable to have a previously established relationship with that bank in other parts of the world. If no previous experience exists with the potential partner, my advice is to network with other clients using the bank for the same services in the specific province. Do not make your decision based on discussions with the international or global relationship staff of the Chinese bank. Despite being able to identify what you want, they do not have the authority over regional branches to deliver specific solutions. The reason is that all regional banks in China are essentially an extension of the economic policy of the central government.</p>
<p>The logical fall-back position is to select a new banking partner from the pool of banks used by the group or one of their associated banks in China. Chinese banks with some partnership or co-operation agreements with foreign banks are by definition still primarily the extended arms of the economic policy of the central government, as explained above. Therefore their links with a friendly home bank have limited value. A foreign bank established in China that is part of the bank pool in the home country of your group is obviously a safer choice. However, thinking that you will automatically obtain the “Rolls-Royce” treatment that your head office gets is an illusion.</p>
<p>Typically your global relationship manager will pledge that their Chinese subsidiary will mirror exactly what you have in other places, and they will probably do it in good faith. My experience is that they can be overruled by a local branch manager in China. In Hong Kong and Shanghai I received apologies from the global relationship manager when it emerged that the local branch manager had applied conditions based on the credit-worthiness of the local subsidiary of a group, while having told the global relationship manager that conditions applied were the best legally possible in the country.</p>
<p>The most difficult judgment to apply regards the ethics of the local bank manager of a possible new partner. Treasury personnel are often inexperienced in China and remote control from the head office is difficult. It is important that the new banking partner does not suggest products which may offer a small temporary advantage to the local subsidiary but could create a large risk for the group.</p>

<h5 id=""how-do-i-improve-my-visibility"">How do I improve my visibility?</h5>
<p>Today, it’s not enough to have fragmented snapshots of cash holdings – a treasurer requires a holistic and consolidated view over all accounts, in all markets and regions, all of the time, in order to make the best decisions around the short-, medium- and long-term use of that cash. Treasurers need to consider whether their potential banking partner has the right infrastructure in place, and ideally ensure that rich information and analytics can be extracted quickly and easily at a number of different levels across a country, the region or even globally.</p>
<h5 id=""how-can-i-grow-the-bottom-line"">How can I grow the bottom line?</h5>
<p>A significant trend over the past few years has been the focus by corporate treasurers on achieving greater efficiencies around their working capital. Largely driven by ongoing uncertainty globally and compression of margins, extracting the maximum value out of a company’s cash holdings is key.</p>
<p>An important consideration here is the extent to which a banking partner is able to offer automated solutions that drive high straight through processing (STP) rates across payables and receivables, both from a transaction and a reconciliation perspective. By eliminating manual processes as much as possible, the combination of faster, more accurate processing and reduced manual intervention results in savings across the board, and a better bottom line.</p>
<h5 id=""how-do-i-mobilise-my-cash"">How do I mobilise my cash?</h5>
<p>Once a treasurer has achieved enhanced visibility over their cash, and automated as much as possible its solutions and infrastructure, a final important question revolves around freeing up that cash and moving it across corporate entities, countries and regions. Doing this across multiple subsidiaries, parent companies and geographies – not to mention a wide and varied range of restricted markets – is a complex task, so a corporate treasurer must look at the synergies and strengths delivered by its banking partner. Fragmented banking relationships – or multiple banking partners – may not always be the right approach, as it can add complexity and challenges around harmonising banking platforms.</p>
<p>A treasurer should consider seeking a partner that is able to provide the right tools, technology and infrastructure, as well as the ability to automate the movement of cash, which will help that company achieve better yields, pay down debt and generate greater returns for their excess cash.</p>

<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>In this article we take a look at how Governments use withholding tax (WHT) to raise tax revenues, consider the circumstances in which this type of tax is most commonly a problem for corporate treasurers and examine some of the options for minimising WHT obligations.</p>
<p>Withholding taxes are relatively commonplace and are applied in numerous tax jurisdictions and for a range of different purposes. They are so named because the Government in question requires the payer of an item of income to withhold (in other words to deduct) tax from the payment and pay the tax direct to the Government. WHT can be applicable both to individuals and to companies.</p>
<p>In this article we will look at some of the key aspects of WHT and some of its more common applications.</p>
<h3 id=""common-applications-of-wht"">Common applications of WHT</h3>
<p>In the case of individuals the most common application of WHT is in respect of employment income, but it can also apply to payments of interest and to dividends. In situations where the recipient of the income is resident in a different jurisdiction there are often additional WHT obligations. It can also be applicable to royalties, rental payments and sales of real estate.</p>
<p>Within the EU perhaps the best known example of a WHT is the European Savings Tax Directive (ESD). This applies to ‘natural persons’ rather than companies and was introduced in 2005 in order to combat tax evasion by EU resident private individuals, particularly in respect of bank accounts held in locations perceived to be tax havens, such as Jersey. Under the ESD banks must automatically deduct tax, at the rate of 20%, from interest and other savings income earned, and pass it to their local tax authority. The rate of withholding will increase to 25% from July 2011.</p>
<p>Another example of how WHT can be used to combat tax evasion by individuals is under discussion at the moment between the UK Government and the Swiss authorities. The former are seeking to reach agreement with the latter to impose WHT on secret Swiss bank accounts held by Britons. A possible WHT rate of between 25% and 30% has been mooted on untaxed income in Swiss bank accounts – if an agreement is reached, and implemented, this could add an estimated £3 billion to £6 billion to the coffers of the cash-strapped UK Treasury within two years.</p>
<p>Governments are generally well aware of certain industries where tax evasion is perceived to be commonplace and they seek to use WHT to ensure that this is minimised, as far as possible. In New Zealand, for example, WHT regulations were changed in 2006 in a targeted effort to reduce tax evasion in the country’s fruit and wine-growing industries.</p>
<p>Governments which impose WHT usually try to back this up with a rigorous reporting regime so that amounts of tax being withheld are accurately reported and diligently collected. Some countries have more effective reporting and collection regimes than others. Copies of WHT reporting are usually given both to the person or company on whom the tax is imposed as well as to the levying Government.</p>
<p>It is common for WHT to be treated by tax authorities as a ‘payment on account’, with an amount being refunded if the taxpayer’s final tax liability for the period is less than the amount of tax that has been withheld.</p>
<h3 id=""cross-border-wht"">Cross-border WHT</h3>
<p>Corporate Treasurers, whose companies typically operate in multiple tax jurisdictions, will probably be more concerned with international WHT regulations than with domestic WHT regulations. The former can be more complex and more onerous to comply with than the latter. Any company doing business internationally needs to understand the WHT rules in those foreign countries in which any business is being done. Companies which fail to consider and take steps to minimise their WHT obligations can expect to see their after-tax income sharply eroded.</p>
<p>By way of a practical example of the implications of cross-border WHT let’s consider how it impacts a US software company selling its products in Korea. In this industry WHT can be 30% or more of gross software licensing income in some countries.</p>
<p>The Korean Government requires that the Korean client of the US company withholds a (large) portion of the invoiced amount and remits it to the local Korean tax authorities on the US company’s behalf. The US company may be able to claim these Korean WHT charges as a credit against their US tax liability, but if the US company is not paying US taxes as a result of recording operating losses the resulting tax credit could be of little use.</p>
<p>This example illustrates the importance for Corporate Treasurers of careful advance tax planning in order to reduce exposure to foreign WHT charges. Fortunately, most large corporates have in-house tax experts, whose role is to ensure that the financial impact on the business of cross-border WHT obligations is minimised and that the company is fully discharging all of its WHT reporting obligations to the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate.</p>
<h3 id=""wht-in-some-key-markets"">WHT in some key markets</h3>
<p>Let’s have a quick (and somewhat simplified) look at WHT legislation in some key markets and its potential impact on companies which do business in them:</p>
<h5 id=""united-states"">United States</h5>
<p>Companies making certain types of payments to non-resident aliens, foreign corporations and foreign partnerships are obliged to withhold Federal income tax. Payments subject to withholding include compensation for services, interest, dividends, rents, royalties and annuities.</p>
<p>Tax is withheld at the rate of 30% on the gross amount of the payment, although the rate can be substantially reduced under international tax treaties. Partnerships are also required to make withholding tax payments on behalf of foreign partners, regardless of whether income is actually distributed to the partner. The US also imposes a 10% WHT on the gross sale price of a US real property interest unless approval has been obtained in advance from the IRS for a lower rate.</p>
<h5 id=""united-kingdom"">United Kingdom</h5>
<p>WHT (at 20%) is payable on interest on loans and other unlisted debt in the case of non-UK entities making or acquiring such loans to UK entities (including banks, funds and SPVs), and where companies are lending inter-group. (A ‘treaty passport’ scheme exists whereby relief can be claimed in certain situations.) Real estate investment trusts are required to withhold tax at the rate of 20% on dividend payments to non-residents (subject to any double tax treaties, or DTTs, which may be in place).</p>
<h5 id=""germany"">Germany</h5>
<p>The dividend WHT rate is 25% but this can be substantially reduced subject to effective use of DTTs and other types of tax planning. There is no WHT on interest paid except in the case of publicly-traded debt, interest received through a German paying-agent, convertible bonds and certain types of loans where a German resident company is the debtor. The rate of WHT is 25% but it can be reduced subject to DTTs and/or certain specific EU directives. The WHT rate on royalty and lease payments on movable property paid to non-resident corporations is 15%.</p>
<h5 id=""china"">China</h5>
<p>WHT is levied on overseas companies providing services to China-based businesses. The Chinese tax authorities levy WHT on ‘China-derived income’ so many overseas companies who do not themselves have a legal presence in China are unable to receive the total gross amount due on their invoices to a China entity.</p>
<p>The standard WHT rate for non tax-resident enterprises in China for passive income is 20%, although this can be reduced to 10% in certain situations. WHT at 10% is also payable on dividends that a non-resident company receives from a resident company (unless there is a tax treaty in place with the relevant foreign government).</p>
<h5 id=""india"">India</h5>
<p>India’s tax treaties typically provide for a 10% WHT on royalties and technical service fees. Under new rules implemented last year every recipient of India-source income subject to WHT (whether resident of non-resident) must furnish a ‘Permanent Account Number’ (PAN) to the Indian payer before payment is made. Failure by a non-resident entity to supply a PAN can lead to tax being withheld at 20%.</p>
<h3 id=""wht-problems"">WHT problems</h3>
<p>The WHT regulations in one jurisdiction can sometimes give rise to unintended consequences in another. In economic ‘blocs’ such as the EU things can, and have, become very complicated as a result of attempts to harmonise the rules across multiple markets. Dividend withholding tax, for example, is a thorny issue within the EU. Current rules give rise to cash flow disadvantages and double taxation issues which can pose a significant disincentive for cross border investors as well as distorting the effective functioning of the internal EU market. The European Commission has recently set up a consultation to try to find solutions to these problems.</p>
<p>Tax authorities the world over are generally unforgiving of failures by businesses to maintain adequate records, make all required declarations – and associated tax payments. No business wants to get into dispute with tax authorities, whether local or overseas, as such situations can be protracted and costly, as well as bringing unwanted negative publicity.</p>
<h3 id=""implications-for-corporate-treasurers"">Implications for corporate treasurers</h3>
<p>In an international group of companies Corporate Treasurers face the constant challenge of how best to manage liquidity. Whether cash is physically swept into a single account, or notionally pooled, companies have to consider the underlying tax issues very carefully. Interest is often liable to being taxed at source, particularly when it is remitted cross-border, hence WHT is often a consideration and one that influences how cash pooling arrangements are established and managed.</p>
<p>Whether it is liquidity management or setting up a new overseas subsidiary it goes without saying that the correct structuring of international business operations is crucial in order to minimise tax. Getting expert tax advice on WHT before starting any new international venture is essential.</p>
<h3 id=""ways-for-companies-to-minimise-wht"">Ways for companies to minimise WHT</h3>
<p>Can companies do anything to minimise their exposure to foreign WHT? Fortunately the answer is yes.</p>
<p>The first way is through international tax treaties. These provide for a reduced WHT rate on cross-border payments of royalties, interest and dividends. Typically, the treaty reduced rate is more favourable than the local country domestic WHT rate and in some case the rate can be reduced to zero%. In order to take advantage of the more favourable treaty rates companies will usually have to go through a fairly lengthy documentation process with their overseas clients and the tax authorities in the client’s country.</p>
<p>Another approach for reducing WHT exposure is for licence agreements to be drafted in such a way as to ensure, for example, that income streams are of a character that is not subject to WHT under the domestic laws of the country where business is being done.</p>
<p>While royalty payments are for the most part subject to local country WHT most countries do not impose WHT on income derived from services performed outside of their country or on income which is derived from the sale of tangible personal property.</p>
<p>It will be pretty tough to convince your overseas customers to stop withholding local country taxes after contracts have been signed and WHT collection has begun, so it’s far better to spend time researching and understanding exactly how overseas WHT rules work before business with clients in new overseas locations commences.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>There are many factors to consider when determining a treasury structure. To what extent will centralisation benefit operations, or will a regional structure be more appropriate? Is a treasury centre to be established, and if so, where should it be? What are the pros and cons?</p>
<p>Treasury organisation is generally dictated by the company’s strategy, structure and underlying business model; however the trend over recent years has been increasingly for treasuries to centralise their operations. This gradual shift towards centralisation has been encouraged by technological advances that have made it easier and cheaper to centralise, and also by governance regulations, such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require a high level of transparency across an organisation. Initiatives like the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) also favour centralised structures, and more recently, the global economic crisis has also pushed companies to revisit their existing structures as they seek to maximise efficiencies and increase visibility across the business.</p>
<p>The structure of treasury operations and, in particular, the chosen level of centralisation will have a major impact on the company’s cash management structures. Generally speaking, the centralisation of treasury activities enables companies to develop more efficient cash management structures and benefit from greater efficiencies in other parts of the company. It is therefore important to determine, and to re-evaluate periodically, the degree of centralisation that is both desirable and practical from the company’s point of view. An important factor in this review is technology, as advances in systems and communication have made it easier and cheaper to centralise treasury operations in recent years.</p>
<h3 id=""degrees-of-centralisation"">Degrees of centralisation</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking there are three different levels of treasury structure. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Decentralised.</h5>
<p>Treasury policy-making, decisions and activities are conducted by each subsidiary with a small team retained at group level to provide advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Partially centralised.</h5>
<p>Treasury policy is defined by group treasury, which may also advise or instruct subsidiaries on investment or hedging activity etc. Back-office operations may be centralised, but subsidiaries retain responsibility for executing deals with local banking partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Fully centralised.</h5>
<p>Treasury policy-making, decisions and most banking and financial activities are undertaken at group or regional treasury level, which might offer a 24-hour service for the subsidiaries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a fully centralised environment may appear to be the most suitable structure for multinational corporations, in reality this is not necessarily the case – many end up with a hybrid or decentralised arrangement, simply because it is impractical to operate in any other way.</p>
<h3 id=""decentralised"">Decentralised</h3>
<p>In a decentralised structure subsidiaries have stand-alone local bank arrangements and may organise their own funding. Cash management is handled locally, including short-term borrowing and investments, although payments to and from the parent will still occur.</p>

<h3 id=""partially-centralised"">Partially centralised</h3>
<p>Companies may choose to set up a partially centralised model in order to improve efficiencies in some areas of the treasury function. In these situations, group treasury will usually define treasury policy and may give advice to, or even instruct, individual subsidiaries. However, the subsidiaries retain responsibility for executing the deals themselves via their local banking partners. Back office operations may be undertaken at local level or they may be centralised, delivering more control while enabling subsidiaries to maintain a degree of autonomy within the front office function.</p>
<h5 id=""regional-model"">Regional model</h5>
<p>One of the most popular approaches to partial centralisation is the regional model. With treasurers rethinking their approach to banking and funding since the financial crisis, the one-bank approach is no longer seen as a viable option. So, with treasurers giving more consideration to regional banking relationships, a regional treasury model is also being mooted as an equally prudent option.</p>

<h3 id=""treasury-centres"">Treasury centres</h3>
<p>A treasury centre is a centralised treasury management function, which is legally structured as a separate group entity or branch. This entity is normally located in a tax-efficient location. A treasury centre provides financial management and transaction services for the other group entities. Its most typical functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing liquidity and reducing interest payments through cash pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing internal (intragroup clearing or netting) and external (payment factory) payment services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting rules for reinvoicing within the group and externally, offering factoring services for the group companies’ third party receivables, or structuring asset-backed securities programmes (ABS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiating group-wide leasing arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structuring, monitoring and financing the capital requirements of group companies as well as co-ordinating and managing external borrowings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing group companies with vendor financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing asset management services for any surplus funds, pension funds or similar liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing exchange and interest rate risk management services to group entities, such as advising, monitoring and managing their exposures, concentrating the group’s exposure within the treasury centre, internal dealing and managing the risks externally with appropriate financial instruments.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to be aware that not all countries where group companies may be located will necessarily permit the concentration of all these activities. The capabilities and activities of a treasury centre, therefore, need to be defined per each individual case.</p>
<h3 id=""advantages"">Advantages</h3>
<p>The treasury centre structure has many benefits and can lead to improvements on three different levels, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Governance.</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of a co-ordinated and central database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardised treasury and risk management procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More accurate group-wide reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know-how pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater focus on core competencies within the group.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Costs.</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced payment and transaction costs through higher volumes and fewer individual transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced financing costs and financing requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced hedging costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Tax.</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allocation of financial profits in a low tax country, when allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax-efficient cash management and financing structures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, not all the elements of a fully centralised treasury are available in all countries, nor are they suitable for every company. In addition, the process of centralising treasury functions is likely to be taken in steps moving through different levels of centralisation.</p>
<h3 id=""how-to-organise-a-treasury-centre"">How to organise a treasury centre</h3>
<p>Once the different possibilities of centralisation have been considered, the organisational structure and location of the treasury centre must be determined. Depending on the group’s management philosophy, the treasury centre has a choice of two models to adopt:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The treasury centre acts as central agent, operating all financial transactions for the group companies in their name, compensated on a cost plus basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treasury centre acts as the group’s central in-house clearing bank, either on a shared service centre basis (which means that the group entities have direct relations with the treasury centre) or in competition with third party banks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both models centralise the treasury know-how of the group. In addition, the in-house bank operates the group’s financial management as its own business. Cost savings, as well as additional income earned, arise at treasury centre level.</p>
<p>If a treasury centre is organised according to an in-house banking model and is competing with other third party banks, it will usually operate as a profit centre. The group companies’ financial needs are met on a price level applicable to a third party.</p>
<p>The question of whether a treasury centre operates as a cost, service or profit centre has a direct impact on where the treasury centre is located. Indeed, a treasury centre acting as a profit centre has a clear advantage if operating in a low tax jurisdiction.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In January we described the process required for choosing a TMS. Having selected a preferred vendor and system, what are the next steps in installing the system?</p>
<p>The key objective of the implementation phase is to have the new system running and performing the required functions as quickly and efficiently as possible and within budget. In general, the core stages in a TMS installation will be the same, regardless of the type of system chosen. So while application-service-provider (ASP) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products may reduce the time taken to implement a system and will affect the upfront cost, contract structure and level of customisation available, they do not fundamentally alter the basic steps that ensure a smooth implementation.</p>
<p>Successful implementation relies on a comprehensive project scoping exercise, and the development of a detailed project plan. Key milestones are identified and progress is regularly monitored during the implementation, to ensure that the process remains on track.</p>
<p>The strategic objective is to deliver the solution that yields the set of business benefits that justifies the organisation’s TMS project investment. The project also provides the opportunity to put in place new, best practice treasury workflows. Implementing a new cash management solution should result in more invested cash and better processes.</p>
<h3 id=""break-down-the-process-into-stages"">Break down the process into stages</h3>
<p>Implementation is broken down into a large number of discrete steps that can be grouped together under several umbrella headings.</p>
<p>“A typical implementation for us is divided into approximately 20 discrete high-level steps. The specific milestones for an actual project can be identified after completion of a detailed project scoping exercise. Each of these stages will be included as milestones in the project plan, which will include the applicable resource assignments (vendor management, consultant and technical, client management, treasury/accounting executive responsible, technical), progress indicator, completion targets and actual completion dates,” explains Patrick Coleman, Regional General Manager, IT2 Treasury Solutions Limited.</p>
<h3 id=""create-a-project-team"">Create a project team</h3>
<p>The first step is to build a project implementation team. This will include the senior implementation consultant from the vendor, a specialist external treasury consultant if one has been hired, a project manager from the buyer, a business analyst who understands the current treasury processes and an IT co-ordinator to deal with legacy system issues.</p>
<p>External consultants can help at several levels. They can advise and support the detailed scoping exercise, and the preparation of the project plan. Implementing a new system is an opportunity to implement best practice treasury operations, and consultants can re-engineer treasury workflows that reflect the latest thinking. It is these workflows that the treasury/vendor team will implement in detail.</p>
<p>Paul Bramwell, Senior Vice President, Treasury Solutions, SunGard’s AvantGard says, “Once a project approaches the 60 to 70 day implementation level, where you may have a treasury department with four to five people in the project, you are getting to the stage where you need an external consultant. It brings discipline to the project and is especially helpful when it comes to change requests.”</p>
<p>A steering committee can also be formed that will include the most senior person involved respectively from the supplier and the company (the project sponsor) and the project manager. This group is responsible for agreeing major changes to the project plan and to resolve any problems or disputes.</p>
<p>“Larger projects especially benefit from supervision by a steering committee to oversee the project’s progress against the plan, and works to ensure that the project fulfils its strategic objectives,” says Coleman.</p>
<h3 id=""project-planning"">Project planning</h3>
<p>With the team in place, the next task is to rigorously define and document the objectives of the project and the deliverables expected of the vendor. The vendor is instrumental in this process and the result of the process should be an agreed statement of work (SOW). This document describes the purpose of the project, the scope of work, the timetable, deliverables, acceptance criteria and payment schedules. It is crucial at this stage to define implementation responsibilities clearly, especially how these are shared between suppliers and the buyer.</p>
<p>In the context of a TMS, this means making a complete analysis of all the treasury business processes to be implemented and planning the system configuration. To ensure that the system delivers the core functionality quickly, treasury priorities need to be clearly mapped – for example, connectivity and cash positioning for primary operating banks or general ledger posting for corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>Only when this statement of work has been exhaustively checked and approved can the next stage in the process begin.</p>
<p>“The detailed plan will contain several tasks (including training as applicable) which together comprise the activities needed to complete the milestone. Many of the intermediate tasks can be performed in parallel, enabling the project to be accelerated – if there are sufficient resources available to do so,” explains Coleman.</p>

</figure>
<p>Bramwell adds, “An important function of the planning phase is to inject realism into the process. Treasurers are often optimistic about the time it takes to implement what are, after all, complex pieces of software that are being used within very complex processes.”</p>
<p>“There is also often a need to reset of thinking in terms of functionality. Often TMS systems are being introduced to replace spreadsheets. But spreadsheets are among the most flexible software tools ever created and while treasurers welcome the standardisation and other benefits that TMSs introduce, they have to accept that they have to compromise.”</p>
<h3 id=""technical-environment-set-up"">Technical environment set-up</h3>
<p>As hosted solutions become more common, this is becoming less of an issue. However, if an in-house solution has been chosen then there is a significant amount of work for the buyer in terms of hardware, software, data connectivity and other external interfacing. “If a hosted or ASP solution has been chosen, then we as vendor can control all of that and offer much more besides. For example, we are a member concentrator of SWIFT and we are a SWIFT service,” says Bramwell. “It is quicker for us if we control the hardware and software environments and don’t have to wait for the company’s IT department.”</p>
<h3 id=""integrations-such-as-bank-reporting-market-data-erp-system"">Integrations (such as bank reporting, market data, ERP system)</h3>
<p>A key step in the process is integration with core systems. The most important connection the new system has to make is with existing banks. It must be able to access prior, current and intra-day files and set up file transfers to new banks; interfacing the banking and treasury systems to achieve straight-through processing will improve daily cash management and forecasting; and there will likely be interfaces to other treasury software such as market information systems, multi-bank dealing portals, ERP systems and confirmation matching systems.</p>
<p>The TMS may also be required to interface into specialist risk management software or an existing cash management solution. Teams frequently underestimate the necessity for and time taken in assembling accurate interface specifications, especially for bank balance and transaction reporting, payments exports and ERP system integrations. Reporting requirements should also be fully specified, given that the improvement of the quality of operational and management reporting is often a primary business driver for implementing a new TMS.</p>
<h3 id=""static-data-management"">Static data management</h3>
<p>Treasury should work with the selected vendor at an early stage to plan the static data element of the project in full detail, and then commit the necessary resources to complete the necessary tasks effectively and within the required timeframe. Each vendor will have different requirements for the format the data should be in and can provide those details in advance.</p>
<p>“Treasury teams often underestimate the effort needed to collect, review, complete and organise the static data needed to operate the new system effectively, especially, as is usually the case, when the new TMS offers greater power in the breadth and depth of available solution,” says Coleman.</p>
<h3 id=""functional-application-implementation"">Functional application implementation</h3>
<p>As well as the core bank interfacing, every asset class and definable functionality block has to be implemented. This can include foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities, risk management, cash management and cash forecasting.</p>
<p>Bramwell explains, “We map out all the asset classes and processes – cash management, cash forecasting, risk management and so on. For each of these areas we would develop a rigorous process for achieving the desired objectives and metrics to judge success in achieving them.”</p>
<h3 id=""regular-reviews"">Regular reviews</h3>
<p>It is crucial throughout the project to conduct regular reviews of progress against milestones and the budget. In this way, most problems and disputes can be headed off before they become serious.</p>
<p>“In the course of the project, it is important to monitor that all tasks are progressing and completing on or ahead of schedule, so that any unexpected issues are identified and rectified before they have a material impact. This implies that there should be a change management contingency built into project planning,” says IT2’s Coleman.</p>
<h3 id=""user-testing-training-parallel-run-go-live"">User testing, training, parallel run, go live</h3>
<p>Once the system has been installed, the end-user treasury staff must be familiarised with the system and trained in its functionality. Their feedback must be incorporated into the final implementation. Consideration should be given to staff outside the core treasury function too.</p>
<p>For example, the accounting department will need to be satisfied that the correct entries are being passed into the general ledger and that the interface works well; business units may be given direct access to the system, to provide data to the centre and to use the system analytics for their own planning. Senior management may be given direct access to the system too. All these staff will need to be trained.</p>
<p>External auditors may also have to be consulted to ensure that they are satisfied that the TMS carries out its various calculations and position reporting functions accurately. At this stage the system should be tested both with dummy transactions and also in a full parallel run with existing systems to ensure accuracy.</p>
<h3 id=""system-optimisation"">System optimisation</h3>
<p>Best practice suggests that between six months to a year after implementation, treasuries that have bought a TMS should go back to the vendor to review their usage of the features and functionality. The vendors have typically installed many tens of systems and have a much broader knowledge of how similar users are making best use of the systems’ features. However most companies do not take advantage of this knowledge and do not use their vendors as post-implementation advisors or trainers. This deprives them of significant additional ROI.</p>
<h3 id=""common-problems"">Common problems</h3>
<p>The commonest problems companies experience when implementing a treasury management system arise when the opportunity is not taken to analyse and re-design treasury workflows to take full advantage of the TMS’s facilities. Simply re-implementing the current processes risks reproducing the shortcomings that justified the investment in a new TMS.</p>
<p>More prosaically, staffing issues cause the most headaches. Says Bramwell, “The commonest problem is staff turnover. The most problematic implementations are those when there is high staff turnover and the new people are unfamiliar with the project and do not have the same level of buy-in as the individuals who initiated it. This is a key project risk that needs to be evaluated ahead of time and contingency-planned for.”</p>
<p>An extension of the staffing issue is simply a lack of sufficient qualified resourcing in the treasury implementation team. This can lead to errors and omissions, and so delays and budget overruns. Bramwell adds, “Lack of dedicated project management is often a problem. We can provide that but it is often lacking on the client side.”</p>
<p>Finally, alterations to the scope of the project commonly cause significant delays in implementation. This usually occurs as the treasury team identifies improved solutions as they learn in depth about the new TMS’s capabilities. This should not happen if the selection project was sufficiently thorough, but is common because of the business pressures under which system selection projects are often performed. It is possible to manage changes of this type smoothly, provided that effective change management processes are built into the project structure.</p>
<p>As Bramwell puts it, “Changing the fundamental scope of the project mid-way does create problems and we recommend the creation of both a steering group (that meets weekly or bi-weekly) and a management group that includes more senior executives not involved in the day-to-day implementation that meets monthly.”</p>
<p>Most pitfalls can be avoided by accurate planning and project management and by staffing the project team with an adequate number of appropriately qualified personnel. And, as Coleman points out, “At a high level, a successful project needs the appropriate level of buy-in by the management and teams of all interested departments, including finance, audit, procurement, legal and the business structure.""</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Monitoring interest rates and acting on changes in them is an important part of a treasurer’s role. Whether looking at the yield on excess cash invested or the interest rate on outstanding or new issue debt, treasurers need to be aware of the impact of interest rate changes on the balance sheet and P&amp;L and of the instruments and techniques available to mitigate the effects of those changes.</p>
<p>Interest rates can affect companies in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Companies with floating or variable rate debt outstanding are exposed to increases in interest rates, whereas companies with borrowing costs which are totally or partly fixed will be exposed to falls in interest rates. The reverse is true for companies with cash term deposits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pension schemes that carry liability and investment risk for the sponsoring corporation have interest rate risk in that liabilities act in a similar way to bonds, rising in value as interest rates fall and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although a nonfinancial firm will usually report its bonds on issue in financial statements, at substantially their face value, early redemptions must be done at the market value. This may be significantly different, as interest rates will change the value of fixed-rate debt.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""how-can-it-be-avoided"">How can it be avoided?</h3>
<p>All of the issues above involve a decision to accept exposure either to a fixed interest rate or a floating rate on either an asset or a liability. This decision can be taken at any time over the life of a debt or an investment and can be modified at any time using a variety of instruments, some with an upfront cash cost, others with no upfront cash cost. It is also possible to purchase instruments that cap interest rates at a pre-defined maximum, floor them at a minimum or allow them to fluctuate within a pre-defined band or range.</p>
<p>Deciding to fix, float or accept a defined range of possible interest rates is the definition of managing interest rate risk. Hedging a floating interest rate means deciding to fix all or part of the exposure. Hedging a fixed rate exposure means deciding to transform all or part of it into a floating rate exposure. The following table lists the main instruments a corporate treasurer could use for this. It omits some less appropriate possibilities:</p>

<td>A collar combines the purchase of a cap and a floor. This sets a corridor of possible interest rates between a maximum and a minimum.</td>

<h3 id=""examples"">Examples</h3>
<p>The interest rate management tools most commonly used by treasurers are forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps and the option products caps/collars/floors. These instruments are flexible, customisable in terms of size, currency and maturity and are traded over-the-counter in large and liquid markets by the world’s largest banks.</p>
<h3 id=""forward-rate-agreements"">Forward rate agreements</h3>
<p>When two parties agree a price for an asset, to be exchanged at a set date in the future, they have agreed a forward contract.</p>
<p>In terms of interest rate risk, this is known as a Forward Rate Agreement (FRA). Corporates taking on debt purchase FRAs to hedge against the possibility of interest rates rising.</p>
<p>The corporate agrees to pay another party an agreed fixed rate of interest at the end of a given time period. Meanwhile, that second party agrees to pay the corporate a variable rate of interest over the same time period. At the end of that agreed time period the two payments are netted and one party receives a payment. As a result, the corporate buying the FRA benefits if interest rates rise, receiving a net payment from the seller of the FRA. The cost of servicing the initial debt also rises – a cost increase which is offset in whole or in part by the income from the FRA. The interest rate risk on the initial debt has been hedged effectively.</p>
<p>Conversely, however, if interest rates fall, the company would have benefitted from reduced interest payments. Some of that benefit is lost, as a payment is made to the counterparty in the FRA. The benefit of purchasing a Forward Rate Agreement, therefore, is that it reduces uncertainty caused by interest rate fluctuations, regardless of the way in which interest rates move.</p>
<h3 id=""interest-rate-swaps"">Interest rate swaps</h3>
<p>A swap is a derivative in which two parties agree to exchange a set of cash flows (or leg) for another set. A notional principal amount is used to calculate each cash flow; these are rarely exchanged by the parties. In an interest rate swap a fixed interest stream is exchanged for a floating stream (or vice versa). Each swap has two counterparties, and therefore in each swap one party pays fixed and receives floating, while the other party receives fixed and pays floating.</p>
<p>The swap rate at any given time is the fixed rate that a counterparty will accept in exchange for Libor. It is the fixed rate at which the present value of both the fixed and floating legs of the swap are, at the initiation of the swap, the same. (This explains why a liquid market can exist – at the beginning of the swap in theory both counterparties are indifferent as to which stream they receive and so the swap has no upfront premium). In practice swaps are used to express interest rate views and off-market swaps can be constructed using different fixed and floating rates. An interest rate swap can be viewed as a pre-packaged strip of FRAs.</p>
<p>There are two basic uses of swaps by non-financial corporates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>A floating-rate borrower converts to a fixed rate.</h5>
<p>In this case a borrower has floating-rate bank debt and carries out a pay-fixed swap, converting the debt to a fixed rate. The two floating-rate streams cancel each other out for the borrower, leaving it to pay only a fixed-rate stream.</p>
<figure class=""center"">
<a class=""enlargeable"" href=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2011/02/2011-02-tt-06-b2b-a-floating-rate-borrower-converts-to-a-fixed-rate.png""><img alt=""Diagram 1: Converting from floating-rate to fixed rate"" height=""143"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2011/02/2011-02-tt-06-b2b-a-floating-rate-borrower-converts-to-a-fixed-rate-t.png"" width=""300""/></a>

<li>
<h5>A fixed-rate borrower converts to a floating rate.</h5>
<p>In this case a borrower has fixed-rate bond debt and undertakes a receive-fixed swap, converting the debt to a floating rate. The two fixed-rate streams cancel each other out for the borrower, leaving it to pay only a floating-rate stream.</p>
<figure class=""center"">
<a class=""enlargeable"" href=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2011/02/2011-02-tt-06-b2b-a-fixed-rate-borrower-converts-to-a-floating-rate.png""><img alt=""Diagram 2: Converting from fixed-rate to floating rate"" height=""141"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2011/02/2011-02-tt-06-b2b-a-fixed-rate-borrower-converts-to-a-floating-rate-t.png"" width=""300""/></a>
</figure>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for example, a company has taken out a floating rate €100m loan. To transform this into a fixed-rate liability it enters into an interest rate swap with a bank under which it agrees to pay the bank agrees to a fixed rate of, say, 5% over three years, and to receive a floating rate based on three-month Euribor plus 100 basis points. If Euribor is 5% at the start of the agreement, the fixed and floating legs are both 6% as the swap is initiated.</p>
<p>If Euribor rises to 6%, the floating amount payable by the bank to the corporate every three months is 7% of €100m divided by four. The company’s payment to the bank on the fixed leg will be less – 6% divided by four. The company uses the difference to pay the floating rate on its loan. Over the life of the swap the company continues to make variable payments on its loan and receives a net cash payment under the swap if rates rise, and makes net payments if they fall. In a fully-hedged transaction, these cash flows offset exactly the changes in the floating rate payments made to the company’s lenders and the net effect on the company is the same as if it had taken out a fixed-rate loan.</p>
<h3 id=""caps-collars-and-floors"">Caps, collars and floors</h3>
<p>A cap is a derivative product in which the buyer receives payments at the end of each period if at the end of the period interest rates exceed an agreed strike price. For example, a borrower in danger of breaching banking covenants on interest cover if Libor rises above 4% could buy a cap with a strike price of 4% with a notional principal amount equal to the amount of their outstanding floating rate debt and with the same maturity as the debt, such that the buyer would receive a payment equal to any interest payments above 4%. As a cap is a series of interest rate call options, a premium is payable, usually upfront.</p>
<p>A floor is simply the opposite of a cap. The buyer receives a payment if rates fall below the pre-agreed strike price. The obvious user of this type of option is a depositor or investor.</p>
<p>A collar is the purchase of a cap and the sale of a floor. The long cap position sets a maximum interest rate payable. The short floor position means that the seller of the floor has to compensate the buyer if rates fall below the strike price. The effect of this is to create a range within which interest rates are free to fluctuate but if rates rise above the cap strike price, then the holder of the collar is compensated for that, and if they fall below the floor strike price, the holder of the collar must pay money to the floor holder. A borrower who has created a collar therefore pays a floating rate within the boundaries set by the two strike prices. Collars are usually constructed so that the sale of the floor cancels out the premium payable for the cap. The borrower therefore obtains zero premium protection if rates rise above the cap strike level but pays for that by taking the risk that rates will fall below the floor strike level. In that case the borrower will not benefit from that rate fall.</p></div>
