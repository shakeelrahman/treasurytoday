<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>China’s regulatory action against a number of technology companies has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the sector, and each individually can be viewed as a microcosm of broader concerns in China. They also shine a light on a debate in China about whether Chinese companies’ expansion should ultimately be encouraged or restricted.</p>
<p>A series of events have been painted broadly as the ‘tech crackdown’ in China. The most visible began in October 2020 with Jack Ma, the Co-Founder of Alibaba Group, being publicly critical of China’s regulators. He was then summoned to a meeting and soon disappeared from public view. The next month, the initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group – the financial affiliate of Alibaba – was suspended. Then there was the June 2021 listing of ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing in New York, which was greeted with enthusiasm by investors. But just days later, cybersecurity regulators in China took action against the company, causing its share value to plummet, and prompting the company to prepare a delisting from the United States.</p>
<p>This also comes against the backdrop of a long-running accounting dispute about US auditors gaining access to the working papers of Chinese companies that are listed on US exchanges. And on a domestic level in China, there has also been a focus on ‘common prosperity’ and addressing the wealth gap in China. This has all created uncertainty for Chinese technology companies, and in March internet analysts at J.P. Morgan China described the sector as “uninvestable” for the next six to 12 months.</p>
<p>There has been a “regulatory whirlwind”, comments Kendra Schaefer, Partner – Tech at Policy Research company Trivium China. She adds that it has caused great uncertainty: “It has given investors whiplash, and no one knows which way to jump,” says Schaefer.</p>
<p>Schaefer explains that a number of things have been happening in parallel. “Five or six regulators at the same time were pursuing their own agendas – they got a tacit green light from Beijing to rein in abuses of power by tech companies. They went after them at the same time for different reasons,” she says.</p>
<p>This includes the State Administration for Market Regulation taking action against e-commerce platforms Alibaba and Meituan for anti-competitive practices. There has also been a crackdown on the online education sector. And there have been data and privacy issues at play, which came to a head just after Didi listed in the United States.</p>
<p>The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) wanted Didi to undergo a cybersecurity assessment before its overseas listing, and Schaefer points to reports that Didi was advised to hold off on its IPO. It is possible, she notes, that because the CAC has not previously been involved in listings, Didi may have interpreted this as a suggestion – rather than an order – because it had not previously been in their purview.</p>
<p>Nan Li, Associate Professor in the Department of Finance at Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, notes that companies like Didi have been collecting vast amounts of data. “They are collecting data on where people are going and some of the locations are actually sensitive,” says Li. This data includes maps and locations that could be issues of national security, and there are concerns about who will be able to access this data if the tech companies expand overseas. “There is some data that is necessary for them to keep and to use, but [the regulators] are still revising how to regulate the data usage for those platforms,” says Li.</p>
<p>Also, notes Professor Li, there are issues about how data is used by any platform company – especially if it is being used for financial services – and the potential for misuse and information asymmetry between the tech giant and the user. She adds that these are not issues that are unique to China – all countries are considering how such companies and their handling of data should be regulated.</p>
<p>Regulation has been an issue with large tech companies, particularly those involved in financial services. While the suspension of Ant Group’s IPO is often viewed as punishment for Jack Ma’s outspoken comments, there are justifiable reasons for the regulator to take action against platform companies like Ant Group and Tencent. Li tells Treasury Today Asia, “They all need better market regulation and appropriate regulation of how they should do financial services on the platform. This is very important – it is necessary regulation of fintech companies and why it was correct to stop the IPO [of Ant Group],” says Li. Ant Group, she comments is “a financial institution under the cloak of a technology company.” She has previously written for SupChina that Ant was involved in deceptive branding, conflicts of interest and predatory lending behaviour that made it necessary for the state to intervene. In this context, the crackdown is not only understandable, but also necessary in order to develop a healthy platform economy and financial system, she argues.</p>
<p>Another major issue that affects overseas listings is the introduction of the US Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was passed in 2020, and stipulates that foreign companies that are listed on US exchanges must make their audit papers available for inspection. If they don’t, they face delisting, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has already publicly mentioned which Chinese stocks are at risk. “The clock is ticking,” says Schaefer for those companies. In the past, this audit paper spat may have been viewed as an “ineffectual stand-off”, but now things are really happening because of that act, says Schaefer. “The real thing to watch is whether or not China ultimately decides to open its books up,” she adds. There have been reports and rumours that progress is being made on the working papers issue, but this still needs to play out.</p>
<p>These are just some of the issues that affect the technology companies that are listed overseas. “There are many streams running in parallel,” says Andrew Collier, Founder and Managing Director of Orient Capital Research. He is also the author of China’s Technology War: Why Beijing Took Down its Tech Giants and describes some of the overarching themes. One is the regulatory catchup that Beijing has had to do in regulating its tech companies. And another major theme, says Collier, is ‘common prosperity’.</p>
<p>Common prosperity is not a new term, but there has been an increase in its usage which has been more noticeable since the tech crackdown. President Xi Jinping officially spelled out his vision for it in 2021, and Collier explains that this provides the context for understanding Xi’s view of how the Chinese state should progress.</p>
<p>Common prosperity is about equality and addressing the wealth gap, and the technology giants are part of it because they are viewed as having amassed too much money and power. One view is that China is returning to the days of the Cultural Revolution and will grab the wealth of the rich; that Alibaba’s Jack Ma got too big for his boots and needed to be brought in line. That, says Professor Li, is a misunderstanding and will not happen. The regulation of the sector and common prosperity, she says, does not mean the state views the technology companies and their founders as having too much money. “The view that this is like the old days of grabbing the wealth of the rich people and distributing it – this is a common misconception. It is a misalignment of all the information,” says Professor Li. She argues that each of the issues affecting the technology companies – the various types of regulatory action – should be viewed independently and not conflated with each other.</p>
<p>Li describes common prosperity as the goal of creating an environment where hard work is rewarded, and also encouraging micro loans and credit to entrepreneurs to enable them to start their own businesses. Introducing these reforms is not an easy job, says Li. Since the 1970s, she notes, China has been transforming itself from a planned economy to a market-based economy. “It’s not an easy job for China; it’s not easy for any country,” she says. “I still feel confident about the outlook of China. We are definitely not going back to the Cultural Revolution period. Outsiders think they are going to grab and remove the wealth of the rich,” says Li. “That is not going to happen,” she says.</p>
<p>In addressing all this for the tech sector, there is a big internal debate going on in China right now, says Schaefer. She describes the two camps as the ‘doves’ and the ‘hawks’. The working paper issue highlights it: the first group is the economists who want foreign trade and want to reach a compromise so that companies can pursue overseas listings. And then there is the other group – the hawks – who see this as a national security issue, that you cannot show these working papers because they contain sensitive data.</p>
<p>This ties in with what Collier says about there being two schools of thought in China at the moment. “The Chinese leadership is torn between those who want to encourage more foreign capital and reform of the financial system, and then those who are concerned about raising capital outside of China,” says Collier.</p>
<p>There is one view that foreign capital is helpful and China needs to be modernised further, says Collier. Then there is the other view that overseas listings would allow the United States access to troves of data – whether that is in the form of data on the journeys of Didi, or the contents of the audit papers.</p>
<p>These issues affect a large number of stocks. “There is a lot of uncertainty,” says Collier, and ultimately many companies may have to delist from exchanges abroad. Hong Kong could potentially be the listing location of choice for those companies that are more sensitive and are facing data restrictions, says Collier.</p>
<p>Schaefer agrees and says, “Some Chinese companies are already starting to think about pursuing a secondary listing in Hong Kong” so they can fall back on that if the worst comes to the worst. Hong Kong is attractive, says Schaefer, for such companies. And for the data heavy companies, Hong Kong may not be considered ‘abroad’ and so they may not need the cybersecurity review that the regulator is insisting on for overseas listings. Does Hong Kong count as abroad for Chinese companies? This is where things get fuzzy, and despite the issuance of some guidelines, Schaefer says this has muddied the waters further. Ultimately, if the regulator decides the company needs one, they have to have one.</p>
<p>While these issues play out, it boils down to two approaches: those who want to make things easier for technology companies and help them go abroad and raise capital, and those who remain concerned about data security and national security issues. Until it is clear which side of the debate the technology companies’ fate will land on, uncertainty will remain for the companies – and investors.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>“We will definitely go the IPO route in the next five years,” says Kane Harrison, Founder and CEO of Wombat, an investment platform for retail investors that has just secured £2m seed funding. “Once we reach 2.5-3 million customers we want to list, allowing our customers to invest in our brand.” Of course, 35-year old Harrison’s listing ambitions for the platform he set up in 2017 to simplify the investment process for young people and encourage saving, will be subject to market conditions. In five year’s time the stock market, currently at record highs, may not be doing as well and today’s investor enthusiasm to buy shares in the digital companies rushing to list is particular to the pandemic and lockdown fast-tracking the shift online.</p>
<p>Yet Harrison’s enthusiasm underscores the boom in a type of corporate funding that has spent the last ten years in the doldrums. According to data provider Refinitiv, companies raised more money through stock market listings in 2020 than in any year besides 2007. For sure, Chinese tech companies face an uncertain regulatory environment following authorities halting the US$37bn Hong Kong and Shanghai IPO of payments firm Ant Group, but businesses have still raised almost US$300bn through flotations globally in 2020, including a record US$159bn in the US. Moreover, important new trends are emerging from the boom. A traditional IPO used to be the only game in town. Now SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are back in fashion and more companies say they want to list directly rather than go through a traditional IPO process.</p>
<h3 id=""going-direct"">Going direct</h3>
<p>The current trend in listing directly began when Spotify went direct in 2018. Back then, executives at the streaming music provider made much of how the company was “re-imagining” the traditional IPO process by ditching the services of big syndicate banks to go it alone on the NYSE. Since then, a small but growing group of companies including Slack, the workplace messaging application, and software companies Palantir and Asana, have also avoided costly investment banking fees to offer shares to institutions and retail investors on an equal basis, allowing them to buy as much as they want and not be held back by allocations. Most recently, Roblox, the video game company, says it too plans to list directly rather than via a conventional IPO.</p>
<p>A direct listing has a few specific characteristics. Companies listing directly aren’t raising more capital – Spotfiy was only listing its outstanding shares (such as those held by employees and early-stage investors), with no plans for either a primary or secondary underwritten offering. Hence there is no need for the services of big syndicate banks responsible for selling shares and drumming up investor interest. This in turn means none of the traditional IPO characteristics like a limited float and preferential treatment for some investors, lock ups and price stabilisation – or the traditional share price “pop.”</p>
<p>Crucially, listing directly on an exchange means the opening share price is established by straight market forces, explains Greg Rodgers, a partner in the New York office of global law firm Latham &amp; Watkins who represented Spotify and the financial advisors in the Asana and Slack direct listings. “Direct listing candidates really value setting the initial trading price at the most efficient price possible. In a traditional IPO, the sale to the public is agreed upon between the company and its underwriters and the market only speaks when the listing on the exchange occurs. Even then, it is somewhat artificial in that the only supply is from the company and the rest is locked up for a traditional 180 days.” In a direct listing, all the available shares for sale and all potential buyers participate in a two-sided price and volume-dependent market, he says. “It is like a normal trading day for a mature public company.”</p>
<h3 id=""money-on-the-table"">Money on the table</h3>
<p>Going direct also prevents money being left on the table, a bugbear in the IPO process amongst treasury teams whereby under-pricing costs companies dear. In a traditional IPO, underwriters typically set an offer price below where the market price is going to open or expected to “pop,” passing along profits to investors. If the company had raised cash at the share price after the “pop” it could have either got more bang for its buck, or sold fewer shares, explains Jay Ritter, an expert on IPOs at the University of Florida. “Money left on the table is money that is not cash on the balance sheet of the company and an opportunity cost,” he says. “The average money left on the table, plus underwriting commissions, worked out at US$200m per IPO last year. IPOs are very expensive.”</p>
<p>Moreover, regulation could boost the number of direct listings. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved rules that allow companies to sell shares in the opening auction when they list directly on NYSE. It gives the green light to raise capital in a direct listing and opens that method of going public to companies needing to raise capital. “As with the direct listings we’ve see to-date, the price for the company shares will be set by pure market forces and the primary sale will make the process more attractive to companies wanting to raise capital,” explains Rodgers, who cautions that details like disclosure and the correct role of the company’s financial advisors in the process still need to be worked out before a “pioneering company” takes the plunge.</p>
<h3 id=""the-hitch"">The hitch</h3>
<p>And there are risks. Despite the benefits, listing direct is only right for companies with strong brands, an easily understood business and investor awareness. “IPOs are sold and not bought,” cautions Jeff Harte, Managing Director, Equity Research at Piper Sandler in Chicago in a reminder of the vital role of banks in selling companies and building muscle behind an IPO. “At the end of the day IPOs are sold and pulling them off without roadshows and sales support of Wall Street is difficult.” For Ritter, this will ultimately confine listing directly to a niche. “Most mid-sized and smaller companies are not going direct,” he says.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, experts flag the process can leave shares thinly followed and without lock-ups, which restrict sales in the early months, vulnerable to falls. An IPO, unlike direct listings, also allow a company to find the sticky public investors at the right price through pre-listing allocations. The Council of Institutional Investors has also cautioned that allowing primary direct floor listing could allow companies to sidestep the typical vetting that comes with a traditional IPO, raising investor risk. “As you can see from Spotify, Slack and Asana, listing directly works best for companies that are fairly large, already have a cross section of investors in their private company investor group, and are going to be well followed by Wall Street analysts and picked up in research coverage,” says Rodgers.</p>
<h3 id=""spacs-are-back"">SPACs are back</h3>
<p>The traditional IPO is also getting a run for its money from SPACs. One of the hottest trends in US investment circles (UK regulation currently discourages SPAC listings) involves so-called blank check companies with an experienced management team and investment focus, but with no assets, floating on the stock market and raising money from investors. The team then hunt and merge with private companies looking to come to market, allowing companies in the SPAC to obtain a stock market listing and have their shares publicly traded for the first time.</p>
<p>Recent corporate names to take the SPAC route include tourism company Virgin Galactic, the US sports betting firm DraftKings and the electric truck maker Nikola. Luminar Technologies, a driverless vehicle technology supplier which came to market via a SPAC in December, made its 25-year old founder a billionaire in the process. According to the website SPACInsider, some 248 SPACs came to market last year raising US$83bn, while 127 SPACs have raised US$37bn so far this year.</p>
<p>SPACs offer treasury teams a quicker route to market and less regulatory bind. Stock market flotations can be drawn out, involving months of presentations to would-be investors, distracting management from the day-to-day running of their company. SPACs can also be an attractive option for a company struggling to show profits. SPAC disclosures put more emphasis on future revenues in contrast to IPO’s which require audited past financial statements, making it a route for loss making or young companies. It can also be easier for companies to negotiate a price or valuation with a SPAC sponsor or management team than it is via the traditional haggle between investment banks and fund managers too. “There aren’t as many regulatory hurdles or filings, and managers can typically do deeper due diligence with a SPAC – investors like this,” adds Harte.</p>
<h3 id=""the-risks"">The risks</h3>
<p>But treasury teams navigating the SPAC route face a number of challenges. SPACs can be hit by muted investor enthusiasm, making it harder to raise money. Investors (those buying the shares in the shell company – not the asset management team behind the SPAC) don’t always get the best deal because the asset management team take 20% of the equity. “It’s pretty much a straight dilution away from investors buying the shares – getting investors interested is a hurdle,” says Harte.</p>
<p>Moreover, underlying companies face giving up a large chunk of equity to the SPAC sponsors. “There is no such thing as a free lunch,” says Rodgers. “Anytime you see people making money, you have to figure out where it’s coming from. SPAC sponsors end up owning a large percentage of a public company for a relatively modest investment, and that comes from the ownership of the SPAC’s target company. Whether that makes sense has to be balanced with the offer on the table.”</p>
<p>Another key risk for treasury teams to weigh is the amount of money the SPAC will deliver to the company. “The process involves quite a lot of uncertainty,” warns Ritter. “From an operating company’s point of view, the company will need to understand the terms of the deal and what percentage of the company is being given up. Moreover, after the deal has been negotiated, the SPAC shareholders still have to approve it and there is some uncertainty for the company as to whether they will. This is the risk.”</p>
<p>There is no doubt it’s the perfect time to IPO. Equity markets are roaring in a sure sign that the bull market is coming to an end. Treasury teams mulling the best route to market should talk to their investment bankers and lawyers, explore the likely valuations through an IPO and factor the risks of each process, the price on offer and the consequences of dilution.</p>
<p>As for Harrison, he is unsure what route he will take. For now, his focus is on ensuring the metrics are in place to attract another round of seed funding come the autumn. “It’s all about traction,” he concludes. “Investors want to see how many customers we are onboarding a week, how our customers are investing, how long they are staying on the platform, and how their use of the platform has changed since they first signed up.”</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>It doesn’t matter if it’s a relatively modest sum involved or a potential record-breaker, if a business is going public, issuing a bond or seeking direct investment, it ought to be aiming high. It should also know that there are ways and means of raising the stakes, and that one of the best tools available to ratchet up the excitement is the corporate roadshow.</p>
<p>When China-based diversified multinational conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Limited debuted on NYSE in 2014, it earnt the as-yet unsurpassed record for the largest ever IPO at US$25bn (this may be surpassed by the planned US$25.6bn Saudi Aramco IPO). In November 2019 the firm was seeking a US$13bn secondary listing in Hong Kong. Roadshows were very much part of its monumental funding effort, with the secondary listing roadshow reported by the FT as being a “week-long” effort.</p>
<p>Whilst the numbers may vary considerably from company to company, the process of meeting potential investors to explain what the business is about and what investment in it could mean, is all about generating excitement and building rapport. As such, every successful roadshow starts with strong stage management and a deep understanding of investor expectations.</p>
<h4 id=""deal-or-no-deal"">Deal or no deal?</h4>
<p>Roadshows can take various forms and can typically be divided into two strands: deal-related, and non-deal related. A deal-related approach announces the intention of a business to come to market or secure further funding. A non-deal approach is intended to offer existing investors a progress update (serving to consolidate the relationship), or perhaps signal future issuance. Whether going public, issuing a bond or seeking direct investment, most firms will appoint an underwriter – usually one of its core banks – to help develop the documentation, work with ratings agencies, and advise on the creation of investor presentations for the roadshow.</p>
<p>When an announcement for a bond or IPO is to be made, the news will typically be spread by the underwriting bank’s sales force to its institutional investor client base. Announcements tend to be picked up quickly by various investor-specific news channels (such as Bond Radar), financial media outlets (such as Bloomberg) and trade press. Depending on the size of the company and the proposed deal, it may also be picked up by mainstream financial media (such as WSJ and FT).</p>
<h4 id=""timing"">Timing</h4>
<p>Where once a roadshow could cover both new issuance and investor updates, more established borrowers tend to divide their roadshow efforts, notes Mark Kitchen, Head of Northern Europe DCM, Bank of America. This means more are now engaging with investors on a non-deal basis by way of a regular (often annual) update, purposefully keeping this at arms-length from any issuance plans. “The rationale for this separation is that when the firm does want to issue, it enables a more nimble and flexible window of activity, helping to minimise market risk,” he says.</p>
<p>Announcing a deal-specific roadshow will be underpinned by some demanding logistics. It will take a few days to set up the meetings, and there will be a few days seeing investors and gathering feedback, after which the company is clear to issue. A minimum of a week will have passed between announcing and being able to execute in the market, notes Kitchen. In a volatile world, over that time, a lot can happen (maybe a provocative tweet from a US President) and the global markets can change quickly; this is a major source of risk for an issuer.</p>
<p>If, however, the investor work has been carried out upfront, for example, around results time, it allows the company to monitor the market closely and pick the day it wishes to issue.</p>
<p>With that timing choice open to it, the company can announce actual issuance on the day, do the book-building in the morning, and pricing that afternoon; its market risk is thus only intra-day. “The nature of some of the macro-economic risks in the current market means that, from a corporate perspective, there will be a preference to try to minimise that risk with intra-day execution,” explains Kitchen. “Issuing without marketing is a risk in itself, but doing it away from a specific trade makes sense.”</p>
<h4 id=""telling-the-story"">Telling the story</h4>
<p>Although different companies will have different views on who precisely gets involved, a debt roadshow is generally orchestrated by the treasurer, usually bringing in the investor relations (IR) team to help pull together a slide-based presentation for potential investors. The underwriting bank will often counsel on the most effective areas of focus for the presentation.</p>
<p>When it comes to meetings, the treasurer will always be part of the process, often with an IR team representative. A smaller company may also call upon the CFO (although some CFOs of larger firms are quite hands-on in this respect too). The aim is to deliver the company story in the most appealing light. The CFO and IR rep will concentrate on the broader strategy of the company and its position in the market, with treasury picking up on treasury policy and core financial metrics such as cash flow.</p>
<p>The meetings will normally be set up by the underwriting bank. It depends on the target area as to how long the roadshow will last; a European event will typically cover three days, visiting London, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt/Munich as part of a well-trodden path. Driven by the issuer’s objectives, there is a decision to be made as to whether the meetings are kept under the radar, with one-to-one (or one-to-two) meetings (usually for the largest institutional investors), versus a more public event where group meetings of up to 20 potential investors are held.</p>
<p>To help tell the best possible company story, companies will need to create a deck of between 25 to 35 slides. At the highest level will be a summary of the company, diving down into more detail about the business units and the markets in which they operate. An explanation of company strategy, and a broad view of company financials, including credit profile, will also be included.</p>
<p>“One area that is gaining a lot more focus, and something we now advise clients to include in a couple of slides, is sustainability,” says Kitchen. “A lot of investors, when looking at credits, will apply an ESG lens to their investment decisions. When telling the company story, it’s important to explain what is being achieved from a sustainability perspective and how ESG elements are impacting strategy.”</p>
<h4 id=""what-to-expect"">What to expect</h4>
<p>To an extent, it depends on how well known the company is as to what happens at the meeting. Broadly, the presentation team must prepare for anything, from getting into the very basics of ‘who we are and what we do’, to some highly detailed questioning on financial metrics by investors.</p>
<p>Where potential investors are up to speed on the business and sector in front of them the meeting will often head straight into a Q&amp;A session. “They often know what they want and what to ask and sometimes the presenting team does not even need to open its presentation pack,” notes Kitchen. Conversely, investors new to the sector and the business may require more background before asking questions.</p>
<p>“The message to treasurers,” says Kitchen, “is to be prepared for both ends of the spectrum: from an investor who has never looked at your name or sector before, to the seasoned analyst who already knows you but has some very detailed questions about the deal.” This means not only getting all the relevant information together but also drafting and rehearsing potential Q&amp;As in advance, covering every potential question. “You get one shot at this in the meeting, if you come across as ill-prepared, it will reflect badly on the company,” he warns.</p>
<p>All aspects of the preparation should bear in mind that different investors have different needs; re-using slides from previous roadshows is not always possible. For example, bond investors will likely focus on mitigating any downside risks. They may seek reassurance that the business can protect its balance sheet to ensure sufficient cash flow is available to pay the coupon and redeem the bond. This is a very different investment proposition to an equity investor who is buying into a growth story and is hoping for a share price that will appreciate over time and who may therefore focus on the upside of entering new markets and major transformation projects.</p>

<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Suzanne Perry, Assistant Group Treasurer and leader of debt IR programme at RELX offers a treasury-eye view of the roadshow</h2>
<div class=""copy__body""><h5>Why do roadshows matter?</h5>
<p>“Roadshows allow direct communication between investors and the corporate to the benefit of both. Investors can expect the corporate to spend the meeting time concentrating on the issues which matter to that investor and it is an opportunity for the corporate to receive direct feedback from the investor on their concerns and investment appetite.”</p>
<h5>Who should get involved?</h5>
<p>“IR is a delicate area and should be restricted to key team members to ensure an accurate and consistent message is presented. At RELX the CFO, CEO, IR team and certain members of the corporate treasury team are authorised to provide information and present to investors either on roadshows or otherwise.”</p>
<h5>What are the preliminary steps for preparing the roadshow, especially for the treasury?</h5>
<p>“The roadshow should be designed so as to achieve maximum impact with the amount of management time available. Likely there will be key investors and locations to target, and these meetings should be the keystones around which the itinerary is put together. Obviously blackout periods prior to results or other announcements should be avoided. It is often helpful to have a hard copy of the investor presentation, although legal advice should be taken as to whether it is appropriate to allow investors to keep the presentation. Legal advice should also be taken to ensure any presentation disclaimers are appropriate.”</p>
<h5>What type and level of information should be offered in a pack – and how should it be presented?</h5>
<p>“Unless the roadshow is to address one specific area, the pack should start at a high level – outlining corporate strategy, financial highlights and so on – before going into more detail in areas that the investors are focused on. This is particularly so if these areas are not usually addressed in routine corporate presentations such as the results announcements. There is a benefit to liaising internally to keep content consistent and at RELX there is a lot of overlap between the equity investor presentations and the debt investor presentations.”</p>
<h5>What should treasurers expect at a meeting, and what happens after?</h5>
<p>“Treasurers should generally check at the start of the meeting how much knowledge of the corporate an investor has. Some investors will need a reminder as to what the company does and why they should invest; some investors will have been investing long-term and have a detailed knowledge and may just want to use the meeting time on Q&amp;A. Investors are generally keen to learn and to make the most of the meeting time, and it is also an opportunity for them to give feedback. There is often no ongoing communication after the meeting unless there is a trigger event, such as a bond issuance.”</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""feedback"">Feedback</h4>
<p>For a non-deal meeting, it is always a good idea to try to get some feedback, to help shape the next presentation more to the investors’ liking, in terms of, for example, content and frequency. The most honest feedback tends to follow post-event, notes Kitchen, making its way to the corporate via its underwriting bank.</p>
<p>On a deal-related roadshow, the focus will be on the likelihood of a transaction and therefore the bank should be far more proactive in following up with potential investors. This should seek to uncover any concerns or issues. Often investors will solicit or provide thoughts around value and pricing, helping to shape the starting point on the book-building phase of a new issue (where pricing is honed progressively until the end-price is agreed).</p>
<p>Overall, investors offering feedback will take a range of approaches, notes Kitchen. “Some offer fulsome feedback early in the process, providing a very tight and aggressive approach that could be construed as forming part of an anchor order,” he comments. Indeed, for a potentially popular issue, he says some investors believe being ultra-helpful may mean receiving a better allocation of the bond if the book is over-subscribed. At the other end of the spectrum, some will wait until they know exactly what the end price is, refraining from offering positive feedback – and thus any indication of interest – so as not to influence pricing (probably in the hope that they get it cheaper).</p>
<h4 id=""roadshow-takeaways"">Roadshow takeaways</h4>
<p>What would a ‘best practice guide to roadshows’ look like? RELX’s Perry offers her top tips for success:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plan well in advance. It is critical to time a roadshow so that as many investors as possible will attend, so picking the right dates is key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are not sure who or where to target, speak to a third party, such as a bank, who understands both your business, and the investors they would expect to see investing, based on their wider market knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have at least two people presenting so that whilst one is talking the other can take notes and pick up on any points which they might want to expand on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that everyone presenting is giving a consistent message and understands what areas they should be taking questions on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be open to any feedback from investors, even if it is not what you were expecting.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>When it comes to comparing the Chinese onshore corporate bond market with developed bond markets across the world, there are many similarities, but there are also some fundamental differences. These include investment platforms, rating methodologies as well as issuer and investor characteristics, not to mention unique local market practices. All of these go hand-in-hand to make investing in the Chinese onshore credit market incredibly challenging.</p>
<p>A decade of financial reform, combined with rapid financial market innovation has increased the range of Chinese credit issuers and the variety of instruments available – contributing to a twelvefold surge in the size of China’s onshore credit market – and contributing to their depth and liquidity.</p>
<p>China’s corporate bonds are traded on multiple platforms, but the interbank market dominates. Local government bonds make up the largest segment of China’s onshore credit market mix while commercial banks are a close second, other issuers include state owned enterprises and private companies.</p>
<p>“Chinese credit market yields are more volatile than those of similar securities in developed markets due to multiple macroeconomic and technical factors,” says Shevlin. “Therefore, credit market investors are dominated by local asset management companies, attracted by their potential for higher investment returns.”</p>
<h3 id=""ratings-different-methodologies"">Ratings – different methodologies</h3>
<p>International investors rely on the long-established international rating agencies when buying credit bonds. Until recently however, none of these had licences to operate in China and their coverage was limited to Chinese issuers who required an international rating due to their foreign bond issuance – a small minority of the domestic credit issuers.</p>
<p>Instead, several domestic rating agencies currently dominate the Chinese onshore rating. “By law, bond issuers are only required to have one rating, making competition between domestic agencies intense and encouraging rating arbitrage,” says Chang.</p>
<p>Local rating agencies have also developed their own unique methodologies – and this has limited investors’ ability to map local ratings to international rating scales. With local rating agencies placing considerable weight on the implicit presence of a government guarantee, the majority of issuers are rated AAA, and there is little relationship between an issuer’s rating, financial strength and credit spread.</p>

<h3 id=""escalating-credit-risks-investors-beware"">Escalating credit risks – investors beware</h3>
<p>Prior to 2014, China’s bond markets had never witnessed a default and investors had never suffered a loss as failing entities were bailed out at the behest of the government. “This practice underpinned the belief that corporate debts would always be underwritten by an implicit government guarantee,” says Shevlin. “The first bond default shocked the market and established a link between risk and return.”</p>
<p>This link was solidified by new regulations designed to stop issuers offering principal guarantees, coupled with a new deposit insurance scheme. Both reforms significantly eroded confidence in the implicit government guarantee and magnified the challenges of investing in the onshore credit market. The sudden seizure of Baoshang Bank in May 2019 highlighted the weakness of smaller commercial banks.</p>
<p>“Investors need to realise that Chinese credit risk is increasing,” says Chang. “The complexity of China’s onshore bond markets highlights the importance of due diligence and rigorous independent analysis, in order to balance the risks and returns of investing in this arena.” He believes that ultimately, credit research is critical; “Chinese credit issuers should primarily be assessed on their standalone capital, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity. Only then should the potential level of government support be considered.”</p>
<p>The Chinese corporate bond market continues to grow in size and importance and is now too large for investors to overlook. Rigorous analysis of issuers and counterparties is critical to understanding the true underlying risk characteristics of onshore Chinese credit risk investments.

<p>Alkane Resources is an Australian gold production company with a multicommodity exploration and development portfolio. Listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, the company has a market capitalisation of almost AU$400m and holds cash and investments of around AU$80m with no debt.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Companies in the mining industry face particular challenges when it comes to managing cash flow and working capital. The sector is highly capital intensive – as James Carter, CFO at Alkane Resources explains, when companies embark on a new mining project, they could spend 12-18 months’ worth of working capital developing a project before receiving any cash flow.</p>
<p>“Another unique aspect of the mining industry is that whether you’re mining in an open pit or starting a new mine underground, is you can be somewhat at the mercy of the natural environment we work in,” Carter explains. “An inevitable challenge is making sure you have sufficient working capital to cope with unforeseen circumstances or delays.”</p>
<p>As a result, mining companies typically need to have several months’ worth of cash set aside in case of delays. For Alkane, which has cash reserves of around AU$80m, a key challenge in the current low interest rate environment was getting the best return on surplus cash – a challenge that the company has tackled by breaking the available cash down into segments. For cash beyond one month, Alkane tends to use higher yielding term deposits. “But for up to 31 days, we have our cash on call to pay for trade creditors, contractors and payroll,” says Carter. “For that type of cash, you’re getting pretty much a zero return.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Carter was looking for a product that would enable the company to achieve a better yield on its short-term cash, without incurring additional risk. “What was important for me and the board was to work with a reliable and investment-grade counterparty that offers same- to next-day liquidity and seamless redemption,” Carter explains.</p>
<h2 id=""solved"" style=""text-align:right;"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Unusually in the mining industry, Alkane has been working with the same transaction bank for the last 50 years – so the board had little experience of embarking on a new relationship. But Carter, who joined the company in October 2018, was able to draw upon his previous knowledge and experience to navigate the process and recommend a suitable partner.</p>
<p>“I had previously worked with J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity when I was at another company during the depths of the global financial crisis – and while many financial institutions were failing, J.P. Morgan was always there as a reliable counterparty,” he explains. “That gave me a lot of comfort when recommending J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity to the board. I had worked with them before, finding the process of investing and redeeming cash very easy.”</p>
<p>Carter says that the chosen solution provides a return on funds “far in excess of a regular call deposit”, with funds available on a same day or overnight basis. “It offers us great flexibility from a reliable counterparty and gives us a higher yield,” he adds. “So it ticks all those boxes. And we just couldn’t find a competing solution in the market.”</p>
<p>Carter adds that the investment process is straightforward to set up and the solution provides a yield without tying up short-term cash. “Given that we’ve been opportunistic with investments that we’ve done from time to time, it gives us more flexibility to have that extra money there,” he says. “Meanwhile, our segmenting approach means our longer-term cash is held in term deposits.”</p>
<p>With Australian-based gold companies currently performing well, Carter notes that many companies in this sector are generating a lot of surplus cash. “While some are paying dividends, I suspect a number of other companies would have the balance sheet to warrant looking at this type of solution,” he concludes.</p></div>

<p>Citi has analysed public financial data from over 250 corporates with its key client base in APAC (ex-Japan), representing a cumulative turnover of almost US$3.4trn between 2013 and 2018. The study revealed a growth in the overall net working capital during this period, with deterioration in the weighted average cash conversion cycle (CCC) which went from 53.1 days to 55.8 days.</p>
<p>This is partly attributable to a consistent deterioration in days sales outstanding (DSO) which grew from 56.3 days to 65 days over the same period, as against days payables outstanding (DPO) which improved from 51 days to 61.8 days.</p>
<p>As part of Citi’s analysis, the CCC drivers were also evaluated by industry sector for a subset of its global key corporate client base. The wide variations in CCC drivers of corporates from within each industry sector underscored the scope for tighter management of working capital, with a view to improve free cash flows and optimise the use of enterprise capital to fund business growth and/or transformation. For some corporates, it is treasury that is at the forefront in leading the charge on working capital efficiency.</p>
<p>To take an example, Henkel, a global leader in Adhesive Technologies, and holding leading positions in many markets and categories of its Laundry &amp; Home Care and Beauty Care businesses around the world, has a strategic focus on sustainable and profitable growth in 2020 and beyond. The company has a strong emphasis on efficient balance sheet management, with a view to maximise free cash flows to fund growth. The pursuit of this strategy has necessitated greater working capital discipline, with Henkel’s treasury team closely monitoring Net Working Capital<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> and other working capital metrics, whilst actively working on initiatives to help release trapped cash in the cash conversion cycle.</p>
<p>Whilst Henkel’s treasury team is engaged on working capital to support business growth priorities, it also needs to monitor the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties on account of global trade tensions, as these have the potential to impact cash flows and working capital requirements.</p>
<p>As it seeks to further sharpen working capital funding decisions, one of the central challenges confronting Henkel’s treasury team is the accuracy of cash flow forecasts. The principal source of the cash forecasting conundrum is accounts receivables, owing to the lack of predictability around customer payment behaviour.</p>
<p>Considering treasury’s efforts to improve the DPO, expanding Henkel’s existing supplier finance programmes by on-boarding more suppliers is one of the key focuses of the purchasing team. Furthermore, whereas the goal is to drive efficiencies on DSO, established modes of payment can present a significant challenge to treasury. For instance, the usage of bank acceptance drafts (BAD) in China, or paper cheques in countries like Thailand and Singapore, lengthen the time taken to convert receivables to cash.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Henkel’s treasury team works in close collaboration with its business teams and with its banking partner. Monthly ‘supplier finance days’ are organised within China, bringing together the purchasing team, suppliers and the bank. These provide a platform to acquaint suppliers with the associated financing programmes and address any concerns. Treasury is also working with its banking partners to collate data towards identifying opportunities to extend supplier financing to additional markets within Asia and expand the scope of these programmes to cover cross-border suppliers.</p>
<p>In parallel, Henkel’s treasury is also focused on opportunities to digitise collections with a view to accelerate DSO, and has initiated a pilot that uses QR codes for instant collections in Singapore to replace paper cheque collections from a select group of customers. The pilot in Singapore is a first step towards replicating similar efforts across Asia. In its effort to streamline the use of BADs in China, treasury has published a policy specifying the eligible draft collections and regulating the end-to-end process.</p>
<p>Focused working capital initiatives have contributed to marked improvements in Henkel’s Net Working Capital ratio. Moreover, the automation of cash application and collections reconciliation processes, through the adoption of QR code-based instant collections, is expected to result in operational efficiency gains and an enhanced customer experience.</p>
<p>Henkel’s example highlights the strategic importance of treasury’s role in working capital management. It demonstrates that where treasury is fully aligned with business teams (in particular procurement and sales), it will be much more effective in supporting and influencing decisions with positive implications on working capital. At Henkel, working capital metrics are embedded into the goals of the relevant business stakeholders, driving alignment and focus across the organisation. In this age of digital transformation, another significant takeaway is the partnership approach adopted by treasury in working with banks, to drive working capital improvement through data analytics and advisory.</p>

<p>Extreme volatility, burdensome regulation and growing investor and issuer appetite for private capital are some of the characteristics of today’s capital markets. They also offer corporates unprecedented cheap money, but that doesn’t come without risk.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>The capital markets have been a fraught place in recent months. Uncharacteristic volatility in global fixed income and plummeting investor confidence make a tricky backdrop for corporates navigating their funding needs. With few alternatives to the capital markets for large companies wanting to tap long-term, cheap finance across diverse investors and products, shifting geopolitical and economic tectonic plates, coupled with innovation, regulation and increasing sources of private finance, make for new rules of engagement. These include taking advantage of unprecedented cheap finance, tapping new pockets in private markets that also provide routes around regulation – and going green.</p>
<h4 id=""paid-to-borrow"">Paid to borrow</h4>
<p>Historically low sovereign bond yields and attractive spreads have made the cost of borrowing for corporates in the debt capital markets cheaper than ever. At the beginning of the year, global software solutions group Wolters Kluwer launched a €1bn European Commercial Paper programme from which the company drew €150 million at the end of June. The new short-term borrowing facility diversifies the company’s funding sources from its existing long-term bonds, credit facility and private placement programmes, allowing it to tap negative short-term rates so that under this programme the company is actually paid for borrowing money. “There is a lot of money in the market at very attractive pricing,” says George Dessing, Executive Vice President in Wolters Kluwer’s treasury and risk department. “Negative yields make a very special funding environment. Money is for free and I think it will remain so for quite a while.”</p>
<h4 id=""cheap-money"">Cheap money</h4>
<p>Indeed, borrowing conditions seem to be getting even more favourable. In the latest trend, low short-term yields have pushed investors further out on the curve in the hunt for returns, allowing companies to lock-in low borrowing costs for longer. “The deepest pool of investor interest in the euro market has always been around the six to eight-year part of curve,” says Roland Broecheler, Executive Director, Debt Capital Markets at Santander. “Now the deepest pool of investor appetite is around ten to 13 years which is allowing issuers to get much longer-term financing at these record low levels.”</p>
<p>Similarly, investors’ hunt for yield is opening up other areas of finance for companies seeking to borrow, like the hybrid market, notes Broecheler. This part of the debt/capital structure offers issuers equity content and investors better returns and is also popular with issuers since it supports their credit rating. “The hybrid market has been very busy recently,” he explains. “Hybrid issuance comes at a significant premium over senior bonds so offers a way for investors to increase their yield when senior debt is very challenging. It’s also a popular option for companies.”</p>
<p>Nor does nervous investors’ demand for safe-haven fixed income assets, despite low returns, show any sign of tiring. Demand for new European corporate issuance has remained strong even though the entire German bund market dropped below zero in August. “After the whole euro bund curve turned negative, we still saw billions of very well-received new corporate supply across the spectrum from two to 30 years, for highly rated and lower rated companies.” says Broecheler.</p>
<h4 id=""risks"">Risks</h4>
<p>Yet today’s low yields do come at a price for issuing companies. Challenging macro data and the risky geopolitical backdrop, particularly the US-China trade war and enduring Brexit chaos, have ushered in unprecedented volatility in recent months. Dovish talk, and actions, from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank hold the markets steady. But any sign of that support waning unleashes extreme volatility – as witnessed in August. It’s in marked contrast to recent years when rock-solid central bank support countered macro news and made almost every day in the debt capital markets a good one. “If central banks don’t deliver what the markets are expecting the capital markets keep focused on macro data and geopolitics and that means more volatility,” says Broechelers.</p>
<p>Navigating day-to-day, and even intra-day volatility, isn’t easy. Positive morning indicators can turn negative by the afternoon. “Every syndicate update call on a bond deal at the moment involves lengthy consideration of the Trump-China trade war, Brexit headwinds and the risk of recession in Germany,” says James Taylor, a Capital Markets Partner at London-based global law firm Mayer Brown. “It’s never been more challenging to find the right pricing that meets the expectations of corporate borrowers and prospective investors alike within set execution windows. The market on a Monday, can look very different come Tuesday.”</p>
<p>Wolters Kluwer always taps the market well in advance of needing the money to avoid execution risk and trusts its strong investor base will see beyond day-to-day volatility. “You don’t want to be out there on that one nasty day. Don’t go when you need the money, go when you can walk away,” advises Dessing.</p>
<p>Nor should companies let today’s cheap money tempt them away from their funding strategies. At Wolters Kluwer, borrowing has three main objectives: either to finance investment in the business; including selective value-add bolt-on acquisitions – expensive in the current climate, maintain optimal leverage or shareholder renumeration. The company increased its dividend to shareholders by 15% in 2018 and plans an up to €250m share buyback in 2019. “We only go to the market according to our strategic plan. This decides the size, timing and currency we tap. It’s great that we can get out money at attractive rates, but it always needs to be allocated effectively.”</p>
<h4 id=""ipos"">IPOs</h4>
<p>European companies wanting to tap a different part of the capital structure via listing will face just as challenging macro conditions. It’s one explanation for the low European issuance of recent years. While the US IPO market has soared thanks to US equities’ rally luring companies to list, in Europe dramatic outflows from European equity funds have impacted the IPO market. Recent research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch found 64 weeks of equity outflows out of the last 66 weeks. Brexit has also taken a toll, with investors withdrawing US$4.2bn from UK equity funds since late May, according to data provider EPFR. The number of UK IPOs fell 44% in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period last year, says EY.</p>
<p>“Corporates tend to list in their local market. But European macro, as evidenced by continued equity outflows, has been a headwind,” says Andrew Briscoe, head of EMEA syndicate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Sellers who are unable to achieve desired valuations may choose to stay private for longer.”</p>
<p>Moreover, European companies grown impatient with lacklustre European equity markets, are increasingly tapping private capital. “We are also seeing more companies, particularly in the tech sector, getting attractive terms from private capital,” says Briscoe. Indicative of the trend is long-term investors like pension funds beefing up their private equity allocations in recent years, he says. “Traditional public market investors have wisened up to this and restructured so they can participate in capital raising in the private markets,” he says. Asset owners now place an estimated 14% of their assets in private markets (mostly private equity and real estate), up from virtually nothing a couple of decades ago, according to Willis Towers Watson.</p>
<p>Briscoe reassures that like all cycles, IPO doldrums won’t last for ever. “Europe has struggled for attention from US investors as a result of poorer macro, but at some stage the valuation disparity will compel them to re-engage, and we have begun to see this change.” In one encouraging sign of the tide turning, merger and acquisition financing is increasingly in demand which can feed into the IPO calendar, he says.</p>
<p>In fact, treasury should start to prepare. As soon as the European equity market returns to health, he advises issuers to go for it. It helps to have first mover advantage and there is only so much dry powder to go around – however good the company. IPOs also tend to succeed – or struggle – in sync, so one poorly received IPO can drag down the next. “In many ways IPOs are an asset class. Although IPO companies may be in different sectors and geographies, interest in IPOs does get influenced by performance of other listings,” says Briscoe.</p>
<h4 id=""difficult-dollars"">Difficult dollars</h4>
<p>It’s not just macro factors that make the capital markets challenging. Treasurers face structural barriers to entry too, like the challenge European corporates face issuing dollar debt because of different regulations and disclosure documentation. Whereas euro and sterling issuance involves similar processes, issuing in dollars is complex and burdensome.</p>
<p>Given that Wolters Kluwer derives more than 60% of its revenue from the US, dollar debt makes sense as a natural hedge. But the company has never issued in dollars, and currently accesses its dollar finance needs via a multi-currency credit facility instead. “Dollar financing comes with real challenges. We would have to study a new legal roadmap with potential governance and compliance restrictions,” says Dessing.</p>
<p>It’s not a burning frustration because euro financing is cheaper than dollars. Today the bond market prices a ten-year euro benchmark issuance with negative interest rates versus the US where corporates are still paying around 1.5%. That’s only the market or mid swap rate, so without the credit spreads. “It’s still cheaper for us to borrow in euros,” says Dessing. Any decision to issue in dollars would also need careful analysis of how much dollar issuance the company needs, its requirement for an internal or natural hedge, and how often it wants to tap the market. “It also means multiple dollar issuance over the number of years of the issue. We are already tapping the euro market and there is a question mark as to whether we have sufficient liquidity needs to have dollar debt issuance too.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a nice option to have.</p>
<h4 id=""regulatory-bind"">Regulatory bind</h4>
<p>Post-financial crisis regulation like Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Transparency Directive is also a headache for companies tapping the European debt market. It is starting to trigger new patterns in corporate issuance as some companies move some of their funding needs from European regulated markets to other products and jurisdictions. Growth in unlisted private placements is a key example, evident in Germany’s Schuldschein market, a hidden corner of borrowing that doesn’t tap bank loans or bonds, and which has tripled in recent years.</p>
<p>These instruments don’t require a prospectus or costly documents prepared by lawyers because there is no listing requirement, explains Mayer Brown’s Taylor. “Corporate treasurers who have issued benchmark bonds on regulated markets are now deciding that instead of doing repeat deals on listed markets, issuing alternative products such as a Schuldschein saves on costs and offers real liquidity.”</p>
<p>In another trend, European corporates are also tapping the US private placement market. Not only is the regulation simpler, it offers alternative maturities allowing companies to slice and dice their issuance in line with their own, and investor base needs. “A US$500m issue could be divided into, for example, five different tranches with different tenors and pricing,” says Broecheler. This market also allows delayed drawdown for corporates, meaning they can lock in cheap borrowing for money they won’t have to draw for up to two years. “This is impossible in the public bond market but has now become a staple diet for many European corporates,” he says.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Europe’s listed high-yield market is increasingly migrating from EEA regulated markets to locations outside Europe’s regulatory reach. For example, the Guernsey-based International Stock Exchange, or TISE, has now become the market of choice for new issuers of high-yield bonds, says Taylor. “Issuers are listing their high-yield bonds away from EEA regulated markets, with consent of the investor base, because they are not subject to the same regulation.”</p>
<p>According to TISE’s website, its high-yield bond issuers include a mix of public and private European and US companies, some of which are the most internationally recognised brands or global leaders in their industries. “The listings have included both new issuances and migrations from EU exchanges as issuers and their advisers are attracted by our robust and proportionate rules for listing HYBs,” it says.</p>
<h4 id=""perfect-union"">Perfect union</h4>
<p>Regulation is also crimping growth in other important corners of Europe’s capital market. Deepening and integrating regional markets in accordance with the EU’s Capital Markets Union (CMU) initiative has stalled, most notably around efforts to draw retail investors into the bond market to help finance SMEs.</p>
<p>EU regulation around prescriptive bond prospectuses and the need for additional marketing materials are to blame, says Taylor. “This kind of regulation is difficult and complicated for SME issuers to understand. Regulation is actually moving in the opposite direction of where the CMU wants to go,” he says, observing that similar challenges befell London’s Order book for Retail Bonds (ORB) market which tried to open up the bond market to retail investors in 2012. “The disclosure requirements and prospectus companies needed to list was prescriptive, burdensome and costly for issuers.”</p>
<h4 id=""ebb-and-flow"">Ebb and Flow</h4>
<p>New streams of finance are testimony to the constant innovation and competition of the capital markets. If one source wains, new sources quickly appear. For food and catering group Compass, the arrival of green bonds and their growing pricing advantages over browner siblings encapsulates that innovation. “The money is starting to talk,” says Deputy Treasurer Ben Walters. “Pretty much every time we talk to a bank about raising finance, this is on the agenda. Investors want to invest in sustainability and there isn’t enough supply.”</p>
<p>The company doesn’t have a date for a green debut yet, but is actively exploring the best approach, looking particularly at which parts of its business it could audit and report sustainability milestones. Issuance focused on water usage or food waste are possible areas Walker enthuses, noting that green issuance is a much bigger undertaking than traditional capital market issuance. “It’s not just treasury involved. The whole company, from corporate social responsibility teams to investor relations and the individual parts of the business that are tracking and auditing sustainability, need to be on board.”</p>
<p>European companies’ dependence on bank financing has fallen during the past decade but remains almost twice as high as in the US, according the ECB. Challenges and barriers remain, none more so than today’s whippy markets. But for established and thriving companies, the capital markets is still the easiest way of raising money. “We see good demand in all but the toughest markets,” concludes Walters. “The capital markets still give us the most competitive pricing out there.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>The US yield curve has been flattening for a long period of time. The difference between interest rates on two-year and ten-year US government bonds was only 20 basis points in late September and had risen to 30 basis points by mid-October. This is generally considered to be a logical development, as the market has been assuming US economic growth will decline next year as the effect of fiscal stimulus fades and higher interest rates start to bite against a backdrop of soaring debts and a strengthening of the dollar exchange rate. Given this outlook, inflation will come under downward pressure next year, forcing the Fed to stop hiking rates or to start cutting them.</em></p>
<p>However, it is also possible to have a different view. Robust US economic data has emerged lately, alongside very strong wage growth, and the outlook on both these fronts remains positive. In addition, oil prices have risen and higher import tariffs will drive up prices of imported goods. This could easily lead to higher inflation data before long. This could give rise to higher wage demands, higher consumption growth and surprisingly strong economic growth.</p>
<p>All that begs the question: does the flattening yield curve reflect bond buyer sentiment that they do not see interest rates rising to much higher levels in the future? Or is the flattening caused by foreign capital that was attracted by higher interest rates, by central banks purchasing massive amounts of long-term bonds, and by pension funds and insurers receiving fiscal incentives to purchase bonds on a large scale?</p>
<p>At the moment, the recent upward outbreak in terms of interest rates seems to have been caused by a combination of factors: improved US economic data; rapidly deteriorating supply/demand ratios due to much higher US government deficits; and a shift from QE to QT by the biggest central banks since October.</p>

<p>However, the recent bout of surprisingly strong economic growth data could easily be a temporary phenomenon. In addition, higher interest rates would impact the emerging markets, with Europe being affected indirectly. They could also end up undermining themselves because credit spreads would (ultimately) rise rapidly and lead to share prices falling. That would likely decelerate the US economy. In addition, investors would purchase US government bonds as a safe haven.</p>
<p>In other words, interest rates could rise for a short period of time, but the tide would turn fairly soon afterwards. The direction and strength of US wage increases and inflation going forwards is therefore of crucial importance. The more wages and inflation rise, the more powerful the upward pressure on US interest rates will be.</p>
<p>More specifically, we anticipate the following scenarios for rates and market prices going forwards.</p>
<h3 id=""us-interest-rates"">US interest rates</h3>
<p>We believe that, for the time being, the US economy will continue to grow at a higher pace than potential growth. This will soon lead to additional wage increases and higher inflation. Higher import tariffs will also contribute towards inflationary pressure.</p>
<p>On that basis, we believe upward pressure on US interest rates will, on balance, intensify considerably over the next couple of months and that the Fed will raise its short-term interest rates in December, however we do not believe interest rates will climb in a straight line. We expect the dollar to strengthen before long, resulting in mounting problems for the emerging markets. In such an environment, US credit spreads would rise and share prices would decline.</p>
<figure class=""center"" style=""text-align:center;"">

<h5 id=""chart-02"">Chart 2: US ten-year treasury note yield</h5>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 index could fairly easily slide down to approximately 2,500 (at the time of writing the S&amp;P 500 traded around 2,760). This would probably be enough for the Fed to pause the process of rate hikes. Long-term interest rates would then probably decline considerably for a brief period of time. Lower interest rates would subsequently boost asset prices and drive up economic growth.</p>
<p>We see the Fed pursuing a monetary policy that will allow growth to remain high enough for inflation to rise. That suggests to us that, following the hike in short-term interest rates in December, the Fed will wait for about two quarters before resuming its hikes and that short-term interest rates will ultimately be at around 4.5% by 2020.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, we believe interest rates on ten-year US government bonds will continue to rise to 3.35-3.5%, after which they will fall back to 2.75-3%. In the ensuing period, the long-term uptrend will continue. As a result, we expect ten-year interest rates to be at approximately 5% by 2020.</p>
<h3 id=""european-interest-rates"">European interest rates</h3>
<p>When we consider Europe we see rising tensions within the EMU as a result of the Italian government budget as perhaps the most important element impacting the outlook for the region. Rome assumes its budget deficit will be 2.4% of GDP in 2019; with the deficit expected to slowly decline on the expectation of higher economic growth in Italy. Many economists, however, doubt Italy will be able to achieve such an outcome. That lack of confidence in the near-term outlook for Italy suggests to us that, for the time being, a flight to German and Dutch bonds will become increasingly evident.</p>
<p>Yet German and Dutch government bond yields will also be influenced by interest rate developments in the US. Moreover, the above-mentioned negative developments will be partially offset by a weaker euro and the associated improved outlook for exports.</p>
<p>Under such a scenario, we believe interest rates on ten-year German government bonds will continue to rise to approximately 0.65%, after which they will decline to approximately 0.35% before the long-term uptrend continues. As a result, we expect ten-year interest rates to be above 1% in the course of 2019, and just below 2% by 2020. The ECB will initially hike its short-term interest rates by 0.25 percentage points every two quarters, after which it will hike its rates by 0.25 percentage points every quarter.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>A credit rating can offer treasurers a means of accessing diversified sources of funding. Given the economic and geopolitical uncertainty that prevails in many parts of the world, perhaps it is time to consider the value of an independent assessment of your organisation’s creditworthiness. Treasury Today takes a back to basics look at what a credit rating really means.</em></p>
<p>There are many reasons why a credit rating may be desirable in the corporate sector. Every company needs to be prepared for future financial events, this being a key role for the treasurer. With a notable trend in the UK over the last few years, following the US example, for diversifying away from bank borrowing and instead heading towards capital market and private placement funding, a credit rating can become an integral part of an organisation’s future growth plans.</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-a-credit-rating"">What is a credit rating?</h3>
<p>A credit rating is a considered, forward-looking opinion offered by a professional independent credit rating agency (CRA) concerning the relative ability of the rated entity (such as a corporate or a bank) to meet its financial commitments.</p>
<p>The main distinction within the scope of a rating is between the public, the private and the confidential. A public rating is a highly visible means of articulating the entity’s credit story to a broad sweep of stakeholders, including investors and analysts, helping them to form more accurate assessments of any investment or lending decisions concerning that entity.</p>
<p>Ratings that are offered privately may be used to support an entity’s private funding exercise, in which it may be seeking to better articulate its own credit story to, for example, the private placement or direct investment market. A private rating story may also be told to select business counterparts, perhaps prior to a corporate establishing a significant new trading relationship or in the negotiation of new commercial terms.</p>
<p>The advantage of a private rating is that it enables the company to understand the way in which external parties view its credit status, how the agency rates it relative to its peers, and also to understand the key ratings drivers in terms of its ongoing ratings performance. It will then be the decision of the company – not the CRA – to choose when (and if) it wishes to make its rating public, sharing with a broad set of market counterparts.</p>
<p>It may be that a company wishes only to dip a tentative toe in the credit rating pool, in which case it may opt for a confidential rating, giving it time to internally digest the information. Confidential ratings may be used as part of an internal benchmarking exercise, where an entity requires a comparison with its publicly-rated competitors. This understanding can help it to develop its own business and commercial strategies.</p>
<p>The process of investigation to reach a rating decision is the same in all cases. The rated business can terminate its relationship with the CRA at any time.</p>
<h3 id=""rating-purpose"">Rating purpose</h3>
<p>The main aim of a credit rating is to offer a transparent, consistent and independent assessment of an entity’s creditworthiness. This helps the accurate pricing of credit risk for that business.</p>
<p>An entity may call upon the opinions of more than one CRA, this decision largely depending upon factors such as purpose or geography.</p>
<p>Achieving a rating means the entity will have undergone a high level of disclosure and evaluation. For investors, ratings are commonly seen as a trusted benchmark when making investment decisions.</p>
<p>The principal benefit of a rating is therefore to give increased comfort to stakeholders that the holder, having undergone independent analysis, has been independently and soundly judged on the basis for which the rating has been applied. For the rated corporate, it can be a means of opening up a wider pool of investors or of securing improved debt pricing.</p>
<p>Once issued, a public credit rating will be continually monitored and assessed by the issuing CRA in terms of the entity’s performance. This provides stakeholders with as accurate, timely and consistent a picture of that entity’s relative creditworthiness as is possible.</p>
<p>Of course, it is up to each market constituent to decide to what extent it incorporates the rating into its decision-making. Each will call upon their own additional sources of data and information, including the more detailed ‘personal’ story of the target company.</p>
<h3 id=""cras"">CRAs</h3>
<p>Moody, S&amp;P and Fitch today represent the Big Three, issuing an estimated 95% of the world’s ratings. They are similar of purpose, but nuanced differences are observable. Each has its own rating scale although the scales do offer equivalency, so can be said to offer a different way of expressing the same view.</p>
<p>However, each also publishes its own rating criteria which means an offered rating can vary from one CRA to another, based on a view of the same entity. The three main CRAs do not all operate in the same markets and there may be some jurisdictions that one covers that the others do not.</p>
<p>There are almost 100 other credit rating agencies and organisations spread across more than 40 countries globally. All are smaller than the Big Three, some of these concern themselves only with domestic ratings, their relative merit being based on deep local market knowledge and, arguably, cost for the entity being rated. On the latter, CRA fees are typically charged for the initial rating and for the necessary ongoing surveillance of the entity’s performance.</p>
<p>The Big Three are more widely known but the choice of CRA might depend on a number of factors. These might include the size of the rated company, the location of its operating activities and its head office or group treasury, the volume of debt being sought, and locations in which it plans to tap the capital markets, use long-term bank funding or seek direct investment from institutional investors.</p>
<h3 id=""ratings-advisor"">Ratings advisor</h3>
<p>The rating process can be quite straightforward, especially for listed companies used to dealing with equity analysts, although the equity analyst’s focus is more on assessing share value than the CRA’s emphasis on creditworthiness.</p>
<p>However, many businesses seeking an initial rating, or those with challenging operating circumstances (such as a difficult jurisdiction or where liquidity is a perceived issue), do decide to use a ratings advisor to ensure their business is accurately represented and thus the rating fairly reflects the perceived risk.</p>
<p>Advisors will often be connected to the applicant’s lead bank, particularly where bond issuance is the goal, but could equally be a debt advisor in the relevant market. The advisor’s job is to steer its client through the process.</p>

<h3 id=""starting-out"">Starting out</h3>
<p>The key to success with an initial rating is effective information gathering. There are two broad corporate-specific (as opposed to general market) categories here.</p>
<p>Qualitative data will present factors such as industry risks, competitive position of the business, the state of corporate governance, management experience, anticipated transformative events (such as major M&amp;A), product portfolio, geographical presence, operational scale and flexibility.</p>
<p>Quantitative data will also be sought, including numerical elements such as audited accounts, financial performance (cash flow, profitability and so on), financial position (including capital structure and level of gearing), and how financial risks such as funding and liquidity are managed.</p>
<p>There are two additional practical considerations for the corporate. The CRA will require a formal ratings presentation of the key facts and figures. This entails a detailed face-to-face Q&amp;A session with senior management.</p>
<p>A decision must be taken early on as to who is best placed to meet the CRA to present the right picture. Usually this will involve the CEO, CFO, COO and the Group Treasurer. All personnel will need to be both available and fully briefed on the process. CRAs do not give advice so the presentation may be prepared in-house by the company or with the guidance of a ratings advisor.</p>
<p>The second point for consideration concerns the likely request by the CRA for confidential information from the corporate. A preparatory internal discussion on what can and cannot be disclosed is necessary to prevent the process from grinding to a halt but principally to help the CRA gain the most accurate impression of the business.</p>
<p>The corporate is not obliged to give any confidential information, but in the interest of gaining an accurate rating, the business should be prepared to be as transparent as possible.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a rating must be forward-looking, so history is never going to be the sole source of information. Forecast data will therefore be required. It is likely that, once all data has been aggregated, stress testing certain scenarios will help the CRA form its opinion.</p>
<h3 id=""fair-judgement"">Fair judgement</h3>
<p>When rating a corporate, CRA analysts will source and sift a wide range of public and private qualitative and quantitative data.</p>
<p>The reality of deriving a credit rating is complex for the CRA not least because it must put its view into a very broad commercial context. By assigning a rating, the CRA is not just providing an opinion and a rationale about a company and its role in its operating sector but it is also necessarily comparing it objectively to all the other companies that it rates.</p>
<p>Using a common language to discuss credit quality thus means an individual rating from one CRA allows an investor to compare relative creditworthiness regardless of the class of debt it is applied to. Although not all CRAs will take the same view of that creditworthiness, well-known equivalency amongst their ratings make for easy comparison.</p>
<h3 id=""a-to-d-of-ratings"">A to D of ratings</h3>
<p>Issuers will normally be given a rating as a business. In addition, all its debt issuances can be rated. If, for some reason, the company does not agree with the rating decision it can appeal to the CRA if it provides materially new or additional information, but there is no specific right to do so.</p>
<p>Ratings range from investment grade (where, for example, S&amp;P’s AAA is at the top, down to its BBB- at the bottom) to the non-investment or high-yield grade, which for S&amp;P ranges from BB+ down to D (D being a state of default).</p>
<p>For all but defaulted ratings, or very low-rated issuers, where default risk is already very high in the ‘C’ to ‘CCC’ rating categories, the CRAs also offer a ‘rating outlook’ to guide investors on the likely direction of their rating over a one- or two-year period.</p>
<p>This dynamic assessment ranges between ‘positive’, ‘stable’ or ‘negative’. This comes with the option of placing the issuer on a shorter timeframe (three to six months) ‘rating watch’ where events dictate, again citing a negative or positive stance based on the expected outcome of a major event (such as an M&amp;A).</p>
<p>A ratings watch can be applied to a business when something material is expected to change its credit profile; a debt-funded acquisition that might materially affect the leverage metrics, for example. A rated company will already have agreed ‘rating headroom’ at its existing rating level whereby it has a degree of latitude before it would become necessary to consider changing the rating.</p>
<h3 id=""being-junk"">Being junk</h3>
<p>Most businesses will spend a long time considering the prospect of securing a rating. If they have used the services of a ratings advisor to help them consider their options, it may become apparent that the they will not receive the expected rating. Some may not pursue it any further but there is still value in undertaking the rating process, as an input to their strategic decision-making or as a snap-shot of current performance.</p>
<p>For companies that know from the outset that they are not at the higher end of the scale, or for those that are downgraded, even if they are moved into ‘junk’ territory (junk is predominantly an emotive investor term, CRAs prefer ‘high-yield’ or ‘non-investment grade’), CRAs will continue rating it all the while there is debt outstanding.</p>
<p>If the information required to maintain the rating is not available (such as if the company is in liquidation), the rating can be withdrawn by the CRA but generally, regardless of rating level, investors would want and need a rating on all outstanding debt; being able to provide it is beneficial.</p>
<p>Although a low rating may be seen as undesirable, the high-yield end of the investment spectrum it opens up for the holder still has an important role to play. An entity can elect to operate a capital structure that provides an optimal return for its shareholders. It could, for example, decide to operate as a highly leveraged company, possibly resulting in non-investment grade status. It is the company’s decision as to what capital structure it feels is appropriate for itself and for its shareholders but there is an investor base covering all ends of the ratings spectrum.</p>
<h3 id=""managing-the-rating"">Managing the rating</h3>
<p>A CRA will use multiple sources of information to regularly update its rating opinions. But between CRA and corporate, there is an expectation of good communication and flow of information. A sensible and reasonable level of transparency is therefore key to the success of the relationship. All ratings are subject to regular reviews by the CRA’s rating committee, to ensure its rating opinion stays current and is at least somewhat resilient to everyday market volatility.</p>
<p>This requires the identification and notification in advance by the corporate of any events that could influence the rating. The CRA should not be finding out about major events through media reports. Such events might include planned M&amp;A or divestments, a new market or strategic direction, or a profits warning. A list of the company’s top ten exposures, or projections for the next two or five-year period, for example, may also be requested.</p>
<p>Volunteering information on transformative events (such as an acquisition) avoids the risk of the corporate being placed on review, possibly for a downgrade, giving the CRA time to formulate a full opinion on the significance of that event in terms of the corporate’s solvency position.</p>
<p>Where highly confidential information is called for, the corporate will already have made its decision on what it will reveal. But the CRA will only use that information to help inform its own opinion and prior to any public announcement (for a public rating), it will usually consult with the corporate to ensure that nothing contained therein will be to the detriment of the corporate and its stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id=""value-adding-exercise"">Value-adding exercise</h3>
<p>Managing a rating is an ongoing process; for it to be useful for a wide range of stakeholders, the need is to keep it current at all times. To get the most out of the ratings process, it is advisable for the corporate not to see it as a test to be endured but instead to use it as an opportunity to add value to the business. Not only can a credit rating provide access to alternative funding sources but, in its assessment, the CRA will sometimes observe key strengths or greater risks within the organisation. Ideally, these impartial expert views should be used to make positive changes within.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>2017 is certainly shaping up to be the year of living uncertainly, as geopolitical changes and challenges rattle markets.</p>
<p>And with record debt loads reaching maturity in Singapore – particularly in the oil and gas, mining, commodities and shipping sectors – some may find themselves quickly squeezed out of the traditional bank and bond finance markets. Recent defaults in the Singapore dollar markets have already slowed that market.</p>
<p>The key is to start researching scenarios and alternatives now, not when doors are already closed.</p>
<p>It is not all doom and gloom, despite the headlines. Strong credits will always be able to tap the capital markets as investors search for less risky homes for their cash in a volatile world.</p>
<p>Also, the negative interest rate environment in Europe is turning investors towards Asia for yield – a number of Asian credits recently raised funds at really attractive pricing from the European markets.</p>
<p>European markets aside, there will always be issue windows of lower volatility during the year, but you must be ready to act. Establishing a medium-term note (MTN) programme will allow you to be ready to tap markets as and when issue windows open.</p>
<p>Even if the capital markets are closed to you, the Asian loan markets are still fairly liquid. Again, we’re seeing a lot of issuers unable to access the debt markets, tapping the loan markets to refinance existing bonds and notes instead.</p>
<p>Those organisations funded through the bond markets may be able to entice bondholders to exchange existing bonds for new bonds with an extended maturity, by offering margin and security incentives.</p>
<p>Companies that are primarily bank funded may be able to negotiate payment deferrals, or ‘amend and extend’ deals. Much will depend on whether you will be able to refinance at the end of the extension, perhaps having de-leveraged via asset sales, and by your ability to meet ongoing interest expenses.</p>
<p>It won’t necessarily be a cheap option. Expect additional fees and increased margin, and possibly additional security requirements, tighter financial covenants and more regular and detailed reporting obligations.</p>
<p>If bank or market funding is no longer an option, alternative capital or “special situation finance” is a fast-developing source of bespoke finance for fundamentally sound businesses facing liquidity constraints or additional capital needs.</p>
<p>While more expensive than traditional bank and bond markets, it can provide a flexible breathing space to undertake restructuring or turnaround measures where bank and bond markets are no longer willing to refinance or extend.</p>
<p>If your company is significantly over leveraged, alternative capital is unlikely to provide a full solution. Some degree of restructuring may be required to ‘right size’ the company’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>Again, early intervention, together with specialist financial and legal advice is critical. Restructuring and insolvency law regimes across Asia have been evolving rapidly, as has the sophistication of the market.</p>
<p>A number of tools are available for companies to implement sensible financial restructurings to reduce a company’s debt load (typically as part of a ‘debt for equity swap’), some of which can be implemented even where there are minority dissenting creditors.</p>
<p>In particular, recent government proposals to radically reform Singapore’s restructuring regime are particularly welcome news for local and regionally based borrowers and issuers looking for a local solution to financing problems.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Managing liquidity risk is a key strategic function of CFOs and corporate treasurers. CFOs and treasurers have to focus on four critical activities to successfully manage the “wall of debt”.</p>
<h5>Know your liquidity position</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build a taskforce to drive and enhance cash forecasting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a good assessment of how much cash your company needs over the next 12 to 24 months. Be as granular as possible and perform stress tests for worst case scenarios.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Diversify funding source</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pay for insurance and secure as many credit facilities and funding sources as possible, even if that entails paying commitment fees for credit lines that may not be drawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think outside the box to explore financing beyond the traditional bank and bond market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Engage external advisors</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In emergency situations, it is common for business leaders to identify talent gaps in the organisation. This is usually where external advisors can help to navigate the complexity of your company having to react to short-term financial market pressures and executing long-term plans to enhance the organisation’s liquidity risk management function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Communicate</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clear stakeholder communication is important, especially during this period. Bankers, shareholders and investors are critical to your success. They need to understand the financial position and operational priorities of your companies in order to help. Designate a senior member of the management team to engage with key stakeholders if your company does not have an investor relations function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, after surmounting this “wall of debt”, it is important for companies to invest in talent and technology to drive cash visibility as well as perform regular risk assessments.</p></div>

<p>One of the fundamental differences between capital markets and traditional bank debt lies in the tradability of bonds as securities: unlike bank debt, borrowers (ie issuers of debt securities) from the international capital markets do not typically know who their creditors (ie bondholders) are from one day to the next.</p>
<p>The increasing adoption of the immobilisation of debt securities in clearing systems (where a global security is registered in the name of, or held by, a nominee for the relevant clearing system), with the increasing velocity of trading that that has led to, has amplified the anonymity of the ultimate beneficial owners of the underlying debt securities to their issuers. As such, the first step of identifying bondholders to engage with can present a significant challenge, even before refinancing options are considered or proposed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the term “liability management” is used to describe a variety of procedures and techniques used by debt capital markets issuers for the purposes of buying back, exchanging or altering the terms of outstanding bonds in order to restructure – or “manage” – their balance sheet liabilities.</p>
<p>In light of the difficulties inherent in seeking to restructure capital markets debt given the anonymity of bondholders. Advanced planning and early engagement with investment banking and legal advisers who have experience in the application of these procedures is crucial. Having a knowledge of the investor profile in the debt securities in question, is also vital to any successful refinancing, restructuring or balance sheet optimisation exercise.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the context of loan transactions, early engagement with lenders and (if the situation merits) advice from a professional financial adviser on options for refinancing and restructuring, can have a critical impact on outcomes. Refinancing options may fall away if not implemented promptly, or if borrowers seek to negotiate terms too heavily, and this may leave borrowers with options that are less likely to preserve value, such as restructuring, dilutive equity raising or accelerated M&amp;A disposals.</p>
<p>In circumstances where these outcomes might be possible, even if uncertain, it is important that borrowers begin to plan their approach at an early stage, with the benefit of expert advice, in order to navigate the complex interplay between different stakeholders (including shareholders, lenders, bondholders, trade creditors, employees, the tax authorities and any other relevant government entities). This will help to ensure the best possible outcome for the company and provide a sustainable platform for future profitability.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4>Tell us a bit about yourself and your background. How did you get into fintech and why did you want to build a solution for the capital markets?</h4>
<p>Before founding Overbond, I spent over ten years in capital markets and technology. This included leading numerous large digital transformation projects at global banks including Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon. I also have experience working on the trading floor for CIBC Fixed Income in Toronto trading structured products. Through all these experiences I have noticed numerous inefficiencies in the financial world and especially in the capital markets and the primary bond origination process.</p>
<h4>What makes fintech such an exciting space and what do you find most interesting about it?</h4>
<p>Innovation in the securities market is not only long overdue, but essential in driving a more efficient and collaborative bond issuance process. It’s very important to see a fintech start-up delivering on its vision for a completely digital bond market that benefits issuers, dealers, and investors. It is incredibly rewarding to transform what is now a largely manual, legacy system so that all participants in the bond market benefit from the increased transparency and efficiencies.</p>
<h4>How did you find the transition from the consulting/banking industry to building a fintech product?</h4>
<p>The transition from the client focus perspective was really non-existent, I continued to think about the same type of clients and how we can bring value to them by solving their core operational, technology or process problems. In that regard, being laser-focused on client value, fintech providers and consulting providers are very similar.</p>
<h4>Does regulation pose a challenge to fintech?</h4>
<p>Regulation is actually helping drive adoption of fintech solutions in the primary bond issuance space. MAR regulation out of Europe in particular and its extraterritorial implications to institutions across the larger global capital markets community mandates higher scrutiny in the ‘sounding’ process – which is the pre-deal launch communication that Overbond specialises in. To ensure compliance with MAR across the global dealer community, the Overbond platform streamlines deal and non-deal related communication.</p>
<h4>How do you expect fintech to develop, especially in the corporate space, in the years to come?</h4>
<p>Transparency Market Research reported that the market for predictive analytics software will reach US$6.5bn by 2019. That’s because predictive intelligence can increase accuracy in decision-making, and subsequently profitability. The market is already showing indications of significant success. Unsurprisingly, innovators developing applications within financial services are growing bolder in their efforts to perform tasks that may have seemed impossible just a few years ago.</p>
<h4>Where do you think that fintech can have a real impact for corporate treasurers?</h4>
<p>There will be many areas where fintech can deliver significant benefit to treasurers, and we believe that improving how they monitor their borrowing programme and how they undergo analysis and due diligence for new bond issuers is one of the most exciting. By digitising the entire deal execution process, issuers can get to market faster to take advantage of favourable market timing and access a broader investor base and we really feel this will impact treasurers in the most positive way.</p>
<p>This will help reduce the cost of new issuance by standardising all aspects of deal execution, drive operational efficiencies by reducing the issuance time and provide an opportunity to optimise cash management by enabling opportunistic offerings. All these aspects directly help treasurers’ mandates.</p>
<p>What is more, issuers can also manage funding targets with dealers and investors, allowing for a more vibrant and efficient primary market process. Issuers can access valuable market insights to make sound funding decisions and build stronger relationships with their investor base.</p>
<h3 id=""digital-bond-origination-in-action"">Digital bond origination in action</h3>
<p>The bond issuance process is outdated and is ripe for change, at least that is the view of Vuk Magdelinic, CEO at Overbond. And his company is looking to bring the industry into the 21<sup>st</sup> century by making the space more digital, transparent, and secure.</p>
<p>“Fixed income capital markets, and more specifically bond origination within it, is one of the few asset classes still relying on time-consuming, manual processes,” says Magdelinic. “Emails, spreadsheets, and phone calls are still the main channels for information exchange for issuers, dealers and investors, with dealers sending upwards of hundreds of millions of bond market update emails globally and treasurers spending hundreds of thousands of hours managing bond market information per year.”</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Overbond</em></p>
<p>As the first end-to-end new bond issuance platform, Overbond is looking to transform how global investment banks, institutional investors, corporations, and governments connect by digitising and streamlining all aspects of primary bond origination workflow.</p>
<h3 id=""coming-together"">Coming together</h3>
<p>The Overbond platform facilitates improved digital connectivity with secure real-time communication among market participants, creating an extensive dealer, issuer and investor opportunity network. In addition, Magdelinic notes that the platform provides advanced data analytics and data visualisation as well as end-to-end digital execution capabilities. “This workflow benefits everyone in the primary bond market through higher transparency, optimised price discovery, and investor diversification – all while reducing infrastructure and transaction costs for issuers, dealers and investors,” he says.</p>
<p>The bond market is a traditional market which to this day relies on legacy, manual processes. In recent years, there has been rapid growth in global bond new issuance, thanks to the low yield environment. Meanwhile, due to increasingly stringent regulations following the financial crisis, dealers’ ability to make the market has decreased significantly, leading to overall secondary market illiquidity.</p>
<p>“Secondary market liquidity or frequent trading activity as we know serves as primary proxy to pricing new bonds,” says Magdelinic. “In the situation where secondary market trades that could serve as benchmarks and main confidence builders around pricing are very rare, the debt capital markets calls for the adoption of innovative technology like Overbond. It can help market participants build confidence through digital processing of information, managing relationships with a larger number of investors and issuers, and executing transactions more efficiently.”</p>
<p>Issuers can also expect the platform to increase their exposure to the investor base, delivering diversification, better access to capital and “stronger relationships with the providers of capital.” The latter could be key in allowing improved price discovery, claims Magdelinic.</p>
<h3 id=""building-it-up"">Building it up</h3>
<p>With a growing client base of more than 100 institutional clients, including some of the largest corporate bond issuers, dealers and investors, Overbond plans to continue building partnerships to allow greater efficiencies throughout the bond issuance process.</p>
<p>Magdelinic believes that the corporate treasury community, in particular, will benefit from the Overbond platform on multiple levels. “For instance, treasurers can rely on the data-driven relationship management module to optimise dealer coverage and expand the investor base.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Overbond provides corporate issuers with a secure and regulatory compliant electronic communication channel to better gauge market demand with investors. “This can lead to the better cost of funding, optimisation of the entire borrowing programme, more opportunistic issuances and more frequent issuance mandates,” says Magdelinic. “Treasurers also have the ability to instantly convert indications of interest into a deal, whether it be a private placement or public offering.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>China is home to the world’s third largest bond market, but for international corporations, it has traditionally been underutilised as a source of financing, despite its great potential. This is beginning to change. Here we take a look at the history of the Panda bond market and its growing appeal to corporate borrowers.</em></p>
<p>It was hard to find many good news stories concerning China in 2016. The economy is, of course, undergoing a significant shift and growth has slowed somewhat as a result. A consequence of this has been Chinese policy makers clamping down on some of the regulatory progress made in recent years, most notably, the introduction of ‘window guidance’ to limit corporates’ cross-border cash flow.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, there have been significant developments in other parts of the economy. Most notably, the growing attractiveness of the Chinese onshore debt market to foreign companies. Indeed, in 2016 the Chinese Panda bond market exceeded the offshore RMB dim sum market for the first time, with US$8.39bn raised onshore in the first seven months of the year alone. It is good progress, but there remains some way to go for it to live up to its full potential.</p>
<h3 id=""young-shoots"">Young shoots</h3>
<p>The first Panda bonds were issued in October 2005 by the IFC and the Asian Development Bank to much fanfare. This followed years of discussions with Chinese government officials, who were worried about the potential impact of the bonds on its currency peg.</p>
<p>Yet the nascent market failed to live up to the initial hype with very few foreign corporates issuing bonds. “Before 2014, only international financial firms and a limited number of corporates were allowed to enter the Panda bond market,” explains Ying Gu, Emerging Markets Asia Rates &amp; FX Strategist at J.P. Morgan. “But since last year, the regulators have loosened policies to allow overseas non-financial corporates and banks, as well as foreign governments to issue Panda bonds. This can go some way to explaining the recent boost in issuance.”</p>
<p>Typically, the companies who have issued since the market has opened up can be split into two buckets, says Keith Pogson, Senior Partner at EY Asia Pacific Financial Services. “First are those who want to prove it can be done to encourage others to do so. A lot of the banks who have issued, fit into this tranche as they want to advertise this to their clients.” The other group, he says, are those international non-financial corporates that have had a pressing need to raise large volumes of capital in the mainland – but these remain few and far between.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t a lot of corporate activity in the market. J.P. Morgan research has highlighted that 65% of issuances, weighted by market value, are made by corporates. “Many of these issuers are actually overseas incorporated Chinese companies, ‘real’ foreign borrowers are still yet to fully embrace the market,” says Gu.</p>
<p>German multinational automotive company, Daimler, is the most well-known ‘real’ foreign company to do so, issuing a one-year RMB500m bond at an interest rate of 5.2% in March 2014. The issuance was seen as a success and Daimler revisited the market in 2015 with a one-year RMB3bn bond to diversify its refinancing base and fund its expansion in China. The company has since also issued a private placement worth RMB4bn this year – the largest single Panda bond for a non-financial business.</p>
<h3 id=""an-attractive-proposition"">An attractive proposition?</h3>
<p>Given the markets historical lethargy, what then is driving the recent boost in issuance? In the view of J.P. Morgan’s Gu, cheap funding is the primary reason. “Issuing Panda bonds and then swapping CNY into USD using USD/CNH CSS provides more attractive funding costs compared with issuing USD bonds directly.” Panda bonds are also now cheaper than Hong Kong’s Dim-Sum bond and Taiwan’s Formosa bond – typically more favourable options for issuers wishing to raise funds in RMB.</p>
<p>China also offers bond issuers a new and extremely large investor base. “For those corporates looking to diversify their portfolio, Panda bonds could provide a useful tool,” says Gu. “China is, after all, the world’s third largest bond market and provides ample liquidity to issuers.”</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, and the recent surge in issuance the Panda bond market only accounts for a tiny fraction of China’s US$3bn onshore debt market, meaning that there is plenty of room for it to grow. However, there are a number of hurdles that need to be removed before the Panda bond becomes a truly attractive proposition to the international corporate community.</p>
<h3 id=""do-you-need-rmb"">Do you need RMB?</h3>
<p>“Although the Panda bond market has developed rapidly in the past two years, there are still some technical obstacles preventing foreign issuers from entering this market,” notes Gu.</p>
<p>Firstly, Panda bonds are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Chinese regulators, essentially meaning that there is a chance that the issuance will be rejected. For corporates wanting certainty, this is clearly a big issue. “What’s more there is very little transparency around this process and what makes a request successful,” says Gu. “Some corporates may be put off at the first hurdle because of this.”</p>
<p>If a corporate is successful in their issuance, there are further issues that can arise, chiefly because there is no official guidance on what can be done with the proceeds of a Panda bond issuance. “This is a particular issue for those companies who might want to raise cheap funding in the mainland and then move this cash offshore,” notes Gu. “If issuers cannot shift the proceeds offshore and they have little to no CNY investment plans onshore, then there really is no benefit for them to enter this market.”</p>
<h3 id=""different-standards"">Different standards</h3>
<p>The documentary filing process is another area where corporates, especially those based in the US, find issue with the Panda bond. “Issuers must provide the past three years of financial statements under the Chinese Account Standards (CAS), Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS), or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),” says EY’s Pogson.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>“This has been a problem because a lot of bond issuance is made in USD and filed under US GAAP,” he adds. “Issuing a Panda bond and changing your accounting standards to do so can, therefore, be too great a resource burden on many organisations, limiting the attractiveness of the market.”</p>
<p>Another burden for international corporates seeking issuance can come from the fact that a local credit rating is needed, alongside one from an international agency. Again the process here is slightly different to what international corporates would be used to when issuing in other markets and, of course, creates further work for the organisation.</p>
<h3 id=""creating-a-mature-market"">Creating a mature market</h3>
<p>Combined, these factors show the hallmarks of an immature market and one not aligned with international standards. “At present, corporates don’t have to push their domestic markets too hard to raise cash. This means that unless there is a genuine business need to take on RMB liabilities it doesn’t make sense for international corporates to issue Panda bonds,” states Pogson.</p>
<p>But he is philosophical in his outlook. “The market is setup this way deliberately, the Chinese regulators did not want to take a risk and loosely regulate the market, only to add further regulation later. This would dent the image of the market and also be quite difficult to do,” he says. “This is why they evaluate issuance on a case-by-case basis at present, because it gives them a chance to bend the rules, without issuing formal regulation, to see what works and what doesn’t – this will have big advantages in the long run.</p>
<p>And Pogson is already hearing positive noises coming from the Chinese regulators, who plan to make the Panda bond more attractive to international corporates, aligning it with international standards both in terms of how they access the market and the filing requirements.</p>
<p>But there is still more work to be done. In the near future, the issuance of Panda bonds will increase rapidly due to a low base,” says J.P. Morgan’s Gu. “But to ensure the sustainable development of the Panda bond, reforms are critical to resolve the discrepancies in accounting rules, as well as provide clear guidance on fund repatriation to offshore and simplify the approval process. In the long term, a fully liberalised capital account, free floating currencies and well-developed rates and FX hedging instruments are necessary to the success of this market.</p>
<p>I fully believe, however, that with the internationalisation of RMB and the openness of the onshore bond market, Panda bonds will become an important market for global issuers and investors and the market will reach its full potential,” he concludes.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Case study</h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading"">Veolia enters the Panda bond market</h3>
<div class=""copy__body"">
<p class=""management-summary""><em>The French multinational joins a small number of foreign corporates that have tapped the nascent Chinese onshore bond market.</em></p>
<p>In early September 2016, French multinational, Veolia, issued its first Panda Bond. Worth RMB1bn (€135m) the deal was the first foray into the market by any French company. Issued via a private placement, the paper bears an interest rate of 3.5% for a three-year maturity and was issued to both Chinese and international investors. Despite the relative low-value of the deal, it presents another significant milestone in the development of the nascent market and highlights that it is increasingly becoming a viable option for companies looking to raise RMB debt.</p>
<p>It is also a significant transaction for Veolia. The company has been looking at numerous ways to raise RMB funds for some time as it looks to satisfy its policy of matching its borrowing currencies to that of its assets.</p>
<p>Claire Bechaux, Director of Treasury at Veolia explains how the company’s traditional approach has been to issue Eurobonds and swap the proceeds into RMB. But the company has always had sights on the onshore market and towards the end of last year, the stars began to align. “A lot of our partner banks were talking to us about the Panda bond market and how this was beginning to open up,” she says. “At the same time, there were increasing levels of volatility in the offshore RMB market. It, therefore, seemed logical to explore the possibility of issuing a Panda bond further.</p>
<p>“We knew that it wouldn’t be an easy process, however, and we made this clear to the CFO when pitching the idea,” adds Bechaux. “Yet the benefits of doing this issuance far outweighed the negatives.”</p>
<h3 id=""open-discussions"">Open discussions</h3>
<p>To begin the process, Veolia entered into discussions with the Chinese regulator alongside the Bank of China, who had been selected as the Global Coordinator and Lead Underwriter. “It was a very open and transparent discussion and we found the Chinese regulators very willing to hear our concerns and then see how they could help solve these by flexing the rules,” says Bechaux.</p>
<p>Most notably, Veolia had questions around certain legal clauses and documentation, as well as the use of proceeds. “We spent quite a lot of time working on this area because the regulators are very keen for the proceeds of any Panda bond transaction to be used to support the real economy,” she explains. “If you are looking to take the proceeds offshore then you have to present a strong case as to how this helps the real economy – they want to avoid companies taking advantage of currency arbitrage.” In Veolia’s case, the proceeds were used to refinance offshore debt that had been used to finance the Group’s investments in mainland China.</p>
<p>Bechaux also notes how the fact Veolia issued a private placement simplified the process somewhat and removed some of the hurdles that have put other companies off issuing thus far. “We could use our European IFRS accounts if we issued this way, for instance, and thus removing the need to translate these into Chinese GaaP,” she says. “This saved time and reduced the complexity of the transaction and given that this was our first foray into the market we wanted to be successful so it made sense to take this approach and I would recommend it to other companies as well.”</p>
<p>The need to obtain a credit rating from a local rating agency can also prove a stumbling block for corporates. However, Veolia found this to be a relatively straightforward process. “We obtained a rating in four weeks and the process was very similar to obtaining a rating from an international agency – albeit with a greater focus on activity in China,” notes Bechaux. “And just like the regulators we found them to be extremely professional and very keen to make life as simple as possible.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-worthwhile-project"">A worthwhile project</h3>
<p>Having issued the bond, Bechaux says that Veolia is very happy with the outcome. “It has been a worthwhile project and we are now in a position to issue in the mainland again by simply drawing down on our existing programme,” she says. “This provides us with a lot of flexibility. What is more, the pricing was very good.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Bechaux admits that whilst not the most important factor, the pricing certainly gave the treasury extra incentive to issue a Panda bond. “We have options to raise RMB, so we didn’t need to go through this intensive process to issue onshore and if the pricing wasn’t as favourable we probably wouldn’t have at this moment in time. It was the last push.”</p>
<p>For Scott Barton, Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Europe, Standard Chartered – a key financial advisor on the transaction – this deal will “open up the window to access the Panda market for all corporates around the world”. He does note, however, that “Panda bond issuance is in its nascent stage so the process naturally comes in shades of grey and involves elements of careful negotiations. At the end of the day, the cost savings it brings is well worth the efforts to get a programme set up.”</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Corporate cash reserves are at record levels yet for many companies seeking funding, the world has changed to one with less certainty but more options. Why has this happened and what does this mean for treasurers?</em></p>
<p>It is well-understood that some corporates are sitting on vast stockpiles of cash. But the truth behind this is that the list of the super cash-rich includes mainly the largest companies – to the extent that the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 law) almost fits to a ‘T’. Deloitte has reported that 75% of cash reserves in EMEA (in the region of €1trn) are held by just 17% of the region’s corporates.</p>
<p>This trend broadly replicates corporate cash concentration worldwide, with approximately one third of the world’s companies holding 80% of its $3.5trn corporate cash reserves. That the cash is held in such imbalance explains why most corporates still have to worry about their funding mix rather than self-financing projects, acquisitions and growth plans.</p>
<h3 id=""where-are-we-now"">Where are we now?</h3>
<p>“Since the financial crisis, companies have generally been more conservative in funding themselves,” Richard King, Head of UK Corporates and Debt Capital Markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) recently told Treasury Today. “They saw what happened during the crisis, with credit markets grinding to a halt, and there has since been an increasing desire among corporates to boost their liquidity, even to the extent where they’re sometimes overfunding themselves.”</p>
<p>Caution, it seems, is now the name of the game for most corporates anxious to avoid the pitfalls of a funding crisis. With banks constrained by regulation (notably the capital adequacy measures that are part of Basel III) and the continuing low- and even negative-yield environment showing no signs of abating, they have every right to feel on edge. As Sean Hanafin, Head of Corporate Coverage, UK &amp; Europe at Standard Chartered says, the current flow of regulation is “a direction of travel rather than the final destination”.</p>
<p>The wariness displayed by some corporates has manifested itself in the nervous pre-funding of maturities, for example. Where companies know they have a maturity of a bond or loan coming up, in the past they might have waited only 12 months before the maturity, whereas now they’re typically going to the markets and funding them a lot earlier. With debt costs low, management at the very least will silently approve the cost of carry of pre-funding. It is seen as a ‘better safe than sorry’ approach in an environment where, since the crisis, most – if not all – of the banking sector has been downgraded, and absolute guarantees of funding no longer exist unless a business pays heavily for the privilege.</p>
<p>The banking industry is facing long-term structural changes through regulatory initiatives. The industry as a whole is certainly benefitting from additional governance as banks are required to put aside significantly more capital for every pound they lend. “Banks are seeing the impact of Basel III in terms of shareholder and client relationship returns. This is impacting banks’ behaviour in terms of how they work with corporate clients.” Regulation is therefore likely to act as a floor on loan pricing and an appetite ceiling in terms of the amount of credit that banks will be prepared to provide for customers.</p>
<p>This view is supported by Clive Gregory, Head of Strategic Finance at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (a member of global financial group, MUFG). “In short, the requirement for banks to hold more capital results in a cost that, if not passed on, will reduce returns,” he says. Indeed, Gregory notes that the rules regarding the tightening of regulatory capital have impacted some businesses more than others – for example companies further down the rating scale and for long-term derivative positions. This, says Gregory, may result in the increased ‘Americanisation’ of the provision of funding for BB lending, driven by funds, some of whom are not regulated. To date, strong competition and excess liquidity in the bank market has meant that in the lending business these increased costs are largely not yet being fully reflected in loan pricing. For banks to achieve their hurdle returns, it is necessary to have non-lending ancillary business, for example transaction banking, DCM and cash management. The focus on multi-product relationship banking for clients is potentially a good thing for treasurers but, warns Gregory, it will place the emphasis on corporate share of wallet, of that there is no doubt.</p>
<p>In this respect some corporates operate with quite sophisticated analysis models to ensure they are apportioning the right level of business (or at least allowing the opportunity to pitch for that business) based on each bank’s capabilities, keeping everyone happy. Conversely, there are those who have adopted a ‘legacy’ model based largely on habit. These companies might not necessarily be forging working relationships with a broader selection of providers which can either be seen as commitment to the few, or adding risk by not seeking diversification.</p>
<h3 id=""us-and-them"">Us and them</h3>
<p>There is, of course, a fundamental difference in corporate funding between the US and Europe that sees European companies rely “far more heavily” on bank lending, says Kira Brecht writing on CME Group’s Open Markets resource. Overall, she notes, “some 80% of corporate debt in Europe is in the form of bank lending, with just 20% coming from the corporate bond markets – almost the inverse of the US.”</p>
<p>The gap is explained through deep-seated cultural “suspicion” of risk-taking entrepreneurialism and “Anglo-Saxon capital markets”, and structural differences between the banking systems of the US and Europe (Europe being driven by a series of national “champion banks” and a strong local network). In the US banks are more than willing to securitise or sell on their loans to the (“much better developed”) institutional loan market whereas European banks tend to keep loans on the balance sheet. Cross-border fragmentation of capital markets in Europe also saw the US gain much ground here, although that gap is closing fast, says Brecht.</p>
<p>Differences aside, the reality is that banks are still prepared to underwrite large loan transactions for the right clients (harking back to Gregory’s point about share of wallet). In fact, loans remain a staple source of funding for European businesses. Their share of total financing may have fallen since 2008, but volumes have remained far more stable over the past seven years than other types of funding. Given their inherent flexibility and private nature – and the cultural emphasis on this form of borrowing – loans will likely remain a strategically core funding component for European businesses for some time to come.</p>
<p>But mounting uncertainty, prudent counterparty risk analysis and the subsequent desire to diversify funding sources has seen a shift on the corporate side. Corporate treasurers have effectively been obliged to investigate and re-evaluate their own capital structure – for day-to-day and strategic business – as a result of funding market changes (not least as some major relationship banks have withdrawn their presence from certain regions). The SME end of the spectrum is having to adjust and become more responsive to banks because of the pressure on cost and availability of funding (and relative lack of alternatives), says Hanafin. But he notes the larger corporate player, with its broader wallet placed with its banks, its existing access to the alternative markets and, by and large, its higher rating, “as seeing a lessened regulatory capital impact”.</p>
<h3 id=""a-moving-target"">A moving target</h3>
<p>Of course, there is a difference between the relative weights of a typical US mid-cap and its European counterpart, explains Hanafin. The US mid-cap is often a larger concern and more likely to access the DCM for its term debt needs and use the banks for working capital. “What we see in the US, we will increasingly see in Europe, albeit over the medium term.”</p>
<p>To find the optimal capital structure, it is helpful for treasurers to have an understanding of available debt instruments and their relative capital consumption, says Gregory. Similarly, understanding how banks assess their share of the overall wallet – now seemingly a vital constituent in safeguarding funding in the first place – will help treasurers in their assessment of bank relationships. The market is constantly changing and in that context capital structures should be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. This will include decision-making regarding corporates’ desire to increasingly diversify funding sources where needs are large, and decisions regarding their holdings of cash – in spite of the low yield – because of the value of liquidity.”</p>
<p>With low interest rates causing investors to search for higher returns, additional liquidity is readily apparent in the alternative markets. Where previously bank lending was the default (in Europe at least), companies are now edging towards options such as bond issuance, equity, private placements (mostly the US but with a growing European scene) and direct investments as their funding pathway.</p>
<p>For corporates with a solid credit profile, access to funding from the bank, public and private markets is strong, and available at historically low rates. Not all corporates are strongly rated or rated at all though and a broad spectrum of funding sources should be considered. In fact, diversification of funding to ensure an optimal balance sheet is or should be part of the natural evolution for all corporates as they develop and grow, again, not least because sometimes a particular market for borrowing may not be available or suitably priced at the time the money is required.</p>
<p>Corporates need to be constantly up to date regarding what the relative benefits of different funding sources are – and these change from day-to-day, warns Gregory. Consideration must be given to the optimal structures at a particular time in the market and questions must be asked regarding execution to ensure financing deal success.</p>
<h3 id=""be-flexible"">Be flexible</h3>
<p>There is clearly more corporate flexibility in terms of funding sources and the funding mix has changed over time as options increase. It is difficult to generalise on the extent of this change, but for high grade corporates the public debt capital markets have developed to be the market of choice for longer-term financing, notes Gregory. The bank market still plays an important role in providing RCFs, medium-term debt and bridge financing but the treasurer’s funding toolbox may develop to include, amongst other things, secured, unsecured, syndicated, private placement, unrated, rated, CP, local and international debt markets, hybrid capital and convertibles (vanilla, synthetic and mandatory), as well as sukuk (Islamic bonds), and M&amp;A focused sponsor-backed deals. The key is to understand the available products, that each will be relevant at different times for different purposes and what the market is doing at any given time.</p>
<p>The pools of capital and the structures that are available are constantly changing. Banking partners should be able to demonstrate an understanding of current market trends by making appropriate loan products available for their clients. Every bank should have a market where it is bringing something different to its clients. By way of example, Gregory comments that just as a Germany-based bank will present the case for Schuldschein, MUFG – as a global bank with Japanese heritage – has had considerable success developing the ‘Samurai loan’ market for its EMEA clients. The total market has tripled in volume since 2010.</p>
<p>Here, yen-denominated cross-border syndicated loans are made accessible to non-Japanese firms, in essence bringing corporates together with the deep pool of financing from regional Japanese banks. Deep pools mean relatively lower costs and an investor base more willing to consider lending to unrated or unlisted borrowers. Aside from being a source of funding diversity, although there will be a cost involved, it could even be cheaper to access finance from the Japanese domestic banks and then swap it back into the preferred major currency.</p>
<p>The Asian capital markets are seen by Hanafin as a more interesting and active space for corporates. Most notable for him are onshore Renminbi (RMB) bond issuances (colloquially known as Panda bonds). The first date back to 2005 but with market liberalisation (starting in 2010) lifting the restriction of the movement of funds raised, more activity has been noted. It is now worth around $7trn and is the world’s third largest bond market. “If you look at funding costs on a swap basis – swapping back to euro, for example – it is actually cheaper today for many corporates to borrow in RMB than it is to borrow in euros,” he says, adding that although corporate access from the West is currently “minimal”, this is changing.</p>
<p>Hanafin notes that once accessed, the onshore market becomes more amenable. Indeed, he points out that automotive firm, Daimler, has been back at least twice (its first in 2014 was a RMB500m issuance at 5.2% – the first non-financial to access this market) and now has a name that Chinese investors know and like. What’s more, he states that the Chinese authorities are “very keen” to have more Western multinationals issue, and have made a firm policy decision to open up their bond market to European and US corporates. He feels that onshore RMB issuance for general corporate purposes is now “becoming a more straightforward path”, with offshore repatriation of funds no longer a stumbling block. With “significant pockets of liquidity” available, Hanafin sees a Chinese, and in fact a wider Asian private placement market, as an entirely feasible next step – with all the benefits of funding diversification that this brings to the corporate community.</p>
<p>However it develops, there may not necessarily be any first-mover advantage in a market such as China. Hanafin suggests that there will be a lot of attention focused on newcomers because all parties will be keen to ensure a smooth process. What’s more, both investors and issuers will be seeking solid reference points for future pricing.</p>
<p>At the more leveraged end of the market, structures have developed in the last year. For example, the growth in EMEA of TLB or term loan ‘B’ (long-term loans made by institutional investors) and so-called ‘cov-lite’ (covenant light) deals (minus the usual lender’s covenants). These structures generally are safe and rational. “The challenge is to make sure the investor base or banks supporting the instruments understand them,” says Gregory. “With cov-lite B notes, for example, investors have less protection in the form of covenants, but as there is a removal of the trigger that a covenant provides, the likelihood of default falls. As a result, investors are buying better-rated paper but the paper has less protection.”</p>
<h3 id=""banking-on-alternatives"">Banking on alternatives</h3>
<p>“It is increasingly important for corporate treasurers to consider multiple funding sources,” says Hanafin. Of course, post Lehman, the market regulators are focused on preventing financing structures that are considered overly aggressive. If investors start to doubt the integrity of what they have, it could lead to a systemic loss of confidence. What is important for treasurers in this light is that their banking partners are able to advise on, and execute, the optimum product-agnostic financing solution.</p>
<p>The sophisticated corporate treasurer should be constantly assessing optimal financing solutions as they become available. This quest must not be limited to the bank market solutions – discussions should cover a broad range to ensure companies are achieving lower costs of funding, funding diversity, duration and the appropriate matching of cash flows to liabilities. This means keeping a weather eye on market changes and seeking out new sources – as the vast Chinese bond market opens up, it would be remiss not to at least investigate such a deep pool of liquidity. As Hanafin observes, “it is not something that needs to develop, it is something that needs to open up to Western corporates and this decision has now been made”.</p>
<p>Generally, there is competition between banks and the alternative funding sources but in the high grade space, the available financing solutions are often broad, complex and mutually complementary. A typical M&amp;A financing structure, for example, may involve a bank bridge-loan being refinanced through the public capital markets. For more leveraged businesses, there has been an increase in both the TLB market and a significant increase in non-bank lending. Again, these should be seen as complementary to traditional bank lending and it is important that banks structure deals around all these developing markets. There is a kind of cross-feed between markets too. Acquisition financing is capital-friendly for banks given that it is short-term, and as such they display a willingness to lend into M&amp;A situations. Corporate ‘takeouts’ can drive bond volumes. Indeed, the FT said earlier this year that M&amp;A have become “a significant driver of corporate bond supply since deal activity accelerated in 2013”.</p>
<p>Of course, the bond market never stands still. “The bond market has significantly matured over the last few years and this development has made it more flexible and accessible for companies,” says BofAML’s King. The Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme, for example, facilitates the raising of relatively small amounts of money at very different tenors with individual investors or a group of investors on a regular basis. This allows companies to be more targeted and flexible in their financing – they don’t have to go out and raise €1bn from the bond market; they can raise €100m or €200m via a private placement.</p>

<h3>A private view: Port of Rotterdam</h3>
<p class=""management-summary"">New regulations may have changed the funding space forever, but for Tim De Knegt, Treasurer for the Port of Rotterdam, the banks have always included terms in any contract stating that, should any regulatory issue incur any expense, then they reserve the right to increase financing fees and push those through to the client. “Up until a few years ago that never actually happened.” However, with the advent of Basel III liquidity ratios, the banks are finding “all sorts of reasons” to increase their pricing.</p>
<p>In this respect de Knegt is not entirely cynical. “I believe that they are simply pushing through the costs rather than ‘cost plus’. But they are all so opaque about pricing, so it is very difficult to know what they are really doing.” The banks’ lack of transparency, he notes, also makes it very difficult to have a sensible conversation about it. Although he suggests that banks lack clearness about all their pricing, in terms of the regulatory pressure he argues that if he knows why prices increase he can make a point to the regulator about the effect of their actions on the corporate community. “But there is no way for me to help them if there is no transparency.”</p>
<p>Whilst at the hands of regulatory change funding accessibility issues may have arisen for certain corporates, De Knegt notes that even for a major corporate it can now be more difficult to secure any sort of committed funding, but then relying on uncommitted lines is a big risk as it is not easy to know which banks will have the funds available when they are needed.</p>
<h3 id=""re-evaluate"">Re-evaluate</h3>
<p>In light of this, Port of Rotterdam has continually re-evaluated its funding structure for the past few years. With several financing options taking it through to early next decade, De Knegt’s treasury is currently making sure it is ready for different markets so that by the time his current financing matures and he is looking for the next round, he is ready to move. To assist this process, De Knegt has presided over some policy alterations to allow not just for different forms of financing but also, given the wider impact of Basel III, different liquidity and cash management products.</p>
<p>Funding used to be quite straightforward for Port of Rotterdam. As a major global port it requires massive investment to sustain its position in the market. Historically, it would head straight to the European Investment Bank or a Dutch commercial bank and quite easily raise up to €1bn just from one institution, recalls De Knegt. The credit crisis and the subsequent regulatory response stopped that and, aside from the fact that it is now much more expensive to get a committed line for a longer period, it is also “incredibly difficult” to get the volume as well, he comments.</p>
<p>Even with its strong credit quality (Port of Rotterdam is unrated but about 70% owned by the Municipality of Rotterdam and about 30% by the Dutch government), securing more than €150m per bank, especially from a European bank, is today “almost impossible”. And for most corporates, unless they are prepared to have a large consortium of banks syndicate a major funding requirement, then other sources will be necessary.</p>
<h3 id=""seek-other-sources"">Seek other sources</h3>
<p>But even with ten banks providing him with a current €1.5bn of outstanding debt, De Knegt looks to other sources. Until recently, he says he would only use syndicated and direct bank lending. But now he is able to look to alternative sources. These include the bond markets and private placements in the US or anywhere else he feels is appropriate. “I have completely broadened the scope of potential sources to be able to go into any market so as not to restrict my options,” he states. “You never know which market will be open and attractive at the right moment so I need to give myself every opportunity to make sure I can give the company the best deal, knowing that right now the banks are not necessarily offering optimal funding solutions.”</p>
<p>Although Port of Rotterdam remains unrated, it has been through the analysis process for its own benefit. This, De Knegt thinks, gives it a head start when the time comes for it to consider an independent rating. Indeed, from a bond issuance perspective, it already has all the facts and figures in place explaining its story and enabling the credit rating agencies, banks and other stakeholders to know what to compare it with. “It is better to carry out this preparatory work at least a couple of years ahead of time, than to be forced to do it three or four months prior to a first issue.”</p>
<p>Having done the preparatory work, the ratings project is on the back-burner for a while, at least until it is needed. It is, says De Knegt, an expensive process that commits the business to a whole new structure of information provision. Whereas currently the business is sharing this information privately with trusted banking partners as part of a relatively simple discussion, a rating requires him to give that information to the rating agency and allow it to sit in judgement over certain processes and even contracts, for example.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company needs to ensure all senior executives understand exactly what is expected of them, whereas bank financing does not require such ‘en masse’ involvement. Additionally, there is some internal concern that the business will start to be “steered by the rating agency instead of being guided by the shareholder perspective”. Nonetheless, with a private rating of sorts in the bag, he feels that Port of Rotterdam is ready to strike when the moment is right.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>The US private placement market has also come into its own over the past few years – it has become incredibly stable, and it remained open throughout the crisis, which is not always the case in the public bond market. Similarly the Schuldschein bond market, with claimed low cost and quick issuances (because they cannot be listed on stock exchanges) is gaining more traction as a debt-financing instrument even beyond its German heartland for mostly medium-sized companies. Although not strictly a debt security, the floating or fixed debt instruments typically have a two- to five-year lifetime with lending volumes ranging between €10m and €100m.</p>
<p>This flexibility helps corporates tailor their funding needs to their specific circumstances, with the competitive pricing and long-dated maturities these markets offer. Many corporates need a quantum of debt that can no longer be supported by the bank market, or they want the higher flexibility that bond markets give them. In the past couple of years, with pricing so low, corporates are thinking if there’s ever a time to start financing in bond markets, it’s now. Low-cost air carrier Ryanair’s debut unsecured Eurobond in 2014 is a good example of this. For an airline to do a senior unsecured issue was ground-breaking in itself. The 1.875% fixed-rate coupon it achieved for €850m of BBB+ debt was even more impressive.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Besides this evolution of the bond market, the low-yield environment tends to make bond financing more attractive than bank financing in many cases. Interest rates are extraordinarily low and will probably remain low for the foreseeable future, and as a result companies can raise funding very cheaply and for very long tenors. Corporates can get 10-20+ year money at very low rates with all-in coupons of 1-4% depending on the credit rating. This is much better than getting shorter-dated money from the bank market, which is generally a five-year market. Bond financing gives corporates much longer-dated money, allowing them to lock in longer-term rates at very cheap levels. This is clearly an appealing proposition that has boosted the corporate hybrid debt market which, in the current low-yield environment, could be seen as a form of cheap equity.</p>
<p>In the shorter term, low interest-rates are also stimulating the commercial paper (CP) market, which, though flagging previously, reached an 11-month high in the US in November 2014. “In the current low-yield environment, the Group can issue CPs at very low rates,” said Brice Zimmerman, Head Treasury Control and Reporting at Novartis. “Also, reflecting the high liquidity in this market, CPs are an attractive source of short-term liquidity that offers a high degree of flexibility as it can be repaid quickly.”</p>
<h3 id=""stay-alert"">Stay alert</h3>
<p>Despite the increasing popularity of debt capital market financing, bank loans remain a core part of most corporates’ funding mix, and the competition between banks (and others) to lend to corporates is intense. It is clear that there are a number of banks from across Western Europe, Asia and the US that have been keen to grow their loan books, and as a consequence, the broader loan market has become increasingly competitive. This is seen not only in price or terms, but also in the amounts each bank is prepared to hold in an individual transaction.</p>
<p>In the coming months, the financing markets of EMEA are expected to remain open, liquid and competitive but they will be subject to change. It is well documented that the region’s lenders face numerous headwinds – the slowdown in China, the aftermath of the Brexit vote, ECB liquidity, negative interest rates, and so on. In reality, such headwinds have always been there in one form or another and the industry is well-versed in adapting to the challenges they present. Corporate treasurers should not wait until they need funding but instead regularly take advantage of this experience to really find out which way the market is headed. No two corporates are facing exactly the same circumstances and as policies and sensitivities vary, Hanafin is keen to reiterate the paramount importance for all treasurers of managing their funding risk. “Banks will remain a core part of any capital structure but I think we will increasingly see alternative forms of capital be adopted.” The bottom line is that all treasurers need to be fully aware of their financial alternatives.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>With the economic weather for the year ahead shrouded in uncertainty, corporate borrowers on Asia’s capital markets are not guaranteed such an easy ride in the next 12 months. Liability management exercises may well be on the agenda for some corporate treasurers.</em></p>
<p>Is Asia’s debt binge coming to an end? After three successive years of record debt sales by non-financial corporates in the region, issuance was relatively muted in 2015 and experts believe it could fall further in 2016 as the era of easy money draws to a close.</p>
<p>If the debt spree really is over, that means Asia’s corporates are likely to encounter some tough decisions on the road ahead. The Federal Reserve has ended the post-crisis era of ultra-low interest rates, China’s economy is cooling for the first time in a quarter of a century and commodity prices on a steep downward trajectory. Accordingly, emerging market (EM) currencies have plunged and refinancing costs – in the overseas markets especially – have risen. And this is all happening at a time when a considerable amount of debt is soon due for repayment.</p>
<p>Overall corporates and governments have an unprecedented $262bn worth of notes in currencies outside of their domestic markets to repay in 2016, according to data recently compiled by Bloomberg. Commentators disagree, however, on what this might mean for corporate issuers in the year ahead.</p>
<h3 id=""trouble-ahead"">Trouble ahead?</h3>
<p>Some say that they are confident there will continue to be sufficient liquidity for those firms who decide to tap the market for refinancing, irrespective of the pace of monetary tightening at the Federal Reserve. “The simple message we are getting from investors here is that there is still a lot of cash to be put to work,” says Leonard Ng, Director of Asia Debt Capital Markets at ANZ. “Gone are the days where if they did a USD deal, Asian issuers would have to rely on European or US investors for a big chunk of the transaction. These days we are seeing some deals in Asia where 80% of the deal is taken by the Asian investor base. Now we have a consistent pool of capital here that obviously gets recycled. Even though the issuer base has grown dramatically, the supply is still getting absorbed by the demand.”</p>
<p>Other analysts are, however, feeling more apprehensive about what lies ahead. “We have been warning against the risk of rapidly increasing EM debt for some time,” the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) wrote in its last quarterly review, published in December 2015. “Non-stop demand for EM credit has fuelled the credit boom, with corporates able to borrow cheaply and increasingly in foreign currencies. The turn in easy Fed policy will pose a threat to EM firms with a high level of dollar debt by increasing their debt servicing costs, which could in turn create solvency risks.”</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: International Monetary Fund</em></p>
<p>Either way, those issuers needing to refinance appear to be biding their time Vicky Münzer-Jones, a Singapore-based debt capital markets lawyer for Norton Rose Fulbright told Treasury Today. Besides a handful of large issues that have skewed the overall figures somewhat, the markets, she says, have been very quiet lately relative to the figures notched up in the previous three years. “This year we have seen concern regarding corruption allegations in Malaysia and not as much progress as hoped in Indonesia. Then there is still Greece, which has been creating challenges for European banks, and China with its own set of problems. It feels that there are lots of issues that have arisen to bring about a situation where companies that you would expect to see in the market are not here.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, Münzer-Jones ponders, this is a sign that those pressures the BIS and others have warned us of are now beginning to be felt at some firms. Once market access declines, elevated debt servicing costs (a consequence of higher rates and depreciating currencies) and instances of companies experiencing rollover problems are perhaps all but inevitable. “We are now reaching a situation where some companies might begin to default,” she says. “Given that there are fewer bond issues at the moment and the loan market has not been looking very strong either, I feel that we will see companies getting into trouble at some point especially with commodity prices still down.”</p>
<p>With some companies beginning to struggle to generate the cash needed to service their debts – a situation exacerbated by the dollar’s recent strength – defaults are beginning to mount. According to Standard &amp; Poor’s, defaults in EM economies hit their highest level since 2009 in 2015, and were up by over 40% on the year before. Some treasurers may be looking at such trends and feeling understandably nervous about what lies ahead, now that the era of easy money is drawing to a close. Fortunately, there are measures that otherwise healthy companies can take to actively mitigate risks where covenants in existing bonds are likely to come under stress.</p>
<h3 id=""breathing-space"">Breathing space</h3>
<p>Above all, treasurers of companies faced with such circumstances need to be thinking about the debt the company has in place and whether the various terms, borrowing rate and tenor agreed are the most favourable they can obtain. “If companies are finding it difficult to refinance their bonds which are maturing, they may start looking at some form of liability management,” says Münzer-Jones. “They may look at an exchange offer or consent solicitation, for instance, which would amend the terms of their bonds to defer an interest payment, extend the maturity or reduce the interest rate – ultimately something that reduces their liabilities.”</p>
<p>Very often it is tender offers and exchange offers (where the company is exchanging its bonds for new ones issued by itself on different terms or by a parent company or third party or doing something that could be presented as enhancing the debt for the investor, she adds. This is not uncommon. “But when companies are looking to extend or amend in order to reduce their liabilities that tends to be part of a bigger discussion between the issuer and its bond holders, and the bond holders are in a position where they feel they are going to lose out if they don’t agree to a certain amendment or deference of payment.”</p>
<p>Noting that a lot of companies have left liabilities – dollar and renminbi – largely unhedged, Keith Pogson, Senior Partner, Financial Services, Asia Pacific at EY is also of the view that liability management exercises will inevitably feature on the agenda for some companies over the coming months.</p>
<p>“Some of those that have paper may well be thinking about that in a more active way,” Pogson says. “I think most treasurers are probably thinking through now what they should be doing in the different scenarios that could play out. Some companies will be running dollar funding risks and some will be looking at upward curves and considering whether it makes sense now to extend their risk and take cheaper funding for longer.”</p>
<h3 id=""sweeten-the-deal"">Sweeten the deal</h3>
<p>Yet given the way in which industry analysts expect the market to evolve over 2016, the window of opportunity for cheaper funding may not be around for long; indeed, for some firms, it may have already closed. Treasurers may, therefore, need to start thinking more creatively when it comes to financing on the capital markets.</p>
<p>“By using collateral, for example, you might be able to reduce the cost by de-risking the strategy,” says EY’s Pogson. “I think treasurers are realising they need to be a bit smarter now, and looking for ways to keep those costs under control.” The collateral pledged by companies to secure their notes might come in the form of the traditional types of securities held on the balance sheet such as T-bills, or stocks and bonds of other companies. Equally though, it could be something less traditional. We have seen numerous examples in recent years of companies unlocking value in assets on their balance sheets not traditionally considered by lenders. Adam Smith Award winners Etihad Airways, for example, used landing slots at Heathrow Airport to support a transaction; while Intellectual Ventures similarly won in the Best Financing Solution category at last year’s event for creating a new asset class through the securitisation of the company’s intellectual property portfolio.</p>
<h3 id=""dont-panic"">Don’t panic</h3>
<p>Given that the level of preparedness for higher funding costs differs so greatly across the region, it stands to reason that there will be some firms that find it more difficult to service their debts. But the changing conditions should only pose an existential risk for a small number of companies as experts maintain that, overall, Asia’s corporates have not overstretched themselves with foreign currency issuance and rising leverage.</p>
<p>In terms of leverage, one could certainly argue that with such favourable conditions on the bond markets some issuers have been tempted perhaps to take on more leverage than they could otherwise afford. But this is not characteristic of the market as a whole and, for the most part, the record borrowing we have seen merely reflects the region’s recent growth trajectory. “Yes, leverage may have gone up, but I don’t think it is the case where they have over committed themselves in an irresponsible way,” says ANZ’s Ng. “If you look at the growth rates in Asia – people talk about a slowdown in China but they are still growing at 5-6%. I think leverage from their perspective is still relatively well managed.”</p>
<p>Although, as noted above, defaults are on an upward trend in Asia, ANZ’s Ng reminds us of the importance of retaining some perspective. “The simple fact is, if you look at default rates across Asia – without going down into specific countries – default rates are still at or near historical lows,” he says. “Every now and then we do see one or two cases that make headlines, and every so often the press may be tempted to call it the first of many to come, but we have seen enough that they tend to be very isolated cases.”</p>
<p>And especially if the treasurers of other companies plan, early on, what mitigative steps they can take in the event the covenants in their bonds come under stress, then isolated cases they should remain. Naturally, renegotiating the terms of the debts early on has to be preferable to defaulting altogether.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body"">
<h3 id=""from-banks-to-bonds"">From banks to bonds</h3>
<p>The role of the bond market finance has grown rapidly as a share of corporate debt in Asian economies since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Recent data from Dealogic, for instance, shows that bond issues in Asia have gained since 2010 as a share of GDP while syndicated loans have fallen. In aggregate terms, syndicated loans and bonds can be substituted for one another, depending on whether the issuer prefers to opt for the liquidity of the loan market or the longer tenors typically on offer in the bond market.</p>
<p>High investor demand due to the search for yield has been one of the factors fuelling the surge in bond issuance. “When there is a lot of liquidity yields become compressed and we do bonds or medium-term note (MTN) programmes, primarily because with those instruments we can raise funding at a cheaper rate than with the banks,” says Joel Cheah, Treasurer, Cambridge Industrial Trust Management, a firm which has raised over $200m on Asia’s debt capital markets in the past 18 months.</p>
<p>There is also another – more strategic – motivation for treasurers shifting to financing on the bond markets: the desire to reduce the dependency of their firms on bank funding, and the fact that the bond markets offer greater flexibility. “Debt capital markets can provide a lot of operational flexibility. It is also about risk management though: your options can become very limited if your funding begins to dry up.”</p>
<p>ANZ’s Ng agrees with this assessment. “The financial crisis in 2008-2009 marked the turning point,” he says. “Some of the banks were facing issues and withdrew from some of the markets – and that left some corporates hanging without any access to bank funding. It was around that time that CFOs and treasurers began looking at the capital markets for an alternative.”</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>In a year where bank lending once again contracted and the ultra-low rate environment pushed investors still further out on the yield curve, it seemed inevitable that private placements would be one of the hot topics of 2014. And so it proved.</p>
<p>Corporates, wherever they are in the world, now need new options when it comes to financing the business. Accordingly, those companies for whom the public debt capital markets are not a feasible option, the private placement markets are becoming an increasingly popular alternative source of capital. The trend can be seen worldwide although, as we will see, there are some important differences between, and even within, regions such as Asia and Western Europe.</p>
<h3 id=""a-turbulent-decade"">A turbulent decade</h3>
<p>Asian capital market issuance is growing rapidly. Regulation has been one of the drivers. In recent years, there have been efforts in the region to improve access to public capital markets through the simplification of legal documentation and the investor base has widened substantially.</p>
<p>“Traditionally Asia has been a bit of a bank loan market,” says Vijay Chandler, Executive Director of the Asia Securities Industry &amp; Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA). The bond market is typically smaller relative to the loan market, at least in terms of the total outstanding. Although this continues to be the case, there are signs that change is afoot. “What has happened in recent years is that the banks have been pulling back from the syndicated loans market, largely as a result of the Basel III guidelines and other regulatory pressures. Bond issuance has really grown, as a result.”</p>
<p>There has been a change, also, in the type of debt being issued on Asia’s capital markets. About a decade ago, private placements in Asia were – with the benefit of hindsight – moving into bubble territory. Western hedge and private-equity funds came to take advantage of the region’s burgeoning growth, but soon found that there was little to purchase on Asia’s underdeveloped capital markets. Some corporates in Asia, meanwhile, faced obstacles to issuing on the public capital markets. Thus each party ended up solving the other’s problem, and the issuance of dollar-denominated debt boomed.</p>
<p>“This was before the financial crisis, remember, so everyone was gung-ho. You had the likes of Indonesian mining companies coming to the market looking for bridge finance prior to an initial public offering (IPO) or a public bond issue, and we had all these investors looking to invest in corporate bonds at a time when the public markets were pretty much full,” notes Chandler.</p>

<p>For a while, this proved a happy arrangement for all concerned. Investors bought up all the debt they could, providing companies with much needed financing, and secured very attractive yields in return. Then, in the autumn of 2008, the music finally stopped.</p>
<p>According to Chandler, around 80-90% of the deals struck during those heady pre-crisis days had to be refinanced. “A lot of them were very short-tenor private transactions,” says Chandler. “That meant that if your company’s deal was priced in 2005-06 – or even as late as 2007 – by 2010, you needed to refinance either through an IPO or some sort of bond offering, both markets which were, of course, closed by that time.”</p>
<p>The subsequent freeze in capital market lending didn’t last long, however. Debts were successfully restructured, and sovereign wealth funds took up some of the remaining slack and now, remarkably, the capital markets are once again growing at a rapid pace, although the bulk of what is being issued, this time, is denominated in local currencies, not USD.</p>
<h3 id=""asia-today"">Asia today</h3>
<p>Asia is not a homogenous region, by any means. The split between public and private issuance still varies considerably across jurisdictions, therefore. Public placements now account for the lion’s share of corporate bond issuance in a number of Asian countries such as China, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea. However, in other markets, like India, private placements have remained the primary form of bond issuance representing more than 80% of the corporate bonds issued domestically in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>The regional disparities are, of course, all a matter of pricing. “In many Asian markets, the costs of public issuance still exceed those associated with private placement by a multiple,” says Hannah Levinger, Analyst, Global Risk Analysis, at Deutsche Bank. “As a result, private placements are still a common issuance regime. Companies can tap longer-term financing with a few selected investors while saving on regulatory costs and requirements and avoiding lengthy and burdensome procedures.”</p>
<p>Such features make private placements a very attractive proposition for some businesses, particularly smaller, fast-growing companies who need capital to finance their growth plans. Recognising this, there have been initiatives in some countries, most notably China where obtaining capital is one of the biggest problems faced by SMEs, to help smaller companies execute private placements. A pilot initiative for SME bonds was launched by the Chinese regulator in 2012, which was followed up in 2013 by an announcement to extend private issuance to a wider region and companies registered at the “new third board” a nationwide share transfer platform for non-listed companies.</p>
<p>“The move was seen as both a measure to stimulate the development of the corporate bond market and reduce SME’s reliance on bank loans,” says Deutsche Bank’s Levinger. “As a result, private placements have seen steady growth in Asia.”</p>
<h3 id=""luxury-or-necessity"">Luxury or necessity?</h3>
<p>We have also seen a growing level of interest in private placements from companies in Europe – and similar initiatives encouraging firms to reduce their reliance on bank loans.</p>
<p>In autumn 2014, private placements – and specifically the question of whether a European PP market to rival the US will develop – was one of the most keenly discussed topics at the Loan Market Association’s (LMA) annual Syndicated Loans Conference in London. On that question, the general sentiment was optimistic. A straw poll of the 850 delegates in attendance found that a sizeable majority (78%) believe that such a market will become established within the next decade. In addition, just under half (49%) indicated their conviction that we will see one emerge within as little as five years.</p>
<p>Earlier in the session, a panel of fixed-income investors were asked if a Europe-wide market for private placements is even needed. After all, companies today can choose to issue a private placement in the US market denominated in dollars, before converting back into euros. In fact, a lot of companies these days are even finding investors in the US willing to lend to them in euros, thereby saving them the bother of executing the conversion themselves. Companies might also find the credit they need in one of Europe’s local markets – the German Schuldschein sector, and the nascent French and UK markets – each of which has seen growing international interest from both investors and issuers in recent years.</p>
<p>However, the ability to issue private placements in a pan-European market would be a big advantage for borrowers, the panel insisted. “It would be much easier for companies to borrow locally in local currency,” Calum Macphail, Head of Corporate Private Placements at M&amp;G Investments, told delegates. Investors, he explained, tend to extend their willingness to lend right across the yield curve when dealing with familiar, local companies.</p>
<p>A European market would also simplify the process enormously, especially on the legal side of things, he added. “If borrowers have the ability to use documentation that is familiar and consistent and cheapens the process – that has got to be beneficial as well.”</p>
<p>Investors would stand to benefit too, Emmanuelle Nasse Bridier, Chief Credit Officer at the AXA Group, pointed out. It’s no secret that institutional investors have felt the need to be a bit more adventurous with their portfolios of late. In the current ultra-low yield market, insurance and pension funds have found it all but necessary to diversify into new asset classes to secure some return on the amount of liquidity they are now holding. Developing a pan-European PP market would certainly help them in that respect.</p>
<p>“For us insurance companies a European private placements market would offer new opportunities that are not available on the public market, most of which are well organised and strongly performing corporates,” she noted. “We are looking for new investment opportunities with that type of company.”</p>

<h3 id=""the-need-for-consistency"">The need for consistency</h3>
<p>Having agreed unanimously that building a private placement market in Europe would be a positive step, the panel then moved on to address the barriers that need to be overcome before that can become a reality. When the question was put to delegates earlier the answer was clear. Just under half (47%) said that the main thing that Europe needed to begin competing on equal terms with the USPP market was greater standardisation, particularly with respect to the legal documentation used across various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Eliminating such inconsistencies is something that the LMA has itself taken a leading role in. In January 2014, the group announced that it is working with banks and law firms on developing a standardised template for use in private placement transactions. Further encouragement for this objective came when, in February 2015, the European Commission (EC) published a Green Paper “Building a Capital Markets Union,’ promising steps to facilitate the work of industry bodies in developing common market practises and documentation for private placements. This is just the beginning, however; the investors on the panel were keen to emphasise that much more progress is needed in this space if Europe is ever to rival the USPP market. “Regulation is very different around Europe when it comes to credit markets,” AXA Group’s Bridier said. “I think if we had a European framework around investment regulation that would solve a lot of the problem.”</p>
<h3 id=""come-together"">Come together</h3>
<p>If the industry now joins forces to iron out the differences at local level then the liquidity should soon follow, the panel concurred. “We are seeing investors become increasingly interested in European private placements markets,” asserted Richard Waddington, Head of Loan Sales at Commerzbank. “Clearly there are challenges, but we’ve got to work together to overcome these challenges and help develop and grow the market,” he added. “There is most certainly demand from issuers, but it is about trying to match that demand with investors’ requirements.”</p>
<p>Achieving that match may take some time, but it is not beyond the industry’s reach. In the end the panel arrived at the consensus that a pan-European market will emerge in time, albeit a segmented one. That is not as contradictory as it might first seem, M&amp;G Investments’ Macphail explained. If a company wants to raise a relatively small amount of funding – say €10m – then it may still be best served by its local market. But there are, of course, no shortage of companies who have larger requirements and, for them, tapping into larger pools of liquidity on a pan-European basis would be the more ideal option.</p>

<p>“If we are talking about a market for everyone, not just the happy few, then you need to have a different response depending on the requirement,” he said. “For a small bilateral loan then local is great. However, we also need to cater for the needs of those larger companies who want to borrow Europe-wide. I think the market is flexible enough to accommodate both.”</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In a year where bank lending once again contracted and the ultra-low rate environment pushed investors still further out on the yield curve, it seemed inevitable that private placements would be one of the hot topics of 2014. And so it proved.</p>
<p>Corporates, wherever they are in the world, now need new options when it comes to financing the business. Accordingly, those companies for whom the public debt capital markets are not a feasible option, the private placement markets are becoming an increasingly popular alternative source of capital.</p>
<p>The trend can be seen worldwide although, as we will see, there are some important differences between, and even within, regions such as Asia and Western Europe.</p>
<h3 id=""a-turbulent-decade"">A turbulent decade</h3>
<p>Asian capital market issuance is growing rapidly. Regulation has been one of the drivers. In recent years, there have been efforts in the region to improve access to public capital markets through the simplification of legal documentation and the investor base has widened substantially.</p>
<p>“Traditionally Asia has been a bit of bank loan market,” says Vijay Chandler, Executive Director of the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA). The bond market is typically smaller relative to the loan market, at least in terms of the total outstanding. Although this continues to be the case, there are signs that change is afoot. “What has happened in recent years is that the banks have been pulling back from the syndicated loans market, largely as a result of the Basel III guidelines and other regulatory pressures. Bond issuance has really grown, as a result.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a while, this proved a happy arrangement for all concerned. Investors bought up all the debt they could, providing companies with much needed financing, and secured very attractive yields in return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been a change, also, in the type of debt being issued on Asia’s capital markets. About a decade ago, private placements in Asia were – with the benefit of hindsight – moving into bubble territory. Western hedge and private-equity funds came to take advantage of the region’s burgeoning growth, but soon found that there was little to purchase on Asia’s underdeveloped capital markets. Some corporates in Asia, meanwhile, faced obstacles to issuing on the public capital markets. Thus each party ended up solving the other’s problem, and the issuance of dollar-denominated debt boomed.</p>
<p>“This was before the financial crisis, remember, so everyone was gung-ho. You had the likes of Indonesian mining companies coming to the market looking for bridge finance prior to an initial public offering (IPO) or a public bond issue, and we had all these investors looking to invest in corporate bonds at a time when the public markets were pretty much full,” notes Chandler.</p>
<p>For a while, this proved a happy arrangement for all concerned. Investors bought up all the debt they could, providing companies with much needed financing, and secured very attractive yields in return. Then, in the autumn of 2008, the music finally stopped.</p>
<p>According to Chandler, a very large percentage of the deals struck during those heady pre-crisis days had to be refinanced. “A lot of them were very short-tenor private transactions,” says Chandler. “That meant that if your company’s deal was priced in 2005-06 – or even as late as 2007 – by 2010, you needed to refinance either through an IPO or some sort of bond offering, both markets which were, of course, closed by that time.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Corporates, at least in Europe, are sitting on more cash than they ever have before. In September 2014, companies in the EMEA region held cash reserves of nearly €1 trillion, according to research published by Deloitte. Surely, then, most corporates don’t need to worry about their funding mix – that is, how their sources of funding break down into equity, bonds, and bank lending – why don’t they just finance projects, acquisitions and growth internally?</p>
<p>However, delve into the figures a bit deeper and you realise it is not quite as simple as that. Deloitte also found that 75% of cash reserves in EMEA are held by just 17% of corporates in the region. And this trend broadly replicates corporate cash concentration worldwide, with approximately a third of companies holding 80% of the world’s $3.5 trillion corporate cash reserves.</p>
<p>A key driver of this hoarding is caution. After all, in recent years, many corporates have become wary of finding themselves short of liquidity, so have often refrained from undergoing significant or transformational change. This has led to event-driven financing being subdued.</p>
<p>“Since the financial crisis, companies have generally been more conservative in funding themselves,” says Richard King, Head of UK Corporates and Debt Capital Markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). “They saw what happened during the crisis, with credit markets grinding to a halt, and there has since been an increasing desire among corporates to boost their liquidity, even to the extent where they’re sometimes overfunding themselves.”</p>
<p>Colm Rainey, Head of UK Debt Capital Markets at Citi, concurs that caution is now the name of the game. “There is definitely a higher degree of caution in the market now,” he says. “It is a case of ‘once bitten, twice shy’, but even those who didn’t get bitten in 2007 knew another corporate who did.”</p>
<p>Many corporates are expressing this caution in the way they pre-fund maturities. “In cases where companies know they have got bond or loan maturities coming up, they are tending to pre-fund those maturities earlier,” says BofAML’s King. “In the past they might have waited only 12 months before the maturity, whereas now they’re typically going to the markets and funding them a lot earlier.”</p>
<p>“No one’s getting into trouble with management for being pre-funded, particularly with debt costs as low as they are,” adds Citi’s Rainey. “This caution is permeating organisations. There is a genuine belief in companies – not only from treasurers, but from the board level down, that it’s better to be safe and bear the cost of carry than worry overly about carry and then realise it’s blown up in several months’ time. This is an organisational change – treasurers are being listened to more carefully than they were in the past.”</p>
<h3 id=""monitoring-counterparty-risk"">Monitoring counterparty risk</h3>
<p>Amid this mood of caution, counterparty risk monitoring has also come right to the fore. “Pre-financial crisis there were many companies that didn’t even think about the counterparty risk on banks – they thought that, within reason, banks were never going to fail as the majority of the big banks were very highly rated,” says BofAML’s King. “The financial crisis has shown that’s something they absolutely have to think about, as most – if not all – of the banking sector has been downgraded since the crisis.”</p>
<p>Of course, regulation has also played a part in creating this environment. Since the financial crisis, regulation on banks – such as the capital adequacy measures that are part of Basel III – has begun to transform the way they are structured, and to a certain extent, has impinged on their lending activity as well as the buffers they hold. Barclays, for instance, has twice the amount of capital it had pre-crisis and seven times the liquidity. This regulation has had, and will continue to have, an impact on corporate lending activity, acting as a brake on some of the business the banks were able to provide customers in times gone by.</p>
<p>“The banking industry is facing long-term structural changes through regulatory initiatives,” explains Karl Nolson, Head of Debt, Managing Director, Barclays Corporate Banking. “The industry as a whole is certainly benefiting from additional governance as banks are required to put aside significantly more capital for every pound they lend. Therefore, put simply, regulation is likely to act as a floor on loan pricing and an appetite ceiling in terms of the amount of credit that banks will be prepared to provide for customers.”</p>
<p>Despite this caution, and the impact of bank regulation on lending, it is not all doom and gloom in the bank lending market. “That’s not to say that the loan market is not buoyant – banks are keen to lend and indeed prepared to underwrite large loan transactions – as we have seen on a number of occasions this year. However, the majority of loan demand has come from finance teams taking advantage of the lowest cost of debt for a generation and banks being very keen to lend,” says Nolson.</p>
<p>He adds that bank lending should continue to be a key means of providing finance for corporates. “It is important to note that loans still remain a staple source of funding for European businesses: their share of total financing may have fallen since 2008, but volumes have remained far more stable over the past seven years than other types of funding. So, given their inherent flexibility and private nature I expect loans to remain a strategically core funding component for UK and European businesses.”</p>
<h3 id=""an-alternative-route"">An alternative route</h3>
<p>Banks are not the only ones to provide funding to corporates. A big development that has shifted the corporate funding mix in recent years is the emergence of alternative financing. Banks that have historically provided lending to corporates are no longer just competing with other banks or traditional lenders. Peer-to-peer lenders and challenger banks are providing additional liquidity to smaller businesses, while mid-to-large sized corporates are increasingly looking to non-bank lenders, including lenders in the private equity space. Meanwhile, multinational corporates are increasingly turning to private placement funding.</p>
<p>“The common underlying theme for alternative sources of finance is low interest rates causing investors to search for higher returns by entering new or alternative markets,” says Barclays’s Nolson. “This additional liquidity, or more people investing, is seen in the fall in average Yield-to-Worst for BB-rated high-yield bonds from highs of above 10% in 2011 to current levels of 5% and the volumes of UK non-financial borrowers have risen from $70 billion in 2007 to $101 billion in 2014 to date.”</p>
<p>However, despite the growth in alternative financing, capital market financing remains the biggest alternative to bank lending. “Business is benefiting from a more diversified funding mix – borrowers are presented with highly attractive financing options and this has led to less reliance on traditional bank loans,” says Nolson. “We can see these trends reflected in corporate capital raising in the UK – for instance, in 2007, loans represented 75% of corporate funding, but since then debt capital market and equity capital market funding have made up an increasing share with 30% and 13% of the capital stack in 2014 respectively, with loans therefore making up 56%.” Bonds, therefore, remain crucial for corporates. But could they eclipse bank lending?</p>
<h3 id=""bank-to-bond-shift"">Bank to bond shift?</h3>
<p>A commonly held view is that corporates in the US are much more reliant on the debt capital markets for their financing than their European counterparts. Indeed, in 2007, around 20% of the corporate funding mix in the US was made up of bonds, compared with just over 10% in the EU (see Charts <a href=""#chart-1"">1</a> and <a href=""#chart-2"">2</a>). However, since then reliance on bonds in both regions has fluctuated, rising in 2009 (to 37% in the US and 43% in the EU), before falling again in 2010 and 2011 (22% and 26% respectively). Interestingly, the debt capital market proportion of the funding mix in the EU has exceeded that in the US for every year since 2011 (in 2014, as of November, the bond percentage was 26% in the US and 38% in Europe).</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Dealogic</em></p>
<p>Besides the challenges in the bank lending market we have already seen, what other drivers are there behind this move into debt capital market financing?</p>
<p>One is the way the bond market has evolved since 2007. “The bond market has significantly matured over the last few years and this development has made it more flexible and accessible for companies,” says BofAML’s King. “The Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme, for example, facilitates the raising of relatively small amounts of money at very different tenors with individual investors or a group of investors on a regular basis. This allows companies to be more targeted and flexible in their financing – they don’t have to go out and raise €1 billion from the bond market; they can raise €100m or €200m via a private placement. The US private placement market has also come into its own over the past few years – it has become incredibly stable, and remained open throughout the crisis, which is not always the case in the public bond market.”</p>
<p>This flexibility helps corporates tailor their funding needs to their specific circumstances, with the competitive pricing and long-dated maturities these markets offer. “Many corporates need a quantum of debt that can no longer be supported by the bank market, or they want the higher flexibility that bond markets give them,” says Citi’s Rainey. “With pricing where it is at the moment – corporates are thinking if there’s ever a time to start financing in bond markets, it’s now. Ryanair’s debut unsecured Eurobond this year is a good example of this. For an airline to get away with doing a senior unsecured issue was pretty phenomenal, and the 1.875% fixed-rate coupon for €850m of BBB+ debt is impressive.”</p>
<h4 id=""chart-2"">Chart 2: EU Funding mix 2007 – 2014</h4>
<p><a class=""enlargeable"" href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/capital-markets/2015-01-tt-04-cf__chart-02__eu-funding-mix-2007-2014__1184x882.png?la=en&amp;hash=3A8CDEE5F9CF5812292626C7639B0605"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Chart 2: EU Funding mix 2007 – 2014"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/capital-markets/2015-01-tt-04-cf__chart-02__eu-funding-mix-2007-2014__1184x882.png?la=en&amp;hash=3A8CDEE5F9CF5812292626C7639B0605"" width=""500""/></a></p>
<p class=""source""><em>Source: Dealogic</em></p>
<p>Besides this evolution of the bond market, the low-yield environment tends to make bond financing more attractive than bank financing in many cases. “Interest rates in Europe in particular are extraordinarily low and will probably remain low for the foreseeable future, and as a result companies can raise funding very cheaply and for very long tenors,” says BofAML’s King. “Corporates can get 10-20+ year money at very low rates with all-in coupons of 1-4% depending on the credit rating, which is much better than getting shorter-dated money from the bank market, which is generally a five-year market. Bond financing gives you much longer-dated money, allowing you to lock in longer-term rates at very cheap levels, which makes a lot of sense.”</p>
<p>This has also boosted the corporate hybrid debt market, which many companies view in the current low-yield environment as a form of ‘cheap equity’.</p>
<p>An increase in M&amp;A activity is giving the bond market a boost, too. “Acquisition financing is clearly back en vogue,” says Citi’s Rainey. “The increasing confidence in the market is impacting on corporate boards, and we have seen something of an M&amp;A frenzy in sectors such as tobacco, pharmaceuticals and telecoms. This is helped by supportive bank groups – generally corporates are incentivised to replace bank debt reasonably promptly with bond debt – and if they don’t do so then the cost of the bank bridge gets higher and higher in order to facilitate that encouragement.”</p>
<p>“Acquisition financing is capital-friendly for banks given that it’s short term and as such there is demonstrably strong willingness to lend into M&amp;A situations. These take-outs are likely to drive bond volumes over the next year,” he adds.</p>
<p>In the shorter term, low interest rates are also stimulating the commercial paper (CP) market, which, though flagging previously, reached an 11-month high in the US in November. “In the current low-yield environment, the Group can issue CPs at very low rates,” says Brice Zimmerman, Head Treasury Control and Reporting at Novartis. “Also, reflecting the high liquidity in this market, CPs are an attractive source of short-term liquidity that offers a high degree of flexibility as it can be repaid quickly.”</p>
<h3 id=""keeping-a-balance"">Keeping a balance</h3>
<p>Despite the increasing popularity of debt capital market financing (at least in Europe), bank loans remain a core part of most corporates’ funding mix, and the competition between banks (and others) to lend to corporates is intense. “It’s clear that there are a number of banks from across Western Europe, Asia and the US that have been keen to grow their loan books, and as a consequence, the broader loan market has become increasingly competitive. This is seen not only in price or terms, but also in the amounts each bank is prepared to hold in an individual transaction, concludes Barclays’s Nolson.”</p>
<p>Funding choices are often a case of ‘horses for courses’. “Bank financing is still there and is still pretty attractive for the right clients, depending on who they are and what they’re doing,” says Citi’s Rainey. “Companies go to the bond markets for a variety of reasons, but there has not been a huge shift away from bank financing to bond financing. Each has its role to play and both are constructive.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>The face of corporate funding is changing. Companies have been keen to lock in long-term funding while borrowing rates remain low, and with bank finance retreating under mounting regulatory pressure, the bond markets have become an increasingly popular destination for corporates.</p>
<p>As a consequence debut bond finance has been surging across all the markets. As of June this year, a total of 402 newly rated companies have made their first issue globally, close to a 10% increase on the 364 companies who debuted during the same period in 2013, according to figures supplied by Moody’s (<a href=""#chart-1-newly-rated-issuers-global"">see Chart 1</a>).</p>

<p>“Since the crisis the credit quality of corporates has improved massively,” says Pascal Ba, Head of EMEA Corporate Debt Capital Markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill). “Because of that investors are more comfortable with this asset class at the moment and they are prepared to take the time to understand and invest in new names.” What this means is that capital market skills are becoming increasingly important to treasurers, wherever they are in the world.</p>
<p>Irish airline Ryanair is one company to have recently taken advantage of the growing penchant for ‘new names’ amongst fixed-income investors. “We have a large capital expenditure programme coming over the next five years,” explains Neil Sorahan, Finance Director at Ryanair. With commitments to buy 180 Boeing 737 aircraft in the years ahead the company sought access to financing that had ‘deep pockets’ and long tenor. They also wished to diversify their funding, having relied heavily in the past on secured financing. And, of course, they wanted to borrow cheaply.</p>
<p>“The debt capital markets, particularly in the current environment, gave us access to that,” says Sorahan. In June, the budget airline made a debut €850m BBB+ rated bond offering. The pricing the company secured, even in the context of ultra-low base rates, was excellent. In a sale that saw over €7 billion of orders, the coupon was fixed at just 1.875%, the cheapest BBB+ issuance in the market to date. Even still the bond was nearly eight times oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Tapping the capital markets is, of course, very different to raising equity finance or applying for a loan through a banking partner. For companies going through the process for the first time, understanding the particular nuances of the bond market quickly will be essential to get the best possible pricing on their credit. What then, have Ryanair’s finance team learnt from their debut issue? And what tips do they and the banks that facilitate such deals have for others considering the capital markets for the first time?</p>
<h3 id=""picking-the-right-advisors"">Picking the right advisors</h3>
<p>The first point is that it would be a mistake to underestimate the workload involved in tapping the capital markets. Corporate treasuries are rarely overstaffed, after all. It is perhaps just as well then that this is a very well-trodden path where treasurers should be able to quickly find the assistance they need to lighten the load.</p>
<p>“If you are giving advice to a corporate that is planning to go into the market for the first time, my first piece of advice would be to pick experienced bookrunners and appoint an independent adviser if needed,” says Russell Maybury, Vice Chairman, UK Debt Capital Markets, RBS. The right advisory team will take a lot of the burden off the shoulders of the treasury, he notes. “They can assist you in every step of the issue, including the documentation, the investor memorandums, ratings advice and the roadshow.”</p>
<p>Ryanair agree that picking the right advisors is important. In their case, Citi were appointed to help them through the ratings process and were joined later by BNP Paribas (BNP) and Deutsche Bank to be book runners for the issue. Although tasks such as preparing the legal documentation ultimately proved to be relatively straightforward, Sorahan says the advice the business received at each stage of the issue was valuable to them as a capital markets debutant. “We had numerous calls on strategy with them (Citi, BNP and Deutsche Bank) throughout the process, discussing at each stage the best way to proceed, early pricing indications, and so on,” says Sorahan.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-rated"">Getting rated</h3>
<p>There is near universal agreement on the fact that a credit rating is needed for companies to secure the best pricing and volumes on the capital markets. For Ryanair, who were unrated when they began considering a bond issue, this was evidently a top priority. The important thing for those in charge of the issue was not to get the highest possible rating, however, rather a stable one which they felt could be comfortably maintained. The investment-grade BBB+ rating they were ultimately awarded by S&amp;P and Fitch Ratings – the highest of any airline in the world – seemed suitable in that respect.</p>
<p>“S&amp;P awarded us an A- anchor,” says John O’Flynn, Treasurer at Ryanair. That effectively means, he explains, that when you put the Ryanair model through S&amp;P’s grading system, they come out in the A category. In the end, they ended up one notch down O’Flynn believes that resisting the temptation to overstretch in search of the highest possible rating was the right move though, and would advise other debuting companies to follow the same practice.</p>
<h3 id=""positioning-your-credit"">Positioning your credit</h3>
<p>Once the credit rating has been obtained the next job is deciding what form the issue will take. There are, of course, a multitude of different options for corporates across the global capital markets, and different maturities that can be targeted. Ryanair, for instance, had to choose between a euro medium-term note programme (MTN) or US-dollar or euro private placements. There is no universal answer to these questions: what makes sense for one business is typically a reflection of its particular circumstances and priorities. But these early considerations are, says Ba, going to be critical to the success of the issue. “The key is to be really well prepared in terms of ambitions,” he says.</p>
<p>Companies that want to issue bonds need to have a clear view of what can and cannot be achieved. Having that awareness, it becomes much easier to position the marketing of the bonds. “I think one of the risks for a debut issuer is to be too focused on the pricing element and not enough on the credit position. When an investor buys credit, it’s because the credit has been correctly positioned.”</p>
<p>A lot of the new companies coming to the market are small, relative to other issuers, and it is going to be a challenge for them to issue on ten-year maturities. So they may find that a medium-term note (MTN) on the five-seven year part of the yield curve is the best option. “That is often the sweet spot for investors in that situation, unless they benefit from a solid investment grade rating,” he notes. Which market to issue in, meanwhile, will often be determined by the geographical footprint of the business and which currencies it has revenues in.</p>
<p>In the case of Ryanair, whose revenues are all in euros and do not intend their financing to be a one-off, the decision to issue a euro denominated EMTN programme was an easy one.” Now we have all the ratings work and documentation in place, it should be a relatively straightforward and quick process to reissue. That will allow us to take swift advantage of movements in the market when opportunities present themselves.”</p>

</figure>
<p>However, that is not to say the company will take the same approach when they return to the market in future. On the contrary, Sorahan says they are open to trying new things in the future. “We will look at all forms of suitable financing as we move forward,” he says. “We will continue to look at the likes of the global bond in the United States and the private placements market. But for the size of the transaction we’re looking for, the EMTN seemed like the ideal place to start.”</p>
<h3 id=""on-the-road"">On the road</h3>
<p>“Don’t fall into the trap of expecting that a fixed-income roadshow will be more or less the same as an equity roadshow,” warns BofA Merrill’s Ba. “They are very different.”</p>
<p>The first thing those familiar with equity roadshows will notice is the obvious difference in priorities. To fixed-income investors, the growth trajectory of the business is but a secondary consideration. What these investors are really after, and what new issuers need to focus on, is to be convinced that the company will be able to meet its repayment commitments whatever happens.</p>
<p>It will be hard work. Ryanair’s own campaign, for example, comprised more than 30 one-on-one meetings and group presentations in eight different European cities in just four days. But the roadshow should not be taken lightly by anybody, especially new issuers. Investors will, of course, be able to obtain public information indicating the financial health of a rated company, but they will not yet know the business on a deeper, personal level.</p>
<p>So the roadshow is the company’s big chance to impress, and the presenting team would be well advised to go as prepared as possible. “We always encourage debut borrowers to practise their roadshow thoroughly before they go on the road,” says RBS’s Maybury. “It won’t necessarily go wrong if you don’t, but we do feel it gives you a better chance of success.”</p>
<p>In the current environment there is little doubt around whether you will get your money or not. What is at stake, however, is the pricing. Sometimes a good performance on the road can make all the difference when it comes to grabbing the intention of prospective investors. “On some road shows you see that the issuer is doing a great job of winning over investors,” says Maybury. “On the other hand, sometimes you feel that they aren’t generating the same level of enthusiasm.”</p>
<h3 id=""no-time-to-lose"">No time to lose</h3>
<p>The last, but certainly not the least, thing for treasurers to note is to keep a watchful eye on market conditions. With experts agreeing that the favourable market conditions for corporate debt issuers are likely to continue through 2014, should a corporate considering a debt issue move now or wait for the market to move even further in their favour?</p>
<p>Most experts believe it would be unwise to delay. We saw last year how even a hint from the Federal Reserve of a reversal of accommodative monetary policy measures panicked markets and drove up yields on government, and by extension, corporate debt. With recent tensions in Crimea and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the geopolitical backdrop in 2014 is far from settled either. The longer a corporate waits, the more chance there is of an event producing a massive swing in government yields.</p>
<p>Until then though, conditions remain favourable, and corporates with the ability to tap the capital markets would be advised to continue taking advantage, even if the cash is not needed right now but somewhere further down the line. “I think we will continue to see more borrowers coming to the market. Investor appetite is very strong, and they are looking at opportunities they wouldn’t have considered just a few years ago. Issuers can certainly feel very confident and, even if they have only a very small requirement, the bond market will be very keen to see them.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>The Islamic finance industry may have been slow to find its feet since the arrival in 1975 of Dubai Islamic Bank, now viewed as the first modern commercial Islamic bank, but it has nonetheless continued to evolve. Today it encompasses retail and commercial banking, equities, syndicated transactions, debt issuance and structured products in a number of Muslim and non-Muslim countries.</p>
<p>“In countries with a strong Islamic banking sector, such as the UAE and Malaysia, we see a whole range of businesses across a number of industries opting either wholly or partially for Islamic finance, from large corporates down to SMEs,” says Tom Guest, Associate Director of independent investment management and advisory firm, Eiger Trading Advisors. The drivers tend to be diversification of their funding base and the option of tapping into an alternative pool of liquidity, but often the driver is investor demand, especially in Saudi Arabia for example where the majority of retail investors on the tadawul (the domestic stock market) may restrict their portfolios to Shariah-compliant companies. “If a company sees a larger potential market for their debt or equity issuance on a Shariah-compliant basis then it makes sense at least to explore the option.”</p>
<p>Because Islamic finance has traditionally been focused on financing the production and trade of physical assets, it was much easier for these types of businesses, such as palm oil producers or cement manufacturers, to access Islamic finance. In recent years, however, as Islamic finance has developed and become increasingly sophisticated, we are seeing less obvious underlying businesses, such as telecoms companies, coming to market, and this trend looks set to continue as original and innovative deal structures become more commonplace.</p>
<p>It was historically perceived that Islamic finance is more expensive than its conventional counterpart. “It is now possible to secure cost of funding that is either equivalent or cheaper than conventional capital. The view from Vicky Jones, Of-Counsel, Norton Rose Fulbright (an international law firm that has handled many sukuk issues through its Singapore office) is that although the depth of liquidity in the Islamic market is good, “I would not say it was so great that companies not using it for principled reasons would do so for the sake of it”. She adds that, although the Islamic finance market represents an alternative pool of liquidity, the extra costs involved in executing Islamic finance transactions mean that some corporates will not be interested, or will not consider it worth their while, to tap that pool of liquidity. For example, a Hong Kong corporate is unlikely to look into entering an Islamic finance transaction unless it has another reason for doing so, such as diversifying its funding base.</p>
<h3 id=""requirements"">Requirements</h3>
<p>Although open to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, all Islamic finance products are subject to the interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, by Muslim scholars. All products must, for example, adhere to restrictions on investments in companies involved in gambling, pornography, alcoholic beverages or porcine food products. The application of interest is prohibited which means providers and consumers of Islamic finance must find a different route to reimbursement. Islamic finance also demands tighter integration between the sources and application of funds which almost inevitably introduces extra (but not insurmountable) complexity at both an administrative and legal level.</p>
<p>Each Islamic financial services provider will have its own Shariah board of scholars which will issue guidance on the suitability of specific products. This is often cited as presenting issues around product standardisation as each scholar may hold a different view. Bodies such as the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) in Bahrain and the Malaysia-based Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) are making headway on this matter but to date, their proposals are neither mandatory nor universally accepted. However, the different interpretation of Shariah is “more talked about as an issue than it is an issue in practical terms”, notes Noel Lourdes, Executive Director at independent global Islamic finance advisory firm, Amanie Advisors.</p>
<p>Indeed, many of the large Middle Eastern banks are active in Malaysia; if their home regulators had an issue with the difference they would simply not allow them to trade overseas. “Even on home territory, if these banks find a difference they will find a way of converging; they are not waiting for AAOIFI to find a solution.”</p>
<p>The level of standardisation of products and governance is the main limiting factor to greater uptake, Guest believes, particularly in cross-border transactions. “National Shariah boards can help in this regard, and the UAE has recently announced a move in this direction, following Malaysia’s example.” The logical extension to this, he continues, is greater collaboration between these national boards, in concert with the international Islamic Financial bodies, such as IIFM and IFSB, to create a product set that is acceptable to Islamic banks across the world, or at least within each region.</p>
<p>The recent collaboration with ISDA in this regard, which led to the Tahawwut (Hedging) Master Agreement was a very positive step in the right direction. “Strangely, there has been a real lag in the market uptake of tools based on this document,” notes Guest. “To a large extent I believe this is due to top tier banks, whose Islamic windows still typically lead the market in product development and execution, struggling to adapt the contract to the international legal, compliance and risk frameworks that they are required to follow internally.” As a result, he feels that what started as a standard agreement, emerges as a heavily redrafted version suited to each institution. “It will probably be some years before we see a deep, liquid market in cross border Islamic hedging and derivative contracts.</p>
<h3 id=""product-development"">Product development</h3>
<p>The sukuk market has been a real success story for Islamic finance, notes Guest. Both issuers and arrangers have brought a huge number to market in recent years. “These range from plain vanilla structures to more complex offerings that, in most cases, are many times over-subscribed by investors in the primary market.”</p>
<p>However, there is a shortage of high quality sukuk issuance, notes Jones, not helped by the fact that many investors hold their investments to maturity even though there is a secondary market. Expectation is also a drag on market growth; much of the current demand lies in the Middle East but, notes Jones, there is “a pricing gap” between what issuers have been able to pay in the domestic Malaysian market and what many Middle Eastern investors expect to receive in return.</p>
<p>What Guest sees though is a good pipeline of future issuance which has helped to free up secondary markets. This, he suggests, is because investors can feel confident that there will be enough supply of ongoing issues to meet future demand, slowly eliminating the ‘buy to hold’ mentality that has been prevalent in the market to date. An active secondary market helps borrowers to price their credit, and ensures a more accurate mark to market for investors. “In some ways, Islamic finance has suffered from an over emphasis on sukuk I believe, to the detriment of developing other products, especially for smaller companies, or un-rated corporates to raise financing.”</p>
<p>Commodity murabaha financing is by far the most common structure, because of the pre-defined profit rate and the ease of execution, as well as clearly defined obligations of each party, in both Shariah and Commercial legal terms. Specialist brokers such as Eiger are usually involved because there is a need to source the underlying assets traded. A commodity murabaha wouldn’t really be classified as an investment product per se; it is more a transactional contract that has been institutionalised by banks to serve the needs of corporate and individual clients. “It forms the basis of most of the innovative new hedging and derivative tools that we are starting to see in the market, profit rate swaps for example, or collateralised financing, such as the Islamic repo,” explains Guest. “I think these products will be one of the next big growth areas in Islamic finance, as we are gradually seeing standardisation in the documentation used, within and across jurisdictions, and there is a huge appetite amongst both corporate and bank treasurers to use these instruments.”</p>
<p>Islamic finance is a relatively young industry, and so the complete suite of products required by sophisticated corporates is still not there yet. The pace of development has gathered momentum in the past few years, “but there will always be a gap between the conventional and Islamic capital markets,” Lourdes comments. “I do not see it ever compromising its principles to facilitate a certain class of borrower or investor who may need synthetic asset classes or instruments to enhance their return or hedge their risk.” Indeed, new structures are typically built according to the needs of the investor or borrower rather than modelled for the sake of it. “A product has to be relevant and practical and Islamic finance has to innovate to meet those demands,” he explains.</p>
<p>Certain solutions have a natural fit for business needs. According to statistics from the World Trade Organisation’s Annual Report in 2012, about 90% of global trade is supported by trade financing. Given the strong trade links between Asia and the GCC (more than 35% of its total imports are from Asia), the Malaysia International Financial Centre (MIFC, part of Bank Negara Malaysia) said in its March 2014 Insights report that Islamic trade financing possesses “a strong potential for significant expansion in the region”.</p>
<p>Indeed, Guest notes that the majority of Islamic financial instruments are trade-based contracts that have been adapted to accommodate the requirements of modern banking. The sector is still dominated by conventional and European banks, even for trade flows between countries with strong Islamic banking sectors. “We should see improvements in this area in the coming years, led by the excellent work of the Islamic Development Bank and its trade finance subsidiary, the ITFC.” However, one of the mains barriers to uptake is lack of education amongst traders and importers/exporters. “Islamic bankers and market players need to do more to promulgate Islamic trade finance as an alternative and complementary source of funding and banking services.”</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-understanding"">Corporate understanding</h3>
<p>The Islamic finance market is not necessarily well-understood amongst non-Islamic corporates says Jones, and in order to encourage Islamic finance among such non-Islamic market participants a process of education will need to be undertaken with respect to Islamic principles as well as the extra documentation involved. “But non-Islamic corporates are willing to explore it and make the effort to understand it,” she says. “A lack of education in this space is not a barrier.”</p>
<p>For Guest, education is the key. But in certain markets, Malaysia being the leading example, Islamic finance has really penetrated the greater economy, partly because of the investment in education at school and university level. “In other countries, where this holistic approach isn’t practical, more engagement is required, and relationship managers at Islamic banks, or the Islamic windows of global and regional conventional banks, should be at the forefront of this push.”</p>
<p>The different schools of Islamic thought can lead to differing approaches to structures and documentation in different jurisdictions, although the fundamentals remain the same internationally. It is more the requirements and the asset base of the issuer which dictate the Islamic structures used and as such requirements become more complicated to cater for particular issuers and as the Islamic finance market becomes more sophisticated so structures become more complex. For example, Jones observes, corporates with diverse asset bases are able to use more than one Islamic finance structure within one sukuk issuance. This obviously adds to the complexity of the documentation and adds to the cost. But at the same time, it is more appealing and allows greater flexibility to companies that have diverse portfolios of assets. The question of Shariah interpretation usually boils down to a case of negotiation. “In the end,” she notes, “deals get done”.</p>
<h3 id=""contribution"">Contribution</h3>
<p>According to the MIFC, the key Islamic finance marketplaces in Asia include Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Other Asian countries with a growing or niche presence include Singapore, Brunei, Philippines, Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Thailand. In general banking terms, Malaysia is the leading Islamic banking hub in Asia, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p>
<p>MIFC reports that emerging markets in Asia experienced “robust real GDP growth rates” of 6.2% in 2013. These markets are expected to sustain real GDP growth of 6.3% into 2014. It further believes that Islamic finance will “contribute significantly” to the growing economies in emerging Asia, with the trade finance, infrastructure investment and wealth management sectors playing a key role.</p>
<p>In terms of growth potential, Indonesia could be a major player. It has the world’s largest Muslim population (205 million or 88% of the country), which is starting to benefit from the country’s growing economic strength. Indeed, Indonesia’s economy is South East Asia’s largest and is amongst the world’s top ten says the IMF. However, Jones notes it will have to make up a lot of ground to compete with its neighbour Malaysia.</p>
<p>Jones notes there is growing interest in Islamic finance generally, helped by certain non-Islamic countries trying to position themselves as centres of Islamic finance, for example, Japan, Hong Kong and the UK recently drafting legislation to encourage Islamic finance and some speculation regarding countries such as the UK and Hong Kong investigating the possibility of issuing sovereign sukuk. She also notes a trend in non-Islamic institutions investigating the use of Islamic finance; accessing new pools of liquidity may appeal to certain corporates, whereas for others it will be the publicity value of conducting a more unusual debt issue.</p>
<p>Ultimately growth of Islamic finance will be sustained by the retail client base, especially in Indonesia. This base layer will provide a huge capital base with which to extend Shariah-compliant funding to corporations and entrepreneurs, says Guest. “As these investors become more sophisticated, and wealthier, we should see increased participation in stock markets, and indeed debt markets through pension funds and Takaful funds.” This will in turn bring more issuers to market, and more companies exploring Islamic finance as a viable alternative or complementary option.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is instructive to differentiate between those companies who are fully Shariah-compliant because of their domestic market and their ethical religious choice, and for whom Islamic finance will be their only financial solution, and those at the other end of the spectrum – large regional or multinational corporates – for whom Islamic financing options will only ever be a small subset of their banking and capital raising needs. “In between those two poles are entities domiciled in markets with a strong Islamic financial sector that tend to view Islamic finance as complementary,” comments Guest. “What will tip the balance is further development of the Islamic product set, as well as cost and level of service. Islamic finance is in a competitive market for this business, and for the most part the gap is closing as Islamic banks and windows invest in improving their infrastructure and human resources.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>It was yet another huge year for corporate bond issuance in 2013, with the combination of artificially low long-term interest rates and strong investor demand once again pushing debt sales to record levels in European markets.</p>
<p>The issuance boom has resulted in a change in the corporate debt stack. In Europe, companies have traditionally relied upon bank loans for their financing needs. But today, “the loan market share of the corporate debt stack in Western Europe stands at roughly 50%, a reduction of 10% from what it was just two years before,” says Karl Nolson, Managing Director, Debt Finance, Barclays. “In the UK the decline in the same period has been more abrupt, dropping from just over 70% to just inside 50%. Now, there is a considerable amount of liquidity chasing very few deals and this has helped pricing in the loan market to regain some of its competitiveness.”</p>
<p>In the Asia Pacific region, the balance of the corporate debt stack moved in the opposite direction. In the bond markets, the coupons paid on debt increased for many corporates during 2013 after the Federal Reserve’s announcement of its plans to unwind its asset purchases triggered a sell-off in dollar denominated debt across a number of emerging markets. Bond issuance, which had hit record highs in 2012, declined, driving companies back to the more competitive loan market for their financing needs.</p>
<p>Overall though, funding conditions for corporates remain favourable across the board. In Treasury Today’s 2013 European Benchmarking Study, a majority of treasurers (79%) indicated that credit costs had remained the same or declined during the past year. In the Asia Pacific region the figure (75%) was only marginally lower.</p>

<p>Corporates know that this era of cheap credit is not going to last forever. With the global economy recovering, interest rates are set to rise sooner or later. To make the most of low borrowing costs conditions while they last, a significant number of companies with existing debt due to mature in the next few years are now entering into negotiations with their lenders to modify and extend terms.</p>
<p>But what is the key to successful refinancing? Every company is different and, as such, are likely to approach such negotiations in their own individual ways. However, when Treasury Today raised the subject of best practices in refinancing with corporates and banks, it quickly became apparent that there are some general principles companies can follow to secure the best possible terms from their lenders.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-in-on-investor-bond-appetite"">Cash in on investor bond appetite</h3>
<p>Both investment-grade and high yield corporate debt issuance have set new records in the US and Europe over the past year. But such is the volume of liquidity in the global economy at the moment that demand for non-financial corporate debt in the US private placement market is still outstripping the supply, says David Cleary, Co-Head of US Private Placements at Lloyds Bank. This supply and demand imbalance has led some US investors to attempt to differentiate themselves by offering, for instance, delayed funding or euro or sterling denominated debt. The trend might provide those corporates who have the ability to access capital markets some unique financing opportunities, whether that be for the purpose of restructuring existing debt, M&amp;A or growth capex.</p>
<p>“That is one of the appeals of the private placement market to the UK or European corporate,” says Cleary. “Because investors are looking for ways to differentiate themselves, corporates issuing debt in this market can secure much greater flexibility in their financing. It gives them the opportunity to mix tenors and use different currencies and tranches.”</p>
<p>Treasurers evidently now have an abundance of options these days when it comes to refinancing on the capital markets. It is important to consider each of these options early on, says Cleary, referring to the core debt quantum in the business plan and considering the potential impact of any future developments such as mergers and acquisitions or unexpected capital expenditure requirements.</p>
<p>“Finance teams need to ensure that the finance they are putting in place today works over the life of that debt facility,” he says. And that is the case whether the company is looking to take on debt with five year maturity from the bank market, or ten or 15 years in the bond or private placement market. “Assess the options,” adds Cleary. “Ensure that each is fit for purpose, and ensure that the terms and conditions will meet your business needs going forward.”</p>
<h3 id=""take-it-while-its-there"">Take it while it’s there</h3>
<p>Ford Motor Company benefited enormously from taking such a forward looking approach when it restructured some of its debts back in 2006. Initially, the treasury at Ford merely intended to renegotiate the company’s revolving credit facility, but given the positive market conditions that existed prior to the onset of the credit crisis it soon turned into much more. In addition, a separate term loan was taken and a convertible bond issued securing a total of $23.5 billion of debt for the company, of which $12 billion was funded and $11.5 billion was unfunded as a backstop facility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a good market without a lot of debt supply coming in you need to come prepared.”</p>
<p><cite>Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer, Ford Motor Company</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer at Ford Motor Company did not regret for one minute that the company squeezed all the credit it could manage out of the market. Less than two years later the US motor industry was in a dire condition. With the arrival of the financial crisis, Ford, alone among Detroit’s big three auto manufacturers, did not need to request Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP) money from the US Government, or declare bankruptcy. And it was the mixture of secured and unsecured funding acquired in 2006 that made the difference during this difficult period.</p>
<p>“It was critically important,” says Schloss when asked about the significance of the restructuring to the company. “It was one of the elements that prevented us from requiring government support during the crisis and meant that, unlike our two big competitors, we didn’t have to cut back on our capital expenditure during that period.”</p>
<p>One of the lessons from this, Schloss notes, is that markets tend to move in cycles which do not always align perfectly with business needs at every given moment. It is crucial therefore to take full advantage of favourable borrowing conditions when they arise. “You tend to take money when you don’t need it and don’t take money when you need it,” he says.</p>

<p>But in order to take advantage of favourable conditions when they materialise, corporate treasurers need to be on their toes constantly. “Availability today has much shorter windows,” he explains. Therefore, corporates who want to refinance when the market is positive need to be ready on any given day to do it. “In a good market without a lot of debt supply coming in you need to come prepared. If you come in one day thinking that the markets look great, but haven’t planned what to do then you are likely to miss it.”</p>
<h3 id=""engage-early-with-lenders"">Engage early with lenders</h3>
<p>It is for this very reason that Barclays’ Karl Nolson says it is important for corporate borrowers to engage early and maintain regular conversations with their lenders. This will allow corporates to move quickly and execute a strategy at the point which they need to. It is something which he thinks applies even in the loan market which is not as dynamic as a market for bonds. “Finance teams often tell us that they need to anticipate when the Board is going to ask the question of how much debt can be raised and at what price,” he says. “For that reason, especially in a heightened M&amp;A environment, the conversation with banks should always be ongoing.”</p>
<p>Keeping in touch with lead arrangers will not only help treasurers by preparing them with the information they need to act at short notice, but also take away some of the taxing aspects of the financing process such as documentation and coordinating with other banks in the syndicate to get the best pricing.</p>
<p>Finally, frequent communication with the lender can help the corporate to understand better what is going on at the regional level of the loan market. Although nations are often thought of as distinct markets, there are often considerable regional disparities in pricing. Demand for credit, and therefore the cost of it may, for example, be very different in the North of England than it is in Scotland or London. “If a lender is based in Manchester and it’s their job to look after that region, given the paucity of new loan volumes in general, they really can’t afford to miss out on any loan issuance emanating from that region. So one tends to see regional pricing variations, but staying in contact with the banks regularly can help the treasurer understand how those dynamics are playing out at any one time.”</p>
<h3 id=""be-transparent"">Be transparent</h3>
<p>Frequent communication with your banking partners is one thing, but as the experience of Royal FrieslandCampina testifies, the way in which you communicate is also important. In late 2011, the market for bank finance in Europe was deteriorating as the Eurozone’s debt woes escalated. Nevertheless, Royal FrieslandCampina managed, in spite of these very challenging market conditions, to successfully negotiate with their lenders an “amend and extend” of the company’s €1 billion general purpose syndicated credit facility.</p>
<p>The manner in which FrieslandCampina communicated its expectations with the banks included in the syndicate was critical to the success of the deal, says Klaas Springer, Director of Corporate Treasury at Royal FrieslandCampina. With the help of Zanders Consultancy, the company developed a tailor made solution it calls the ‘Wallet Sizing’ model to help frame the forthcoming negotiations. Using this model, treasury were able to perform their own analysis on the profitability of the business the company was doing with each of the 14 banks in the syndicate, before reporting back to them with the results.</p>
<p>Once treasury had completed this analysis and ascertained that a majority of the banks in the syndicate were satisfied with their relationships with the company, it began exploring the possibility of renegotiating the terms of the loan. In addition to extending the maturity of the loan, treasury also felt that pricing should be brought in line with what other companies of a similar size and creditworthiness were paying in the market.</p>
<p>“They basically couldn’t say no to us,” says Springer, explaining that having the syndicate banks confirm they were happy with the relationship prior to the discussions had put the company in a very strong negotiating position. Although a few banks displayed some hesitancy, as one might expect given the broader economic climate, Springer held that the vast majority responded positively and were tremendously cooperative.</p>
<p>The lesson from all of this, says Springer, is that when it comes to refinancing it pays to be as transparent as possible with your creditors. “They need to understand where you are coming from,” he says. “I always say, if you treat the banks with respect you will get respect back. It certainly helps your cause if you are transparent and involve your banks in the proper way.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-year-ahead"">The year ahead</h3>
<p>As the global economy improves, the prospect of higher rates is certain to increase. Any corporate with maturing fixed income debt would understandably want to refinance before the Federal Reserve reduces the pace of its $85 billion-a-month asset purchasing programme and yields begin to rise. This, perhaps, is one of the factors that has contributed to the extraordinarily high levels of issuance in recent months and why analysts expect to see it continue at least into early 2014.</p>
<p>The outlook for pricing in the loan market is less certain. In the US, analysts do not foresee any rise in short-term rates until at least the beginning of 2016 while, given the Eurozone’s ongoing troubles it seems likely that policy rates there will remain low for some considerable time. Although the Bank of England has raised the possibility of a rise in 2014, it goes without saying that such a move will be conditional on the UK sustaining its recent return to growth. Instead, the biggest issue for corporates accessing bank finance is likely to be regulation, with the leverage ratios introduced under Basel III, in particular, likely to either increase – or, at the very least, put a floor on – loan pricing.</p>
<p>But the impact at the investment-grade end, at least, shouldn’t be too adverse says Barclays’ Nolson. The corporate with “a good ancillary story” and lots of business to share between its relationship banks will, he adds, always be able to command improved pricing on loans. On that basis, in addition to all the liquidity that is still out there, Nolson expects to see the number of deals continue to pick up as Europe heads towards the next big refinancing spike in 2015. “The number of ‘amend to extends’ has increased significantly through 2013. We expect a lot of borrowers to continue exploring and executing refinancings as we move into 2014.”</p></div>

<p>European leaders want to foster the development of deeper, more liquid bond markets for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to fill the funding gap left by weakened banks.</p>
<p>But the plans of 11 eurozone governments, including France and Germany, to bring corporate debt markets under the umbrella of a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) will have the opposite effect, experts warn. If the FTT is passed in its current form, it could cut off many companies – small and mid-caps particularly – from a vital source funding. In a worst-case scenario, nascent platforms in Europe that help such businesses issue could even disappear completely.</p>
<p>The FTT will apply a 0.1% levy on the value of bond transactions in the EUR-11 area for each participant in the trade. It is difficult to quantify precisely the upward effect that the FTT would have on corporate bond yields, which would already be higher due to the impact of the FTT in the underlying sovereign debt markets. However, it would be reasonable to assume that issuers of corporate debt will have to offer investors higher returns to compensate for the erosion the tax will have on their earnings.</p>
<p>In addition liquidity in the secondary market will inevitably diminish, warns Dr. Gerrit Fey, Head of Capital Market Affairs at Deutsches Aktieninstitut, a federation of companies and institutions in Germany’s capital markets. Small and medium-sized issuers, but also large non-financial issuers, in the bond market rely on market makers to access the capital market as a source of funding. They support the trading of corporate securities by continuously placing bids and ask orders to ensure market liquidity. Because the profit margins of these market makers are relatively small, Dr. Fey fears that the business of market making is in danger of receding, if not disappearing altogether.</p>
<p>“It would be very difficult for small and medium-sized issuers to obtain finance through the capital markets under these circumstances,” Fey says. “And that, of course, completely contradicts what politicians in the European Council said in a recent Green Paper about wanting to improve access to the capital markets for SMEs.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-german-example"">The German example</h3>
<p>This must surely be very troubling for the companies who have issued through the recently developed platforms on European stock exchanges, where the bonds of small and mid-caps can be traded. In Germany, especially, the SME bond market has blossomed over the past few years. Via the platforms that have sprung up at regional stock exchanges in Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart, German companies have successfully issued over €3 billion worth of debt to investors, according to Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P).</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2010, the Bondm platform on the Stuttgart Börse has facilitated 50 issuances, at a time when ‘Mittelstand’ firms were finding it very difficult to gain access to credit through traditional bank channels. The Bondm platform is very much geared towards the needs of the smaller issuer – companies can promote their bonds directly to retail and institutional investors without the help of an underwriter, allowing them to considerably reduce the costs of an issue.</p>
<p>Executives at the exchange fear that all this progress could be lost if the FTT proposal is introduced by the EC in its current form. Echoing Fey, Christoph Boschan, Managing Director of the Stuttgart Börse, says he is concerned that liquidity in the secondary market will be seriously diminished if market makers are not exempted from the EC’s final proposal.</p>
<p>Speaking as a former market maker himself, Boschan says that a tax burden of 10 bps is completely unacceptable considering that the average gains made in market making transactions are between 2-5 bps. Therefore it came as no surprise to him, when the Stuttgart Börse teamed up with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology to study the impact of France’s own – albeit weaker – FTT introduced in August 2012, that the study showed liquidity in the market declined by approximately 25%. In fact, one might expect that this loss in volume would have been even greater had the French government not included an exemption for market makers. “This is the real problem of the tax,” he says. “Market liquidity will decrease, spreads will widen and execution times will be longer.”</p>
<p>The issue is particularly acute with respect to SME bonds. In this area where Bondm operates, market making is of the very essence, as these are relatively illiquid instruments. A properly functioning secondary market is vital – even when it comes to primary market trading. This is because investor participation in a primary market is interconnected with the potential to reinvest on the secondary market. If that opportunity is not there anymore then Boschan expects the willingness of private investors to participate in initial bond offers (IBOs) will decrease.</p>
<p>The Stuttgart Börse, together with the other German exchanges, recently raised these concerns in a letter to the EC. But Boschan is keen to emphasise that he does not oppose the introduction of the FTT outright. Instead what he and the other exchanges are calling for is, in his words, “a responsible introduction of such a tax”. This would involve looking again at the impact of the tax upon the real economy and providing an exemption for market makers and private investors.</p>
<p>“From a political perspective, the solution should be clear,” he says. “The objective of the FTT is to compel those who caused the crisis to pay towards the costs of the crisis. But the market maker, the private investor and the bond issuer did not cause this crisis, and they already incurred heavy losses as a result of the mistakes made by the banks.”</p>
<h3 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>According to the EC in its recent Green Paper ‘Long-Term Financing of the European Economy’, it is the mid-caps and SMEs that will drive the economic recovery in Europe. The problem, as the EC acknowledges, is that in the wake of the banking crisis and the subsequent regulatory tightening, banks are not lending as much as they used to.</p>
<p>Citing the recent surge in German SME high yield bond issuance as an example for the rest of Europe to follow, the EC proposes that more should be done to help smaller companies access capital markets in order to fill the funding void left by banks. This could be accomplished, the EC argues, by improving the information provided by credit scoring companies, and making existing research and ratings information on such companies available to a wider set of potential investors.</p>
<p>But what the EC gives with one hand may well be taken away with the other. By undermining the market maker model that has sustained platforms such as the Bondm on the Stuttgart Börse, the introduction of the FTT would clearly damage the funding opportunities for SMEs in Germany’s capital markets, not to mention stifling the development of similar platforms in other European countries.</p>
<p>European policy-makers are presently engaged in reworking the FTT. Recent press reports indicate that the European Central Bank (ECB), responding to opposition from the financial sector, has offered to help the EC redesign its proposal and assuage industry concerns over its “negative impact” on market stability. However, the financial sector will now have a long, nervous wait to see the EC’s final proposal. No definitive political decision on the tax is expected to be made until after federal elections in Germany have concluded in September.</p>

Capital Markets,Debt capital markets in Indonesia: one to watch, Published: May 2013 ,,"<div class=""gs-grid__col gs-grid__col-1-10 gs-grid__col--expand"" style="""">

<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""growth-and-stability"">Growth and stability</h3>
<p>Indonesia has worked hard to develop its domestic and international bond markets and since 2012 there has been an upsurge in the number of government and corporate bond issuances, which is very much in line with Indonesia’s economic growth. It is an active market but the country’s volume of issuance compared to other jurisdictions around Asia is relatively low, particularly in view of the size of the country’s economy. It is fair to say that the Indonesian bond market is still in the early stages; indeed, there were no government bonds prior to 1997.</p>
<p>Amidst the background of an expected 6% GDP growth, 20% loan growth and low credit costs, the general trend is one of increased activity in the bond markets. Ji Liu, a Partner at Norton Rose in Hong Kong and Ferzana Haq, Of Counsel at Norton Rose in Singapore who advise financial institutions, sovereign and corporate issuers on debt capital markets instruments and Shari’ah-compliant products, observe that interest in tapping the debt capital markets is on the rise in Indonesia. This is because the coupon rates on bonds have fallen, making it a cheaper source of funding than bank lending, both in the domestic and international bond markets. According to the Jakarta Globe, many Indonesian companies are turning to the debt market to capitalise on low borrowing costs, with Bank Indonesia having kept its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 5.75% since February last year in an effort to spur economic growth.</p>
<h3 id=""bond-momentum"">Bond momentum</h3>
<p>With a focus on Indonesian government and companies cross-border bond issuance, mostly in US dollar, Haq has seen the activity in the past three years gather serious momentum. The government has done a lot to encourage cross-border issuance, she notes, pointing to a number of “large scale” sovereign bonds, both conventional and sukuk.</p>
<p>As an example, both Haq and Liu led and represented the Government of Indonesia’s landmark $1 billion sukuk issuance in November 2011 and the Government’s first international sukuk programme of up to $3 billion in 2012, both of which were made available to US and non-US investors. These issuances were complemented this week with a further $3 billion dual-tranche (ten and 30-year) conventional bond, predominantly allocated to US investors. This most likely concludes the country’s conventional offshore funding for this year, but further sukuk issuance may come later in the year.</p>
<p>The burst of activity and the size of the issuances reflect the general improvement of Indonesia’s improved credit rating, achieving investment-grade status for the first time since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Moody’s assigned a Baa3 rating to Indonesia’s global bond offering and a stable outlook. Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) currently offers a BB+ and positive outlook, whilst Fitch goes for a BBB- and stable. Becoming investment grade has made it more attractive for international institutional investors to invest in Indonesian government bonds, and it also means the government has access to a cheaper source of funding in terms of coupons.</p>
<p>This has had a knock-on effect. By going through the credit rating process in respect of its $1 billion sukuk issuance in 2011, Indonesia’s credit rating was raised to investment grade, which in turn gave it access to a wider pool of investors and cheaper funds. Much of these funds were used, or are to be used, for the national budget and to develop Indonesia’s infrastructure projects. Infrastructure development remains a major requirement – and improvements to the country’s infrastructure (including road networks, transportation, utilities, etc) is a major part of Indonesia’s economic progress and would go some way to enhancing the overall profile of the country and contributing to the maintenance of its credit rating. And, as Haq points out, the sovereign’s rise to an investment grade rating creates an environment of confidence, and would enable Indonesian corporates to tap the international bond markets too.</p>
<h3 id=""stable-environment"">Stable environment</h3>
<p>Practical delivery and trading of international debt instruments is handled entirely electronically, says Haq. Trading of non-domestic bonds takes place over-the-counter (OTC) and are cleared for international bond issuance handled either via Euroclear or Clearstream and, if issuing into the US, through the Depository Trust Company (DTC). It’s a very stable, well run process and I don’t see any concerns on that front.</p>
<p>The market is also a lot more stable now in terms of its general risk, but companies may span the whole range of risk profiles. At the one end of the scale are the state-owned companies and large and steady corporate entities that are highly rated and enjoy low-coupons and limited covenants because there is confidence they can meet their debt obligations. At the other end of the scale are low rated or distressed businesses that often refinance through bond issuance, getting into the market by issuing high yield bonds which are subject to far more restrictive covenants.</p>
<p>The consistency of activity over the last couple of years contributes to the general impression that Indonesia is a more stable country and this has created a lot more interest from international investors, notes Haq. Companies such as the state-owned power utility, PLN, and the privately-owned national airline, Garuda, have engaged with the bond markets in the past, and she believes that current market buoyancy and the low coupon rate that highly rated entities can command will see a number of sizeable bond issuances this year. “All of this contributes to the increased confidence in Indonesia, making it much easier for other Indonesian corporates to tap the markets, ensuring the coupon rates they have to pay remain attractive.”</p>
<p>The level of bond issuance remains strong globally and with many banks now unable to fully fund the demand for loans, in part because of their own capital requirements, Haq sees many seeking to act as arrangers or managers to distribute bonds into the institutional bond market where there is more appetite for longer-term debt. “The bond markets still have enough room to take up that form of funding so it is covering the gap where international banks may no longer be able to, because they are facing their own credit squeeze,” she explains.</p>
<h3 id=""infrastructure-regulation-and-the-future"">Infrastructure, regulation and the future</h3>
<p>Two years ago the Indonesian government announced its Rp 4,000 trillion infrastructure programme (known as MP3EI) aimed at creating more domestic jobs and spurring economic growth. The scheme covers aspects such as the redevelopment of seaports, airports, roads, water and energy facilities.</p>
<p>A number of state construction companies have talked about plans to tap funds from the bond market, including Wijaya Karya, Waskita Karya and Adhi Karya. In March this year, the latter announced plans to issue Rp750 billion ($77.5m) worth of bonds to finance its various investment plans. The company said it would be offering conventional and Islamic bonds and listing the notes on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX).</p>
<p>Some companies are not tapping the markets to fund a specific project but instead to satisfy their own capital expenditure needs. Garuda Indonesia airline is a good example of this. It announced in March this year, a Rp2 trillion ($205.52m) corporate bond issue set for the second quarter of 2013. Earlier this year Garuda’s low-cost division, Citilink, was reported to have ordered 25 Airbus A320 aircraft (around $2.4 billion at list price) as a means of fending off rising competition in Indonesia’s budget airline sector. The bond market, notes Ferzana Haq, presents a “logical” source of funding for such plans.</p>
<h3 id=""project-bonds"">Project bonds</h3>
<p>Some of the infrastructure developers that have set up special-purpose project companies, as opposed to fully operational ongoing businesses, do face some extra challenges in the bond markets, says Haq. “The bond markets have not been overly amenable to project bond financing because the ability to repay bondholders is dependent on the revenue stream from the project, which, especially in the case of greenfield projects, would take a long time to materialise and are subject to construction risks, amongst other things. Historically, the bond markets have had little appetite for that kind of risk.” However, because bank funding is becoming harder and more expensive to obtain, she believes this will change over the next three to five years.</p>
<p>In particular, as projects which have already gone through the construction phase come up for refinancing, the bond market may present an attractive and cheaper alternative to bank lending. The challenge is to make sure these projects get their rating up to a level that fits within the investment policy guidelines of a broader sweep of investors (typically pension funds and insurance companies). Alternatively, they must find some form of support, perhaps coming from a government-backed guarantee or an export credit agency (ECA). “I think the way bonds are structured will need to adapt – project bonds tend to have more restrictive covenants, which require more monitoring; this is a big change for bond investors.”</p>
<p>The established corporate bond issuances in Indonesia – such as those issued by Garuda – have a secondary market because the bonds are relatively easy to sell and bond investors are particularly keen on corporate credit. The difficulty with a project bond, even if it can achieve the correct rating, is one of liquidity; investors need to be sure they can be in it for the long term, as the secondary market is not well-established. The same requirement applies to the sukuk market, where the secondary market is not of sufficient size to ensure strong liquidity – but Islamic investors tend to adopt an ‘invest and hold’ approach anyway.</p>
<h3 id=""market-regulation-and-legal-standing"">Market regulation and legal standing</h3>
<p>In terms of market oversight, Indonesia’s capital markets regulator, Bapepam, has worked to ensure that its laws and guidelines have not restricted domestic companies from issuing bonds, either domestically or internationally. “But when it comes to the corporate bond market, the challenge faced sometimes in Indonesia is one of perception rather than the actual rules,” notes Haq. Even though there has been increasing confidence in Indonesia, there is still a perception it presents more legal risks simply because its legal system is not viewed as being as stable as other countries in the region. There is, she explains, a concern amongst some looking to invest in the country, whether in bonds or otherwise, around what the legal risks are and whether it is certain they can enforce their rights as foreign entities.</p>
<p>If a dispute arises over the terms in the bond document and a judgment is granted in favour of the investors by a foreign court under foreign law, judgements will still need to be recognised and enforced by the Indonesian courts. Uncertainty as to whether Indonesian courts will recognise a judgement in all instances can be mitigated by incorporating within the documentation provision for arbitration. This takes it out of the Indonesian court system and into an arbitration forum in a country such as Singapore, which is currently one of the main regional forums. As Indonesia is a party to the New York Convention, an arbitral award would, in general, be enforceable in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Challenges can also arise where bonds are secured over assets in Indonesia. For example, if security is granted over land, it raises concerns over the application of foreign ownership restrictions and thus how long it may take to enforce the security. Making sure that any monies, which are part of that security package, are held in accounts overseas can give investors more assurance that they will be able to access the security if there is a default, says Haq.</p>
<h3 id=""progress"">Progress</h3>
<p>Overall, the Indonesian debt capital markets are steadily improving in terms of access and security. The fact that the government itself has issued a number of large-scale bond and sukuk issuances shows its own commitment to turning the country into an attractive investment opportunity. However, Haq feels that the country needs to look more closely at its stance on Islamic finance. “Whilst the Indonesian government has issued sukuk internationally, a lot of the methods and structures for issuing sukuk would not be available to corporate entities in the country, in part because existing laws impose high taxes when it comes to the transfer of assets, which is a structural element of a sukuk transaction.”</p>
<p>By way of contrast, she notes that Singapore, which is not an Islamic country and does not have a large Islamic finance market, had passed regulations to incentivise companies to use Islamic finance, removing any additional taxes or constraints. Malaysia has the largest Islamic finance market, with much of the growth in sukuk stemming from its government’s amendment of regulations to level the playing field with conventional bond issuance.</p>
<p>“Indonesia, as the most populous Muslim country in the world, has huge potential for Islamic finance but it has not yet changed its regulation to allow for that; this has restricted the Islamic bond market from developing,” states Haq. Having gone to both conventional and sukuk markets over the past few years, its government has certainly given strong encouragement to corporate entities to follow suit. However, the regulations need to change and the laws need to be adapted before the sukuk market in Indonesia can reach its true potential.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Corporate bonds were one of the most popular asset classes for investors in 2012. The reason is quite straightforward. Yields on corporate debt may have fallen to record lows, but with governments around the globe committed to maintaining artificially low interest rates, the spreads between corporate/gilts have compressed.</p>
<p>This has created the perfect environment for corporate debt. Investors seeking yield are rushing to buy into the asset class, where they can get better returns than with government debt without exposing themselves to volatile equities. Corporates, meanwhile, have had to find alternatives to bank debt, as bank lending is not as buoyant as it used to be. For example, recent data from the Bank of England’s (BoE) ‘Trends in Lending’ survey reveals that the total stock of lending to UK businesses fell by around $4 billion between September and November 2012. As a result, corporates now need to think outside the box much more when it comes to funding opportunities, and the $4 trillion surge in global debt issuance witnessed over the past 12 months is evidence of this developing creativity.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-in-while-the-going-is-good"">Getting in while the going is good</h3>
<p>With record low rates of borrowing available on the capital markets for junk-rated and investment-grade alike, corporates have rushed to take advantage of market conditions. And, as finance departments start planning further ahead, the “doubling-up” factors of pre-funding and liability management begin to come into play, according to Farouk Ramzan, Head of Corporate Debt, Capital Markets, Lloyds.</p>
<p>“All in all, the cost of debt in 2012 was very low,” he says. “Corporates see the current market conditions as a great opportunity to pre-fund and for liability management – to get more cash on the balance sheet and buy back expensive debt.” Companies, have been funding not just for the current year, but also further out in the future. “That is one of the main reasons for this quick increase in debt issuance,” he says. “Since credit spreads and yields are really low, many treasurers and CFOs are looking beyond the 2012 maturities to 2013, or perhaps 2014.”</p>
<p>As Ramzan explains, companies have been using the bullish trajectory of fixed income capital markets to improve their balance sheets. Ford Motor Company was among a number of companies borrowing on the capital markets taking advantage of a post-fiscal cliff rally in early January, issuing $2 billion worth of 4.75% 30-year notes. Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer of Ford, explains that favourable market conditions were a significant factor in the company’s decision to enter the capital markets for funding in January. “Interest rates have been lowered again and again,” he explains, “and so have credit spreads.” Combining the business case and an ideal capital markets environment meant that issuing bonds is a “no-brainer”. The ability to issue a BBB-rated bond with a sub 5% yield was an opportunity in the market that Ford couldn’t pass up.</p>
<p>“We are using the proceeds partly to call higher cost debt,” he adds. “There is about $600m of similar maturity which has a 7.5% coupon, so that represents a significant saving and interest expense. The bulk of the remainder will be used to fund our pension plans.”</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-debt-in-emerging-markets"">Corporate debt in emerging markets</h3>
<p>Despite a very different macroeconomic backdrop, the market for emerging corporate debt has been just as positive. Recent data published by J.P. Morgan reveals that $329 billion worth of emerging market corporate debt was issued during 2012, breaking a record of $210 billion set back in 2010.</p>
<p>In the past, interest in emerging market corporate bonds was often tempered by concerns over the credit worthiness of companies in those regions. Instead, sovereign debt was the main focus for investors seeking exposure to global bonds. Not anymore however. As the chart illustrates, corporate issues have far surpassed issuance of sovereign bonds in each of the past six years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Corporates see the current market conditions as a great opportunity to pre-fund and for liability management – to get more cash on the balance sheet and buy back expensive debt.”</p>
<p><cite>Farouk Ramzan, Head of Corporate Debt, Capital Markets, Lloyds</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a similar dynamic at play in the market for emerging corporate debt as elsewhere, says Esther Chan, Emerging Market Debt (EMD) Portfolio Manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. The falling cost of borrowing has led to greater issuance and therefore increased liquidity. Meanwhile tightening credit spreads, together with the improving fundamentals for emerging market companies, have brought about an increase in investor demand for the asset class. “The good thing is that a lot of these companies, because of access to markets, are able to access cheap funding,” she says. “And having all that additional liquidity in the market helps alleviate the thing which we fear the most – the inability for companies to get the funding they need.”</p>
<p>One of the principal reasons for this positive trend is the greater capacity for growth and development in the emerging markets. But with growth slowing and with various structural challenges now coming to the fore, it may be overly optimistic to expect the same favourable market conditions again this year, Chan argues. “I think that the way companies manage the different growth levels will be important,” she says. “Whether a company wins or loses depends on its ability to navigate through the changing environment. It is much easier to hide your mistakes in times of high growth because your buffer is much bigger.” This is a factor which will rise in importance more for emerging market corporates in the capital markets over the course of the next few years, if it hasn’t begun to already.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Chan remains optimistic about the prospects for emerging market corporates to meet these new challenges. Companies in developing economies have a considerable experience of operating in difficult conditions, something which she believes will stand them in good stead for the potentially turbulent times ahead.</p>
<p>The market in developing economies is less homogenous than in the US or Europe, comprising of more than 40 different countries, each with a unique political situation and set of dynamics. And this can be an advantage for investors, offering them a level of choice not likely to be found in the capital markets of developed economies.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Chan expects the investor base for emerging market corporate debt to continue to widen in the coming years, despite the changing macroeconomic backdrop.</p>
<h3 id=""will-bonds-continue-to-boom-in-2013"">Will bonds continue to boom in 2013?</h3>
<p>In the capital markets of developed nations, the uncertain economic environment ahead in 2013 is dangerous for investors on two fronts: already marginal yields could be further eroded by inflation; and the value of fixed income assets could deteriorate markedly if central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, begin to move away from their policy of near-zero interest rates.</p>
<p>A rise in interest rates could be particularly damaging to the corporate bond market. At the end of 2012, the ratings agency Fitch warned that while the damage would be limited by a gradual reversion to higher rates, a sudden rise could have dramatic consequences. According to Fitch’s projections, a typical investment-grade US corporate bond with a ten-year maturity could lose as much as 15% of its market value were interest rates to return to their 2011 levels. For longer duration bonds, the drop would be even steeper with as much as 26% valuation loss anticipated if that scenario were to play out.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced of the likelihood of this happening during 2013, however. “I don’t think that corporate bond spread levels are currently in bubble territory,” says Euan McNeil, Co-Manager of Kames Investment Grade Bond Fund and the Kames Investment Grade Global Bond Fund. “If you look at it on a three or four year spread history, they are certainly close to the tights. But on a longer-term view they still offer some value, particularly against underlying government bonds.”</p>
<p>The macroeconomic backdrop should continue to be supportive of the corporate bonds for the foreseeable future, McNeil argues. “We don’t subscribe to the view that government bonds – particularly domestic gilts – will be materially high in 2013, given the relatively moribund economic backdrop and the commitment of central banks to keep rates at exceptionally low levels for the near future. We would be surprised to see any rate hikes before the summer of 2014.”</p>
<p>The market for corporate debt could also be affected in the coming year by forthcoming regulatory changes, such as Basel III and Dodd-Frank. New liquidity rules soon to be introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision were diluted at the beginning of the year and now allow banks to hold some corporate bonds to satisfy their liquidity coverage ratios. Under the previous guidelines, banks were permitted to hold only corporate debt rated AA- and above, but can now include any bond rated BBB- or above as part of the buffer. But with such high levels of liquidity presently in the market for corporate debt, Ramzan is doubtful that the change will make much difference to demand level. The main thing to be watchful for in the coming year, he argues, is a sudden deterioration in the political situation in either the US or Europe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whether a company wins or loses depends on its ability to navigate through the changing environment.”</p>
<p><cite>Esther Chan, Emerging Market Debt (EMD) Portfolio Manager at Aberdeen Asset Management</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Let’s be clear, if there was a ‘black swan’ event and a risk-off period, then the high yield market would certainly suffer,” says Ramzan. But excluding an extreme scenario, he predicts demand for high yield to continue for the foreseeable future. “And I think that institutional investors are becoming a little bit more comfortable with this ongoing background volatility. So unless there is a major event, I expect high yield issuance to continue to come to the fore.”</p>
<h3 id=""no-time-to-lose"">No time to lose</h3>
<p>With experts agreeing that the favourable market conditions for corporate debt issuers are likely to continue through 2013, should a corporate considering a debt issue move now or wait for the market to move even further in their favour?</p>
<p>Ramzan believes that it would be unwise to delay. With the recent compression in spreads with government gilts, treasurers and CFOs may be tempted to hold out for further tightening that would generate an even lower cost of borrowing. “They are probably right,” he says, adding that he expects to see a 50 basis points tightening over the course of 2013 for the indexes. “However, the problem is that while you go fishing for the best level of compression in your credit spread, there is a risk that something will happen that would produce a massive swing in government yields – and the risk of that happening is probably greater than seeing a three or four point compression in your credit spreads.”</p>
<p>Ford’s Schloss agrees that waiting any longer would not be a gamble worth taking. Corporates should be looking to take advantage of low cost debt while they still can. “I would do it sooner rather than later,” he advises. “Ford Credit is constantly in the market. Over the past three or four years we have issued between $6 billion and $10 billion a year in unsecured bonds – and we’ll be continuing to do that throughout the year in multiple markets.”</p>
<p>“But if I was a one or two time issuer in the market, I would go in early and take the chance while it’s still there,” he adds.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><i>Since derivatives are often used by speculators to take positions on price movements in an underlying asset, it is easy to overlook their raison d’être – to hedge risk. In this article, we remind readers that the derivative is a useful tool in the corporate’s armoury.</i></p>
<p>Derivatives play an important role in risk management, especially hedging, and are commonly entered into by producers of commodities. Indeed, the futures contract, a basic hedging instrument, was devised by Osakan rice farmers in 17<sup>th</sup> century Japan to mitigate price risk when it came to selling their crop. Rice futures were referred to as ‘empty rice’ coupons in acknowledgement of the fact that the rice was not in the trader’s physical possession.</p>
<p>Today, many derivative contracts – especially futures – are often settled in cash and are traded on futures exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange. For much of their history, derivative contracts were entered into and transacted on the trading floors of these exchanges, but are now for the most part bought and sold over electronic trading networks.</p>
<p>In the current volatile economic environment, derivatives play a more important role than ever. Indeed, in a survey of 130 of its corporate clients, Misys, the global application software and services company, found recently that that its client activity using Misys Confirmation Matching Service (CMS) in 2011 compared to 2010 showed a marked increase in the use of foreign exchange (FX) options by its corporate clients.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h5 id=""definitions"">Definitions</h5>
<p>A derivative is a contract entered into by two parties. The contract is drawn up on an underlying asset, often simply referred to as ‘the underlying’. The underlying can be anything from a foreign currency or stock to an interest rate or bond index.</p>
<p>Derivatives come in two flavours – vanilla and exotic – and tend to be characterised by high leverage. The former are straightforward derivative instruments that allow basic risk mitigation. A simple put/call option is an example of a vanilla derivative. Exotic derivatives, on the other hand, are often complicated and sometimes unwieldy.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""the-rise-of-derivatives"">The rise of derivatives</h3>
<p>The shift to electronic trading coincided with the birth of more exotic futures trading in the 1980s, which saw the deregulation of many of the world’s largest stock exchanges. It was then that derivative contracts started to be written on all number of equities, bonds, interest rates, foreign currencies and other underlying assets. The rise of ever more exotic and complicated derivative instruments has been inexorable – and these were largely to blame for the sub-prime CDO debacle in 2008.</p>
<p>Although they are generally used to mitigate and manage risk, derivative contracts can also be used to speculate on the price fluctuations of the underlying. An investor in the United States, for example, who owns stock in a European company, might mitigate their exchange rate risk on their repatriated dividends by entering into a currency futures contract to lock in an attractive exchange rate.</p>
<p>When derivatives are used to speculate on price movements, they allow the purchaser to gain price exposure to an underlying asset or security – typically a commodity, index or exchange rate, but occasionally to something more exotic such as the amount of rainfall in a region. A derivative contract that is used for speculative purposes does not usually involve the transfer of the title to the underlying security or asset.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h4 id=""dodd-frank-act"">Dodd-Frank Act</h4>
<p>On July 21<sup>st</sup> 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (‘Dodd-Frank Act’) was signed into law by the US President, Barack Obama. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, entitled the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, establishes a new framework for regulatory and supervisory oversight of the over-the-counter (<abbr title=""over-the-counter"">OTC</abbr>) derivatives market.</p>
<p>The effect of the Act is to move <abbr title=""over-the-counter"">OTC</abbr> derivatives onto exchanges and ‘swap execution facilities’ (SEFs), which will mean that most derivatives will henceforth be processed through clearing houses and central counterparties.</p>
<p class=""source""><em>Source: KPMG</em></p>
</div>
<h3 id=""using-derivatives"">Using derivatives</h3>
<p>Next, we explain how the following derivative instruments work and can be used by corporates to mitigate risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Swaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Futures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""swaps"">Swaps</h3>
<p>If a company that is paying a floating interest rate on its debt wishes to fix the interest rate, it may choose to swap its floating interest rate for a fixed rate by entering into a swap contract. When interest rates are swapped, the two companies enter into an agreement to make the other’s interest payments (<a href=""#swaps-example"">see diagram below</a>).</p>
<p>The fixed or floating rates the companies pay is multiplied by a notional principal amount, which isn’t typically exchanged between counterparties, but is used as a means of calculating the interest payments to be exchanged by the parties – which are usually netted out. The floating rate is calculated using a reference interest such as LIBOR or EURIBOR.</p>
<p>The first swap agreements were drawn up to allow multi-national companies to avoid exchange controls. Today, as with other types of derivative, interest rate swaps are often used to speculate on and hedge against movements in interest rates.</p>
<figure class=""center"">
<figcaption>
<h5 id=""swaps-example"">Swaps example</h5>
</figcaption>
<a class=""enlargeable"" href=""/i/2012/01/2012-01-tt-07-b2b-swap-diagram.png""><img alt=""Swaps example"" height=""191"" src=""/i/2012/01/2012-01-tt-07-b2b-swap-diagram-t.png"" width=""300""/></a>
</figure>
<p>In the above example, company B has swapped its fixed rate (8.5%) for a floating rate (LIBOR +0.70%). Both A and B are still locked into their original loans with their banks. Company A still pays LIBOR +1.5% to its bank, while company B still pays a fixed 8.5% to its bank. However, by signing a swap contract between them, companies A and B have now effectively swapped interest rates.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons a company with a fixed interest rate may wish to swap it for a floating rate is because it suspects the reference rate is due to fall. However, companies also swap their interest rates for other reasons – a company may wish to fix the interest rate of interest payments and thereby eliminate some of uncertainty surrounding its cash outflows, or to hedge against rising interest rate.</p>
<p>Swaps are not always fixed for floating. Floating-for-floating and fixed-for-fixed also occur.</p>
<h3 id=""futures"">Futures</h3>
<p>Futures contracts are similar to forwards because they give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset/commodity at a date and time in the future. A futures contract may require the seller of the contract to physically deliver the underlying asset at the date stipulated – other contracts are settled in cash.</p>
<h3 id=""the-contract-specifics"">The contract specifics</h3>
<p>A futures contract will include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amount of the underlying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date or range of dates in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The price agreed between the two parties for the derivative.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The contracts are traded on a futures exchange, where the party agreeing to buy the underlying asset expects its price to rise and the party agreeing to sell the asset expects it to fall. Futures contracts are used as financial instruments by producers and consumers, both of whom deal in the underlying physical asset, and also by speculators, who use them as a means of taking positions on price fluctuations in the commodity. For this reason the futures market, can be risky.</p>
<p>When two parties have signed up to the futures contract, the clearing house of the exchange becomes the third party to the deal. A company wishing to trade in futures must first open a futures account with a brokerage firm in order to buy and sell the contracts. Once a futures contract is agreed, the buyer and seller are required to deliver an initial margin (typically 1% to 5%) of the total purchase price of the futures contract.</p>
<p>The profit or loss of the futures contract to each party is calculated daily basis and added to or subtracted from the buyer’s or seller’s margin account, thereby reducing the risk of counterparty default.</p>
<h3 id=""forwards"">Forwards</h3>
<p>A close relative of the futures contract is a derivative known as a forward. With a forward contract the buyer agrees to buy an asset/commodity from the seller. The delivery of the asset will take place sometime in the future, but the price is determined at the time/date on which the deal is transacted.</p>
<p>Popular types of forward contract are currency forwards and commodity forwards. Foreign currency forwards are used to hedge an FX exposure when an investor has a payable or receivable in a foreign currency.</p>
<p>The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position.</p>
<h3 id=""forwards-or-futures"">Forwards or futures?</h3>
<p>While forwards and futures are very similar types of derivative, there is a fundamental difference between them. Both types of contracts allow people to buy or sell an asset/commodity a time, date and price in the future.</p>
<p>Futures contracts, however, are exchange-traded; forward contracts are private agreements between two parties and therefore are not as rigid. With futures, counterparty risk is much reduced because the exchange acts as the counterparty. Because they are exchange traded, futures are a much more liquid market than forwards – and therefore traders finds their prices more revealing of current market conditions.</p>
<h3 id=""options"">Options</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, an option is a derivative instrument that gives the purchaser the option of purchasing the underlying asset or commodity at a later date. Of particular interest to treasurers are interest rate options, which allow the purchaser to lock-in interest rates and to limit their exposure to higher interest rates.</p>
<p>An options contract will establish a specific price for the underlying, this is called the ‘strike price’ or ‘exercise price’. There will also be an expiration date included in the contract. There are two varieties of options: call options and put options. When buying a call, you have the right to buy the underlying at the strike price – either on or before the expiration date of the contract. If you buy a put however, you have the right to sell the underlying – again on or before the expiration date.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, an options contract will also specify the quantity and class of the underlying and the settlement terms (ie whether the underlying must be physically delivered or whether the equivalent can be paid in cash.</p>
<p>The purchase price of an option is called the ‘premium’. This is not a fixed amount, as explained in the box below. The most a company can lose on an option is the premium – if the market goes against them then they simply do not exercise the option.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""interest-rate-options-an-example"">Interest rate options: an example</h3>
<p>A company wants to borrow $10m from the bank for three years at a rate of EURIBOR + 0.5%, with EURIBOR at 1.5%. In order to protect the company against increasing interest charges as a result of EURIBOR rising beyond 2.0%, and to fix the maximum borrowing rate to 3.0% (plus option premium), the treasurer buys a three-year interest rate cap.</p>
<p>This option can be exercised every six months. If the EURIBOR rate remains below the strike rate of 2%, the option will not be exercised. Should the EURIBOR rate exceed the strike rate, the writer of the option contract will have to compensate the company for the difference between the two rates. Whether or not the option is exercised, the company will have to pay a premium to the bank writing the option.</p>
<h3 id=""the-premium"">The premium</h3>
<p>The price of the premium is determined by the notional amount, the length of the term covered by the option and the strike rate. As with conventional insurance, the charges will be higher if it is more likely that the bank will have to pay out. This means the cost of the premium is dependent on the tenor of the option and its intrinsic value, which mainly depends on the difference between the reference rate and strike rate.</p>

<p>The premium will be quoted in basis points per annum. If we assume in our example that the bank charges 50 basis points for the option, the annual premium for the three year period will be $50,000.</p>
<h3 id=""the-pay-out"">The pay-out</h3>
<p>If EURIBOR increases to a rate of more than 2%, for example 2.5%, at any of the six pre-agreed reset dates, the writer of the option is obliged to pay a compensation for the difference of 0.5% between strike rate and reference rate. For each six-month period, the compensation payment can be calculated as follows:</p>

</figure>
<p>As a result of purchasing the option, the company is able to fix its maximum borrowing costs to EURIBOR +0.5% credit margin plus the cap premium, without having to alter the loan agreement. At the same time, the company benefits from any interest rate fall which would translate into lower borrowing costs.</p>
</div>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h4 id=""why-might-companies-use-derivatives"">Why might companies use derivatives?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Derivatives can mitigate risk on future price movements in the underlying – be it a commodity, currency or interest rate. If the underlying moves, the derivative protects the buyer from the volatility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treasury team can budget more accurately when they know that their exchange rates/interest rates have been fixed for a period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need to monitor price fluctuations of the underlying – the contract has locked the price in. This frees up staff for more value-added tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derivatives are tradable. If the purchaser no longer needs the protection of the hedge, it can be sold on.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>A company that wishes to raise capital from a broad base of investors often chooses to list itself on a public exchange. The process whereby a previously private company becomes publicly listed has a number of stages. In this article, we explain how it works.</p>
<p>An initial public offering (IPO) is the inaugural sale of a company’s equity on a public stock exchange. Once a company has made its shares available to the general public, it is said to be ‘publicly listed’ and its stock can be freely traded.</p>
<p>A company must perform a number of steps before it becomes listed and its stock can be bought and sold on a stock market. Here we look at issuing an IPO in one of the most popular destinations for such activity: the US.</p>
<h3 id=""selection-of-underwriters"">Selection of underwriters</h3>
<p>Although it is possible for a private company to ‘go public’ by issuing its own shares, this is not the most common method used. More frequently, before the company embarks on an IPO, it enlists the services of an investment bank(s), which underwrites some or all of the stock that is to be sold to the public. A team of lawyers and accountants should also be assembled from the start.</p>
<p>Aside from the details of the underwriting, the investment bank will discuss with the company the amount of money that they are looking to raise from the IPO and the type of securities that the company wishes to issue.</p>
<p>While an IPO is often underwritten by a number of banks (a syndicate), they are typically managed by just the one – the lead bank or book runner. For this reason, it is common practice for a company embarking on a public offering to perform a ‘beauty parade’ of financial institutions with experience of carrying off successful public listings.</p>
<p>During this process, each bank prepares a pitch that demonstrates its experience and expertise in raising capital on public stock markets. The bank’s pitch should include information about how many IPOs it has carried out in the past and in which industries. The bank should also be in a position to describe current conditions on the capital markets. At this stage, it is likely that the bank will also give a preliminary analysis of the company’s stock market valuation.</p>
<p>Once the banks have made their case, one of them will usually be chosen as the lead manager. Some of the others may be retained to act as co-managers, but this depends on the size and scope of the offering. For smaller deals, a company may employ the services of just one manager, while for larger offerings as many as six co-managers may be used.</p>
<p>A public offering is usually structured in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Firm commitment.</h5>
<p>The underwriter purchases the entire allocation of the stock and resells it on a secondary market. This way the underwriter can guarantee that a certain amount of capital will be raised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Best efforts.</h5>
<p>The underwriter sells the company’s stock, but doesn’t guarantee the amount of capital that it will raise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In a typical IPO, the lead underwriter suggests the price at which the stock will be brought to market. It then takes provisional orders from institutional investors that it uses as a barometer of the stock’s demand. The filing price can be adjusted upward if demand is strong (see ‘<a href=""#hitting-the-road"">Hitting the road</a>’ below). In general, the price at which the company offers its stock is below the market estimate.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""going-dutch"">Going Dutch</h3>
<p>In a Dutch auction, the stock’s price is determined by the investors, each of whom submits the highest price he/she is willing to pay and the number of shares he/she wishes to take at that price.</p>
<p>The highest bidder – or if two investors bid the same price, the earliest – gets first refusal on the shares, which are then allocated to the other bidders from highest to lowest bid.</p>
<p>No matter what the investor bids, the price paid is the lowest that any investor who was allocated shares bid. A Dutch auction takes the investment banks out of the equation and lets the forces of supply and demand set the price.</p>
<p>Google decided to launch its 2004 IPO via Dutch auction.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""getting-the-green-light"">Getting the green light</h3>
<p>Whichever country the IPO is being issued in, there will be regulatory and documentation requirements to be fulfilled before it can go ahead. In the US, a company must have the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) permission to perform an IPO. It can do this by filing a registration statement (Form S-1) with the SEC. This contains basic facts about the company and its financial history.</p>
<p>Prior to going public, the unlisted company is of course a private entity. As such, the current investors must give their consent in order for the company to pursue the IPO; this is called shareholder approval. Shareholders vote on the proposed issue and if the vote goes in the IPO’s favour, the company can take the next step in becoming publicly listed.</p>
<p>The SEC then investigates the issuing company to ensure that all the relevant information has been disclosed. During this period, the S-1 is made public. This, in fact, becomes the initial prospectus containing all the information relating to the company and its share issue, except for the initial offer price and the date on which the stock will go on sale. It will contain a passage in red stating that the company is not attempting to sell its shares before the registration is approved by the SEC, thus referred to as a ‘red herring’.</p>
<p>Once the SEC approves the offering, a date is set when the stock will be listed on the public stock exchange.</p>
<h3 id=""where-to-issue"">Where to issue</h3>
<p>Whilst waiting for the IPO to be approved, the company must choose the exchange on which it wishes its stock to be listed. This is an important decision for a number of reasons, including fees. A typical listing fee on NASDAQ is circa $160,000 dollars (one-time fee). Each exchange will have slightly different listing requirements and information on these can be found on the respective exchange’s website.</p>
<p>The likes of Google, Intel, Microsoft and Apple have traditionally opted for NASDAQ, as the exchange is known for listing technology companies. Today, however, the type of company choosing the NASDAQ is much broader because of its success over the past decade.</p>
<p>Other popular exchanges include NYSE Euronext and the London Stock Exchange. In addition to picking its exchange, the company must also select a trading symbol by which the stock will be referred to on the exchange; this is known as a ‘ticker’. Microsoft, for example, trades under MSFT and Starbucks is SBUX. Others are a little more creative, going for memorable ticker symbols, such as WOOF for animal health care company VCA Antech Inc. Tickers can and do vary between stock exchanges, depending upon availability.</p>
<h3 id=""hitting-the-road"">Hitting the road</h3>
<p>With the prospectus issued to potential investors, the underwriter and company must drum up interest in the share issuance. They do this by undertaking an IPO ‘road show’, which usually lasts a week or perhaps two. This typically involves giving a presentation to large groups of institutional investors and investment banks in the hope of attracting pre-orders for significant tranches of the stock. Presentations may be given internationally, depending on the size of the IPO.</p>
<p>Once the road show ends, the final prospectus can be printed and distributed to investors. It is then a question of choosing the final offering size and price, based on demand. If the company chooses an IPO stock price that is too low, it is said to ‘leave money on the table’. In this case, the stock’s price will rise quickly once it is traded publicly. On the other hand, if it over-inflates its price, the stock moves in the opposite direction. That can mean investors are suspicious of the company, which in turn could damage its reputation.</p>
<p>It is important, therefore, for companies considering an IPO, to spend time with their investment bank(s) in order to determine the right pricing model. Once this has been agreed on, and investors have had the final prospectus for 48 hours, the IPO can then become effective.</p></div>

<p>In contrast to straight debt or equity instruments, hybrid bonds contain elements of both.</p>
<p>They are flexible instruments, encompassing a range of characteristics, typically including at least some of the following features. It is important to note that securities laws vary across jurisdictions, and these features should be viewed as typical rather than binding in all cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Maturity.</h5>
<p>Hybrid bonds often have very long maturity dates, or even no maturity date at all, and are typically callable by the issuer. Often, the investor is made aware of possible call dates but the issuer may choose to roll over (that is, not call) the bond at the first possible date, instead choosing to wait. The indeterminate maturity of these instruments is one equity-like characteristic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Coupon step-up.</h5>
<p>If the bond is not called at the first possible date, the coupon may be increased. Such a clause is usually included to protect the lender, who has a strong interest in the bond being paid back at the first possible date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Subordination.</h5>
<p>Hybrid bond investors absorb relatively high levels of loss in the event of a bankruptcy as the bonds are deeply subordinated to senior debt and are senior only to equity. Investors therefore demand higher yields versus straight bonds of the same maturity for the same issuer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Mandatory non-payment of coupon.</h5>
<p>An essential equity-like feature of hybrid bonds is the possibility of deferring or not paying the coupon. This is similar to equity as dividends can also be deferred while deferring an interest payment on a straight bond is treated as an event of default. For hybrids, non-payment can be either mandatory or optional. Mandatory non-payment clauses can prescribe, for example, that if the company does not meet specified financial ratio tests the coupon payment is halted. These tests might include set ratios of cash flow to sales, cash flow to debt or net interest cover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Optional non-payment of coupon.</h5>
<p>Despite its name, ‘optional non-payment’ does not mean the issuer can freely choose whether or not to pay the coupon. Rather, it means if a company pays a dividend or buys back its own shares it will first have to pay the coupon. Depending on the structure of the hybrid, if coupon payments are not made, these payments may have to be accumulated for a specified number of years and paid at the end of that period. However, hybrids are flexible instruments. An alternative way of structuring the bond is to draw it up in a ‘non-cumulative’ way – that is, unpaid coupons do not have to be paid at a later stage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""the-pros-and-cons"">The pros and cons</h3>
<p>Key to the issuance of hybrid bonds is the regulatory position of the instruments. They are treated as debt for tax purposes and – because of their very long maturities – sizeable proportions of the bond are treated as equity for accounting purposes, under IFRS rules.</p>
<p>This brings benefits to the issuer. Interest payments are tax-deductible, and so treating the hybrid as debt lowers tax costs. This contrasts with dividend payments on equity, which are taxable.</p>
<p>The partial treatment as equity is also beneficial. Equity is not factored into certain ratios – cashflow to debt, for example – so treating hybrid bonds as equity can improve a company’s credit rating.</p>
<p>Indeed, this technique is explicitly approved of by the ratings agencies. Moody’s highlighted the growing popularity of hybrids as far back as 1999, describing the bonds as ‘a low-cost alternative to equity financing’. The agency launched its ‘Tool Kit’ that year, giving hybrids a grade from ‘A’ to ‘E’. On that scale securities rated ‘A’ are the most debt-like and those rated ‘E’ are closest to equity. For example, those closest to debt may be ‘perpetual preferred securities with a five year cash call if they are issued by high grade corporate issuers’, and those most like equity are ‘mandatorily convertible preferred stock’, according to Moody’s guidelines.</p>
<p>The way in which hybrids were rated was changed in the issuers’ favour in 2005 as it became clear many hybrids were not fully permanent structures. Moody’s changed its measurement strategy to reflect the increasing frequency of cash calls on the hybrids as the market became more dynamic. That change made hybrids look more like traditional bonds. At the same time the agency recognised that yield deferrals did not necessarily mean a greater likelihood of defaulting, instead treating such a deferral in the same way as a reduced dividend – thus viewing hybrids in a similar light to equity.</p>
<p>These similarities with equity mean that the debt has a lower impact on the corporate’s credit rating than traditional debt. This can be particularly important when refinancing debt – a hybrid can be issued to pay off an existing bond and improve the company’s debt position at the same time. Changing the rating strategy to better reflect the ways in which companies use hybrids has been seen as a core reason for the instruments increase in popularity since 2005.</p>
<p>As an extra benefit for financial institutions, regulators tend to treat hybrid securities as equity, contributing towards tier 1 capital requirements.</p>
<p>However, there are costs associated with hybrids, too. Foremost amongst these is the coupon paid – the extra risk and lack of certain repayment dates means investors seek a higher yield than they would on a similarly dated normal bond.</p>
<h3 id=""when-are-they-appropriate"">When are they appropriate?</h3>
<p>In the low interest rate environment that we are currently experiencing – and bearing in mind the likelihood of rates rising in the near future – treasurers must have a good reason for choosing to pay the premium inflicted by a hybrid.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Debt refinancing.</h5>
<p>Because of their equity-like characteristics, hybrids can be used to refinance debt to improve the company’s books. For example, Belgian pharmaceuticals group UCB issued a €300m perpetual subordinated bond in March. The company described it as ‘a very clever further optimisation of our capital structure as we can treat it as equity under IFRS’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Acquisitions.</h5>
<p>Similarly, corporates can finance acquisitions with hybrid bond issuance, knowing that the acquirer’s credit rating will suffer less than if a straight bond were issued. Further, equity is not diluted by the move. Tata Power, for example, issued a $450m hybrid bond in April, saying it would be used both to refinance earlier debts and to fund acquisitions. As leverage is not increased by hybrid bond issuance, corporates still have room to raise additional funds via a straight bond should circumstances require it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Share buy-backs.</h5>
<p>As with acquisitions, financing share repurchase programmes with hybrid bonds reduces the impact on the firm’s leverage.</p>
