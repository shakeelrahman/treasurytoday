<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>There’s no question that cyber risk remains a major threat to organisations. And it’s also clear that the disruption brought by the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the risks: 81% of executives polled in the EY Global Information Security Survey said that the pandemic had forced their organisations to bypass cyber-security processes.</p>
<p>As cyber-criminals become increasingly sophisticated, the cyber threat continues to grow. However, it is not always clear what responsibility treasurers have for managing this type of risk. So what are the most significant cyber threats companies are facing today – and what measures can treasurers take to protect their organisations effectively?</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-the-latest-threats"">Understanding the latest threats</h4>
<p>Cybercriminals continue to be adept at evolving rapidly and exploiting new vulnerabilities when they arise, so it’s important to understand the latest threats. Here are some of the latest threats and trends.</p>
<h4 id=""when-ransomware-meets-extortion"">When ransomware meets extortion</h4>
<p>While ransomware continues to be a problem, the threat has been exacerbated by criminals who are combining it with extortion, explains Joseph Krull, a Senior Analyst at Aite-Novarica Group who specialises in cybersecurity, privacy and IT risk. “What they’ll do is steal data – and then they’ll lock the computers and threaten the company that if they don’t pay the ransom, they will make public the data they have stolen,” he says. In addition, he says, ransomware organisations have become increasingly sophisticated: “Instead of doing the attacks themselves, they’ve licensed their tools to others through an affiliate programme – and then they take a share of the ransoms as payment.”</p>
<p>As Bank of America’s Cyber Security Journal notes, “There’s a very simple reason that ransomware is proliferating so fast: it often works, because victims face a ticking clock and severe impacts on business operations. For businesses of all sizes, the integrity of and access to data is crucial to operations, and many fear the negative impacts on brand and reputation should a data breach become public.”</p>
<p>What’s more, says Krull, when cyber-criminals break into an organisation, they will look for key data, such as whether the company has cyber insurance, and how much the payoff would be in the event of a breach. “So when they ask for a ransom, they already know what a company can afford.” In addition, he says, insurance providers are increasingly taking on the role of negotiating ransom on behalf of their clients in order to reduce the size of the pay out.</p>
<p>However, paying the ransom has the potential to create a different set of problems. “The US Treasury Department has said that if they can prove you have made payments to anyone that’s on the economic sanctions list, you can be subject to penalties,” says Krull. “So the Treasury is now examining who people are paying ransoms to, and if companies are paying someone on that list they are going to face additional sanctions, or even hold the executives responsible.”</p>
<h4 id=""supply-chain-attacks"">Supply chain attacks</h4>
<p>Also of concern is the risk of a supply chain attack – such as the high-profile SolarWinds attack, in which malicious code was added to the company’s network management product. Consequently, 18,000 of the company’s clients became vulnerable to attack after installing software updates, with victims including the Pentagon, Microsoft and the US Treasury Department.</p>
<p>More recently, IT solutions developer Kaseya was the victim of a supply chain ransomware attack, in which managed service providers (MSPs) using the software were targeted, together with their clients. In total, as many as 1,500 organisations around the world were affected by the attack. As Krull notes, “What we learned was that the supply chain is still going to be under attack, and will be used as a way to find the path of least resistance into an organisation.”</p>
<h4 id=""covid-related-scams-and-the-rise-of-remote-working"">COVID-related scams and the rise of remote working</h4>
<p>As the pandemic escalated in 2020, fraudsters quickly began exploiting the crisis with new scams – including malicious domains exploiting people searching for information about the pandemic. Other examples included PPE-related scams, as well as instances of criminals posing as contact tracers and asking victims for their identity information and credit card details.</p>
<p>More recently, Krull says there has been a move away from COVID-related scams. “Frankly, people are becoming much more suspicious about these things. But there have been some really clever campaigns – such as using well-crafted messages that look like a DocuSign message to get people to download malware.”</p>
<p>Another impact of the pandemic is the rise of remote working – and, more recently, hybrid working arrangements. “There are people coming into the office, and those that either refuse to come into the office or have got used to working remotely and have asked their employers for an exception for returning to the office,” says Krull. “So now organisations have to provide defences for both onsite and remote workers, which becomes a bit complicated.”</p>
<p>Where treasury is concerned, many companies have adapted smoothly to the different working conditions adopted in response to the pandemic. Paul Bramwell, Principal &amp; Founder at Treasury Tech Advisory, notes that the move to working from home has worked remarkably well, with the vast majority of companies having technology in place to facilitate remote working. “Effectively, companies enacted their business continuity plan, which became more of a BAU operating model,” he observes. “Companies have evolved to the new normal by ensuring they have strengthened their IT and data security configurations to ensure remote workers only use a firm’s own VPN, that all multi-factor options are enabled, and increased use of IP whitelisting.”</p>
<p>As Bramwell points out, companies that had already moved to a modern treasury and payment platform ahead of the pandemic were better placed than those that hadn’t, “and were already in a great place to have staff working from home.”</p>
<p>“From my perspective, COVID has simply acted to shine a light on the importance of good treasury processes, underpinned by good treasury systems,” adds Carl Sharman, Head of Treasury Technology Advisory at Deloitte. “When it comes to security, there should be no difference between logging on and making transactions from your office, your home, or anywhere else on the planet.”</p>
<h4 id=""zero-trust"">Zero trust</h4>
<p>As the threats continue to evolve, another notable development in the world of cybersecurity is the increasing focus on the concept of zero trust. “More and more organisations have embraced cloud computing,” explains Krull. “The idea is that instead of having to go through a firewall or a VPN, they’ll go straight to the data and authenticate themselves to every data source, application or asset that they want to interact with. It’s a much simpler way of doing it – but it’s a real challenge for a Chief Information Security Officer to build that kind of infrastructure.”</p>
<h4 id=""building-resilience"">Building resilience</h4>
<p>So what should companies be doing to protect themselves from the cyber threat in today’s landscape? “If I were a Chief Information Security Officer right now, I would probably go back to basics and review how many of the tools I’m currently paying maintenance fees for are still effective,” says Krull. “For any that aren’t, I would get rid of them and replace them with something more modern.</p>
<p>“I would probably look for additional automation, so that I don’t need a lot of people to do things manually. I would look at reducing the number of third parties that can come into the network. And if I bought custom software, I would check it extensively before allowing it to be on the network.”</p>
<p>He adds that while these measures aren’t enough to prevent a company from being breached, they can make it that much harder for an attacker to get in. “As others have said, the organisation has to be right 100% of the time – but the attacker only needs to be right once to be able to breach the organisation. It’s all about resilience today: how can I limit the impact? And how quickly can I restore business operations?”</p>
<h4 id=""securing-the-treasury"">Securing the treasury</h4>
<p>For treasurers, Bramwell highlights the importance of having a clearly understood and documented manual that is regularly updated and tested. “This should be done alongside internal (and even external) auditors to make sure any potential risks from fraud or cyber threat are effectively stymied,” he says. “Compensating controls can be put in place in the event of system deficiencies, but it is paramount that everything is thoroughly tested.”</p>
<p>In addition, he points out treasurers may face challenges when it comes to making sure staff do not circumvent internal policies and procedures – for example, by writing passwords in ‘hidden’ places, such as the bottom of the laptop. “Security controls such as dual factor and tokens (both virtual and physical) also seem burdensome, and appear to make operations clunky,” he adds. “A treasurer needs to make sure all staff are aware of why such controls exist, and why they absolutely cannot be circumvented.”</p>
<h4 id=""addressing-technology-risks"">Addressing technology risks</h4>
<p>It’s also important to understand the implications of cyber threats for the treasury’s technology infrastructure. As Bramwell explains, “Technology vendors are acutely aware of the threats and risks, and routinely test their environments and software for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by groups with nefarious intentions. Threats are often controllable within the treasurer’s team, but oftentimes remain under the control of the organisation’s technology team and the vendor.”</p>
<p>Where vendors are concerned, Bramwell notes that treasurers are increasingly outsourcing a significant component of potential cyber issues to their vendors. “The best vendors will produce regular documentation, unqualified and timely, demonstrating the security of their systems, process and hosting environments,” he says. “These are performed by third parties specialising in cyber security, processes and controls, and provide a significant level of comfort that moving to SaaS/cloud does not expose your company to undue levels of risk.’’</p>
<p>As such, Bramwell says treasurers need to ensure their solution vendors go through regular testing for their own controls. “These morphed over the years from SAS70 to SSAE audit resulting in SOC certifications. This cannot be overstated – any qualifications to SOC reports should be taken very seriously,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""choosing-the-right-solution"">Choosing the right solution</h4>
<p>Deloitte’s Sharman argues that treasury should be employed as part of an end-to-end process, as a facilitator for good practice, rather than as a solution itself. “However, treasurers should determine how their organisation needs to operate before selecting the technology that is the best fit and adopting its capabilities – there will still be design elements and rules of the road for employee engagement,” he says. “Security, user experience and quality of output – not cost – should be the core decision drivers.”</p>
<h4 id=""whos-responsible"">Who’s responsible</h4>
<p>A further obstacle when it comes to managing cyber risk is that the responsibilities of the treasury are not always straightforward. “I think the challenge is that for many treasurers, it isn’t clear where responsibility for fraudulent payments actually lies,” says David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC.</p>
<p>Corporate attitudes towards responsibility for cybersecurity could change in the future, however. In the UK, measures set out in a consultation by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) earlier this year could result in directors having to attest to the effectiveness of their controls. The proposed measures, which have been compared to the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, could change the way in which treasures think about operational risk in the future.</p>
<h4 id=""the-way-forward"">The way forward</h4>
<p>Cyber-criminals are nothing if not opportunistic. It’s essential that companies continuously work to protect themselves from cyber-attacks – and, just as importantly, have a plan in place to recover from any attacks that do take place. And while cyber-security is not always seen as a core responsibility for the treasurer, this could change in the future – so treasurers should make sure they are prepared.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading"">The importance of being vigilant</h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><img alt=""Wolters Kluwer logo"" class=""org"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/wolters-kluwer-122x20.svg?la=en&amp;hash=845D6049C3FC60B2D8EF5FE7E1D3F138"" title=""Wolters Kluwer logo"" width=""150""/></p>
<p>George Dessing, SVP Treasury &amp; Risk at Wolters Kluwer, says cyber-security “is top of mind for our customers, who rely on us to deliver our platforms and services safely and reliably, while safeguarding their data. We are committed to cyber-security and resilience, with our customers’ success at the centre of everything we do.”</p>
<p>Dessing adds that treasurers have an important role to play when it comes to managing cyber-security risks and maintaining related resiliency. “Hackers and other criminals are taking advantage of the current worldwide volatile situation, and their fraud schemes are increasingly more sophisticated,” he says. “We remind all employees on a regular basis who are involved in any type of financial transactions, that we need to remain extra vigilant with communications received during this time of crisis – whether by text, phone or email.”</p>
<p>Dessing adds that fraudsters that carry out ‘engineering’ of the company can put together names and titles, and are able to make requests look genuine. “So, we ask everybody – ‘be vigilant, develop sharp reflexes and use common sense’.”</p>
<p>In addition, he says wolters kluwer has adopted the national institute of standards and technology cyber security framework (nist-csf) “to expand the maturity-based model of our cybersecurity programme into a risk-based model.”</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification</strong> – such as guiding risk management strategy and participating in related governance structures internally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection</strong> – eg holding regular training and anti-fraud ‘lunch and learn’ sessions to encourage shared stories about the latest attempts, and ask whether home offices are cyber secure. “As a result, we implemented a mobile device management solution to protect our mobile devices, and are actively implementing multi factor authentication,” says dessing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detection</strong> – examples include technical and human controls including segregation of duties, as well as common sense checks such as call-back procedures to detect potential fraud early. Risk-based internal audits and fraud assessment activities are also used to mitigate risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response</strong> – “irrespective of incident type, it is important to carefully assess, track, recover and improve from financial impacts, not if but when incidents occur,” says dessing. “Employees (and our vendors) are encouraged to ‘pause for cause’ and report suspected activities including fraud via appropriate channels.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dessing says forward-thinking treasurers have a part to play in weaving anti-fraud protections into vendor management, payment card and banking practices. “To guard against fraud and cyber risks, it is not enough to have procedures, tools and controls,” he adds. “It is very important to keep your employees informed and trained so they can detect and counter fraud attempts and cyberattacks. As we know, in almost all cases fraudsters take advantage of human weakness.”</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Fraud committed by employees continues to take its toll on businesses. According to data from Action Fraud, losses from corporate employee fraud in the UK amounted to £277m in 2019/20, with almost two-thirds (64%) suffering some kind of fraud. This chimes with the findings of Bottomline’s 2021 treasury fraud and controls research report, in which 54% of treasurers in larger firms across North America and EMEA reported experiencing a loss in 2020.</p>
<p>Cases of fraud perpetrated by employees rarely make the headlines for a variety of reasons, with the reluctance of the company involved to expose itself to negative publicity high on this list. Many incidents are resolved internally – fewer than one in six incidents of fraud reported in the UK last year ended up in the judicial system according to Action Fraud.</p>
<p>One of the highest profile examples of alleged corporate employee fraud in the UK in recent years was Patisserie Valerie. In 2019 the Serious Fraud Office arrested and questioned five people over allegations of accounting fraud at the company, following on from the arrest and bailing of its former finance director. More recently, car dealership chain Lookers corrected its accounts in November 2020, partly due to ‘a number of fraudulent expense claims’.</p>
<p>Technology is a vital weapon in the battle against employee fraud, but treasury also plays an important role and it is the responsibility of treasury staff members to report suspicious activities by their colleagues. Bottomline describes assessing organisational payment processes to reduce exposures and speed up detection as a good first step.</p>
<p>Once suspicious activity has been detected, it might be tempting to confront the perpetrator immediately. However, corporate fraud investigation firm Ten Intelligence advises companies who suspect they have been victims of fraud to analyse the available evidence and circumstances surrounding the suspicion, retain accurate records, develop a fraud theory, and set out their objectives in an investigation plan.</p>
<p>Once the suspicious activity has been identified, fraud investigators can begin their investigation. As part of this they will ascertain the facts and make a judgement as to whether the incident demands disciplinary action or a more severe course of action.</p>
<p>“The scope of fraud investigators varies across different companies and sectors,” explains Tracey Carpenter, Proposition Manager – Insider Threat at Cifas. “Some organisations may allow fraud investigators to access confidential information such as human resources records, which would show if an employee had previously faced disciplinary issues or had difficult personal circumstances and could offer vital intelligence as part of the investigation.”</p>
<p>Law firm Kingsley Napley observes that companies should proceed with caution when engaging an investigator, noting that illegally obtained information can have serious adverse consequences. In extreme circumstances it could result in criminal proceedings being brought against the victim of the fraud personally and could also result in the loss of legal professional privilege over the instructions to (and the report of) the investigator, the discharge of injunctive relief obtained, and a costs order being made against the victim. Its advice is to provide clear instructions as to what the investigator is not permitted to do and to carefully define what they are being asked to do.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>According to Avi Kahalani, CEO and Chief Financial Officer at Blackhawk Intelligence, compromised evidence is one of the main reasons why cases that are brought to the attention of the police may proceed slowly.</p>
<p>Upon learning about fraud, many company managers and directors tend to confront the alleged perpetrators immediately, giving them – or their accomplices – a chance to tamper with any incriminating evidence. If the alleged perpetrators are employees, this type of confrontation may also see directors risk breaking employment laws and give the affected employees a chance to take action against the company later.</p>
<p>For corporates that want to ensure they are not recruiting someone who has previously committed fraud, Steven Smith, Managing Director EMEA at background and identity services specialist Sterling explains that there are several elements to a background check.</p>
<p>“The first is identity, confirming that individuals are who they say they are and verifying what they claim to have done in the past,” he says. “Then you have additional components such as criminal and reference checks. There are three levels of criminal record check in the UK, but for roles outside regulated industries the basic check is probably the most appropriate and will show up any conviction that is unspent.”</p>
<p>Checks take anywhere from several hours to several weeks to complete, with the average check taking around ten days to complete and costing less than £100. Costs have fallen in recent years as the cost of accessing the source data has gone down, making background checks accessible to a wider range of businesses.</p>
<p>“The final report goes to the client and it is then up to them how they use that information,” says Smith. “If there is a discrepancy or a significant finding, the employer may choose to have a conversation with that individual. Some will decide not to move that person into employment, while others may proceed but with caveats around probation periods.” He suggests there has been a sharp increase in non-regulated organisations choosing to commission background checks.</p>
<p>“Companies need to consider the cost of doing these checks in terms of time and money in the context of their wider onboarding process,” says Smith. “A comprehensive background check is going to add a certain cost to each hire as well as add time to the onboarding process, but this trade-off is increasingly deemed essential for certain positions.”</p>
<p>ACAS has produced guidance (<a href=""https://www.acas.org.uk/investigations-for-discipline-and-grievance-step-by-step"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://www.acas.org.uk/investigations-for-discipline-and-grievance-step-by-step</a>) for conducting workplace investigations. This guidance provides information on the rights of people being investigated at different stages of the investigation.</p>
<p>At disciplinary investigations, there is no statutory right for a worker to be accompanied to the meeting, whereas at a grievance investigation the worker does have this right. But even in a situation where there is no statutory right to be accompanied into an interview there are instances where it may be allowed – for instance under the Equality Act 2010 where it would be considered a reasonable adjustment for a disabled worker.</p></div>

<p><em>Vince Tickel is the owner of wholesale trading group Hunter Worldwide. In 2018 he took a private prosecution against his former financial controller, who stole more than £1.5m from his various businesses over more than a decade.</em></p>
<p>Having set up a marketing agency he decided to build a group of businesses and realised that he needed a better finance function. “This person came to us on a freelance basis in 1996,” he recalls. “He seemed to know what he was doing.”</p>
<p>Over the following years the group of companies including Hunter grew into an organisation with turnover of £15m and around 220 full and part time staff across offices in the UK and Portugal. What Tickel didn’t know was that his financial controller had put processes in place that allowed him to defraud the business.</p>
<p>“For example he changed the bank mandates after they were signed by directors and himself with ‘anyone to sign’ so he could write cheques to cash, taking cash directly and posting the amount to cost of sale,” he says.</p>
<p>Credit card statements were sent directly to his home and the total amount of the company’s three credit cards was paid by direct debit, so his individual expenditure was ‘hidden’.</p>
<p>“The fraud we discovered was in full swing as far back as at least 2003 (he was dismissed in 2014),” explains Tickel. “It was uncovered when we closed one of the businesses and the final credit card statement was sent to the office instead of his home.”</p>
<p>“I was leaving the office one evening and noticed the statement among the post,” he says. “It was addressed to him and when I opened it I found that there was nothing on my card, about £300 on my managing director’s card but more than £3,500 on our financial director’s card, which all appeared to be personal expenditure.”</p>
<p>Tickel contacted the card company but was told he wasn’t an authorised signatory, so he had to ask his managing director to retrieve previous statements from all the group’s cards. This revealed expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds over just a two-year period. In addition, the company’s bank had set up an online payment system that was in theory designed to be more secure but in reality prevented visibility on payments by batching them together so it was impossible to see who was being paid. Tickel says he recently spoke to another business that had been defrauded and that it was the same bank and method used in their case.</p>
<p>Over the period the fraud was perpetrated the group’s accounts were audited and it had VAT investigations, but the financial director managed to keep his activities hidden by misleading the auditors.</p>
<p>“I had thought that once he went to a lawyer they would get together with our lawyers and he would sell his house and pay back at least a significant amount of money,” says Tickel. “But after about a year it was clear this wasn’t going to happen so I went to the police and explained the situation.”</p>
<p>However, he says the police didn’t even visit him and that he was told white collar crime was too difficult and expensive to prosecute. He then instructed Edmonds Marshall McMahon to investigate and commence a private prosecution, which culminated in his former financial controller receiving concurrent sentences of seven and a half and five years imprisonment for fraud by abuse of position and theft and a ten year director disqualification.</p>
<p>Tickel says pursuing the case has cost him almost as much as the original fraud but that he couldn’t let the perpetrator get away with it.</p>
<p>“Looking back there are a number of things I would have done differently,” he says. “The systems we had in place were not robust enough and I wasn’t sufficiently experienced to know that. I would tell my younger self to ask my external auditors for a pressure check on the business to see where we should tighten up our systems to reduce the opportunity for fraud. Some people think that if they steal money and there are no consequences it is victimless, so the answer is to not leave temptation in people’s way.”</p>
<p>Tickel is an advocate of changing auditor every three years and also suggests companies should ‘change things up’ occasionally, especially if they are working with the same accountant for a long period of time.</p>
<p>“The business got so large that I didn’t look at the bank accounts, I didn’t sign off on the credit cards and the auditors didn’t look at the credit card statements in detail – it was only when we made changes that we discovered the fraud,” he concludes. “When we interview people for financial positions now, I ask them if they steal money and make it clear that the last person who stole from us is doing seven and a half years in prison.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Security controls are an everyday fact in all corporate banking activities. Indeed, identification and authentication are now expected components of doing business across all channels of interaction. And yet financial crime still happens.</p>
<p>For Jonathan Williams, Principal of payments, identity and fraud prevention firm, Mk2 Consulting, the simple explanation is that the criminals are very good at looking for loopholes in the way systems are configured, and they understand how to exploit people as the weakest link in the security chain.</p>
<h4 id=""e-challenge"">e-challenge</h4>
<p>The shift to e-commerce and immediate payments systems has increased the strike-power of criminals. Fortunately, the European Union, as part of its PSD2 deliberations in 2012, responded to the need to tighten up security. This aligned with work commencing at roughly the same time in the card space that looked at 3D security for e-commerce. But whereas fraud prevention has improved in this space over the past decade, criminals seeing a more secure card space started shifting their attention elsewhere, says Williams.</p>
<p>The targeting of corporate payments, ERP and TMS systems and even treasury personnel, is now a real threat. Attacks of this nature have grown over the past few years since Condé Nast was defrauded of around US$8m back in 2010 through social engineering (although this wasn’t an authentication failure per se but a failure to identify the supplier, or rather, the fraudster).</p>
<p>Identity and authentication processes try to ascertain who a business is really dealing with. In the treasury space, many treasurers use security devices to log on to each of their banks. Although these have proven fairly secure over the years, they have failed to enhance the user experience; any multi-banking treasurer knows all too well about the desk-full of tokens. It’s been a great driver to move to the inherently secure SWIFT network, says Williams, but accepts that not every treasurer has this option.</p>
<h4 id=""it-is-personal"">It is personal</h4>
<p>The challenge remains to deliver the best experience for treasurers accessing their accounts, either online or on the phone. Some systems are secure enough, for now, but the highly motivated criminal makes success a moving feast, says Williams. “Authentication is trying to keep up, and we are seeing more processes geared specifically to the payment-service user,” he notes.</p>
<p>In making it personal, the industry is trying to create the same level of trust across electronic channels that existed naturally when people used to present in-the-flesh at the bank to conduct business. To reach that level of trust, authentication is moving towards the combined use of several factors which are demonstrably independent of each other.</p>
<p>These include three primary categories: knowledge factors such as passwords; possession factors such as one-time passwords or authentication tokens; and inherence factors such as biometrics. For business transactions in particular, biometrics are increasingly being adopted to authenticate the individual, alongside at least one of the other two factors. This is a notion referred to as multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p>With the advent of more automation in bank/corporate interactions, between ERPs/TMSs and banking systems, authentication of systems rather than individuals becomes essential. Herein lies another challenge, because currently legislation implies someone has to approve an automated transaction unless otherwise exempted.</p>
<h4 id=""biometrics"">Biometrics</h4>
<p>In changing a bank mandate or adding new signatories, the bank still needs to know it is the corporate treasurer, or other authorised individual, actioning that. Biometrics is currently the best way to provide that confidence. Access to the right knowledge and possession factors do not in themselves offer conclusive identification; these could have been acquired by foul means.</p>
<p>Biometrics as part of multi-factor authentication processes work well. A treasurer using a mobile device to access a payments system may therefore use the device’s identity (and its registration to the individual), the fact that the right password or one-time code is being used, and that the individual can offer up a correct biometric identity (a fingerprint, facial recognition, an iris scan or even how the phone is held).</p>
<p>Whilst the combination of these factors can deliver a higher degree of confidence that the individual is the real customer, it becomes more challenging when an extended sign-in process is demanded, such as where multiple signatories are required to make payments over a certain threshold.</p>
<p>Here, the principle underpinning success requires an understanding of who needs to be involved in the transaction, what level of confidence is needed in the identity of each individual to authorise the transaction, and what means each has at their disposal to prove it really is them, notes Williams.</p>
<p>And one caveat for biometrics, he notes, is the quality of the technology used to read biometric data; not all sensors are the same. Technology is progressing rapidly but with every innovation, only when it is deployed to a mass market will it reveal its true strengths and weaknesses. This pressurises the development process.</p>
<p>“Banks are now in a situation where they feel forced to use biometrics – and they do want to use it from a customer experience point of view – but they remain wary of putting all of their security ‘eggs’ in one basket,” he comments.</p>
<p>Instead, they are rightly considering what security factors, including biometrics, best support their own and their customers’ needs. Given that usable provenance only comes from mass-market adoption, banks and other FIs will need to be agile and flexible in their development programmes. They will also need to learn from real-world feedback as quickly as they can, because criminals will constantly be trying to undermine them.</p>
<h4 id=""bsi-pas-499-a-joined-up-approach"">BSI PAS 499: a joined-up approach</h4>
<p>The range of different approaches to security suggests a lack of coherence across the financial sector. Understandably, each organisation bases its response on its own risk appetite and assessment of which solutions work best; this is likely to continue. The area where a more standard approach is desirable is around the documentation of authentication processes and procedures.</p>
<p>Launched in July 2019, British Standards Institute (BSI)’s Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 499, Digital Identification &amp; Authentication Code of Practice (of which Williams was one of two authors) builds a risk model around authentication, addressing the elements that should be considered when trying to ascertain identity with the right level of confidence.</p>
<p>In essence, PAS 499 provides standardised recommendations and principles for security in online transactions and services. It covers identity, validation, verification and authentication. “Even where procedures and processes are different in each payment provider, PAS 499 offers a system of documenting them in the same way,” he notes.</p>
<p>Mindful that the same sorts of challenges are being faced by these organisations, and that they are therefore likely to come up with similar, if not the same, solutions, this set of guiding principles around factors such as strong authentication, anti-money laundering and biometrics, means the whole industry can begin moving in the same direction.</p>
<p>If implemented widely, PAS 499 at least gives regulators a level of confidence that participating FIs are taking the same security steps for each customer base, from consumer to corporate. It may even usher in the more collaborative approach that could ultimately offer multi-banking treasurers an easier time as they access their different platforms.</p>
<h4 id=""not-infallible"">Not infallible</h4>
<p>Whilst there are many steps that can be taken to try to correctly identify an individual, confidence in the systems being used remains a potential issue in that it’s not possible to know with complete certainty that, for example, the mobile being used to transact has not been corrupted in some way.</p>
<p>“What we can aim for is making sure that the confidence of authentication matches the confidence needed for the transaction,” suggests Williams. “Doing so at least enables industry in general to reduce fraud levels. But I don’t think we are ever going to reduce them to zero, or ever know with absolute certainty that every individual is who they say they are.”</p>
<p>Indeed, there is always a theoretical chance that even if ten security factors are used, they have been compromised. Of course, the more factors that are used, the more obstacles are put in the way of the criminals, lowering the risk of fraud. But some of the more advanced technologies available also make it possible to detect fraud and financial crime before they have happened.</p></div>

<p>Where customers interact with their financial services providers through a growing number of digital channels, so the means of identification and authentication have necessarily grown in number. Each new access point creates another potential weak point, says Ian Holmes, Global Lead for Enterprise Fraud Solutions at SAS.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals use a moving feast of tools to access financial data. For example, ‘geo-spoofing’ enables criminals to use intermediate computers to hide their IP address and appear in a location that matches the stolen credentials. Hackers are also implementing ‘bots’ that use automated scripts to crack passwords. Social engineering is often used, targeting the weakest link of all, the human, with increasingly clever and convincing tricks that place vital information in the fraudster’s hands.</p>
<p>Proving identity is the critical first step in preventing fraud. But what if access has been gained fraudulently or an insider has criminal intent? Although arguably digitisation has complicated matters with regard to identity and authentication management, Holmes believes that it also holds the key to resolving the problem. In particular, he cites AI and advanced analytics as the most effective means of improving security.</p>
<p>Together, he believes that AI and advanced real-time analytics can help organisations pre-emptively detect fraud, rather than them having to deal with the aftermath. AI and advanced analytics, Holmes explains, can be used to spot anomalies – activities that contradict the system’s constantly updating understanding of normal behaviour. With the capacity to do this in real-time, across huge pools of data, certainly far larger than any human could analyse with any degree of accuracy or speed, it means there is no hiding place for criminal activity.</p>
<p>This makes it easier, for example, for banks to stop fraud in the first place, and as the system learns, can reduce the number of false positives (challenges on legitimate transactions) that traditional systems create. This helps to reduce customer frustration and friction whilst maintaining high levels of security.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious advantages, few financial institutions are leveraging advanced AI in this context. Research from advisory firm Aite Group shows that only 10% of organisations are actively using machine learning analytics to orchestrate authentication. Whilst 50% are in the process of implementing these solutions or have them on their road maps, 40% are yet to take a firm stance on the adoption of AI. Clearly, an opportunity exists to improve the way customers access and use banking systems.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>The term ‘know your customer’ is no longer good enough, know your transaction’ (KYT) is more appropriate.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""anyone-for-kyt-blockchain-upholding-the-rules"">Anyone for KYT? Blockchain upholding the rules</h4>
<p>For every transaction between bank and client, not only must the right of the individual to make that transaction be ascertained, but also the transaction itself must be shown not to be contravening any regulations, notably know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions regulations. It’s a serious matter: 58 AML penalties were handed down globally in 2019, totalling US$8.14bn, double the amount, and nearly double the value, of 2018 penalties.</p>
<p>“The term ‘know your customer’ is no longer good enough,” states Nick Armstrong, CEO of Identitii, an Australia-based firm using blockchain technology to reduce the risk of fraud when data is shared between banks and corporates. Instead, he argues that the term ‘know your transaction’ (KYT) is more appropriate.</p>
<p>“We know traditional KYC is often only done once every few years at best,” explains Armstrong. “For corporates and banks, if the director or ultimate beneficial owner changes in the meantime, and this is not acknowledged, either party could be unknowingly allowing money to flow to terrorists or be used for money laundering.”</p>
<p>As a more rigorous and timely version of identity checking for financial crime management, KYT’s aim is to create a deeper real-time record and audit trail of KYC information, relating to both the sender and the beneficiary of a payment. Identitii uses KYT in its Overlay+ platform. Monitoring is already a requirement under Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendation 16. Using KYT in Overlay+ KYT allows for details of the underlying purpose of the transaction to be appended, applying blockchain security to the entire process in real-time, to ensure correct screening at a corporate level, across every transaction.</p>
<p>Most of the rails that move money around limit the amount of information that can be included with the payment, Armstrong explains, and these limits are so low that it is rarely enough to allow corporates and their banks to describe what their transactions are for. “KYT aims to link rich information to every transfer to address this problem; banks using this system will no longer have to call their corporate clients to request information that wasn’t able to fit into the original transaction.” This is one of the main pain points of KYC.</p>
<p>Identitii was a winner of SWIFT’s Innotribe Challenge on Compliance competition in 2016 and worked with seven large correspondent banks for a PoC that followed. Initially, it focused on reducing the risk of fines being imposed on banks for inadvertently allowing funds to flow to sanctioned beneficiaries. But with far-reaching consequences for KYC and AML regulation infringement (possible fines, sanctions, and reputational damage), corporates, too, have cause to check their counterparties.</p>
<p>But with many having spent large sums connecting to their banks, any solution has to be able to integrate with legacy technologies and existing payments rails. Armstrong says Identitii’s Overlay+ solution achieves this goal, adding that HSBC has already adopted it across five of its key markets, predominantly in Asia.</p>
<p>As a real-time overlay system, it allows AML, KYC and sanctions screening to be carried out prior to the payment being sent. As data is entered to set up a payment, it can be checked, the system effectively pre-validating that information before releasing that payment.</p>
<p>As part of its data verifying mechanism, the system leverages blockchain technology to create a fully audited record of information exchange that fraudsters will find impossible to circumvent. If any data (such as a bank account number) is altered for the purpose of invoice fraud, for example, blockchain, having applied a hash (or digital signature) to the underlying invoice, will immediately flag it up. It can do so in real-time at any stage in the payments process. Once alerted, the bank can suspend release of the payment, pending enquiry.</p>
<p>The whole notion of real-time processing in the fight against financial crime is an active area of investigation for many financial technologists. SWIFT, for example, currently has a team developing KYC, AML transaction monitoring and analysis, and fraud-prevention solutions as part of its wider Payment Controls programme. It aims to combine real-time monitoring, alerting and blocking of sent payments.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Cybercrime is a major concern for companies around the world, with ransomware attacks becoming particularly widespread – but how can treasurers determine the extent of the possible losses if an attack does take place?</em></p>
<p> Cyber-risk continues to be a focus for businesses around the world. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2018 stated that cyber attacks against businesses have almost doubled in the last five years, noting the cost of cybercrime to businesses is expected to be US$8trn over the next five.</p>
<p>While 2016 saw US$81m stolen from Bangladesh Bank, 2017 was characterised by a proliferation of high profile ransomware attacks – the most serious of which affected hundreds of thousands of computers around the world and cost some corporations hundreds of thousands of dollars to address. Against this backdrop, how can treasurers go about quantifying the risks they face – and how can these risks best be managed?</p>
<h3 id=""current-trends"">Current trends</h3>
<p>Cyber-risk is one of the main business risks currently affecting the corporate landscape. It’s also an issue which is constantly developing. Carl Sharman, a Director in Deloitte’s Treasury Advisory practice, explains that the landscape is continuing to evolve: “It’s becoming more mainstream in terms of organised crime,” he says. “Criminals are increasingly able to perpetrate very lucrative crimes without leaving their homes or offices.”</p>
<p>That said, Sharman differentiates between different types of cyber-risk. The first, he explains, is where highly skilled individuals are trying to hack into systems and extract value through technological means. According to Sharman, some clients are taking action against this type of risk by inviting hackers to test their systems for weaknesses.</p>
<p>“The flipside is the low-technology targeting,” he adds. “Although this is very technologically focused, the greatest successes are caused by testing the weakest link in the chain, which tends to be the human link.”</p>
<h4 id=""changing-profile"">Changing profile</h4>
<p>While cyber-risk includes a variety of different approaches and techniques, Fenton Burgin, Head of Deloitte’s UK Debt Advisory team, observes that the risk profile of cybercriminals has changed markedly over the last 18 to 24 months. “More companies are concerned about being targeted by an organisation, rather than a lone wolf individual,” he says. “This fundamentally means that a broader range of companies now have to have this on their agenda.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average cost of cybercrime has increased from US$9.5m per organisation in 2016 to US$11.7m in 2017.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shirley Inscoe, Senior Analyst at Aite Group, agrees that attacks are becoming more sophisticated. “Originally, many threats were from hackers and young people who just wanted to show how smart they were by breaking into systems,” she says. “Today, threats are much more serious. Many are backed by unfriendly nations, and they often are directed against key infrastructure.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the cost of individual attacks is rising. Accenture’s 2017 Cost of Cyber Crime Study found that the average cost of cybercrime has increased from US$9.5m per organisation in 2016 to US$11.7m in 2017.</p>
<h4 id=""the-rise-of-ransomware"">The rise of ransomware</h4>
<p>One major trend is the rise of ransomware attacks, many of which have been directed at government units and hospitals as well as businesses. Such attacks typically lock users out of their computers, demanding payment in return for restoring access. These attacks are increasingly commonplace: the Global Risks Report noted that ransomware attacks accounted for 64% of all malicious emails in 2017.</p>
<p>Particularly notable was last year’s WannaCry ransomware attack, which affected hundreds of thousands of computers across 150 countries. The attack wreaked havoc for the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), resulting in frozen files and cancelled appointments. The ransomware, which attempted to extract payments of around US$300 in bitcoin from victims, also affected Spanish utilities, caused factories to halt production and attacked 1,000 computers in the Russian Interior Ministry. In China, meanwhile, the organisations affected by the attack included 4,300 educational institutions and 20,000 petrol stations.</p>
<h4 id=""wiper-malware"">Wiper malware</h4>
<p>Not all ransomware is alike. Shannan Fort, cyber-risk expert at Aon, notes that another trend involves malware which “appears to be ransomware but is actually designed to do nothing but destroy”. Last year’s NotPetya attack, for example, was first believed to be ransomware but was later identified as a ‘wiper’ which simply destroys data without enabling victims to regain access to their files. The attack caused considerable disruption in Ukraine and Russia. It also resulted in costs of around US$200-300m for large corporations such as Merck, FedEx and Maersk.</p>
<p>“NotPetya appeared to be Petya at first, which was ransomware, but what it turned out to be was essentially malicious code or malware,” says Fort. “The purpose was to wreak havoc by wiping systems and corrupting data.”</p>
<h4 id=""counting-the-costs"">Counting the costs</h4>
<p>The impact of such attacks is set to rise even further. Research published last year by Cybersecurity Ventures estimated that the global cost of ransomware would be US$5bn in 2017, up from US$325m in 2015.</p>
<p>While the costs can include ransom payments, ransomware attacks can also bring a variety of other costs as a result of enforced downtime, loss of data, productivity losses and additional employee training. Accenture’s 2017 Cost of Cyber Crime Study noted that the average time taken to resolve a ransomware attack is 23 days.</p>

</figure>
<p>Businesses are often advised not to pay ransom in the event of a ransomware attack: for one thing, there is no guarantee that cybercriminals will actually restore systems once a payment has been received. In practice, however, it is largely suspected that many companies do opt to comply with demands for ransom – not least because they are keen to avoid adverse publicity. “It is very possible that corporates in this situation are choosing to pay, rather than bring this out into the public eye,” comments Sharman. “This would then distort the public’s view of the extent of the problem.”</p>
<h4 id=""beyond-financial-loss"">Beyond financial loss</h4>
<p>It’s also important to note that the damage incurred by businesses is not limited to the financial. “Financial losses are certainly important, and often include ancillary losses such as productivity losses and other hard-to-measure categories,” says Inscoe. “Other losses – such as loss of life when key systems are disrupted in hospitals, or when transportation systems are disrupted resulting in accidents – are more critical.”</p>
<p>Reputational damage is another concern, although as Inscoe notes, this may be more costly in the case of large-scale attacks and when consumers’ financial accounts and personal information are breached. “There are so many small data breaches in the news that consumers seem to be tuning them out (due to the sheer volume) except when they are personally impacted,” she adds.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h4 id=""combatting-cyber-risk-the-treasurers-role"">Combatting cyber-risk: the treasurer’s role</h4>
<p>As cyber-risk becomes a more pressing concern, treasurers are playing a more important role in managing this area. Steve Wiley, Vice President, Treasury Solutions at FIS, explains that treasurers have historically relied upon the IT organisation or a corporate security function as it related to the management of treasury-related risks.</p>
<p>“Most organisations have shifted away from this approach over the past several years, with the treasurer taking on more of a shared responsibility, working closely with IT to mitigate cyber-risk,” he says. “This has really frustrated that generation of treasurers which isn’t deeply educated or trained in technology. Additionally, treasurers have been challenged in accelerating the cyber security learning curve for all core treasury, non-technologically specialised, employees.”</p>
<p>As such, Wiley says that treasurers and CTOs are looking for third-party technology providers to play a more active role in mitigating cyber-risk, “through hosting and other managed application and data protection services”. Consequently, treasurers “are re-evaluating relationships with all mission-critical service providers, including banks, specialised treasury technology providers, and consultancies providing guidance in technology related areas.”</p>
<p>In other cases, linkages between the IT and treasury department are becoming closer than in the past. “Historically the IT and treasury department would have been in separate floors of the building – but increasingly you’re seeing IT departments and the treasury function merging,” says Deloitte’s Burgin. “It’s not untypical for the CFO of a large Fortune 500 company to have a range of technology people embedded into their treasury function across all levels”.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""quantifying-the-financial-impact"">Quantifying the financial impact</h3>
<p>In practice there are a number of reasons why companies may not take action to protect themselves from cyber-risk. According to Inscoe, these may include competing priorities for limited budget dollars, as well as “a naïve belief that it can’t happen to your company”. But as Inscoe points out, “As the ongoing data breaches and ransomware attacks in the news make clear, it can happen to any company at any time, and the cost of handling the crisis probably far outweighs the cost of avoiding it.”</p>
<p>In light of the growing threats, it’s important for companies to understand just how much a cyber-attack could cost them. For one thing, quantifying the risks can play an important role when it comes to moving forward with the purchase of new systems. “Quantifying the implications of a potential attack is extremely important in order to justify technology investments to protect companies,” comments Inscoe.</p>
<p>It can also help with risk transfer decisions when companies are considering taking out cyber insurance, a relatively recent development. “This is still a very young and new cover, and the data behind it is still developing,” says Fort. “We don’t have 300 years of property losses and incredibly accurate predictive modelling to rely on to help us understand the likelihood of a loss and the amount that a company is likely to suffer following that loss.”</p>
<p>As such, Fort says it’s critical that companies take steps to quantify the risks they face. “If the maximum loss you’re likely to suffer is less than £10m, and you’re buying £300m of insurance, you may not be making a prudent decision when it comes to your risk transfer,” she points out.</p>
<h4 id=""paying-the-price"">Paying the price</h4>
<p>However, assessing the risks may not be straightforward. On the on hand, a minority of attacks can and do cost businesses hundreds of millions of dollars – but on the other, the cost of most cyber breaches is considerably less. Consequently, treasurers may face a dilemma when considering whether to spend money protecting their businesses using insurance, or whether to spend the money on strengthening their IT defences.</p>
<p>In practice, the nature and scale of attacks can vary considerably. As Deloitte’s Burgin points out, “At one end of the spectrum, it could mean turning the lights out.” It’s therefore important to look broadly at the possible risks and consider a variety of different scenarios.</p>
<p>“Examples of such attacks should be varied, such as losing system access (eg Sony Pictures), a ransomware attack or a major data breach,” says Inscoe. “For each scenario, all the negative ramifications should be defined, and an attempt to quantify the potential negative impacts should be attempted.”</p>
<p>Fort says that companies should factor in a number of different considerations when quantifying possible loss – including the company’s existing controls. “You have to look at compensating controls as well as the risk that you’re facing to understand how a particular incident could impact you, and then what kind of cost you’d be looking at thereafter,” she explains. “For example, a company which specialises in forensic investigations has a team available – so your cost around identifying an incident, controlling it and making sure the impact is minimal will likely be less than for a company which has no experience there.”</p>
<h4 id=""taking-action"">Taking action</h4>
<p>Whatever a company’s chosen approach, it’s clear that cyber-risk is an issue that needs to be managed carefully. Inscoe advises that companies should “define various threats to their environment, envision the impacts of each type of attack, define roles and responsibilities in the event of an attack, add all this data to their business continuity plan and test it periodically”. She adds that an evaluation should also be performed of security gaps and a timeline developed to address all gaps noted.</p>
<p>Finally, Burgin notes the importance of having cyber-risk squarely on the agenda of the Board. “It’s about having the right resource on your executive team to be able to lead and measure that risk,” he concludes. “Going forward, our view is that you’re going to see more companies having to have IT experienced professionals sitting at that board table, rather than the CFO having IT as part of his remit.”</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>With high-profile cyber-attacks continuing to make headlines, treasurers cannot afford to ignore the importance of cyber-security. But should this area be viewed as a straightforward necessity, or can it be approached as a business enabler?</em></p>
<p>The risk of cyber-attacks was a major theme in 2017, with a number of high-profile incidents underlining both the breadth of attacks taking place and the scale of possible losses. In February, US$81m was stolen from Bangladesh Bank in an attack which had attempted to steal almost US$1bn. In December, Yahoo revealed that a data breach from August 2013 had affected a billion users.</p>
<p>Even when the figures are less staggering, the impact of a cyber-attack can still be considerable. According to Cisco’s 2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report, 29% of security professionals said that their organisations experienced a loss of revenue as a result of cyber-attacks, with 38% saying their revenue loss was 20% or higher. Twenty two percent of organisations said they had lost customers as a result of cyber-attacks, while 23% said they had experienced a loss of business opportunity.</p>
<p>From data breaches to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, businesses may be at risk from many different types of cyber threat. Linda Coven, Senior Analyst at Aite Group, points out that the threat of a cyber-attack has grown beyond the account takeover to the potential for stolen company secrets and intellectual property. She notes that these attacks can take the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social engineering fraud using network breaches and stolen credential information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nation states – sponsored attacks, which may be politically, economically or militarily motivated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continued DDoS attacks of significant volume and frequency against financial institutions, often to cover fraudulent activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extortion (ransomware) – demands for money or other ‘payments’ from a business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Espionage against governments and business intellectual property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business Email Compromise – accessing executives’ accounts to gain credentials or spoof email to elicit a funds transfer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that these threats are becoming more severe as cyber-criminals refine their techniques. “Are the bad guys getting more sophisticated? Absolutely,” says Mike Lamberg, Chief Information Security Officer at OpenLink, and the former VP of Information Security at the NYSE. “Social engineering, or the practice of getting someone to trust you and do things you want them to do, continues to increase and be the prevalent method of infiltrating an organisation and doing harm.” Lamberg points out that this could take the form of a legitimate looking email, enticing website ad – “or a simple phone call leading to a loss of confidential information, or causing an inappropriate funds transfer, for example.”</p>
<h3 id=""targeting-treasury"">Targeting treasury</h3>
<p>Where corporate treasury is concerned, the most significant concern is the risk that a fraudulent payment will be made. This is a very real risk for companies around the world. The 2016 AFP Fraud Report found that 73% of American companies were targeted by payments fraud in 2015 – up from 62% in 2014. While cheques were found to be the payment method most often targeted by fraudsters, the research also found that 64% of businesses were exposed to BEC scams, while 48% were exposed to wire fraud.</p>
<p>Increasingly, sophisticated spear-phishing attacks are being aimed specifically at finance and treasury staff. “Recent sophisticated attacks on systems and services that offered weak overall security have directly targeted the treasury and payments systems that sit at the heart of a modern corporate treasury,” says Andrew Bateman, Head of Corporate Liquidity and Bank Treasury at FIS.</p>
<p>The strategies used by criminals continue to evolve. Bateman notes that “social engineering attacks through phishing and/or spear-phishing attacks as a vector for installing malware, or other advanced persistent threat (APT) components, remains a significantly high component of the threat.” The nature of the APT components is changing in sophistication year on year, as is the professionalism of the most sophisticated phishing attacks. Bateman adds, “We are seeing more targeted attacks on financial systems and finance employees.”</p>
<p>But despite these threats, treasurers may not be doing everything possible to protect their businesses. Bateman says that treasurers are “probably not yet as concerned as they need to be”. He adds, “While we are seeing a clearly strong and growing awareness amongst treasurers of the risks that cyber-attacks place on their businesses, the active engagement that is required to address it is lagging a little.”</p>
<p>According to Bateman, this lag may be attributed in part to the “legacy view” that treasury remains somewhat isolated from the outside world – although the targeting of treasury staff demonstrates that the reality is changed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body"">
<h3 id=""liability-for-fraud"">Liability for fraud</h3>
<p>If the worst happens and a company falls victim to a significant cyber-attack, is there anything companies can do to get their money back? David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC, says that while companies are focusing their attention on how to protect themselves from an attack, they are also keen to understand whether their banks, technology providers or SWIFT bureaus may take some liability for the loss.</p>
<p>“In the past, it’s always been assumed amongst the corporate community that once you sent a payment message via the bank, if something went wrong, they would pay you back for the loss,” explains Stebbings. “Obviously the challenge was proving that it was not your fault and that you had sent them valid instructions, but based on the relationship repayment was often assumed.” More recently, however, Stebbings notes that banks may be tightening up their approach such that this assumption may no longer be as true as previously.</p>
<p>Technology providers, meanwhile, may simply be unable to repay a large sum, whatever the circumstances. “The challenge for them is to show that they are the best in terms of minimising this risk, given their focus on cyber security measures and persuading treasurers and their IT people that this is the case,” Stebbings explains.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately for a treasurer or finance person, although the chance of something happening is remote, the scale of the loss if something does happen is probably career damaging. So choosing the right payment providers is very important and obviously the providers which can show they have the best security have a competitive advantage.”</p>
<p>In some cases, companies may wish to check for themselves that their third-party providers have sufficient security controls in place. “One of my clients wanted to go to their SWIFT bureau every year,” Stebbings explains. “The SWIFT bureau gave them a certificate of its controls which had been provided by audit firms, but the client wanted to go down to the bunker themselves and test the security controls independently.” Stebbings argues that supporting this level of scrutiny should be seen as a positive thing by third party vendors – “if you want to sell this stuff, and you want to be top of the market, it could be one of your selling points.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Meanwhile, businesses may be reacting more robustly in some regions than in others. In Asia, for example, the risk of cyber-attacks is particularly strong. Research published last year by US internet security company Mandiant said that the median time between a breach occurring and being discovered is 520 days in APAC, compared to 146 days globally. The reported noted that “APAC organisations are frequently unprepared to identify and respond to breaches”, pointing out that most breaches in APAC never become public due to a lack of effective breach disclosure laws.</p>
<p>But despite the scale of these risks, not all companies are focusing on cyber-attacks as a high priority for corporate treasury. David Blair, an independent treasury consultant based in Singapore, notes that where treasurers in Asia are concerned, “Asia is probably behind on this, despite at least equal risks compared to western businesses.”</p>
<h3 id=""making-cyber-security-a-business-enabler"">Making cyber-security a business enabler</h3>
<p>With so many threats to consider, is cyber-security a straightforward necessity, or can it be viewed as a business enabler? For third-party vendors, such as treasury management system vendors, SWIFT bureaus or third-party payment providers, it is clear that cyber-security falls into the latter category. “If you are a third-party provider, you can turn this to your advantage by spelling out your investment in security and how often you test your controls and have them validated independently,” Stebbings explains. “So they can certainly turn it to a competitive advantage.”</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers, the situation is less clear-cut. In Asia, for example, Blair says that this topic is “more of a survival requirement”, adding that it is “hard to see security intrinsically bringing better products and services to customers”. On the other hand, he notes that a lack of security can hurt customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>OpenLink’s Lamberg comments that cyber-security is definitely a necessity, and that making it a business enabler “would require a company’s senior leadership and board to view cyber-security as a strategic asset that is partnered with the business itself”. Until that happens, Lamberg says, “it will be viewed as a quasi-tax or insurance”.</p>
<p>However, this is also an area which is evolving rapidly, and companies are adjusting the way in which they approach cyber-security as the threats develop. Bateman argues that cyber security should – and can – be a business enabler as well as a necessity.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>“Treasurers, and their organisations right through to Board oversight level, will expect security and risk management to be built into the solutions and services their organisations consume – and will expect their cloud vendors, their partners, and their service providers to focus on cyber security as a key element of an overall offering,” he explains. “Treasurers will give greater value to those offerings that have superior cyber risk protection in the same way we value any quality metric, and partners or vendors that excel in this area will be advantaged in their client relationships.”</p>
<p>How can cyber-security deliver business improvements? Aside from avoiding financial loss, the most obvious improvements lie in increasing efficiency and managing risks more effectively. Marcus Hughes, Head of Strategic Business Development at Bottomline Technologies, points out that implementing increased controls “not only helps a treasurer to remain compliant and fight financial crime, but it also makes a business more efficient by reducing errors and cutting the risk of losing money.”</p>
<p>Coven agrees that cyber-security can be seen as a business enabler, pointing out that the costs of an attack can be devastating. These may include direct damages, such as missing funds, trade secrets, damaged hardware and software and business disruption. “There are also response costs such as notifications to employees or customers and in some cases having to provide services such as credit monitoring to those affected,” she explains. “And of course there is reputational damage which can lead to loss of customers, goodwill of suppliers and diminished valuation for investors.”</p>
<p>As such, Coven says that companies need to take cyber-security seriously. This involves making it part of the company’s culture to manage risk at all levels, and making this area “the responsibility of everyone”.</p>
<h3 id=""best-practice"">Best practice</h3>
<p>With so many threats to consider, what actions should treasurers be taking to protect their businesses from cyber-crime? The following actions may help treasurers avoid falling victim to a cyber-attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure your devices.</strong> All devices on the network should be secure, with up-to-date virus protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice good password hygiene.</strong> Strong passwords should be used and users should be required to change their passwords regularly. Different passwords should be used for different systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the latest versions.</strong> “Ensuring systems are on the latest versions, and the systems and vendors have robust and audited security and risk management processes in place, should now be a key element of any treasury or financial professional’s role,” advises Bateman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Segregation of duties.</strong> Where possible, different staff should be tasked with initiating payments, approving payments and reconciling the accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforce network separation.</strong> Lamberg says that treasury and financial systems should be physically and logically separated from the general corporate network. “You need to minimise the chances that a rogue network user could gain access to your key financial systems,” he adds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inform and educate.</strong> All too often, employees themselves are the weak spot when it comes to preventing fraud. “With proper training on how to recognise a cyber-security event, phishing email or a suspicious link on a web page will go a long way to reducing the security risk in an organisation,” says Lamberg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For incoming emails, ‘trust but verify’.</strong> “A basic step for any employee to make before clicking a link in an email is to press the “reply” button and examine the email domain for discrepancies, since fraudsters can buy nearly identical domains,” explains Coven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use screening solutions.</strong> By screening payment files against sanctions lists, Hughes says that treasurers can avoid the reputational risk of being identified by their banks as trying to make payments to black-listed organisations or individuals. “It also builds a good relationship with banking partners by reducing their payment investigations work,” he adds. Hughes points out that screening solutions can also be used to identify inappropriate payments diverted to fraudster employees, or to accounts which do not appear on the controlled list of suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use anomaly detection systems.</strong> Such systems can be used to identify anomalies and alert management to payment files which do not fit within normal patterns, such as payments above preconfigured limits. “This not only prevents fraud but also identifies operational errors, such as failure to submit a payment file by a certain deadline,” explains Hughes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Track employees’ use of mission critical applications.</strong> Tracking how employees use certain applications can reveal anomalies and suspicious behaviour. Hughes notes, “this non-intrusive way of monitoring user activity enables management to capture and replay such behaviour, rather like a CCTV, not only recording any information, such as amount or account number, which has been tampered with, but also tracking all screens which have been viewed by employees.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Carry out simulations.</strong> Blair advises that treasurers should “accept you will be hacked and be prepared to deal with it”, adding that this should include carrying out regular simulations like fire drills, designing systems and processes on the assumption that hacking will occur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""direction-of-travel"">Direction of travel</h3>
<p>By necessity, cyber-security is an area which continues to develop rapidly. As Lamberg points out, “the bad guys are getting smarter with new technology and techniques, forcing all of us to get smarter and implement newer technology to anticipate and defend against them.”</p>
<p>In terms of future developments, Blair says he hopes that software will increasingly be built for security, much as it is now tested for bugs. “I expect more human-friendly security arrangements to progress beyond the current multiplicity of impossible to memorise passwords (face, blood vessels, etc),” he says, adding that the advent of voice, as heralded by developments such as echo and siri, will open a “whole new can of worms”. Blair also comments that people will increasingly have to accept that some convenience will need to be sacrificed in order to maintain security, with companies increasingly locking down work computers and restricting BYO devices.</p>
<p>Bateman, meanwhile, says that “there needs to be greater partnership between governments, NGOs and corporate entities in information sharing and threat prevention.” He adds that this should involve moving to a real-time threat information sharing model, allowing all partners to move quickly and efficiently and to benefit from each other’s experiences.</p>
<p>In conclusion, cyber-security is a topic that no treasurer can afford to ignore. Whether this area is regarded as a necessary evil or a business enabler may vary from company to company – but what is clear is that this topic will only become more crucial as the threats continue to evolve.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Corporates operating in today’s uncertain markets know they cannot afford to be encumbered by dated, ineffectual risk technologies. Those treasurers looking for new tools to help them manage risk are often confronted with a confusing array of options. But as industry experts interviewed in this article maintain, when it comes to navigating the treasury technology landscape, it helps if you have a clear idea of your risk management needs beforehand.</em></p>
<p>Plunging commodity prices, relentless currency volatility and several abrupt policy changes by major central banks besides; after a year of such surprises, it is perhaps little wonder that so many treasurers have been increasing their focus on risk management technologies.</p>
<p>In Deloitte’s 2015 Global Corporate Treasury Survey, 50% of treasurers noted that their biggest challenge is to manage foreign exchange volatility, with 40% citing insufficient technology infrastructure as one of the key problems hampering them in this regard.</p>
<p>To manage risk, treasurers need reliable, complete and consistent data, available on a timely basis and, technology, they know, remains the key to delivering this. But finding the right solution is not easy: and not because of a lack of choice. Technology giants or nimble local specialists; installed software or cloud hosting – today’s technology landscape offers treasurers more options than ever before. With a little bit of foresight though, evaluating the various vendors and finding the right tools for the job need not be a costly and time-consuming ordeal.</p>
<h3 id=""time-for-an-upgrade"">Time for an upgrade</h3>
<p>A number of factors might lead treasurers to the market to look for new solutions. Top of the list today, perhaps, are new market realities. The recent commodity price slump is but one example. Such was the speed of that decline in prices over the course of 2014, especially in the energy commodity markets where oil market benchmarks halved in less than six months, it triggered some corporates to review risk management arrangements at an organisational level.</p>
<p>A treasurer of a company that is producing finished goods derived from material inputs (like oil or oil derivatives), obviously has an exposure which may or may not – depending on a number of factors – require hedging. In most organisations that decision would, traditionally, have been made by procurement without treasuries involvement. But according to the representatives of two leading risk management solutions providers, a growing number of companies are now beginning to reconsider this arrangement.</p>
<p>“Procurement would be managing the physical contract buying along with the logistics of getting commodities from A to B, but when it came to risk management and hedging, this becomes a bit more challenging without a robust system designed to handle that,” Mark O’Toole, Vice President Commodities &amp; Treasury Solutions at OpenLink explains. “This was being done on spreadsheets, for the most part, and it didn’t have full transparency and a global view into the position and the real risk around it. But what we’ve seen over the past year and a half, is CFOs now looking to break down the barriers between procurement and treasury. As zero based budgeting becomes more prominent, this is a chance for companies to system rationalise on a single platform while getting this visibility.”</p>
<p>O’Toole is not the only person in the treasury technology business identifying this as a growing trend. “Commodities was typically managed in procurement outside of treasury, but now a lot of global organisations have started incorporating commodity risk into treasury organisations,” says Sanjay Thoppil, Solution Consultant at Reval. “What that means for treasurers is that they have got to come up to speed very quickly.”</p>
<p>Regulatory changes may have also given a few treasurers cause to reassess their treasury technology needs in recent years. Take, for instance, post-crisis changes to the OTC derivatives business such as Dodd-Frank and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Although it is two years on now since trade reporting under the latter begun, the new demands placed on treasurers by the regulation still appears to be a compelling reason for many treasurers to look at new solutions.</p>
<p>“EMIR and Dodd-Frank have been around for a couple of years, but reporting has really come into focus for a lot of corporates these past few months,” says Thoppil. “We are starting to see a lot more requests around for EMIR requirements, more clients asking us to provide output for reporting.”</p>
<p>Other compliance issues, notably the imminent Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II, have also been a boon for multi-dealer platforms as responsibility for execution is increasingly pushed away from the bank to the corporate customer who are then looking for electronic platforms with TCA tools that can help them manage risk. “That’s one of the biggest changes in the industry we are seeing,” concurs Neill Penney, Head of Foreign Exchange Workflow at Thomson Reuters, the business information and technology specialists that provide a suite of solutions for corporate treasurers. “Regulators are saying to the customer that it is their responsibility to make sure they get the right price and to ensure they are executing at the right time of day.”</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the evolution of treasury technology itself to consider. The typical ERP/TMS or FX portal has a very long cycle; implementing a new solution every year, even if affordable, would be neither practical nor feasible in many organisations. Even accounting for upgrades then, it is likely that solutions introduced ten or perhaps even five years ago are going to look very antiquated alongside some of the more recent advents in the treasury technology space.</p>
<p>“Five years ago the industry was beginning to get there with comprehensive treasury solutions and now I think the problems are well-understood with good solutions out there,” says Penney. “Now treasurers are walking into a very mature market that understands corporate treasury and can meet their evolving needs.” Penney cites the recent introduction of innovations such as algorithmic trading and order slicing into the corporate FX market as examples of how vendors are developing their offerings to meet their clients differing execution strategies. “Large order slicing is something stemming from the customer saying they that are going to take more responsibility for how the order is broken up and how quickly or slowly they push it into the market. If you are on the market for a new FX solution now and you want to future proof it then that is the sort of question you should be asking yourself: what happens if my policy needs algos or order slicing?”</p>
<h3 id=""before-you-buy"">Before you buy</h3>
<p>What other tips do treasury solutions vendors have to share with potential customers as they navigate the technology landscape? There is a long list of things the corporate customer should keep in mind, they say, when purchasing new technology – ranging from functionalities included and the degree of centralisation on offer, to know knowing what ones priorities are, in particular, where the biggest risks are in the business that need to be managed.</p>
<p>First of all, treasurers need risk management technologies that are comprehensive with respect to the scope of functionalities on offer. Wolfgang Koester, CEO at FX exposure management solutions provider FiREapps says: “The biggest mistake I see at the moment is people looking for programmes and not platforms. A programme is something that allows you to do one particular thing but nothing else – and nothing else in today’s environment can end up being very costly, because one needs to have an environment where at a moment’s notice one can look at risk from a different perspective and/or a different type of risk not previously pre-defined.”</p>
<p>One should be careful, Koester adds, not to lose sight of the original objective – managing risk – because of the cost-savings a particular solution offers. “Unfortunately, this is something some people still do,” he says. “But when considering technology, the first thing the treasurer should be thinking about is where the biggest risks reside – not what a solution can do to make their lives easier.”</p>
<p>This sentiment is echoed by Thomson Reuters’ Penney, who explains that, as with any purchasing decision, it helps if the customer is clear on their priorities from the offset. “I would encourage treasurers to think end-to-end, and look at their company’s risk management needs holistically. Start with the whole picture and then write a list of the things you want to fix with respect to your current workflow,” he says.</p>
<p>The danger in heading to the market without one’s priorities clearly articulated is this could mean ending wasting a lot of time and money on solutions that fail to address the fundamental problem. “It is a band-aid approach, versus trying to fix the problem holistically,” Reval’s Thoppil asserts. “Do you want to just patch something up, or do you want to really revisit your risk management practices?”</p>
<p>Depending on how the company is organised, a truly comprehensive solution might mean considering solutions that help the treasurer manage risks across the business. “A big trend we are seeing at the moment is the breakdown of commodities and FX into treasury and the introduction of systems that allow corporates proactively manage that,” says O’Toole. It is all about centralisation: both technologically and departmentally. “Certain things – cash management, or in-country banking – might remain regional for some firms, but it should all roll into one centralised view, of cash, of commodities and of financial hedges.”</p>
<p>Finally, it is no good finding a solution that ticks all the boxes if the money to purchase it is not forthcoming. “You need CEO, CFO buy-in,” says Reval’s Thoppil. “Without it, treasurers are often just fishing and hoping they can get budget for a product on which management may not mandate.” But given the way treasury is traditionally perceived as a cost-centre, securing those necessary approvals is often easier said than done. To help, Reval – like most leading vendors – offer an array of documentation and analytical examples explaining clearly what the particular solution in question does and how it will benefit the company. These can be used to help treasurers frame the conversation when they begin to explain to senior executives why it is the company needs a new solution.</p>
<h3 id=""listen-to-your-peers"">Listen to your peers</h3>
<p>Having taken the decision to purchase a new treasury solution, established what ones priorities as a customer and secured the necessary buy-in at the C-level, how should the treasurer go about navigating the multitude of different vendors and solutions?</p>
<p>The consensus amongst industry experts is that the best way for treasurers to evaluate the claims of the various technology vendors is to listen to the experiences of their industry peers. There are a variety of ways for them to do this: read objective research in industry magazines like Treasury Today Asia, source vendor case studies and attend user-conferences and other industry events, to name but a few.</p>
<p>“I would advise treasurers to try and socialise their purchasing decisions,” says Thoppil. This process is not too dissimilar, he points out, to what many of us already do as consumers. “Any time I make a purchase of a large item I am usually talking to friends and family,” he adds, “and I know that some people use social media in similar way.”</p>
<p>FiREapps’ Koester concurs on this point, but adds that when it comes to the client references supplied by vendors treasurers should be cautious not to give too much credence to case studies that are not relevant to what their own treasury environment is and what treasury is attempting to achieve. What fits one firm’s unique requirements may not, after all, be appropriate for another company in a different sector or with different legacy technologies. “References need to be applicable to them,” he adds. “If a treasurer wants to address a certain issue with a solution and they have a SAP supplied ERP system, a reference from a corporate who uses Oracle is going to be next to useless to them.”</p>
<p>This is a crucial point. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions when it comes to risk management. Treasurers who fail to keep this in mind when shopping for risk management technology may well find themselves lumbered with an unsuitable, piecemeal solution – and that is a risk no corporate treasurer should be willing to accept.</p>

<h3 id=""easing-the-process"">Easing the process</h3>
<p>When issuing an RFP, there are a number of factors that sometimes get overlooked, but which can help make the process easier both for the issuer and the service providers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is important to create a realistic time-frame for responses and for the selection process. One or two weeks are simply not enough time for providers to gather information and make a submission. Allowing respondents a month or six weeks to prepare it enables them to tailor their proposal to the unique aspects of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, any changes made to the RFP for one service provider − for example an extension or question changes − should be made for all respondents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When drafting an RFP it is a good idea to separate it into logical sections. This will help respondents to organise their responses as well as helping the issuer to avoid irrelevant and duplicate questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be consistent throughout the document in wording and in expectations. Try to keep formatting constant as well. This will make it easier for providers to respond and result in better quality responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many companies get frustrated when they receive a 300-page response from service providers. It can be helpful to put a limit on the length of responses − either on the entire RFP or by section. In addition, using short, precise questions can help respondents to be more succinct in their responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is better not to bid for too many services at once, as the decision-making process can grow to be excessively complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to work closely with other functional areas affected by the service or solution − such as accounting, IT and purchasing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visiting final candidates provides the opportunity to meet the technical staff, sort out any existing concerns, and complete due diligence.</p>
</li>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Cybercrime has existed in numerous guises since the emergence of technology in the workplace and it is an ever evolving space. As a result of this evolution the threats to businesses are multiplying and becoming increasingly complex, seeing cyber-security creep to the top of business leaders’ minds. In this article, Treasury Today explores the changing threats and what treasurers can do to help fend off cyber-criminals.</em></p>
<p>It is widely accepted that cybercrime poses a huge risk to businesses, and if you are not concerned about cyber-security, then you should be. The numbers speak for themselves: cyber-attacks cost companies around the world $7.7m a year on average in losses, according to the 2015 Ponemon Institute of Cyber Crime Study of 252 companies. These attacks did not discriminate against company size, industry or location.</p>
<p>Many businesses, perhaps in light of some recent high profile cyber incidents, have woken up to the risk. As a survey conducted by PwC, titled The Global State of Information Security 2016, highlights that 91% now have risk-based security frameworks in place and 24% have boosted their security budgets. Despite this work, breaches still occur and at great cost. The reason for this being that a business can only be as strong, in cyber terms, as its weakest link, and in a multinational with thousands of staff there are many potential weaknesses.</p>
<p>When put in these terms, it may seem that protecting the company’s financial data and assets from cyber-criminals is an impossible job. However, with the right education, culture, technology and processes in place, a company can go a long way to achieving this. And a prudent place to start is to understand the threats and from where they originate.</p>
<h3 id=""shadow-corporations"">Shadow corporations</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the threats corporates face are multifaceted, and their origin is frequently shifting. Once cyber-attacks were largely perpetrated by nation states, or by tech-savvy individuals and hacktivists, today cybercrime is big business. In fact, it is often not understood just how profitable an industry it is.</p>
<p>Information security company Trustwave have looked to lift the lid on the industry, conducting a study into the potential returns a cyber-criminal can expect to make and the numbers are staggering: Trustwave estimate that cyber-criminals receive on average a return on investment of 1,425%. With returns such as these it is unsurprising that cybercrime is becoming increasingly commercialised. As George Quigley, Cyber Security Partner at KPMG explains: “We like the phrase shadow corporations to describe these organisations, because although they are not ethical or legal, they operate much in the same way as any other company, with a management structure and various departments that look after different areas of the operation.” Some shadow corporations may have copywriting departments, for instance, that look to craft professional looking phishing emails – rather than those littered with spelling mistakes and dubious URLs of yesteryears. Some have even gone so far as to offer healthcare and pension plans to its employees, it has been reported.</p>
<p>To further maximise revenue, shadow corporations are now offering ‘crime-as-a-service’ (CaaS), building sophisticated solutions that can be sold to other criminals looking to get a slice of the action. The most advanced of these have an enterprise feel to them with cloud based access and 24x7 support.</p>
<h3 id=""sophisticated-attacks"">Sophisticated attacks</h3>
<p>Just as the threat actors are changing and growing in sophistication, so are the methods. A recently published Threat Report by McAfee Labs outlines this, stating that: “We have seen a change during the past two years, with a significant increase in the number of technically sophisticated attacks. Many of these have been designed purely to evade advanced defences. They are infiltrating in pieces, hiding in seemingly inert code, and waiting for an unprotected moment to emerge.”</p>
<p>And once inside a company’s system, there are then a number of ways that cyber-criminals can look to generate revenue. “Some hackers will simply extract sensitive information and send a small portion of this back to the company, demanding money in return for safe passage of the rest of the information,” says Quigley. Other methods can be more debilitating. “We are seeing the re-emergence of ransomware that can lock users out of the system,” he adds. “For treasury, this may cause a problem in terms of being able to access information and authorise transactions.” Another similar method Quigley sees returning is the distributed denial service attack, where a threat actor floods the network with traffic, bringing it down. In both of these examples, the criminals will demand a ransom fee to stop the attack.</p>
<p>There is little the company can do in instances such as this. In fact, the FBI have stated that in the case of such an event it may be prudent to simply give into the criminal’s demands – which the FBI say the overwhelming majority of institutions do. Interestingly, according to reports, there seems to be some honour amongst thieves. Joseph Bonavolonta, Assistant Special Agent at the FBI’s CYBER and Counterintelligence Programme in Boston, told Business Insider that ironically the fact people are paying the ransom is keeping the criminals’ demands low, and that in the vast majority of cases access is returned upon receipt of payment.</p>
<h3 id=""and-unsophisticated-attacks"">…And unsophisticated attacks</h3>
<p>Cyber-criminals are also becoming smarter in how they prey on human frailty to breach a company’s defences. “There is a plethora of information about a company and its people, freely available online, affording cyber-criminals the opportunity to digitally track employees (think social networks) and then launch an attack at an opportunistic time,” says Quigley.</p>
<p>A prime example of this is when a member of staff is on holiday, but still keeping half an eye on work, explains Quigley. “Often attacks are planned over a period of 12 to 18 months and in cases such as these a cybercriminal can follow an employee’s social media account and find out when they are on holiday,” he says. “Once this opportune moment arises the fraudsters can send a phishing email, impersonating somebody from the business they have also been following, asking to approve something – a transaction, for example. The hope being they will do so without suspecting any wrongdoing.”</p>
<p>‘Friday afternoon fraud’ is another arguably less sophisticated attack. Here, cyber-criminals look to take advantage of the rush to complete work before the weekend. Again, the hope is that not enough attention is being paid to what is happening and a transaction of some sort is approved. This was something that occurred to an employee at Fortelus Capital Management LLP, who received a call late on a Friday from somebody claiming to be from Coutts, the investment bank, claiming that there was fraudulent activity on Fortelus’ account. To rectify this, the employee used the bank’s smart card security system to produce codes for the caller to cancel the suspicious payments. When he returned to work on Monday, $1.2m had been stolen.</p>
<h3 id=""building-up-the-barriers"">Building up the barriers</h3>
<p>So how can corporates protect against the plethora of cyber risks? Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet; best-in-class cyber-security comes from a mixture of technology, process and people. That being said, technology can go a long way in protecting the business, and a corporate’s IT team must ensure that they have a robust firewall system in place and various other technical defence mechanisms.</p>
<p>But digital barriers can only be built so high, and it cannot be assumed that these are impenetrable. As Simon Viney, Director, Security Science at Stroz Friedberg states: “You can invest millions in your cyber-security, but there only needs to be one error, or one misconfiguration, for the criminals to take advantage.”</p>
<p>As a result, Viney is seeing corporates dedicating greater resources to penetration testing, where outside experts are hired to attack the network and highlight areas the security falls short. There is also a greater investment in threat intelligence tools that are able to spot patterns in data, and highlight any nuances that may be potential threats – data flowing to an unfamiliar IP address in a location the business doesn’t operate in, for instance – providing the opportunity to spot these early and take the necessary action.</p>
<p>Outside parties are also able to provide some layer of protection. Banks, for example, have invested heavily in their fraud detection software and are able to spot irregular payments, based on size, destination, time and a whole host of other parameters. In cases such as these, the bank is able to contact the treasury team and ask if this is a legitimate payment before pushing it through, potentially preventing a significant financial loss.</p>
<h3 id=""security-in-the-cloud"">Security in the cloud</h3>
<p>Technology works both ways, however. Whilst corporates are investing in their cyber-security, they are also investing in innovative technology, such as the cloud – creating further attack surfaces and areas of concern for corporates. But cloud also offers its advantages, as Philip Pettinato, Chief Technology Officer at Reval, explains: “One of the main benefits I see in cloud technology is that corporates get the benefit of knowing that the other companies they are sharing the platform with have gone through their own extensive audit and penetration testing to ensure that it is secure,” he says. “Thus creating a more secure environment for everyone involved.”</p>
<p>Holding financial data in the cloud can also outsource the burden of cyber-security and, in some cases, offer greater protection compared to leaving it on the company’s own servers. “Most corporates today have security measures in place and they are doing a lot of the right things,” says Pettinato. “Cyber-threats are changing quickly, but the tools we are using to maintain an advantage are up to date and constantly evolving in response to these changes.”</p>
<h3 id=""step-by-step"">Step by step</h3>
<p>Whilst technology can certainly help protect the business, it is not infallible, particularly when a mistake is unwittingly made by a human. It is therefore vital to ensure that the company has robust processes in place to mitigate the risk of cybercrime and that this is backed up by the education of all employees about the risks. The aim: to create a cyber conscious culture.</p>
<p>In regards to processes, the changes do not have to be dramatic. Take, for example, a member of the treasury department receiving an email from the CFO asking for the account number to be changed on a regular payment. In this instance, it would be wise to question this request and make a phone call to the CFO asking if this is legitimate.</p>
<p>“The treasury team needs to be empowered to question these items,” says Cindy Murray, Head of Platform Transformation, Digital Channels and Client Experience for Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). “And this should feed into a broader, more robust, segregation of duties in the treasury department. When we see fraud, it is often because the company is enabling a single person to approve and initiate a payment. No matter what security layers are in place, if a cyber-criminal hacked into their desktop and made payments, there would be little way of identifying this payment before it is too late.”</p>
<p>Murray and her team therefore promote a strong segregation of duties to all their clients. However, sometimes a treasury team may be too small to do this effectively. “There is technology that can support corporates with this challenge,” adds Murray. “For instance, we offer two-factor authentication when making payments and also a solution that requires the CFO or senior treasurer to digitally sign the payments before they are approved and initiated by the treasury team.”</p>
<p>The issue however, as mentioned earlier, is that a company is only as strong as its weakest link. And even though a treasury team may follow all the correct processes and have technology in place to mitigate the risk of cybercrime, if somebody in another department mistakenly provides a cyber-criminal with access to the company’s servers, they may be able to make their way into the treasury department’s systems undetected. In fact, such an incident occurred in recent months at an Austrian manufacturing company where $54m was transferred out of the company’s bank accounts with attackers able to access authorisation credentials for conducting a wire transfer using the corporate treasury systems.</p>
<p>“Education is vitally important and everybody in the company needs to understand the risks, helping to create a cyber-conscious culture,” says Stroz Friedberg’s Viney. “Board engagement is critical in this respect and the culture has to be driven from the top down. If anyone opts out, then the risk grows.”</p>
<h3 id=""dealing-with-a-breach"">Dealing with a breach</h3>
<p>Regrettably, even the companies that do this best may still be prone to cyber-attacks. As a result, experts advise that a company never rest on its laurels, and be prepared for an attack to be successful. And if the worst does happen, then time is of the essence. “Corporates should immediately contact the bank,” says BofAML’s Murray. “We can very quickly trace the payment and attempt to reverse it. But cybercriminals know this, and will try to move the money on as quickly as possible. Therefore, the longer it takes for the bank to be notified the less opportunity we have to recover the payments.”</p>
<p>The corporate treasury department can play a big part in ensuring that an illegitimate transaction is spotted quickly by regularly reconciling its accounts. “Many years ago corporates reconciled monthly. If this was still the case, there would be little chance of recovering an illegitimate payment. Today, corporates are adopting best practice and reconciling daily, and many even intra-day. This is enabling any issues to be identified in good time and further escalated should need be.” In addition, Murray also highlights that banks now offer numerous reports, advice, and acknowledgements that corporates can utilise in order check their payments and ensure that fraud is not occurring.</p>
<h3 id=""a-team-game"">A team game</h3>
<p>Using this information may become of even greater importance due to the increasing digital connectivity between businesses in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. For instance, a large corporate is likely to be digitally connected to a vast number of counterparties on both the buy and sell side, up and downstream, and each one poses a potential cyber risk. “We have rushed into an interconnected world, and it is nearly impossible for an organisation to be responsible for, or even understand the security, that is being operated by its counterparties,” says KPMG’s Quigley.</p>
<p>The awareness of the cyber-risk posed by third parties undoubtedly increased following the Target incident – where the company’s network credentials were stolen from a third-party vendor. And this is beginning to have an impact on how companies do business, with some looking to shorten their supply chains. “Companies are also analysing the risk profile of the supply chain from a cyber perspective and assessing how they interact with each other and if these channels are secure,” adds Quigley.</p>
<p>The complexity of businesses in the 21<sup>st</sup> century means that this is no mean feat, particularly when so many organisations are reluctant to share their information. “Companies need to understand the importance of sharing data,” says Stroz Friedberg’s Viney. “Cyber-criminals are sharing their information to gain an advantage. So should corporates.” The message is clear: cyber-security is no longer a siloed activity, it is a team game and one that corporates may lose if they don’t work together.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Defined by the UK Serious Fraud Office as intentional deception to obtain an advantage, avoid an obligation or cause loss to another person or company, fraud is an ongoing issue for the business community. Treasury Today considers the threat from the treasurer’s perspective and asks what role the profession has in defending corporate cash and reputation.</em></p>
<p>In a globalised and competitive world where complexity of systems and processes meet a workforce subjected to increasing personal financial pressures, and where blasé attitudes to security assist unchecked greed, the conditions are right for fraudsters to try their luck. Fraud is of course nothing new, but despite awareness of its prevalence, and the adoption of sophisticated anti-fraud technologies by some business, it remains a major commercial issue.</p>
<p>Despite this, the ACT/Kyriba annual report shows that fraud prevention remains surprisingly low on the priority list with only 11% viewing it as one of their three top concerns for 2015. Martin Taylor, Vice President of Northern European Sales at Kyriba says it is certainly “a concern” that fraud does not feature highly on most treasurers’ radars, particularly given the number of high-profile cases that have come to light on both sides of the Atlantic in the past couple of years. “At the moment, there does not seem to be too much ownership of the problem.” It is, he believes, not solely an ‘IT problem’ or a ‘risk problem’; it is a matter in which all must be involved.</p>
<p>After all, the reputation of a business that is in some way embroiled in major fraudulent activity is starting to have an interesting and potentially serious side effect, notably in the Asia Pacific region. Ethical business practices are directly related to attracting and retaining talent in the region, with almost 80% of respondents polled in Ernst &amp; Young’s (EY) recent APAC Fraud Survey 2015 saying they would be unwilling to work for companies involved in bribery and corruption. As EY concludes, “fraud prevention is no longer just a legal and compliance issue but impacts recruitment, talent retention and business continuity.”</p>
<h3 id=""red-flag-act"">Red flag act</h3>
<p>So how do you spot a potential fraud, or stop fraud before it even starts? Well, most perpetrators of corporate fraud do not aim for the big numbers straight away simply because the chances of being caught syphoning millions in one hit are very high. The intelligent fraudster makes multiple micro-transactions, often sent on a circuitous route, ensuring far greater difficulty in tracing their movement. The UK Serious Fraud Office notes a number of indicators or ‘red flags’ that may suggest an individual is engaged in fraud. Its watch-list is not exhaustive but combinations of the following may indicate trouble:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Significant changes in behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual is known to have large personal debts or financial losses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transactions taking place at odd times, odd frequencies, or involving unusual amounts or to odd recipients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discrepancies in accounting records and unexplained items on reconciliations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing documents or only photocopied documents available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One employee has control of a process from start to finish with no segregation of duties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It almost goes without saying that any approach must be handled with extreme sensitivity.</p>
<h3 id=""human-weakness"">Human weakness</h3>
<p>Within any organisation humans are most likely the weakest link, says Kyriba’s Taylor. “If an employee is given unilateral control over financial movements without safeguards then the possibility for fraud exists.” As part of a pre-employment checklist, he suggests a degree of due diligence, checking relevant credentials for example. Although most recruitment specialists should do this anyway, a discreet background search may prove worthwhile. As employment progresses it becomes a line management and HR duty to keep up with personnel matters; this may reveal at an early stage problems that could, if left, resolve in fraud.</p>
<p>As treasurers are at the helm of the company’s finances, they are often the last in the chain when approving payments or executing trades, Taylor notes. “If the company is still depending on individual banking portals and spreadsheets then the potential to defraud is much higher than for a treasurer with highly secure workflows.”</p>
<p>For Steve Baseby, the UK ACT’s Associate Policy &amp; Technical Director, the fact that treasurers tend to deal with the wholesale end of the money spectrum sets them apart from more obvious areas of potential fraud (simply because of the process, not the people) such as accounting, accounts payable or purchasing. Treasurers do have access to payments systems where they move quite large sums of money, but even here the classic bank internet system for the corporate treasurer has a three-tier transaction process, he explains. When one of these systems is implemented the first thing internal audit will do is certify its integrity so that once in operation, having got to the stage where the business is creating a payment instruction, it is certain that, depending on value, at least ‘four eyes’ approval is given. “And ideally none of these people will have anything to do with the original commercial transaction.”</p>
<h3 id=""it-meets-iq"">IT meets IQ</h3>
<p>In addition to multi-factor authentication, companies can put in place more general safeguards such as Virtual Private Networks and IP Filtering. Many of these tools are commonly and conveniently deployed as part of a TMS or ERP. Furthermore, IT can also integrate treasury system user rights with internal systems using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Authentication, effectively creating a secure single sign on for multiple services. “Even just implementing these controls increases security dramatically, without having to resort to further IT investments,” says Taylor. “As long as people follow the process and don’t make exceptions ‘just because it seems to be the CEO emailing me’, then the defences will remain enforced.”</p>
<p>In any approach to fraud detection and prevention, whilst most environments can be considered for risk-free operation, there will always be a cost associated with the number of people or systems engaged in checking every transaction. “If you increase the oversight you lower the risk, but businesses have to take decisions about how much cost they can justify to lower those risks,” says Baseby. “There is a persistent level of fraud because business in general chooses not to overload the internal controls because they know that costs can get out of hand.” There is, he notes, a “bearable level of control” and within that limit, internal auditors will use various statistical sampling methods to check the level of confidence that there is not fraud within a system, but fraud is still possible.</p>
<p>Why is this acceptable? As an example, a normal commercial relationship that involves a continuous flow of trade will, in the eyes of the auditors, have a standard deviation probability measure of the way the business runs its procedures. This methodology may give 98% certainty that things are happening as they should. Within this boundary Baseby says it is generally accepted that the cost of pushing that last 2%, and thus fully eradicating fraud, would be “ludicrous.” Even if the costs were acceptable, the reality of business would most likely see the company grind to a halt under such a regime anyway; hence there has to be a practical limit of control beyond which it becomes unfeasible. Herein lies the need for clear, well-documented and promoted policy as a means of providing the foundations and guidance for all.</p>
<h3 id=""a-matter-of-policy"">A matter of policy</h3>
<p>Most corporates will have a two-stage policy process, Baseby notes. A summary policy will be agreed at Board level, covering the general principles and strategies (including IT) around matters such as managing payments, dealing processes, counterparty exposures (including bank exposures) and will set risk appetite, boundaries and limits for practical application above which additional checks will be required.</p>
<p>The second stage of policy takes the form of the more detailed procedures manual, which describes actual processes. This should be the constantly evolving part. As this document is amended, so the conversation must continue with internal auditors to keep every process up to date. This, Baseby explains, avoids the common error of thinking that “just because a system worked once it will always work.” Although policy must not be too restrictive and prescriptive, the adoption of procedure must be across the board, with no exceptions because, as Taylor mentions above, as soon as its influence is disregarded the risk of fraud rises significantly.</p>
<p>Policy around fraud should address control measures which will seek to either prevent or detect at various levels. Organisational controls may include assurance that senior management has oversight, that staff background checks have been carried out and that there is segregation of duties where necessary. Physical controls such as workplace security roll into system controls that cover areas such as access and authorisation rights and identification. Controls around process will consider a wide spread of areas such as management of mandates for bank and dealing activity, the control of financial product acceptability, payment approval processes, strong reporting and the insistence on at least an annual independent audit. Accenture’s ‘Treasury operations and controls’ advisory document urges treasurers to make sure policy is relevant, clear, well understood, aligned to the corporate objectives and, most importantly, has full buy-in of all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is the responsibility of all employees to safeguard and be vigilant to the threat of fraud – but are strong policy guidelines enough? The EY Fraud survey referred to above suggests that policies are failing to improve attitudes to fraud. Some 52% of EY’s respondents believe anti-bribery and corruption policies are ‘irrelevant and ineffective’. In addition, 41% said a code of conduct has little impact on how people actually behave. Although 55% of APAC companies have whistleblowing hotlines in place, the number of respondents prepared to use them has dropped since the last survey (81% in 2013 but 53% in 2015). “The drop in whistleblower hotline usage appears to be due to respondents being increasingly concerned about insufficient legal protection or the lack of confidentiality leading to a risk of retaliation,” says Reuben Khoo, EY Partner and ASEAN Leader for Fraud Investigation &amp; Dispute Services. “It is clear that APAC policies, codes of conduct and whistleblowing hotlines are not enough. Companies need to demonstrate and communicate about ethical behaviour if they want to affect true change.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-forensic-approach"">A forensic approach</h3>
<p>When something is amiss and internal audit and investigation cannot find an answer, an external forensic accounting expert may be required. Forensic accounting is all about piecing together information contained in financial records and other documents, to create, or recreate, as accurate a picture as possible of an event or transaction that has happened, explains Richard Abbey, Head of Global Forensic Accounting firm, Stroz Friedberg.</p>
<p>The unwinding of that event or transaction is like “reverse engineering” each step to be able to tell when a payment was made, where it went, how it was described in the system and what it was that triggered it, such as an invoice or payment instruction, and who authorised it, which cost centre did it go to and so on until the truth is revealed. But other than the knowledge that something is not right, Abbey notes that there are few immediate warning signs with which a forensic investigation can commence; it can require a long and patient trawl by skilled practitioners through the relevant data.</p>
<p>However, genuinely beneficial technology is at hand in the form of ‘transaction monitoring’ which can help uncover anomalies. Stroz Friedberg has developed its own analytical engine that uses complex algorithms to unearth irregular transaction patterns. The output, also known as red flags, will be further investigated by the team, tracing them back through the chain, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>Abbey is convinced that it is becoming less effective for businesses to rely fully on internal networks and control mechanisms such as segregation of duties to protect assets. He argues that organisations will need to run regular monitoring and analytics on all their transactions to be sure they have not been compromised. The issue is not now just one of fraud prevention and detection, but also one of regulatory compliance, as rulings around AML, bribery and corruption and fraud hit the statute books.</p>
<p>Curiously, although he comments that many organisations still think fraud is something that only happens to other companies and thus they prefer not to spend time and resources in trying to prevent it, he believes that the current raft of regulations is having more impact in this respect. Abbey comments that businesses have spent a lot of money in the past few years taking advice on internal control frameworks to ensure regulatory compliance. For him, the next challenge is going to be in proving that these controls are working and being adhered to. “The most obvious way to do that is to carry out regular transaction monitoring, and if you’re not doing that then query whether you really have implemented adequate controls.” Whilst he concedes that real-time monitoring of every transaction is maybe too much of a regulatory ask, he feels it is “inevitable” that the regulators will eventually expect some kind of “regular retrospective design to control and capture infringements.”</p>
<h3 id=""detection-and-prevention"">Detection and prevention</h3>
<p>Claiming a first for transaction monitoring in the procure-to-pay environment is David Griffiths, CEO of UK-based FISCAL Technologies, vendor of the APForensics suite. He says his firm’s cloud-based or installed system sits alongside a corporate accounting system, monitoring invoice payments and consuming master data relating to suppliers and employees to build a picture of payments activities of all values as they unfold in real-time. Working in the fraud and compliance context, it uses proprietary algorithms to perform real-time controls monitoring by continuously recalculating and outputting any anomalies or ‘red flags’ for further investigation. These warnings may, for example, be based on the size of the payment, the date of payment, the frequency or a combination of such issues. If a red flag is created it may warrant further investigation by internal audit or an external forensics unit.</p>
<p>Due to the sheer volume of data being processed, internal audit capacity for this kind of investigation is typically restricted to ad hoc investigations. “They may do this once a year; what we do is carry out those tests all the time,” says Griffiths. “This enables management within each business unit to own the output of all procure-to-pay monitoring and to take responsibility for it.” The role of treasury in this context is to provide detailed insight into the mechanics of cash and payments processes within their company which can help other functions to better understand their own processes and any suspicious movements.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-ownership"">Taking ownership</h3>
<p>Ultimately, a company can only control the opportunities it gives to fraudsters; it has no control over the external pressures its staff face nor how they may rationalise an act of fraud. With or without technology, one thing is certain and that is the responsibility for preventing or capturing fraudulent activity must now be collaborative rather than individual and that the entire process must start from a company-wide ethical stance and be led by a set of policies that everyone buys into. Where there is the risk of fraud, the chances are that fraud will eventually occur, unless the organisation has identified the risk first and put effective anti-fraud controls in place.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>One of the biggest challenges treasury departments worldwide are facing today is the efficient and secure management of banks and bank account related information and processes. Visibility and control over the bank accounts globally, the ability to effectively store bank account related information and documentation (including signature mandates), as well as centrally managing the processes on the lifecycle of this information is fundamental for CFOs and treasurers to minimise risks and adopt automated processes.</p>
<p>In order to achieve these goals, many corporates decide on a comprehensive solution for the management of their bank accounts. Effective and structured bank account management can be easily realised by implementing a solution, which is one of the main steps treasury departments take to fulfil governance and compliance regulations. In addition, the adoption of a central bank account repository, for collecting both data and bank documentation, ensures that processes are optimised and performance is measured and monitored.</p>
<p>In my previous role as Head of Global Treasury at SAP, I faced a similar challenge and can recommend that the management of signature mandates should be provided by external experts as a service. This allows treasury departments to focus on strategic topics which help to deliver better business results.</p>
<p>The key advantages and acknowledged benefits in adopting a Bank Account Management solution, provided as a service, are gaining complete control and effective management of all bank relationships – including bank master data, legally binding documents as well as signatory mandates.</p>
<p>Through automated approval workflows for requests to changes in bank mandates, secure and audit proof processes, such a solution provides full corporate compliance. In addition, complete integration with existing back office infrastructures improves efficiency and cost reduction, through automating manual processes and monitoring their performance. All departments involved benefit from easy access to real-time information for strategically managing signature mandates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the recognition that the banks are using electronic exchange of Bank Account Management (eBAM) information, including the electronic opening, closing and maintenance of bank accounts as well as generation of audit reports, is picking up pace in the market, especially within large corporations. The business case is now becoming fundamental as a growing number of companies, across all sectors, aim to resolve governance and compliance issues as well as minimising risk.</p>
<p>We have provided our customers with a best practice service model to globally manage signature mandates within all bank relationships and providing efficient, low-risk business workflows which embeds governance processes as corporate regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>My final recommendation is to approach this challenge by establishing a model which captures all of the bank details into a central ‘source of truth’, which is the fundamental milestone in achieving a global overview of signature mandates.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>When discussing treasury topics with our clients, one of the key challenges that is constantly raised is the management of bank accounts and related signatories. The complexity, the time to process changes with banking partners and the highly manual process result in large inefficiencies and little visibility and control over this highly error and risk prone process. Auditability and compliance are key in this area – there are a number of initiatives that organisations can drive to reduce the complexities.</p>
<p>Rationalisation of bank accounts is an activity that many are constantly working on. By having less bank accounts the management of bank accounts and related signatories will clearly be reduced. The introduction of SEPA has introduced new possibilities but it has not been fully leveraged by many corporate treasurers. The benefits that the rationalisation bring should be balanced with other factors such as bank wallets, counterparty risk but also making sure that the services for the local entities continue to be serviced.</p>
<p>A second option would be to move away from bank-branded electronic banking to a multi-bank payment solution, coupled with bank communication such as host-to-host or SWIFT. By using such solutions you will have the benefit of approving payments in a multi-bank payment tool and securing the payment files with a company token. Organisations benefit from operational efficiencies by eliminating duplication of user and bank account data in multiple e-banking platforms.</p>
<p>A third, and more significant, efficiency and control mechanism would be to migrate to a central bank account management (BAM) solution. In recent studies, 15% of treasuries reported to have a tool in place for managing bank administration and relationships. The majority of these tools include Excel reports or simple homegrown database solutions. While these types of tools provide visibility on the number of bank accounts and signatories, they lack control, auditability and efficiency. It is remarkable to see that in many corporate organisations the accounts payable process requires high levels of security, while the management of the underlying mandates and signatories has lower controls.</p>
<p>It is vital to have all documentation and letters readily available and easily generated. This requires streamlined BAM for all processes and exchanges within the company and across different countries. Internal and external reporting and correspondence to internal and external stakeholders should be automatically generated, taking out the risk- and error-prone paper trails around this process.</p>
<p>Besides bank BAM solutions, there are many proven solutions in the market available that provide bank account management functions including workflows (to open, close and modify bank accounts), activity lists, dashboards and report generators that can be sent straight to the banks. In the last few years, ERP integrated solutions have also been introduced in the market – further leveraging efficiency and compliance around BAM.</p>
<p>Although the exchange of the related XML-based eBAM messages needs to mature in the next few years, corporates can reap benefits of visibility, control and efficiency over their bank account management processes as of today.</p></div>

<p>As the financial community seeks to reduce costs, mitigate risk and streamline their processes, corporates face challenges in managing their relationships with multiple banking partners – particularly when different channels, different protocols, different formats, and different data requirements need to be factored into the implementation process. A number of initiatives seek to address the ambiguity of how corporates and banks interact with each other, in particular regarding messaging formats and standards. Of note is the CGI-MP initiative, an industry-led effort that is gaining prominence as a key frame of reference for the implementation of ISO 20022 (an international standard that’s designed to simplify global business communication) payments messages between corporates and banks which represent the next generation messaging standard for SWIFT.</p>
<p>CGI-MP (Common Global Implementation – Market Practice) embodies the notion that, “a corporate can use the same message structure (for each message type) to interact with all of their transaction banks across the globe for payments initiation (credit transfer and direct debit), account and status reporting.”</p>
<p>The goal of CGI-MP is to provide a forum for both financial (banks and bank associations) and non-financial institutions (corporates, corporate associations, vendors and market infrastructures) to progress various corporate-to-bank implementation topics on the use of ISO 20022 messages and to other related activities in the payments domain. In particular, it is to simplify implementation for corporate users and thereby promote wider acceptance of ISO 20022 as the common XML standard used between corporates and banks. SWIFT operates the ISO 20022 Registration Authority (RA) as the guardian of the ISO 20022 Financial Repository and the <a href=""https://www.iso20022.org"" target=""_blank"">www.iso20022.org</a> website.</p></div>

<h5 id=""rohini-tendulkar"">Rohini Tendulkar, Economist, IOSCO:</h5>
<p>The first thing to understand is that the cyber attack threat profile that a firm faces will depend very much on the type of firm, the services it provides and its function in the greater financial system. Threat assessments are best performed on an individual basis.</p>
<p>In general, cyber attacks will most likely be targeting money, or information that can be monetised, but this is not always the case. Cybercriminals can come with a myriad of motivations and include actors such as: Criminals, including organised criminal groups, acting for financial gain; ‘Hactivists’, groups or individuals motivated by a political ideal or ideology; cyber spies, using espionage to steal political or economic secrets, including information on how financial markets work; nation states or terrorist groups, using the cyber vector in warfare with a motive to disrupt or destroy a nation’s economy; insiders (eg disgruntled employees) seeking to steal from or sabotage their firm.</p>
<p>This means that in some cases, firms may be targeted by those driven by political, geopolitical and ideological reasons – where revenge, disruption and sabotage are the goals. In addition, a firm, no matter the size, may be targeted as an entry point to get into a system of another, connected firm. It is therefore critical that all firms, clients and third-party vendors are aware of the cyber risk, put in place preventative measures and identify who and how they are connected to each other through IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the Asia-Pacific region in particular, it is worth noting the acceleration of technological usage in business and government. As the use of technology increases, new vulnerabilities are introduced. Nevertheless, the status and challenges of cyber risk exist irrespective of regional or national borders. Some cyber threats to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stealing of confidential data/information – through obtaining access credentials and dispatching a virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributed denial of service attacks – flooding a server with information requests until it crashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced persistent threats – multi-layered and multi-stage cyber attacks that can stay in a system for years without being detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ransomware – malware that blocks system access, disrupts processes or scrambles data. Functionality is returned to normal only after a ransom (monetary or political action) is paid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber espionage also appears to be an emerging trend in the region, according to some reports.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of tackling cybersecurity, it is important to realise that cybercrime is not something that can be dealt with by a firm’s IT department in isolation. Traditional preventative measures such as antivirus software and firewalls are not enough to deal with sophisticated attacks. Even with the most cutting-edge preventative and detection technology in place, human behaviour (such as clicking on an attachment in an email) can provide a channel for cyber attacks to penetrate.</p>
<p>Consequently, for treasurers, it is important to keep up-to-date with trends in the cyber attack landscape to know what to look out for – in particular the various social engineering techniques that may be used to trick someone into allowing a cyber attack to propagate. This can be achieved by attending cybersecurity training or information sharing events/groups. It is also important to identify the most critical or sensitive information/data/processes under one’s control and relay this information to IT departments so that cybersecurity efforts can be prioritised. Lastly, treasurers should understand or encourage the development of internal cybersecurity policies in their firm, for example clear reporting lines in the case of a cyber attack.</p>

<h5 id=""anupreet-singh-amole"">Anupreet Singh Amole, Senior Associate, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP:</h5>
<p>Simply put, a cybersecurity incident is a breach or disruption of an organisation’s computer systems (or internet presence) by an unauthorised third party. Although this topic is often linked with the growth of technology within an organisation, cyber risk is far more than a technical issue. When hackers steal, or employees lose, confidential data, the affected company faces real-world implications, whether financial, legal or reputational. As such, a company’s risk mitigation and incident response should be multi-disciplinary from the very outset.</p>
<p>Hackers use various techniques depending upon their intentions. Those seeking to disrupt, may launch denial of service attacks to cripple a company’s client-facing website. By contrast, those seeking to steal confidential commercial information and/or valuable personal data (such as credit card details) will use spear-phishing emails or sophisticated ‘watering-hole attacks’, which infect an external website frequented by the target organisation (eg a news outlet for a particular profession or industry sector).</p>
<p>As demonstrated by high-profile cases over recent years at Sony, Adobe, Apple, eBay and Target Inc, these threats can have significant, real world, commercial consequences. In the case of Target, the company suffered both reputationally and financially. Its CEO resigned in the aftermath and it still faces class action litigation by shareholders, consumers and certain financial institutions. It seems that the Target breach is regarded as something of a tipping point in corporate awareness of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a place for spending on specialist technical security advice and software. However, one must not see that technical element as a panacea. Instead, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, it is the human element that is crucial. Again, a cross-functional approach is required.</p>
<p>Do the directors on your Board understand the effects that a cybersecurity breach could have upon the company? Has the Board discussed relevant guidance issued by government agencies? Are your employees trained about cyber and information security more broadly? Do they know how to spot and report a suspected phishing email? Do employees have access to all data or are there restrictions around the most sensitive data? Does the company have clear computer use policies? What is the policy and procedure regarding employees’ access to and storage of company data on their individual personal mobile devices (eg Bring Your Own Device policies)?</p>
<p>Do contracts with suppliers (including data cloud providers) and customers address liability for data loss? Do the company’s insurance policies adequately cover the risk of a cyber breach? What are your plans for handling an incident as and when it occurs? Who will be in your incident response team? It would be prudent to include representatives from senior management plus IT, Legal, Security, Corporate Communications, Human Resources, Investor and Press Relations functions. Which external advisers (IT security/forensic consultants; lawyers; corporate brokers) are needed? How and when will you rehearse your incident response? These are just some of the issues to consider when managing cyber risk.</p>

<h5 id=""eddie-toh-and-lem-chin-kok"">Eddie Toh, Director, Forensic, KPMG and Lem Chin Kok, Partner, Forensic, KPMG:</h5>
<p>The underlying risks posed by cyber, in many respects, haven’t changed a great deal in the last decade. Malwares and phishing scams are nothing new; however the sophistication of these has increased. The main change however, is the scale of these risks. Over the past decade, organisations have introduced exponential amounts of technology in all areas of the business. Although this has offered many benefits to companies, it has also opened the market to cyber criminals. The market place is also growing, as individuals and organisations throughout Asia Pacific and the world embrace technology.</p>
<p>The big question then is – are companies aware and prepared to meet the threat? In Asia Pacific, generally the answer is no, and in some cases organisations don’t care about the topic. We have seen companies introducing lots of technology, and spending lots of money doing so, but not focusing on the risks associated with this and building adequate controls and processes to mitigate these. In the cases where cyber risk is appreciated, a second problem is that in the region we have limited professionals with the knowledge and skillset to help companies mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>Another key problem is the lack of awareness and knowledge about the cyber world at an individual level. For example, we often see cases where an individual within a company has fallen foul of a phishing scam, despite these well-publicised scams existing for a long time. Another example comes from man-in–the-middle attacks, where the cybercriminal eavesdrops, intercepts and relays messages between parties, inducing innocent parties into making payments to bank accounts controlled by the cybercriminal. In recent months, we have seen an increasing trend of the treasury falling foul of these attacks. In many cases, the treasury followed up on requests to make payment to other bank accounts and employed their control procedures by asking for supporting documents to validate the request, which the cybercriminal who made the request was able to fabricate and provide. The payment was made and it was only after a few months, when the real supplier called asking for payment, that the treasury realised what had happened. We therefore always advise our clients to make an independent call back to the vendor to validate the request. Individuals should also be mindful of email accounts of the email sender and receivers (including those copied).</p>
<p>Cyber attacks are becoming increasingly common in the region and are likely to increase. It is no longer a question of whether an organisation will be compromised as a result of cyber attacks, but when. Organisations have to assume that their IT infrastructure will be compromised and ensure that they are well-prepared to detect and respond to cybercrimes when they happen. We strongly believe an organisation can mitigate the risks posed by cyber when it takes a people-led approach, puts in place a strong cyber governance process and invests in the right technology.</p>

Cyber Risk And Fraud,Emptying the drawer: farewell to security tokens?, Published: Nov 2014 ,,"<div class=""gs-grid__col gs-grid__col-1-10 gs-grid__col--expand"" style="""">

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>‘Too many security devices’ has been the treasurers’ complaint about corporate-to-bank connectivity for many years. No-one questions the need for security when executing electronic transactions but there are few plausible options to replace the cumbersome system of multiple bank-proprietary tokens (their multiple formats), simply because no single alternative system has gained sufficient ground on the others to become the de facto standard.</p>
<h3 id=""pkis-cas-and-digital-signatures-a-brief-explanation"">PKIs, CAs and digital signatures: a brief explanation</h3>
<p>Secure remote access to electronic and online financial systems relies on a process of identification and authentication. When transactions are made, a digital signature is required to authenticate the sender and to confirm that the message was indeed sent (assuring non-repudiation) and that it was not altered in transit (confirming its integrity). Secure digital signing relies on the encryption process.</p>
<p>The most common model of cryptography in this context is public key encryption (also known as asymmetric cryptography because it must have a corresponding private key). In the words of IBM: “Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key. Data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted using the corresponding public key”.</p>
<p>Encryption uses an algorithm to generate a code (a ‘hash value’) that is almost impossible to break. Banks commonly use hash values based on 128-bit (bit is a contraction of ‘binary digit’) numbers which have a vast number of potential combinations (128-bit may now be considered the minimum secure value).</p>
<p>The broad system that manages public and private keys and which provides secure access to unsecure networks such as the internet, is known as a public key infrastructure (PKI). A PKI will typically include key depository and an independent certificate authority (CA) such as VeriSign, IdenTrust or Thawte, that issues and verifies digital certificates. These add substance to the keys and are used to verify that a web server is trusted by the CA. The CA also issues personal digital certificates, often delivered in the form of USB keys, and will confirm their validity (or otherwise) when these are used to gain access to a secure site. A PKI also includes a registration authority (RA), such as a bank, to verify public key users (eg its clients) for the CA before a personal digital certificate is issued and its associated key is activated.</p>
<p>For a bank client to use a registered personal digital certificate, two-factor authentication is often used. This requires ‘something you have, plus something you know’. In this case the ‘have’ would be the security device, such as a USB key, and the ‘know’ would be a PIN-type code.</p>
<h3 id=""what-are-the-security-choices"">What are the security choices?</h3>
<p>In terms of how financial institutions enable authentication and validation, the choices are few. Banks may use their own proprietary set-up, offering secure ID tokens which may be physically connected to a computer (such as a USB device) or be offered as a standalone one-time pass code generator (as used by many online consumer banking sites).</p>
<p>There are some advanced technologies being used that take the USB token to the next level, such as Barclays Corporate Banking which, from 2015 will be offering UK clients a compact biometric device which can read and verify the users’ unique vein patterns in their fingers. This is still essentially a two-factor authentication tool but it takes the form of a personal scanner, using infrared light to detect the vein pattern in a living finger and so the authentication factors are rolled into one; nothing else is needed. It matches the pattern with that of a digitally captured and encrypted version previously recorded and stored by the user on a SIM card. Michael Muller, Head of Cash Management at Barclays Corporate Banking told Treasury Today at the launch of the device that he saw it as “an important part of our digital strategy” and was “optimistic” that biometric technology will join the mainstream fight against fraud.</p>
<p>Other banks opt to work with third-party providers such as IdenTrust (which was originally formed through bank co-operation but is now commercial). By far the most common form is the USB device and treasurers will often have one for each bank they work with. The much-talked about drawer full of devices is no myth; it is an awkward fact of making secure transactions.</p>
<p>If treasurers just want to make sure those transactions are secure, Andrew Burns, Director of TMS system vendor, Kyriba UK, notes that from a process standpoint, life has become more complicated as organisations start to centralise their payments processes (via a shared service centre for example).</p>
<p>Within a decentralised structure, payments could be issued and released at a local level, executed perhaps by a local Finance Director via an electronic banking platform. “When the payments requirement has been centralised, suddenly there are individuals responsible for multiple approvals for multiple banks,” he explains. This is where the problem of multiple security devices arises; having 30 different tokens in a drawer is not uncommon. If the holder of those devices is travelling, all those devices have to go along too. “It’s just not practical,” he states.</p>
<p>The challenge therefore is to find a practical alternative, and Burns believes that although “nothing has gained critical mass”, SWIFT’s 3SKey is making most headway. “It uses the SWIFT infrastructure which is a trusted banking network independent of any individual bank security method,” he notes. “I think the main worry for banks which are driving these security measures is that they do not want to outsource their KYC process, relying on authentication by somebody else’s processes in the PKI that they use,” says Burns. This is not necessarily the issue for 3SKey but he feels that many companies will not move until they know where the market is going. “They won’t invest money in a product and move away from their existing one if that’s not going to be the solution that sticks around.”</p>
<p>Without momentum, it will be difficult to get going. “For a treasurer, if too many of your banks are not registered for 3SKey it becomes difficult to use that methodology; it dilutes the value proposition if you still have many tokens plus the 3SKey.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-main-contender-swift-explains-3skey"">The main contender: SWIFT explains 3SKey</h3>
<p>The hierarchy of security system sees SWIFT effectively as the neutral third-party infrastructure provider, the financial institution as the service provider and the corporate client as the customer, with individual employees as the end-point. “3SKey is all about personal not organisational-level digital signatures,” explains Neil Gray, Senior Manager for SWIFT’s Corporates Business in the UK and Ireland. The first stage of the process involves that individual receiving a token (in the form of a USB) from his or her service provider. Currently, the banks subscribing to the 3SKey service will order a stock of these tokens. The banks will issue tokens to their corporate clients and the client will distribute one to each employee in treasury or AP/AR as required. At this point, the token needs to be activated. This is done by plugging it into the USB port of a computer and accessing via the internet (not the SWIFT network) the relevant 3SKey portal where the activation button is presented.</p>
<p>This generates a digital certificate on the token; SWIFT is acting as the CA and as such has no direct relation with the corporate or token user. The next stage is for the individual to register the token (either in person or online) with each of the different banks on the corporate’s panel (assuming that they are subscribed into the 3SKey scheme); the banks here acting as the RA. This pairs the individual’s identity with the certificate on the token. “There is no hierarchy of banks in registration or use; they are all completely independent of each other,” comments Gray.</p>
<p>The registered token can be used to digitally sign in a variety of ways for different channels, such as signing and sending a batch payment file via the SWIFT network or a bank’s proprietary host-to-host system or as a means of authentication on a bank’s online portal. In each scenario, the bank is able to automatically revert to SWIFT (as the CA) to check the status of each certificate being used, enabling it to either execute or deny the request being made via the token. If an activated token is lost or stolen, Gray points out that the two-factor authentication system it uses would require anyone trying to use the token also to know the associated PIN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only limitation the USB-based 3SKey currently has is with mobile devices that do not support a USB port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only limitation the USB-based 3SKey currently has is with mobile devices that do not support a USB port. “We are conscious that treasurers are building mobile devices into their operations,” Gray comments. “We are actively working on an extension to support mobile platforms as well”. Details of the exact nature of the solution are not yet announced.</p>
<p>However, the use of 3SKey is not restricted to banking, having potential for example to extend into the space occupied by online trading portals or cloud-based financial platforms, says Gray. “This gives a stronger login access and when a customer wants to execute a transaction, the system can prompt the user to re-enter the PIN, effectively acting as the user’s signature to the deal.”</p>
<p>The roll-out status of 3SKey (as at August 2014) shows 38 bank subscribers (generally at group level, so including support across multiple countries). Currently, its reach is 113 countries. Around 51,000 tokens have been distributed, with 21,000 active users across some 4,300 corporates. SWIFT claims 17 of the top 20 cash management banks globally support 3SKey. “Typically corporates will start off in one business context before approaching their other banks; they are pushing their other banks to support it if they aren’t already subscribed. A bank that has newly subscribed to the service to support one might then question why it continues to support its own proprietary technology. This is something we have seen with Societe Generale.”</p>
<h3 id=""using-3skey-the-bank-view"">Using 3SKey: the bank view</h3>
<p>Societe Generale is indeed one bank that has successfully adopted 3SKey as its sole security measure in the context of its Sogecash Web portal and host solutions. It started rolling it out in 2010 and is so convinced of its merits that this year the bank has announced to all clients that it is replacing its PKI proprietary solution with the single 3SKey device. Although there was no choice in the matter for clients, the response has been positive.</p>
<p>“We were looking for a multi-bank solution because when we discussed this with treasurers they quite often told us that they had too many security devices to manage for all their banks,” says Emmanuelle Fischer, Head of Marketing &amp; Products for Payments and Cash Management, Societe Generale Global Transaction Banking. “We found an easier and cheaper solution for corporate clients that could be used with many banks and which is also compatible with most of the products we offer to them.”</p>
<p>Societe Generale has been very proactive in its approach to 3SKey. “I think there is a trend towards adoption and I think treasurers will be pushing their banks to deliver a single solution,” she explains, adding that there is some movement by the European Commission to work towards harmonisation of security devices.</p>
<p>“The only drawback with 3SKey is that you cannot plug it into a mobile device,” comments Fischer. “We have to go along with the trend of the past few years that sees more treasurers wanting their cash management applications on their smartphone or tablet computer.” Societe Generale has therefore been developing a solution for mobile devices, seemingly as SWIFT is also considering such a proposition but the bank clearly working towards its own more pressing commercial launch date. “Almost one year ago we launched our first cash management application for mobile; we will launch a new version later this year that will allow treasurers to validate transactions on their mobile devices and for that we needed to work on our own security solution.”</p>
<p>Mobile issues aside, Fischer sees a steady growth of the number of users. “We are confident that it will become one of the standards for all global digital signatures, to authenticate users on web portals and to sign all files when sending them to banks. But I think there could be additional applications for all digital contact with banks. Our clients are increasingly sensitive to security issues and although some see these devices as a constraint, many more are seeing the benefits.”</p>
<p>Whilst she feels SWIFT probably initially saw 3SKey as a tool for large corporates to sign orders on the SWIFT network, Fischer sees more mid-sized companies adopting it, with all users exploiting it beyond that network. “In our case, it is used to authenticate customers on our web portal, allowing them to make any transactions, but it is also used for other protocols such as FTP, SFTP and, in France, EBICS TS.”</p>
<h3 id=""using-3skey-the-corporate-view"">Using 3SKey: the corporate view</h3>
<p>Although French engineering and technology consulting company Alten has been connected to SWIFTNet since 2008, many of its subsidiaries outside France remained linked to their banks through e-banking services only. The growth of its business led to an increase in the complexity of systems and the number of banks its treasury needed to connect into. “This creates difficulties and is hard to maintain on both the functional and technical sides,” explains Guillaume Peslin, Global Treasurer of Alten.</p>
<p>When in France, the ETEBAC 5 corporate-to-bank communication platform was replaced by EBICS, corporates could no longer digitally sign payment files which were then verified by the bank upon receipt, the problem was magnified. “When SWIFT launched 3SKey in 2010, we immediately saw an opportunity to reduce the complexity of e-banking identification,” he says. Alten’s treasury department implemented the solution to work with Societe Generale’s ‘Sogecash Web’ online banking portal. “Now, when we update our authentication process, 3SKey requests all bank systems to facilitate the maintenance; this was done previously with a single ETEBAC card for France,” adds Peslin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any security solution to become a compelling proposition for the wider business community, it needs to be able to replace most or all other forms of security device; in short it needs to be the de facto standard. Getting banks to agree on anything is never an easy option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having used 3SKey for some while, he believes it “could also be a good tool to facilitate eBAM” (electronic bank account management), which Alten is now aiming to adopt. Despite its apparent flexibility, for 3SKey to move forward, Peslin notes one essential requirement: “the compliance of banks and their systems is key”.</p>
<h3 id=""a-call-to-action"">A call to action</h3>
<p>For any security solution to become a compelling proposition for the wider business community, it needs to be able to replace most or all other forms of security device; in short it needs to be the de facto standard. Getting banks to agree on anything is never an easy option. This appears to be the issue with moving the whole security aspect of corporate online banking away from that drawer full of single bank proprietary tokens towards a unified model of identification and authentication.</p>
<p>3SKey seems to be the current favourite; most banks (certainly those offering transaction services) are already on the SWIFT network anyway so it is a small step for them. For it to become the standard, Burns suggests that banks need “a bit of a push” from their corporate clients. “The technology goes in the direction of where the pain is; if treasurers can go to their banks and say they need a better solution then the banks will start to move,” he says. “But banks are so inundated at the moment with so many different demands – not least by the regulators – that they have to prioritise. If corporates do not raise the issue of security tokens then the banks will not move.”</p></div>

<h5 id=""nasreen-quibria"">Nasreen Quibria, Executive Consultant, CGI:</h5>
<p>The digital age is opening up new forms of payments fraud and cyber crime. One of the most common forms of cyber crime is malware. With these types of attacks, fraudsters lure users to content hiding malicious links underneath a legitimate image. Once a user clicks on that image, it downloads a hidden programme to an employee’s computer. When the employee then logs on to a bank site, it grants information to attackers and redirects them to a malicious payload site. In a corporate setting, malware can have disastrous consequences with man-in-the-browser fraud mechanisms such as Zeus having the ability to compromise security tokens and certificates. Take, for example, a standard ACH batch, this can be manipulated to create a new beneficiary and account information and append the information to an existing payroll batch.</p>
<p>Malware can further exploit vulnerabilities to commit cross-channel fraud shifting from the online to the physical space. In one particular scam, criminals sold pre-printed counterfeit cheques linked to corporate bank accounts. To do this, fraudsters took advantage of the access to scanned versions of paid and received cheques available on many banking web sites, they obtained login credentials through malware and phishing attacks and found all the required information to transfer large sums of money to “mule” accounts.</p>
<p>Certain technology trends also contribute to heightened risk of exposure. For example, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a growing trend in finance and treasury departments and malware can potentially be introduced to the office network through an employee’s mobile device. Similarly the introduction of remote services with cloud storage is another area for concern. The flexibility and freedom that companies gain from such trends can conversely enable cyber criminals to conduct highly automated online banking theft. Therefore, companies that overlook security and employee education in these areas ultimately risk exposing their confidential data.</p>
<p>The good news is that the common forms of cyber crime are preventable. A multi-faceted approach that builds a culture of risk awareness with education, formalised processes and effective tools can thwart criminals’ efforts. This begins with establishing corporate policies and communicating them to employees, such as providing helpful information to identify legitimate emails, the use of encrypted information for confidential information, masking account numbers and employing complex passwords.</p>
<p>Ultimately, fraud prevention requires constant vigilance. Companies should leverage best practices that include monitoring and reconciling accounts daily and instituting operational controls that rely on multiple approvals.</p>
<p>Exposure to risk can be further reduced by implementing tools from software providers and financial institutions. Installing, updating and maintaining firewalls and intrusion detection software, particularly those that provide malware/spyware security is key. Updating web browsers and installing security patches is also important. Finally, there are specialised solution providers in the market which offer real-time fraud detection systems monitoring and identifying unusual activity, such as new beneficiaries and disbursements sizes that are significantly higher than set criteria, which can be beneficial to a treasury department.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of John Salter"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/03/2014-03-tt-02-qa-john-salter-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""john-salter"">John Salter, Managing Director – Cash Management and Payments, Lloyds Bank:</h5>
<p>The introduction of large amounts of technology into a treasury department poses different and increasingly more challenging security issues to companies than ever before. Cyber criminals are now able to attack companies in large volumes using technology and only need one breach of security to extract a substantial amount of sensitive information and potentially cause a fair degree of damage to a company in a few hours.</p>
<p>It is true however that despite the threat, many companies have insufficient dedicated resources protecting against cyber attacks. I believe that the key reason for this is that many do not understand the threats posed and assume that they will not be affected. For many companies it is not intuitive to have advanced cyber protection beyond the standard firewalls and anti-virus. Yet cyber criminals do not discriminate against company size, location or industry sector as long as a profit can be made. Cyber criminals will attack the weakest in the herd so ignorance to threats actually makes you increasingly likely to be attacked.</p>
<p>Cyber crime is also becoming increasingly professional and globalised and the scope and sophistication of attacks should not be underestimated. Treasury departments should therefore be aware that an attack may stem from any corner of the world and in many cases may be disguised as legitimate business dealings. Furthermore, overseas associates may not have adequate controls in place which can leave your company exposed to attacks. The correct procedures will therefore need to be put in place to safeguard against these threats.</p>
<p>While cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, issues still arise because of human error. Treasury departments looking to increase their cyber security should therefore begin by focusing on the basics. Areas like the processes surrounding opening and closing bank accounts and the handling of sensitive information are a good place to start. We would also suggest that corporates ensure their hiring processes are sound and training is offered so employees understand cyber risks.</p>
<p>Companies should also begin to look at professionalising their cyber security much in the same way as banks, through establishing a business unit which focuses solely on preventing cyber crime. Corporates will have to accept that this will cost money and will need to be continually funded to keep pace with the advancements in technology. However, this will assist in safeguarding the company against both external cyber attacks and slower developing internal attacks, which remain very difficult to spot, unless somebody is looking for them.</p>
<p>Going forward, cyber threats will continue to adapt and become increasingly more advanced. Treasury departments must therefore begin to understand the threats and employ greater safeguards against them before it is too late.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Martin Tyley"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/03/2014-03-tt-02-qa-martin-tyley-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""martin-tyley"">Martin Tyley, Regional Head of Cyber, KPMG:</h5>
<p>While growing levels of technology in a treasury department can represent an increased cyber risk it still primarily remains a people issue. For example, a treasury department can have advanced controls and highly secured data, but if an employee takes this home, mentions it in public or wrongly emails it, these controls will be undone and the business will be at risk.</p>
<p>External cyber attacks on a business also pose risks and can be broken down into three areas. Organised crime, politically motivated ‘hacktivitsts’ and state sponsored attacks all use various methods to breach the companies safeguards and steal or corrupt data for personal gain. Unfortunately, there is no foolproof method to fully prevent these attacks but a treasury department, like the rest of the business, has the responsibility to liaise with IT and ensure that the correct security and technology is in place to counter these threats.</p>
<p>Internal threats pose another issue which treasury departments need to be aware of, coming in the form of employees who may steal, corrupt or use data for their own personal gain. Again technology can only go so far in preventing this and we recommend to our clients that background checks are performed on new staff that have access to sensitive information and that these are reviewed every two to four years.</p>
<p>A treasury department should also keep track of the data access its staff has. Most companies are now proficient at providing sufficient access when an employee joins and removing the account when they leave. However, an area that still requires improvement is when an employee transfers departments, from treasury to legal, for example. It is often the case that their access to the treasury department’s data will not be removed following this move even if they no longer require it. In a large company there can be hundreds, if not thousands, of employees who therefore have access to sensitive data which they do not require, increasing cyber risk. To safeguard against this treasuries should work with IT to ensure there are processes for employee transfers and that access is removed in a timely manner to improve cyber security controls.</p>
<p>Third parties that treasuries share data with should also be fully checked to ensure they are not weak links in the businesses cyber security posture. It is important that the correct controls are in place to ensure that data is safe with them and deleted once not required. Furthermore, if the third party also outsources, then these requirements will also apply to them.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to identify that cyber security isn’t about having an inward looking approach and believing you are safe. The most effective departments are those who understand that it is a collective responsibility. The most ineffective are those who believe that it is just an IT issue and their responsibility to clean up. The key therefore is to be able to harmonise people, processes and technology and if this can be achieved there is a much greater chance of protecting the treasury department and the organisation.</p>

Cyber Risk And Fraud,Under cyber siege, Published: Jul 2013 ,,"<div class=""gs-grid__col gs-grid__col-1-10 gs-grid__col--expand"" style="""">

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Cyber security is a growing source of anxiety for businesses. Several studies published this year indicate the growing attention cyber related risks are now being afforded by organisations. For example, a PwC study, published in conjunction with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS), reported that budgets dedicated to cyber security at UK businesses have increased by 2% over the past year, with an average of 10% now being reserved for cyber-crime prevention and mitigation. And it appears to be a similar story in the financial sector. In the Bank of England’s (BoE) twice-yearly systemic risk poll, more respondents cited cyber-crime as the main threat to the stability of their bank.</p>
<p>Whether this growing concern about cyber security reflects an actual increase in the frequency and severity of cyber-attacks is difficult to substantiate – cyber-crime, after all, is not something companies like to talk about, at least publically. But John Salter, Head of Cash and Payments at Lloyds TSB, argues that it would still be reasonable to assume that the threat is a growing one. An ever-growing quantity of data and assets stored in the virtual world mean that the incentives for criminals to steal money or information through corporate networks have never been greater.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t risk breaking into a vault when there is only £50 inside, but you might do if there is £50m,” says Salter. “The virtual world has become a much more interesting place to exploit now through criminal activity because it is easier to do on a large scale – and the payback can be much bigger.”</p>
<p>Consequently, organisations have found themselves under almost constant siege from criminals in the cyber world. “They knock on the door almost on a permanent basis,” he adds. “I would use German blitzkrieg tactics as an analogy – criminals will probe for weak spots and when they find one they steam their whole division through it.”</p>
<h3 id=""fighting-back"">Fighting back</h3>
<p>In order to keep up with this evolving threat, companies are being forced to rethink how they approach cyber security. Salter, who recently spoke on the subject of cyber-related crime at the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT) conference in Liverpool, believes many companies still have a way to go.</p>
<p>Most banks will have a dedicated group function to manage this specialist type of criminal activity, he says. When he asked treasurers at the ACT conference how their businesses were managing the threat, it quickly became clear to him that non-financial companies have not been addressing it in the same way as banks have been. “In a room of maybe 100 people, only 20% responded positively to that question,” he says. “So I’m not sure that companies fully understand the nature of the threat they face today and are responding as well as they could or should be.”</p>
<p>However, some businesses are beginning to recognise that defending their networks is no longer just about having the right firewalls and anti-virus programmes in place. To protect against some of the more sophisticated types of attacks being perpetrated today, experts unanimously agree that a more holistic approach is required.</p>
<p>The growing use of analytics technology provided by companies such as SAS could be one example of a new level of realisation. “I think if you look at cyber security as an IT problem alone, you are always going to be ten steps behind,” says Joanne Taylor, Director of Public Security at SAS. “What we offer is the next stage in the evolution.” A large company will, she says, accumulate masses of information that serves to inform them of different types of attacks originating from different areas of the business. SAS’ solution gathers this data together and uses an analytics platform to scan for suspicious activity.</p>
<p>This is perfect for identifying the “low and slow attacks” referred to by Salter, and evidence shows such technology can help to reduce the cost of a security incident (<a href=""#chart-1-activity-cost-comparison-and-the-use-of-security-intelligence-technologies"">see Chart 1</a>). By linking cyber-activities to business events – the opening of an account, for example – analytics software is able to pick up on potentially suspicious events that a firewall or anti-virus would almost certainly have considered innocuous. “They are constantly hitting an organisation over a long period of time,” Taylor explains. “But because the organisation is not connecting the dots, they are often unaware they are being probed for weak points.”</p>

</figure>
<p>Chris Pickles, BT’s Head of Industry Initiatives for the Financial Sector, agrees. “Pattern recognition is an important development.” Yet a basic anti-virus package is simply inadequate for the needs of some companies today, he says. The types of attacks that companies are experiencing have become so advanced, and the consequences for those that fall victim so severe, that companies need to change their tactics. “It is the difference between putting a bolt on your door and installing a managed alarm – the alarm not only monitors your surveillance systems throughout the day, but also looks for patterns.”</p>
<p>Despite these advancements companies realise that the risk of a breach cannot be eliminated fully. For those businesses whose operations make their potential losses from a cyber-breach very substantial – for example, companies that aggregate a considerable amount of personally identifiable data – they should begin looking into hedging that risk by taking out cover with a cyber-insurance provider.</p>
<p>Although Europe’s cyber insurance industry is still in its infancy, Kevin Kalinich, Global Practice Leader for Cyber Insurance at Aon One, believes that might be about to change. An increasing number of EU companies are taking out first party cyber liability policies to cover business interruption and the costs associated with sending out notices to aggrieved customers if personal data is compromised.</p>
<p>It is no surprise, he says, that this increased interest in cyber insurance has coincided with recent proposed amendments to the EU Privacy Data Directive that will require mandatory disclosure of all data breaches. “In the US and Asia, there wasn’t a big growth in cyber insurance until there was a data breach disclosure law. After that, there was an almost linear increase in litigation, which was followed by a linear increase in cyber insurance.”</p>
<h3 id=""building-a-cyber-savvy-treasury"">Building a cyber-savvy treasury</h3>
<p>Treasurers are not known to be the most tech savvy individuals, and in today’s challenging economic environment one might argue that they have enough on their plate managing financial risks without having to contemplate escalating cyber threats.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, there are areas where the treasurer can make a noticeable difference. Earlier this year, the Ponemon Institute published a study that examined the impact of a data breach on company balance sheets. The research found the companies that were most successful in minimising the cost of a data breach tended to be the ones who had adopted a strong security posture. An example of this are organisations which had centralised the management of data protection with the appointment of a C-level information security professional, a chief information and security officer (CISO), who works with treasury and other company departments in order to lead a more co-ordinated response.</p>
<p>“It is usually the job of the CISO to make sure that there is effective security in place,” says SAS’ Taylor. Instead, a treasurer’s role when it comes to cyber security, as with every other employee, should be on understanding that the information they handle has a value, she says. “Taking responsibility has got to be the starting point for individuals in a company.”</p>
<p>This is particularly important when applied to the security of information stored on mobiles, laptops or USB memory sticks – among the leading factors cited by the Ponemon Institute as driving up the cost of a data breach when it resulted in the loss or theft of a device. This, Taylor thinks, should make treasurers, and indeed all individuals within a company, consider carefully how they handle information. “The trend towards bring-your-own-device does open up massive security problems for organisations. At the individual level we all need to change our behaviours. Whatever job we are in, our information is an asset which means we don’t share it and we must think about how we are protecting it.”</p>
<p>Kalinich agrees. “A treasurer should be looking at the information assets within his department,” he says. If these are increasing then the issue clearly demands more scrutiny. Although he says it would be wrong to expect the treasurer to be an expert on the finer details of cyber security, Kalinich believes a basic awareness of the issues is required in every senior area of corporate management if losses are to be minimised.</p>
<p>“Treasurers should have some involvement in the procurement process when it comes to hiring the services of third-party vendors – be it for mobile, big data or cloud computing – and ensuring that those providers will be maintaining the highest level of security.” The CISO can then dig down into the technical detail to answer this question, Kalinich adds, but it is important for treasurers to know where within an organisation they can go to get help on cyber security-related questions affecting their department.</p>
<p>In this space, there is clearly an area of internal policy compliance for treasurers to think about, says BT’s Pickles. “Corporate treasurers will see a lot of cash management processes can be carried out with the help of smart phones now. But obviously there are security challenges relating to this type of technology, and maybe that is why it has not yet progressed, in terms of adoption, as quickly as some might have hoped.” That doesn’t mean the technology should be regarded as off limits, he is at pains to emphasise, just that “implementation needs to be done in a proper, controlled manner”.</p>
<p>Treasurers should also be considering what contingency plans the department has in place in the event that one of their banking counterparties is hit by an attack, Pickles adds. In the autumn of last year, a number of large financial institutions, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill) and J.P. Morgan (JPM), were victims of this type of attack. Although the disruption was short lasting and mostly limited to retail, rather than corporate clients, the fact that they happened should emphasise to treasurers the need to look again at their contingency plans for this type of scenario. “There is a perception that banks know about security,” says Pickles. “But when you look at the security breaches they’ve had over the past few years – whether that is banks, credit card companies or other financial institutions – it is clear that companies shouldn’t be blindly relying on them.”</p></div>

<p>Today a high performing treasury team is a business partner, a value-adding change agent and a thought leader. Over the coming years, a treasurer will also need to further intensify collaboration with colleagues in shared service centres (SSCs) and lines of business in order to optimise, standardise and automate, especially the order-to-cash (O2C) and purchase-to-pay (P2P) cycles.</p>
<p>In my experience, a treasurer should establish highly scalable, flexible, standardised, automated and ERP integrated treasury and payment processes across the company. In addition, a quick return on investment (ROI) in terms of IT is crucial for a treasury’s success.</p>
<p>This is a huge challenge for internal IT teams. During my time as treasurer I had several projects with excellent business cases, including high ROIs. However, many projects were slowed down because in-house IT resources were not available or the IT team did not have the expert knowledge required to make payment processes more efficient and secure. IT departments are often uninterested in taking on responsibility for treasury’s technology for a good reason: most IT organisations spend 80% on maintenance and only 20% on innovation which directly supports the lines of business. By reducing the high maintenance costs for treasury IT, resources (money and people) can be freed up for innovation and improvement, which can help the organisation be more competitive and better achieve its ambitious growth targets.</p>
<p>Buying treasury IT as a service has become an attractive option for treasurers, CFOs and CIOs. The cloud computing/software-as-a-service (SaaS) trend in payments and treasury is moving faster than many may think. Compared to SaaS, a typical traditional on-premise solution is a painful road to take, with time-consuming and costly hardware and software installations, followed by lengthy and apprehensive IT projects that tend to take an enormous amount of treasury and IT resources.</p>

<p>The global financial crisis in 2007 and economic downturn led to a sharp reduction in the lending activities by the banks and thus made access to credit extremely difficult and costly. The complexities of working capital and liquidity management were compounded by fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices and new regulations. This has created a high level of uncertainty in assessing the financial position within the corporates and the potential impact on profitability. The role of the CFO and corporate treasurer in the management of funds has therefore become extremely challenging. Within this context, technology plays a crucial role in helping the CFOs run an effective treasury function.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the person in charge needs a sound head for technology. Whether it is re-engineering accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) processes to release idle cash from within operations, or implementing liquidity management tools to reduce reliance on bank credit and implementation of SSCs, IT is central to any successful treasury management programme.</p>
<p>In many businesses, it means the CFO is often the best person to take on this responsibility. Not only do they have visibility of the company’s financial and business strategy, but they also have control of many of the technology tools already in place being used to make effective treasury decisions, such as information reporting and cash flow forecasting tools. By harnessing these technologies and closely aligning them with corporate goals, the CFO can be the primary driver for internal change initiatives and ensure a healthy pot of funds for the business.</p>
<p>New additions to the CFO’s arsenal include mobility and big data tools which help provide real-time reporting and analytics. These enable the CFO to monitor and better understand treasury activity and requirements, as well as harness data from the rest of the business to make more effective decisions. This can be particularly useful for liquidity management where a holistic, real-time view can provide the CFO with a better understanding of liquidity and risk positions across asset classes, geographies and currencies. Furthermore, these technologies can provide the CFO with the right financial tools to forecast their cash flows, understand their working capital needs based on the cash flows, benchmark their business metrics against industry peers and drive operational improvements.</p>

<p>IT is central to the operational requirements of corporate treasury. The problem is that the information held and used on these systems is so important, confidential and market sensitive that it needs to be kept under strict control. That does not mean that treasury can function without the support of IT, but overall control needs to remain with treasury.</p>
<p>Treasury is an area where there is a limited number of operational staff, so IT can be invaluable in achieving effective segregation of duties, to cover access and control. However, the input of transactions and data and authorisation need to be separate from each other, to minimise the risk of errors and fraud.</p>
<p>Companies using ERP systems will often expect treasury to conform to a corporate systems policy to use a particular supplier, even though their specific treasury capability may be of limited value. Providers of systems usually try to absolve themselves of any responsibility for losses incurred as a result of using their systems. Therefore, IT should manage the systems – but they don’t have the capability or experience to understand the exceptional risks which exist in treasury operations. Treasury must be accountable for errors and losses that might occur and should remain in overall charge of all its IT.</p>

<p>Treasury should be in charge of everything treasury, including IT responsibilities such as application support, performance monitoring, and disaster recovery. The obvious question of course arises: how is this possible?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: while treasury should be responsible for the support of their systems, they enable this by leveraging the cloud and an ecosystem of cloud solution providers that provide SaaS for treasury.</p>
<p>There are a number of important reasons why this should be the case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Internal IT resources are scarce.</h5>
<p>Treasury has specific and on-demand service levels, including high system availability and above-industry-standard business continuity requirements, no matter what the disaster. IT departments are not staffed to meet these needs, so treasury must turn to external providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Security.</h5>
<p>Hardware and data controls are rarely sufficient when systems are hosted internally within an organisation, especially when treasury information is concerned. Therefore, greater safeguards are needed. IT resources are often insufficient to protect treasury’s interests to the level that is mandated or recommended by internal or external auditors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cost.</h5>
<p>Treasury’s budget is usually quite low in comparison to other teams. To offer the service levels and security that the treasury requires unfortunately consume a disproportionate amount of budget compared with other teams. Cloud providers – offering better service levels and disaster recovery metrics – cost less than installing software in-house and, as a result, offer better value to the treasury team. This also frees up budget for other projects; never a bad thing for an aspiring treasurer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The nice thing is that this isn’t a tug of war between IT and treasury. IT doesn’t want to be in the business of installing software and troubleshooting software conflicts; instead it wants to be much more focused on technology projects that deliver business value for the organisation. This means that treasury’s shift to the cloud is completely aligned to IT’s objective.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Whatever anyone does to try to prevent it, fraudulent activity will never go away. Corporate treasuries have the same fraud risks as anyone else, but given the access treasury has to strategic information, pools of funding and payments mechanisms, they are also subject to some bespoke risks and potential for major loss. The risks need to be mitigated.</p>
<p>Alongside the processes and procedures laid down by a company as the framework in which its employees are expected to operate, there is the element of the people themselves who have different and unpredictable needs and behaviours. There is also a technology element that can put controls around the people and ideally some workflow around the processes, but this can also complicate matters. “Where these three elements come together, if you get them right you can significantly reduce your corporate fraud risk,” says Steve Wright, Product Development Manager at payments processor, VocaLink. But, he adds, although the idea is to “make it as difficult as possible”, fraud is an ongoing threat: if a criminal is determined to act, then they will.</p>
<p>With this in mind, all these usual practical measures – including controls around passwords, clear-desk policies, training against social engineering, locking computers when away from the desk, implementing banking processes that require multiple approvals, segregation of initiation and approval of payments – are just “basic things that apply to any business”, according to Bill Trueman, Managing Director of corporate fraud and risk management consultancy, UK Fraud. What is really needed is a change of culture. The common corporate practice of keeping the lid on fraud only serves to perpetuate it and, says Trueman, building silos of risk and compliance expertise into each corporate function (including treasury) serves to limit the level of communication and thus the agility of the business when responding to the threat.</p>
<h3 id=""all-change"">All change</h3>
<p>The nature of corporate fraud, notes Trueman, has moved beyond the relative simplicity of the corrupt office manager and the occasional “weights and measures issue” with a supplier and into a sophisticated world where highly intelligent professionals – and professional criminals – will manipulate processes and procedures to inflict heavy damage, both financial and reputational, on their targets. The defeat of a modern sting can thus require multiple corporate functions to co-operate and communicate as never before.</p>
<p>The motivation behind corporate fraud varies considerably, the methods ranging from the desperate and stupid to the ingenious. Fraudsters may act alone or as part of an organised crime syndicate. They may be part of the company or have no connection. But in the corporate world, when a fraudulent act is revealed, the sums involved can be staggering.</p>
<p>Indeed, recent history has thrown up three monumental cases of corporate fraud. Each was inflicted upon a multi-billion dollar business and saw their CEO convicted and sentenced to a long prison term for their efforts. Former Tyco CEO, Dennis Kozlowski, was convicted in 2005 of misappropriating more than $400m to fund his extravagant lifestyle (which allegedly required $6,000 shower curtains). The CEO of telecoms firm, WorldCom, Bernie Ebbers, was convicted in 2005 of fraud and conspiracy in the US’s largest ever accounting scandal. False financial reporting caused investors to lose more than $11 billion. Around the same time, the Enron scandal hit. Its CEO, Kenneth Lay, played a major part in what was termed an “institutionalised, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud” that led to the collapse of this US-based energy, commodities and services company. Lay was found guilty in 2006 of multiple counts of securities fraud. He died before he could be given a custodial sentence which was expected to be 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>These high profile scandals served to cast a dark shadow over the accounting practices and activities of many US corporates, and the realisation that all was not well had earlier heralded the arrival of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, which placed culpability for accounting inaccuracies directly in the lap of CEOs who signed off financial statements. That year also saw the award for the IgNobel Prize in Economics (an American parody of the Nobel Prize) go to the CEOs of various companies known to be involved in the corporate accounting scandals. Each was lauded for “adapting the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers for use in the business world”.</p>
<p>There may be dark humour to be extracted from this situation, but the 2013 AFP Payments Fraud and Control survey shows that 61% of organisations questioned experienced, attempted or actual payments fraud last year. Some 27% reported that the number of fraud incidents had increased, with affected organisations being hit more often, indicating that the fraudsters know they are a soft target and, more worryingly, that nothing had been done to close the breach.</p>
<p>The latest findings from the UK’s fraud prevention service, CIFAS, saw its member organisations (spread across multiple sectors) report a 53% rise in 2012 of facility takeover fraud – unlawful access to and fraudulent operation of an account. In a survey published in December last year by EuroFinance, more than a third of global financial professionals stated that they had worked in an organisation in which serious financial malpractice had taken place. The prevalence of fraud is a concern but, according to the survey, there is a serious obstacle preventing companies from tackling it head on.</p>
<p>Corporations, it seems, are far less likely than banks to prosecute fraudsters. Some 57% of respondents said that whistleblowers severely risked damaging their careers by speaking out. When serious financial fraud had been detected, 42% of corporate respondents said that the perpetrators had been fired but that the issue was merely hushed up. Of the banks, 76% of respondents said the guilty party had been prosecuted. Whilst corporates are seemingly prepared to get tough on minor fraud cases, they are not prepared to risk seriously damaging company reputation (and potentially their share price) by going public, and so they often sweep it under the carpet. According to Melvin Glapion, UK Managing Director of global risk and security consultant, Kroll Advisory Solutions, this reluctance to face up to the issue sends out all the wrong signals.</p>
<h3 id=""know-your-employees"">Know your employees</h3>
<p>Whilst fraud will always present a challenge, Glapion feels that unless companies establish an appropriate culture around this topic it will remain a taboo. Failure to tackle the underlying problem will not make it go away.</p>
<p>The major corporate fraud that takes place is usually internal, notes Trueman. The perpetrator is often at a relatively senior level and will nearly always have a personal issue (such as a gambling habit) or corporate issue (being overlooked for a promotion) driving them. “Usually the fraud involves significant amounts of money,” he says. Sophisticated stings are much in evidence but most often are based on a deliberate ‘conflict of interest’ where the perpetrator will work with an existing supplier and arrange to overpay for products, or they will work with a relatively new supplier to the company and receive a kickback from them in exchange for continued business.</p>
<p>As such, corporate fraud tends to be an ongoing problem. “If regular payments go to the same supplier, the name becomes familiar within the immediate company in terms of invoicing,” Glapion explains. It thus becomes commonplace and unremarkable. Once it has become a part of the system it is much more difficult for other staff, especially at a junior level, to question it.</p>
<p>The challenge for a corporate is in how to identify and mitigate such fraud, says Trueman. A possible deterrent that can also be an investigative tool may be found in a back office IT system that can create an audit trail for every process carried out by staff. But, he notes, the fraudster will know how to sidestep these systems (just think of Nick Leeson or Jérôme Kerviel).</p>
<h3 id=""it-toolkit"">IT toolkit</h3>
<p>VocaLink’s Wright argues the case for as much automation and straight through processing (STP) of accounts payable (AP) and receivable (AR) as possible. As well as eradicating points of intervention and creating a clear audit trail, he says that it removes the need for back office staff to have access to bank accounts and core systems, or for others to handle sensitive account details on bits of paper. “If someone is manually assigning receivables to a particular account and they have found a way of diverting those funds, and if they are also doing the accounting, the fraud can go undetected for years.” He adds that if someone gets away with it once “invariably they will go back again and again and it only comes out when it has become a big problem”.</p>
<p>Automation clearly has a key role to play in prevention, but when it comes to fraud detection Glapion notes that relying on “algorithms and analysis” to try to figure out where fraud is going to occur and who is going to do it is part of the toolkit “but it is not the answer in itself”. For Glapion and Trueman, the key lies in being able to monitor and understand employees at a more human level. Internal fraudsters may exhibit behavioural traits such as obviously living beyond their own means or refusing to share workload or take holidays. Observing such changes is a key part of detection.</p>
<h3 id=""who-are-you"">Who are you?</h3>
<p>All businesses therefore need to be able to answer a very basic question: who are the employees in the company, particularly in the finance, sales and marketing and executive teams? Details such as address and spouses name and employer can be cross-referenced with the company’s database of key suppliers to see if there is any matching information. “We do find conflicts of interest which have not been disclosed to the corporation,” Glapion says.</p>
<p>However, in some countries, harvesting and cross-referencing this kind of data is illegal (in Germany, for example). He urges all businesses to “think outside the box” when it comes to looking at how legitimate information can be checked to ensure there is sufficient basic knowledge about all employees.</p>
<p>Related to this is the more pressing need for companies to carry out background screening of those in or being considered for key roles. In treasury, says Trueman, the task takes on greater importance because of the sensitivity of the information they may have access to, including strategic corporate information and any trading and merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity.</p>
<p>“You’d be surprised at the number of companies that don’t do this,” comments Glapion. “Many tell us that they don’t feel comfortable prying into personal lives. But quite frankly, it is just basic due diligence. They will do it for M&amp;A transactions and on the financial side for tax and pensions reasons, so they certainly should be doing it when employing key personnel.”</p>
<p>A credit check can be a useful indicator of an individual’s propensity to be compromised. But for key employees it is necessary also to uncover any issues around litigation or criminal records and to acquire ‘human intelligence’ by talking to people who have worked with or have been involved in deals with this individual. It is, Glapion notes, “basic common sense” that the higher up you go in an organisation the broader the scope of enquiry should be. “Candidates looking for a very senior level position should expect that the company possibly about to hire them will want to know more about them.” Some searches require permission; any candidate that refuses may be hiding something (but it may just be an objection on moral grounds).</p>
<h3 id=""watching-the-watchers"">Watching the watchers</h3>
<p>The task of checking and monitoring staff is often seen as the responsibility of HR. But for Glapion, this is “much more of a commercial responsibility” and should be shared with General Counsel (the legal head), HR and other key department heads such as finance and sales and marketing. Department heads should be looking at individuals within their department and asking for the information at the point of hire and reviewing that information every one or two years. Indeed, if there has been a change in an employee’s circumstances or behaviour it may be necessary to review their levels of access and authority and be “mindful of situations” that could place them in a position where they may be compromised.</p>
<p>Accepting that many people are uncomfortable talking about these investigative activities, Glapion insists that they are absolutely necessary. No individual should be above this process, from the CEO and Board down, and this is why the responsibility sits well within the legal division and not HR.</p>
<h3 id=""a-cultural-shift"">A cultural shift</h3>
<p>To counter inevitable accusations of Big Brother-type surveillance, it’s necessary to normalise the checking process, making it part of company policy and bringing it into the open so that everyone knows it is part of the process. Whilst the information gleaned must be treated with absolute confidentiality, the discovery process itself should never be covert, as this engenders mistrust and suspicion.</p>
<p>When a company is subjected to a major fraud it will almost certainly and understandably close ranks and seek to suppress it. There may be certain aspects that have to be reported in the accounts, says Wright, but he adds that “no one wants to make public where their issues are”. This secretive approach can permeate the business and create an environment in which discussion is awkward, if not impossible. If individuals do not feel comfortable communicating their concerns upwards it can enable someone to operate outside of policy and procedure unhindered.</p>
<p>Companies need to state the absolute expectation that all communication is made through the official channels and not conducted in secret. It also needs to be asserted that individuals will not be subjected to any repercussions if they report something that they believe to be out of the ordinary, even if it means reporting something about their direct manager or the CEO.</p>
<p>If this out-in-the-open approach is enshrined in policy it will be seen as a genuine requirement that will be taken seriously. “Companies should also be able to demonstrate it in action, even with something that didn’t result in finding fraud,” Glapion advises. “If an employee in a subsidiary discovers something unusual that relates to a senior executive and it transpires that it was nothing, there is no reason not to praise that employee for raising the matter to show other employees that this is what is expected of them, as a means of combatting fraud.”</p>
<p>Another matter that should be addressed is the standing that fraud prevention often has in the hierarchy of corporate needs. In the current environment where personal budgets are squeezed and redundancies are hanging over ever more people, the temptation to defraud an employer can escalate into a need, notes VocaLink’s Wright.</p>
<p>The corporate investment agenda tends to be driven by revenue, profit or cost simply because these are areas that most can relate to within a business case. When tackling fraud, Wright notes that many companies will implement measures only when their business has been hit because it is a pure cost centre. “It’s one of those things that people believe probably won’t happen to them,” he notes. But unless tackling fraud is moved up the agenda, enabling firms to put the right measures in place and to look at the intersection of people, processes and technology, how confident can a business be that it is not already a victim?</p></div>
