<h4 id=""what-do-we-mean-when-we-speak-about-inclusion"">What do we mean when we speak about inclusion?</h4>
<p>In conversation with Treasury Today were Debbie Kaya, the Senior Director of Global Cash and Operations for Cisco Treasury, Rachel Brown, the North America Head of Implementations of Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions and Carlos Fuentes, from Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions team. Cisco and Citi, like many other companies, have been further compelled by the events of 2020 to look more closely at inclusion and to confidently articulate the complexities of building an egalitarian and diverse workforce.</p>
<p>Kaya outlined the ways in which she tackles the issue in her role, mostly approaching it from an HR and educational perspective, primarily by rolling her sleeves up and getting involved. The most obvious impact this has is on hiring, which Kaya looks at from a practical perspective. There must be a diverse group of candidates to begin with, and a diverse board conducting the interview process itself, in terms of both gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Although Citi has long aligned itself with a progressive social policy and agenda, the events of summer 2020 have encouraged the company to publicly declare its position and to solidify its social commitments with a number of new initiatives aimed at both internal and external communities. Brown and Kaya both emphasised the importance of education.</p>
<p>As Kaya explained, in some cases this is about education and in some it is a matter of re-education. When she is dealing with a global team, not everybody understands the history behind recent events in North America and so opening up a dialogue is critical. This crucial work that takes place within Cisco exists alongside Kaya’s support of inclusion as a whole in the industry, evidenced in her involvement with Women in Treasury and her support for industry events and discussions around inclusion and racial equity.</p>
<p>Brown explained that similarly and concurrently for Citi, the focus on diversity and inclusion has been a real journey that they have been on over the last couple of years. For her, operating in this space is a lifestyle approach. It is not just something that one does in the confines of one’s role or work environment, but something that becomes core and central to who you are. She began with herself, making sure that she was aware of the injustices that were taking place, better understanding the vocabulary, what unconscious bias meant, what micro-inequities meant, all in order to create a culture of belonging that would equip others to have these conversations as well. Brown explained that these discussions can be hard initially because they are new, therefore it is imperative to try to normalise them and make them easier to initiate. People must feel free and be encouraged to learn and grow, not full of fear of judgement and self-doubt.</p>
<p>Kaya spoke of the impact in her team of the tragic deaths in the black community. ‘When I spoke with my management team, we agreed a conversation with the team about the recent events and its impact needed to happen I sent an email and asked the team to have a very open discussion, trust each other, understand that not everybody has the right language, we may use the wrong words and just created that space. It is not the job of minority colleagues to educate others on the minority experience, but provide space for them to play a role, if they wish. Some may want an active role in the discussion, and some may be okay to answer questions, but we must also recognise many people are very emotionally drained by the situation.’</p>
<p>As Brown summed up, ‘We have had heavy hearts lately and it’s been a really different time for individuals who have experienced these traumas, in their family, in their family history, and they watch the news cycle and then have to re-experience these traumas. We walk into these discussions thinking about our families and how to keep our loved ones protected from these same injustices.’</p>


<blockquote><p>When I spoke with my management team, we agreed a conversation with the team about the recent events and its impact needed to happen I sent an email and asked the team to have a very open discussion, trust each other, understand that not everybody has the right language, we may use the wrong words and just created that space.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Brown and Fuentes both drew on the importance of surrounding themselves with nurturing environments and empathetic leaders. This highlights the need for diverse leaders from different backgrounds with different experiences. Fuentes then expanded to explore the international community of which Citi is a part.</p>
<p>‘Operating in over 95 countries, it is already a quite diverse organisation when we compare amongst peers. Working with teams across multiple countries and cultures, makes you very aware of understanding the differences and integrating that within your work.’ Ultimately, as all speakers mentioned and Fuentes explained, it is really a question of embedding inclusion into everything that a company does, as he has seen at Citi.</p>
<p>Brown echoed Kaya’s point on the importance of getting involved, citing Citi’s success with grass roots programmes. These are affinity programmes that are led by employees across the organisation who give of their time and they are a focus for talent recruitment and development. Additionally, she highlighted getting involved in the community, with affinity networks within Citi covering a number of different spectrums that have really seen successful. This, coupled with a focus on increased transparency, has allowed Citi to breathe new life into accountability and credibility and hopefully set a tone for the wider industry.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all agreed that it came down to the human aspect, with individuals in the workplace being valued for their experiences and the talent they bring. A diverse team has different ideas and discussions, with challenges being placed at the table, opening up new ideas and paving the way for innovative.</p>
<p>Brown’s hope for the future was, ‘that we don’t have to work so hard against score cards or representation statistics or even on trying to close gaps, my hope is that it becomes so embedded in our DNA that it is just the way that we operate and so it isn’t something that we strive for.’</p>
<p>Regarding advice for the community, Kaya offered the following, ‘the last thing I would say is determine where you want to commit your time. How much time do you have and how do you want to commit? Many people get involved because of how it appears to others, but it is important to be very authentic around this topic. Do you have a passion around this and if you do, how can you get involved?</p>
<p id=""video"">Summarising and amplifying Kaya’s points, Brown added, ‘I think that it is important to just make yourself aware of where you stand now and then give yourself goals on where you want to go. I would also say expand your network. If you look around and you see your network looks a lot like you, whether it be at home or at work, find new people to bring into it, have one-to-one conversations. Those are going to be very enlightening and will give you a greater sense of understanding around what is needed.’</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The moral imperative for greater diversity and inclusion in treasury along with its direct link to corporate performance may be well known but it has still been a mixed year regarding progress in the area. On one hand, remote working en-masse has ushered in a new raft of challenges around nurturing inclusion including helping treasury professionals build their brand and network through the wider company. A report by Lean In and McKinsey &amp; Co that finds one in four women are considering downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce due to the impact of COVID-19 is another cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the death of George Floyd in May pushed social injustice centre stage and grabbed attention inside the workplace but also exposed a lack of diversity within many companies’ own ranks, caught in statistics like the Fortune 500 still only having three black CEOs. Add in recent criticism from the UK’s Financial Reporting Council, lambasting listed companies for failing to live up to their diversity promises, plus the UK government launching a new task force to increase the number of people from poorer backgrounds in senior positions in financial and professional services, and it is clear diversity remains a challenge. That said, growing investor pressure on companies, more diverse role models and new recruitment practices show there is more cause for hope than despair.</p>
<h3 id=""role-models"">Role models</h3>
<p>One source of celebration is the growing number of leaders and role models within treasury, serving up proof to others that women and people of colour can reach leadership roles. “I never imagined that I would do this,” said Rosanna Summerville, Manager Global Transaction Banking &amp; Processes at Unilever, speaking during Treasury Today’s Inclusion in Action event last November. It is diverse leaders like Summerville who play a crucial role in showing and encouraging others that a career in finance is possible.</p>
<p>Simone Coultress, Treasury Manager at global science and chemicals group Johnson Matthey, credits the black female CFO in her first job in finance for imbuing her with a conviction that she could also succeed. “It made me feel that if I worked hard enough and I was good enough, it was possible,” said Coultress, who keen to encourage others herself, contributes to Johnson Matthey’s employee research group, an initiative focused on recruitment and development of black employees. Similarly, Alison Livesey, Managing Director, Wholesale Payments, EMEA at J.P. Morgan, has been inspired to push on diversity and inclusion after often finding herself the “only woman in the room,” and struggling to find role models herself. “Sponsorship has been key to my career progression, and I want to give back.”</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-change"">Corporate change</h3>
<p>Other encouraging signs of progress include treasury testimonies of corporate change. Summerville says that when she joined Unilever 25 years ago, diversity and inclusion weren’t even on the radar. “There was no awareness of this topic,” she said, recalling how men dominated the stage, particularly in bank meetings. Today, diversity is enshrined as a strategic objective and Unilever has achieved gender parity in all management posts, most recently turning the focus on closing the gap at senior executive level.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Aviva, Microsoft, Deloitte and Linklaters are among the companies to sign up to a new campaign spearheaded by employers’ group CBI calling on businesses to set and publish clear targets for greater racial and ethnic diversity at board, executive committee and senior management levels.</p>
<p>Targets have become an increasingly important tool for change. Amongst asset managers, focus committees, initiatives and goals with hard targets driven by rigorous data collection, alongside developing junior talent and providing coaching, are becoming the norm. Moreover, asset managers are increasingly demanding the same kind of diversity efforts from their investee companies, said Kim Hochfeld, Senior Managing Director, Global Head of Cash at State Street Global Advisors, who offers fresh insight on SSGA’s recruitment practices. “We insist on having a diverse slate of candidates when we are hiring for a new role. It’s not happening naturally, and prospective candidates can’t just all be white male,” she said, stressing the importance of employers to focus on prospective candidates’ ability to adapt their skills into the role rather than be a perfect match on experience or a conventional stereotype.</p>
<p>In another encouraging sign of the shift in recruitment practices, banks like Citi and J.P. Morgan have launched apprenticeship schemes for young people who haven’t gone to university. Tech firms have been offering apprenticeship schemes for a while, and Dino Zannetos, COO Treasury and Trade Solutions, EMEA at Citi, explained that a dual aim of the bank’s recent initiative alongside boosting diversity is to tap the talent needed to drive the digital transformation. “The generation we are recruiting through the scheme was born in the digital era. We are hoping they will bring a different way of looking at things to the table as we promote digitalisation across the bank. Junior talent brings a lot of energy and is hungry to learn,” he said.</p>
<h3 id=""inclusion"">Inclusion</h3>
<p>But diversity is no good unless it comes alongside inclusion, the new battleground for progress. “I am Chinese and female, but this won’t really tell you how I think or what my values are,” said Geraldine Yip, Regional Head, Asia Pacific, Sales Practice and Content Management, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC, in a reminder that employees need to feel comfortable sharing their views and speaking up to truly counter group think. It involves tackling unconscious bias and nurturing psychological safety whereby people feel safe to share their views.</p>
<p>One area this could manifest is a thoughtful reappraisal of the conventional corporate gathering or networking forum. Deepa Palamuttam, Director of Global Tax and Treasury Technology and Controls at Intel Corporation, still recalls early career pressure to attend happy hours and drinking sessions that conflicted with her culture and home life – the embodiment of the diversity companies seek. “I made it clear I didn’t enjoy these sessions and I have empathy with people who don’t want to network this way: while travelling and at conferences things can be different, at home it’s a different situation.” That said, she noted that the environment has changed today compared to the late 90’s and early 2000’s due to an increased focus on diversity and inclusion. Inclusion also involves consideration for those for whom English isn’t a first language, reminded Yip.</p>
<p>Measuring progress and ensuring accountability around inclusion has become a key focus at J.P. Morgan. The bank is currently exploring different ways to best assess and measure inclusive leadership that includes making managers accountable for reaching inclusion targets and tying those targets to regular managerial performance appraisals. “Inclusion is difficult to measure but we must think about what inclusive leadership looks like, find a rigour to assessing it and build accountability for inclusion. We used to talk about diversity; now we talk about diversity and inclusion,” said Livesey.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that the pandemic has also set inclusion back. It is more difficult for juniors to develop their brand, get in front of senior managers and progress their careers when everyone is working from home. Career progression depends on taking on tasks, presenting in front of senior management and meaningfully contributing, said Christine Dirringer, Head of Energy and Asset Based Structured Debt at BNP Paribas. “It is not easy to get to the top. You must differentiate yourself, build your brand and demonstrate leadership which is difficult in a COVID-distanced world,” she said.</p>
<p>Comments echoed by seasoned treasury executive Hochfeld who started a new role at State Street Global Advisors on the eve of the pandemic. “I had eight days in the office and then we were all sent home,” she said, describing the experience as not for the faint hearted. With frequent travel between London and the majority of her team in Boston on hold because of the pandemic, she has had to build relationships digitally, bereft of casual office interactions or the creativity of in-person meetings. Treasury experts cite the challenges of managing teams and reading emotional cues on Zoom, as well as the difficulty of motivating colleagues who are not self-starters as well as imbuing a diverse and inclusive corporate culture digitally.</p>
<p>Solutions to preserve inclusion include managers ensuring staff have equitable exposure to senior management. They in turn should reach out to different people and ensure it is not always the usual faces who get an opportunity to shine within treasury and the wider business. “We must ensure that juniors can get visibility with senior managers, and this sometimes requires forcing situations. For example, asking a senior leader to talk to one of the juniors on a call – it’s not an organic situation,” says BNP Paribas’s Dirringer.</p>
<h3 id=""mentorship"">Mentorship</h3>
<p>Treasury experts also note how internal mentoring and sponsorship programmes offering encouragement, support and confidence building can help boost inclusion. Important given the reality of the cut and thrust of corporate life often involves breaking cultural taboos and speaking up over tricky issues like salary levels. “Career success has involved breaking free from the way I was raised,” explains Johnson Matthey’s Coultress. “It was only after a number of years I realised you have to be loud and confident to be seen as able to lead.”</p>
<p>Intel’s Palamuttam broke social taboos by studying engineering in the late 80’s, unusual for women in India at the time. Next, she had to learn to voice her opinion in the workplace. “It took some time to get used to speaking up,” she said, recalling how in many meetings she didn’t think it was her place to speak up. “Now I am told I am too direct,” she joked. Similarly, she has only grown comfortable networking since she began viewing it like building her own social circle. “I tell this to the people I mentor, and I hope it becomes a tool to help,” she says.</p>
<p>Treasury is more multicultural than other finance professions and attracts more women than other sectors of the industry like the trading floor. As the diversity gap gradually closes with recruitment schemes, mentorship and real corporate change, the focus has switched to inclusion.

Diversity and inclusion: as important as financial performance,"


<p><em>During a virtual Leaders’ Workshop “Inclusion in Action” supported by J.P. Morgan, panellists discussed the importance of mentors and role models, tying inclusion and diversity progress to performance targets, and the importance of managing inclusion in real-time.

<h4 id=""giving-back"">Giving back</h4>
<p>When Rosanna Summerville, Manager Global Transaction Banking &amp; Processes at Unilever joined the consumer goods company 25 years ago, diversity and inclusion weren’t really on the radar. “There was no awareness of this topic,” she recalled.</p>
<p>However, for the last ten years Unilever has been actively driving diversity and inclusion and has achieved gender parity in management roles across the company and within the finance function. Now the focus has turned to close any remaining gaps at senior executive levels too. “We are not there yet, but we will get there,” she enthused, noting how Unilever’s own action on diversity and inclusion mirrors diversity becoming more prevalent across corporate treasury in general.</p>
<p>Rosanna explained to delegates how the absence of women in treasury motivated her to speak on diversity platforms and become a role model for others. “I never imagined that I would do this,” she admitted.  These sentiments were echoed by fellow panellist Alison Livesey, Managing Director, Wholesale Payments, EMEA at J.P. Morgan, who explained that despite a varied early career, she also often found herself the only woman in the room. “I struggled to find role models,” she said. Cue her ambition to also use her experience to boost diversity and encourage others. “Sponsorship has been key to my career progression, and I want to give back,” she said.</p>
<h4 id=""inclusion-and-belonging"">Inclusion and belonging</h4>
<p>Although both panellists agreed diversity has improved, they said measuring progress and ensuring accountability around inclusion is more challenging. It is a focus for J.P. Morgan, which is currently working on how best to assess and measure inclusive leadership via promoting teamwork and fostering an open environment. Alison also spoke about the importance of making leaders accountable for reaching inclusion targets, suggesting inclusion needed to be tied to performance. “We must think about what inclusive leadership looks like and find a rigour to assessing it,” she said. “It has also got to run through the organisation. We have amazing inclusive leadership at the top, but we’ve got to make sure that it exists at every level. We used to talk about diversity, now we talk about diversity and inclusion.”</p>
<p>Ways to measure inclusion could include feedback and understanding why people decide to leave a company, and actively ensuring everyone’s voice is heard, she suggested. Regarding tying inclusion targets to performance, she said inclusion had to be pulled into regular performance appraisals rather than singled out at year-end: it needs managerial rigour in real-time. “It is incredibly important to us,” she said.</p>
<h4 id=""advice-to-others"">Advice to others</h4>
<p>Offering key advice to other women working in treasury, Rosanna urged delegates to “try new things,” and grab opportunities such as working abroad. She advised on the importance of a “development plan” and seeking a mentor - something she missed out on. Finally, she espoused the benefits of participating and speaking on platforms that celebrate diversity. </p>
<p>However, panellists reflected on how the pandemic and enduring economic crisis also poses a threat to diversity and inclusion. For example, new employees working from home don’t have existing networks to fall back on. “We need to reach newer people to make sure they are supported,” said Alison. She also counselled on the importance of equitable exposure to senior managers, who should reach out to different people and ensure it is not always the usual faces who get an opportunity “to shine.” She also flagged that the ongoing crisis has left people increasingly tired and stressed, requiring leadership. “We must make sure we are alive to this and show compassionate leadership and emotional intelligence,” she said.</p>
<p>Alison also noted that inclusion and diversity within a company is not something that “one person can fix.” Rather, it demands broad-based cultural change. At Unilever – where Rosanna noted diversity and inclusion is passionately supported by top leadership including the CEO – some of the company-wide cultural focus has been on tackling unconscious bias and nurturing psychological safety whereby people feel safe to share their views and bring their authentic selves to work.</p>
<h4 id=""public-to-private"">Public to private</h4>
<p>Next, Simone Coultress, Treasury Manager, Johnson Matthey, recounted the challenges and lack of support she faced moving from a public sector management accounting role for a local authority to a private sector treasury role before joining Johnson Matthey, where she now manages the treasury back office. However, she noted that the public sector felt more diverse, recalling that her CFO was a Black woman who made her feel “if she worked hard enough, it was possible.” She also noted the strides Johnson Matthey is taking around diversity and inclusion focused on recruitment and career development of black employees, among other under-represented groups.</p>
<p>Simone also shared her personal belief that her career success has involved breaking free from the way she was raised, where she was always told to “keep her head down.” She added: “These aren’t the skills that are associated with leadership; you have to be loud and confident. These are the traits that are rightly, or wrongly, associated with leaders.”</p>
<p>She noted that a mentor would have helped her build confidence and perform in the workplace and urged delegates to take risks, make and thereby learn from mistakes and most importantly, speak up. “No one is going to tap you on the shoulder and say you are a leader. It doesn’t happen like that.”</p>
<h4 id=""men-on-side"">Men on side</h4>
<p>Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer at Ferguson plc, agreed that diversity and inclusion has only become centre stage in recent years but that it is now firmly on the agenda.</p>
<p>“For all companies, success lies in making diversity an organisation-wide initiative,” he said. 
He also reiterated that creating true gender parity will require participation by both men and women, with the involvement of men in particular being crucial to generate progress. He urges other men to step up and become actively involved in promoting diversity.</p>
<p>His passion for diversity and inclusion is sparked as a father of two daughters; he wants to create a more equitable world in which they can thrive and achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>In his view, we need to be adept at seeing and hearing differences in order to reap the benefits of diversity (to achieve greater performance and innovation). Therefore, he has encouraged mentorship, support and networking.</p><br/>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>The treasury’s evolving role and the impact of the pandemic on team engagement were key areas of focus in the latest Future Treasurer roundtable, hosted by Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>Opening the event, Sophie Jackson, Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content at Treasury Today Group, spoke about the silver linings of the pandemic, including the way people are willing to offer their advice, guidance and time at a moment when they are under great pressure. She also cited the “newly enlightened conversations” organisations are now having in light of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>Kim Hochfeld, Global Head of Cash at State Street Global Advisors, explained how the firm has expanded its focus since launching the Fearless Girl campaign three years ago to include both racial and ethnic diversity. She added that as an activist shareholder, State Street Global Advisors is now applying pressure to companies on this topic, just as it has on gender.</p>
<h4 id=""evolving-role-of-the-treasurer"">Evolving role of the treasurer</h4>
<p>Next up was a thought-provoking discussion with Susan Gaughan, MD, Prime Services Clearing Collateral Management at Societe Generale, and David Deranek, Director of Treasury, Enterprise Treasury Operations at BlueCross and BlueShield, a division of HCSC.</p>
<p>Speaking about the evolving role of the treasurer, Deranek explained how he has seen treasury change during his career. “The greatest opportunity for somebody working in treasury is moving from a reactive to a proactive force in the organisation,” he commented. “This comes from an understanding of what treasury really does – and that’s drive value in the organisation.”</p>
<p>He explained that reaching this point takes a number of steps, from achieving efficiency through the use of suitable tools and policies to developing better financial controls “Treasury can then take a third step, which is to become more proactive, gaining greater visibility into financial data,” he added, noting that the three steps “enable treasury to better understand the value it has to offer the organisation, and then be more proactive in delivering value.”</p>
<p>Next, Gaughan talked about the evolution of her own role, with a particular focus on the importance of mentorship. “Mentors have always been important for my development for many reasons,” she said, adding that these include providing advice, expanding her professional network and acting as a sounding board, as well as encouraging her to “reach up”. 
</p>
<p>Even more important, she said, is the role of the sponsor – namely “an executive or senior manager within your organisation who advocates on your behalf for promotions or new job opportunities you may not even know about – I would almost call them your campaign manager.”</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-unconscious-bias"">Understanding unconscious bias</h4>
<p>Turning to the topic of diversity and inclusion, Gaughan observed that there is still room for improvement, particularly where inclusion is concerned. She commented that this needs to be a long-term commitment from top management, including initiatives such as unconscious bias training.</p>
<p>Deranek said that his organisation has adopted a department diversity and inclusion goal for treasury – and that the team has proactively explored the issue of unconscious bias as part of this.</p>
<p>“Everyone instinctively categorises people based on how they look, their gender, their education level, their accent – maybe even their social status and so on – and assign them assumed traits, which is very unfair,” he said. As such, “we realised we needed to become more aware that we’re being influenced by bias.”</p>
<h4 id=""impact-of-the-pandemic"">Impact of the pandemic</h4>
<p>Focusing on the pandemic, Gaughan described her experience of shifting to a remote working environment, and the importance of technology in enabling the team to stay in close communication.</p>
<p>“My takeaway so far from 2020 is to really sit down and understand what is a want, versus a need,” she said. While concluding that few things really count as ‘needs’, she noted that many people don’t have their basic needs met. As such, she underlined the importance of coming together as a society to correct the inequalities that exist today.</p>
<p>Deranek, meanwhile, said that HCSC has long been proactive about the issue of business continuity, with treasury identified as a key area that would need to be up and running in the case of an interruption. Treasury staff were therefore already in the habit of working once or twice a week from home by the time the pandemic hit – “so it was rather seamless.” </p>
<h4 id=""impact-of-the-new-normal"">Impact of the ‘new normal’</h4>
<p>Moving on from the discussion, Treasury Today’s Jackson invited attendees to move into virtual breakout rooms to discuss the impact that working from home is having on the topics of diversity, inclusion and female representation.</p>
<p>One theme that emerged was the impact of home working on people’s ability to build connections. One participant said that she had built more connections within the businesses as a result of home working. But another noted that while her organisation is still holding diversity and inclusion events, the virtual nature of those events means that it is no longer possible to have impromptu conversations afterwards with other attendees.</p>
<p>In the second breakout session, participants discussed the importance of motivating teams and managing productivity in the current challenging environment. One observation was that in the first couple of months, the focus had been on tackling challenges on a day-by-day basis. But now, with people looking at remote working as a longer-term situation, they are being more creative in finding ways to keep teams engaged, from virtual cookery classes to ‘walk and talk’ meetings.</p>
<p>In closing the event, Kevin Zimmerman, Head of US Cash, Direct Channel at State Street Global Advisors, encouraged participants to take any actionable items they had heard back to their own organisations, and to use the insights they had heard to further their own personal development journeys.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>The Future Treasurer roundtable event series is one of many new digital interactive events that the Treasury Today Group has been hosting in 2020. The Future Treasurer builds on the work that we have done together with State Street Global Advisors to provide a roadmap for future best practice in the industry. These events incorporate inclusion and diversity conversations with a hard look at future skill sets, leadership, sustainability and more. The first roundtable took place earlier this summer with our community around the Greater New York City area and it was then our privilege to return to our treasury community on the West Coast. It was a rare chance for our West Coast community to come together after facing the challenges posed both by the pandemic and the ongoing California fires. We are very grateful to our co-hosts, our panellists and to our community for taking the time out of their busy schedules to grab a GrubHub lunch at home and join us to discuss how inclusion and new skill sets in treasury have shifted in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>The day opened with a welcome from Sophie Jackson and Meg Coates.  Kevin Zimmerman then outlined the background on the partnership between State Street Global Advisors and the Treasury Today Group. The energy and enthusiasm was evident as our guests digitally interacted with each other in break-out rooms before the panel discussion.</p>
<p>Our phenomenal panellists who shared their insights on the day were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-bebb-29280a/"">Donna Bebb</a>, Head of Global Credit Management, Google</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynjhansen/"">Carolyn Hansen</a>, Global Head of Treasury, Uber</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethkwong/"">Elizabeth Kwong</a>, Assistant Treasurer, Autodesk</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Carolyn Hansen spoke about her background in finance, her experiences in treasury and the events leading up to her current role at Uber. Carolyn also highlighted the importance of such events when explaining how earlier on in her career there were very few instances where she would see anybody in the industry who looked like her. The importance of communities, such as those we have created with the Future Treasurer series, in terms of representation and inspiration cannot be underestimated. Donna Bebb spoke about her fascinating background and varying experiences which led to her arrival at Google. All three panellists shared the humbling experiences of the past six months of working from home and their personal passion for inclusion and diversity. Carolyn also discussed her team’s use of virtual games and icebreakers to keep engaged and connected during remote working.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Kwong shared her experiences of moving with a role at Goldman Sachs to Tokyo, Japan. Coming to understand a different culture, language and navigating a new city takes professionals out of their comfort zone and forces them to consider completely different perspectives and cultural viewpoints than they would ever have experienced otherwise. This appreciation of the limitations of our perspective is a critical piece of the inclusion puzzle as we learn to walk in another’s shoes and consider positions outside of our own life experiences.</p>
<p>All three panellists spoke of their passionate support for female representation, inclusion in all forms and of the broad conversation around ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) issues, affecting corporations. After a career involving managing assets in the oil and gas sector and a period dedicated to academic research, Donna was surprised to be approached with a professional opportunity dedicated to the returns of sustainable financing. However, it was her very experience and focus that was sought after in what was then a nascent financial arena. Donna’s early work on green financing and sustainability were explored as she talked about what we mean when we say, ‘ESG’. Over the eight years that Donna has been involved in sustainable financing she has seen a great rise in awareness of such terms and ideas. She spoke of her concerns that these terms are used so widely and with such varying intent and meaning that they can cease to have impact or value as they sweep into the lexicon, destined to impart no significance. It therefore becomes incumbent upon us all to apply value to such terms, to learn within the industry about the true meaning of these ideas and to protect and uphold the intent of the ideology.</p>
<p>Carolyn and Elizabeth both talked through the rise of the strategic treasurer in recent times and the new suite of skills, which are prioritised in our modern industry. The Future Treasurer title was chosen to highlight the new and evolving key elements of a treasurer’s role. Both in terms of the practical skills required of treasurers and the leadership skills that the present and future demand, one theme was clear for them both, which was to expect the unexpected. The pace and adaptability of modern corporate finance is here to stay.</p>
<p>Flexibility and intellectual curiosity were highlighted as key attributes of the modern treasurer by Elizabeth and Carolyn as they spoke of their professional journeys in the industry. Donna also shared her advice on avoiding short-term optimisation and embracing skill sets and pursuits outside of work that can bring us additional resources and conviction. In her case, taking up extracurricular classes led to a new professional tool, helping her to develop confidence and presence. We never know where new opportunities and challenges may take us and that uncertainty and open approach can be incredibly rewarding in ways which we never imagined.</p>
<p>Attendees on the day were polled on the importance of ESG issues for their companies. We also divided into smaller groups to discuss topics including the challenges and the influence of working from home on issues like diversity, inclusion and female representation. Our West Coast community’s conversation consisted of troubleshooting issues that their peers were facing whilst looking more broadly at the impact on long-term targets for inclusion and diverse representation of the global pandemic. Attendees focused on their personal and professional challenges, offering advice on leadership while remote working. Maintaining the ability to galvanise and keep their teams motivated while managing productivity were also issues that our West Coast community discussed between each other.</p>
<p>Kevin closed the day, outlining his thoughts on the impact of the communities that have been created across the world in partnership with Treasury Today. Our new virtual events are a powerful tool to ensure that our community maintains connectivity and can support and inspire one another even at a distance.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Our community across the world is discovering what it means to work from home and communicate virtually. We are also observing the impact that the global pandemic will have on progress with inclusion, diversity and general ESG issues for corporations across the world.</p>
<h4 id=""diversity-is"">Diversity is…</h4>
<p>Coming from an academic background that included a History of Art BA, Kim Hochfeld, Managing Director and Global Head of Cash at State Street Global Advisors, moved across the world to start her role in finance. Her degree’s focus on creative thinking and independent analysis along with  her academic and broad cultural experiences give her a fresh perspective and a collaborative leadership style.</p>
<p>Hochfeld today urges younger people to study a subject that is interesting to them and that they have a passion for. “Don’t study a subject because you feel you ought to; your route forward will be your enthusiasm for learning and ability to shine in whatever you do.”</p>
<p>Although initially focused on having a career on Wall Street, Lynda McGoey graduated into a year of hiring freezes. Challenging herself to deviate from the original plan, she took on a corporate treasury role and seized every opportunity it gave her to learn. Flexibility has been a key element in Lynda’s career approach and has helped lead her to her current role as Managing Director and Global Head of Trade Finance GE.</p>
<p>McGoey has worked on many innovative and pioneering treasury projects over the course of her years at GE. Speaking about what she had learnt whilst honing her future treasury skillsets on these projects, she stated “it’s important to go in with your eyes open.” Processes may be settled, she explained, but that doesn’t mean they cannot benefit from fresh thinking. The most junior person on the team can shine new light on old ways. Successful leadership, she explained, is about “acting with humility.” It’s a continuous lesson in listening and learning from diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>Exposure to as many different experiences as possible is part of Hochfeld’s modus operandi. She also echoed McGoey’s focus on humility. Working in a second language and operating in different cultures led to a considered and humble approach to communication and leadership. Her global roles have exposed different business cultures and practices, “I hope it’s made me more conscious of cultural and linguistic differences.” It’s vital, she added, to give people the space to contribute, in order to draw the best out of them; only this way will the strictures of group-think be removed.</p>
<h4 id=""progress"">Progress</h4>
<p>Against a backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement gaining pace and impact across the globe, our panel and audience discussed support for this progress and highlighted the imperative need for inclusion to be a priority for all future business leaders. The conversation has widened to future corporate best practices which put inclusion and innovation at the forefront and proactively encourage equality.</p>
<p>Hochfeld discussed the changes she has seen to the diversity and inclusion movement over her career span. Her previous, early experience of chairing a women’s network at a bank, Hochfeld likened to a Sisyphean task. “Five years later, the same ideas and dialogue were only just gaining traction,” she noted. Despite the frustrations of such slow progress, the evolution of the conversation from both inside the industry and in society at large has been encouraging.</p>
<p>“Over the course of my career, I have definitely witnessed a shift,” explained McGoey.  She shared the evolution of female representation for her from early days as one of the only women  working in the then-male dominated trading space to today when both GE’s Treasurer and CFO are women.  “But clearly the conversation must continue.”</p>
<p>As State Street Global Advisor’s CEO, Cyrus Taraporevala, declared their commitment to “investing responsibly to enable economic prosperity and social progress”, Hochfeld explained how State Street Global Advisors, as a major asset holder, uses its voting power to drive real change.</p>
<h4 id=""wider-view"">Wider view</h4>
<p>This first, digitally delivered roundtable event saw virtual breakout rooms focused on the challenges faced by our group of corporate treasurers during the pandemic. They were also asked to consider the impact that they believe this may have on existing conversations around female representation and diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Between discussion sessions, the group was polled on the issues most important to them, the challenges they were facing and their future outlook. The overall picture was a strong consensus towards inclusive workplaces, strong representation across social groups and a radical workplace shift that will see a permanent reframing of remote working with increased adoption of technology.</p>
<p>The individuality of peoples’ situations will greatly affect their experiences. For many, the simple logistics of not commuting, for example, now enable more family time and domestic role-sharing. For other family households there may be an overwhelming barrage of demands. However, for single households, managing loneliness and staying positive and motivated may be much more challenging. However, managing the pressure of the domestic environment, both from a ‘house full’ and ‘house empty’ perspective, was acknowledged by others. The lack of balance at home and the psychological tension of not being able to leave your working environment is a challenge for many and should be recognised by leaders and co-workers.</p>
<p>Missing the casual interactions of the office was also brought up by one group. With the post-meeting chats that often build bridges having ceased, homeworking has forced teams to restructure and coordinate more personal catch up discussions to maintain team ties.</p>
<p>A topic raised by attendees was the sheer value of two-way communication, and their realisation over the past few months of its profound significance in our personal and professional lives. Working from home can diminish the communicative power of learning through proximity whereas informal chats and casual conversations can prove invaluable.</p>
<p>Of course, concluded McGoey, constant access to multiple sources of information is essential for rapid re-prioritisation, critical during the pandemic. Lynda McGoey, Kim Hochfeld and our community signing in from their homes across the New York City greater area helped to create a vision of a future roadmap. The map avoids herd mentality and focuses on expanding mindsets and skillsets. It involves intellectually curious, open minded and strategic treasurers who will thrive in the future of corporate finance.</p>
