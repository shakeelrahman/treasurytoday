<h5>Erik Seifert, Head of Cash Management Sales, Nordea Sweden:</h5>
<p>The depths of winter in Stockholm is certainly not the best time of year to entice customers out of self-imposed office hibernation and into the city for a treasury seminar. But in January 2017, the topic we presented to our corporate customers saw a record number of treasurers and CFOs in attendance to hear about the latest developments in payments and what the future payment landscape might look like.</p>
<p>And yes, over the last 12 months we have seen consistent and perhaps even increased interest from treasury in a range of topics such as working capital management, compliance, automation/digitalisation in the treasury mid- and back-office and the new strategic demands of the treasury at C-suite level and in achieving overall business goals. However, these topics have been on the agenda for quite a while and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>But if we focus on the last year, it really has been the increased speed of development in the payment space that has come to dominate the agenda. Treasurers are now faced with a multitude of payment channels, a lack of standardisation and an increasing requirement that they become the “procurement” hub in terms of digital financial infrastructure. To be successful across these areas, they need to be completely on top of the digital agenda and have a solid vision of the future payment landscape.</p>
<p>The main driver is changing consumer behaviours, where the expectation of the seamless, digital experience is moving from the high street to treasury departments. This is forcing treasurers to recognise that payments are not just the moving of funds from A to B, but rather that they have become an integral part of the experience of their own end customers. Consequently, treasurers have been forced to look at novel ways of managing payment flows and consolidating flows from a variety of different channels into one manageable stream.</p>
<p>In our recent Future of Payments survey and report, customers ranked a lack of standardisation as their greatest concern and indicated a preference for third-party and fintech solutions in payments to be delivered to them by banks, rather than having to deal with external providers. This desire for a simplified and standardised structure is something we are working towards providing and see Nordea acting as a “digital banking superstore” or one-stop-shop for customers in the future. To arrive at this point, we are working in close collaboration with our customers from idea stage through piloting and on to launch so that we co-develop solutions and new service methods that we know answer their needs and industry needs.</p>
<p>This year, for instance, we launched an automated hedging solution, AutoFX, that came about when we were approached by a customer with a specific need. We then involved a small group of other customers as we developed and piloted the solution before full release. Then, in terms of standardisation and delivering the optimum solution to customers in the most user-friendly way, we see Nordea as a future one-stop-shop that provides the best of home-grown, co-created and third-party solutions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, customer demands and expectations will dictate which new services are developed and integrated into the final, user-facing solution. Banks will most likely continue to become increasingly like tech and IT companies, by turning their platforms into agile plug-and-play hubs that deliver optimum, smart solutions in a one-stop-shop for customers. And that’s a future worth braving the Stockholm winter to hear.</p>

<img alt=""Julia Persson"" height=""150"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/europe/2017-05-06-tt-13-qa-bio-julia-persson-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=B6C9DB5C9CDE924D8EAE18A540CAF04E"" width=""100""/> 	</figure>
<h5>Julia Persson, Head of Cash Management, Swedbank:</h5>
<p>Like all players in the financial markets, corporate treasurers are affected by the major increase in financial regulation that has been ongoing for some time. This increase has meant that banks must invest considerable amounts in compliance, leaving them with less flexibility to meet the needs of their clients. As a result, the requirements of corporate treasurers are changing constantly; now they need to not only take care of funds but also support management in decision-making.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers can, however, benefit from the increased regulations, for example, as banks increase their transparency and it becomes easier to make informed decisions about their banking relationships. The industry is in a period of constant change; the regulatory factors driving the banks are now almost as important as shifts in the market.</p>
<p>The compliance pressure on corporates is also mounting and they are feeling increasing pressure to bring in more resources, which takes away from their core business. The situation has intensified during the past five years, and there is no reason that this will change soon. Banks now need to request more extensive documentation from their clients in order to meet the regulatory demands, and even clients operating within a single country may be asked for different types of documentation. For those operating in multiple countries, the efforts needed to ensure regulatory compliance are even greater. We see it as a “must” for banks to simplify documentation within the cash management area in order to free up resources for both themselves and their clients.</p>
<p>In addition to issues related to regulations and compliance, corporate treasurers are dealing with other challenges as well. For example, it remains difficult to fully capitalise on the implicit potential of standard payment products for Europe. Although the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) has provided a standard for EUR payments, many markets have evolved local variations or market expectations on payments. Further, non-euro countries have been slow to offer new SEPA-like payment types for their currencies. For treasurers, this means in practice that the market is almost as fragmented as it was before from an account-holding perspective, as the need for local accounts remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Another major challenge for treasurers has been how to handle the excess liquidity in a negative deposit rate environment. Those who are cash-rich have few alternatives for how to invest in the current situation. Therefore, it is important to re-evaluate investment policy and whether the excess liquidity should be used in a different way, such as increasing dividends, investing in research and development, or acquiring other businesses. Another driver for finding alternatives for excess liquidity is the Basel III regulation, which stipulates that these types of deposits are very likely to have a high outflow in a stressed scenario and makes it costlier to hold corporate excess liquidity — both for the bank and for the client.</p>
<p>In addition to these challenges, geographical strategy is at the top of the agenda for many international corporates today. Consistency within geographies is important; corporates need to know what kind of trusted partners they have in all the geographies where they are present. Here in the Nordic-Baltic region, working with an established bank with deep roots and a focus on local knowledge means that the client can be confident that the bank is a trusted, reliable partner throughout all the markets where they operate.</p>

<div class=""article-qa answer"" id=""frank-palser-director-treasury-and-trade-solutions-citi-sweden""><img alt=""Frank Palser"" height=""150"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/europe/2017-05-06-tt-13-qa-frank-palser-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=7BFF3147F27E00238FCFA12789D5CF82"" width=""100""/>
<h5>Frank Palser, Director, Treasury &amp; Trade Solutions, Citi Sweden:</h5>
<p>Twenty years ago the word ‘Scandinavian’ conjured up images of sturdy (if slightly boring) cars, seafood-heavy diets and smiling Eurovision winners. Fast forward a generation and the image has turned: homes from Vancouver to Vladivostok contain Nordic furniture, millions download music through a Scandinavian platform and property owners aspire to offer Danish ‘hygge’. And no self-respecting fiction reader or TV viewer can survive the winter without regular immersion in Nordic Noir.</p>
<p>But what about the more prosaic world of corporate treasury? Are we talking about an ‘old school’ Nordic operation – dependable but sticking to the tried and tested – or a funky Södermalm hipster leveraging the latest technology and looking to lead rather than follow? The truth lies somewhere in between – leveraging the best of both.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenges facing corporate treasurers globally have never been greater. For those in the Nordics and Baltics this is equally true – arguably more so given the stable economic and political environment which has prevailed for years. Facing the combined threats of geopolitical upheaval (sharply brought into focus by the recent Stockholm incident), negative rates, ever accelerating changes in industrial practices and consumer behaviour, it has been informative to witness how treasurers have become ever more laser-focused in their activities – whilst at the same time adaptable to external factors and opportunities. Three broad themes emerge: visibility, control and working capital management.</p>
<p>Visibility has always been at the heart of a treasurer’s armoury – as the adage goes ‘if you can’t measure it, it’s not worth doing’. But our surveys and dialogue would suggest that it is more important than ever to know where corporate cash is sitting and how it can be accessed and optimised.</p>
<p>The same can be said for control, with the emerging impact of global initiatives such as BEPS and Basel III, traditional liquidity management techniques (cash concentration and notional pooling) are under increased scrutiny by tax authorities but remain at the heart of most Nordic cash optimisation structures. And where funds cannot be pooled, corporates are actively looking to maximise their return or at least minimise cost. Tools such as dynamic discounting are now being used as a means of leveraging surplus cash and simultaneously supporting suppliers by providing access to favourable finance terms.</p>
<p>Working capital management whilst once peripheral to some treasurers is now seen as a core competency and has instigated far greater partnership between the treasurer and the underlying business. Scandinavian treasurers have long seen the benefit of corporate card programmes but are now extending these into a wider B2B context by introducing P-Card programmes. And whilst supply chain finance has been available for years, many if not most large Nordic groups now have at least one such programme in place: many opting to extend the number of finance providers to reward relationship banks and simultaneously diversify credit risk.</p>
<p>In summary, the Nordic and Baltic corporate treasurer is a far more ‘street savvy’ and adaptable operator than his or her predecessor – a business necessity rather than a style choice.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><i>The Nordic region consists of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland and the autonomous territories of Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Åland. If we then add from the northern part of central Europe the three states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, known collectively as the Baltics, we have a wider region of study that is both closely bound by history and yet individually distinct in culture. For the corporate treasurer, this can take some understanding.</i></p>
<p>First and foremost, one of the major challenges to efficient cash management in the Nordics and Baltics is the variety of currencies in use among the different countries. Until very recently, the majority of the Nordic and Baltic states remained outside of the single European currency. Now, following the accession of Latvia and Lithuania to the Eurozone, there is an equal split. These countries, however, look likely to be last from the Nordic and Baltic region to join the euro, for the foreseeable future at least. In this respect, the recent histories of these countries can be summarised as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Denmark held a referendum in 2000, the Danes rejected the European single currency by a vote of 53.2% to 46.8%. In 2007, the country declared its intention to hold a new referendum on joining the euro by 2011. However, following the uncertainty that resulted from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, these plans were postponed indefinitely and thus it remains today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finland has been a member of the euro since its inception in 1999.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iceland is ineligible to join the euro because it is not a member of the EU. The country applied to become a member of the union in July 2009 and was granted candidate status in 2010. However, in September 2013, the country decided to suspend its application to join the EU until a referendum could be held on the question. A date for the referendum has yet to be confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Norway is also ineligible to join the euro because it is not a member of the EU and it is not expected to become one in the near future. The country has twice held a referendum on membership – in 1972 and in 1994. On both occasions the proposal was defeated. The country is however part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sweden is obliged to adopt the euro at some point in the future, under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty. However, the country has so far resisted and the currency is not yet within the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), which is a precursor to euro adoption. In 2003, Sweden held a referendum on joining the euro, which was defeated. Since then, public sentiment has largely been against adopting the euro for fear that businesses will be adversely affected. The country has no official target date for euro adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estonia has been part of the EU since 2004 and became the first Baltic state to join the single currency, on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2011.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latvia joined the EU alongside Estonia. It had planned to adopt the euro in 2008, but, as a result of the financial crisis, was forced to revise its expectations as inflation rose. Despite a series of additional setbacks, Latvia was able to retain its ERM II peg post-financial crisis and finally joined the euro in January 2014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lithuania’s EU membership (also 2004) had originally seen it plan to adopt the single currency in 2007, but like Latvia, inflationary pressures delayed this. At the beginning of 2015, the country finally realised its ambition, becoming the 19<sup>th</sup> member of the currency union.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""meeting-sepa"">Meeting SEPA</h3>
<p>As more Nordic and Baltic states become members of the euro, the cash management landscape in the regions will become somewhat easier and cheaper. Likewise, the introduction of SEPA has had a significant effect on cash management in the region, simplifying payments and collections. Many domestic card schemes have also been replaced with SEPA-compliant cards.</p>
<p>Banks in all of the Nordic and Baltic countries were early adopters of SEPA and the ISO 20022 XML standard. Although Norway and Iceland do not belong to the EU, they belong to the European Economic Area (EEA) and have likewise moved to adopt SEPA and the payment services directive (PSD) and will presumably move to PSD2 when that is finally transposed by all into national law no later than January 2018. Of all the SEPA countries, Finland is the most advanced. In fact, Finland was one of the first countries to boast full SEPA compliance, becoming 100% SEPA-ready in 2011.</p>
<p>Indeed, given the generally advanced digital status of countries in the region, SEPA is largely viewed by the Nordic and Baltic banks as a stepping-stone to further innovation in the transaction banking space. Consolidation in the payments space has also been driven by the introduction of SEPA, with the Nordic payments group, Nets, launched in September 2010, acting as a means of connecting banks, businesses, the public sector, merchants and consumers via its network. Its corporate services activity provides a payment platform and real-time clearing for recurring bills and credit transfers, mainly in Denmark and Norway.</p>
<p>From a wider corporate treasury point of view, as in other regions, SEPA has facilitated central treasury management and enabled companies to consider payment factories and/or shared service centres more readily. Companies have also been able to consolidate euro bank accounts, centralising accounting and simplifying processes, thereby realising significant cost savings.</p>
<p>Harmonisation between the payments infrastructures of euro and non-euro countries across the Nordic region has been on the agenda in recent years. One initiative which has focused on this objective is the Nordic Payments Area (NPA), a scheme that would have involved the harmonisation of payments standards and infrastructures across Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland using ISO 20022 XML. The ultimate vision was to create an area, like SEPA, in which businesses and consumers could connect and make payments to one another across any NPA country, regardless of currency. To date, very little progress has been made on this initiative. However, discussions between countries around payments infrastructure standardisation and harmonisation are nevertheless continuing.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-pooling-and-concentration"">Cash pooling and concentration</h3>
<p>Cash pooling is well-established among the larger and more sophisticated companies of the Nordic region but is not quite as common among smaller companies, or in the Baltic states. With all three Baltic states now members of the Eurozone, uptake of cash pooling is expected to accelerate amongst corporates in the years ahead.</p>
<p>In general, the types of pooling structure available mirror those elsewhere, with one exception, single legal account pooling, described below. Otherwise, the standard physical cash concentration structures of zero balancing, sweeping and topping are available, as well as notional pooling.</p>
<p>However, while notional pooling is permissible in all Nordic and Baltic countries, it is not widely offered because local restrictions prevent the banks from offsetting credit and debit balances for capital adequacy purposes. Notional pooling is therefore relatively expensive in the region because banks charge a spread on the balances offset to compensate for the cost of capital.</p>
<p>Due to the cost and restricted nature of notional pooling in the Nordic and Baltic regions, physical cash pooling is often a more attractive option. It is important to note however that the pooling solutions on offer will vary between banks and between corporates (depending on needs and legal set-up) the following information only provides an indication of the type of solutions available. When considering cash pooling options in the region, it is vital to research each bank’s offering thoroughly.</p>
<p>Be aware that the terminology surrounding cash pooling will also alter between countries and between banks. In Sweden for example, single legal account pooling is sometimes referred to as ‘KoncernKonto’. In Estonia, a cross-border cash pool is often called a ‘Group Account’. Professional advice should also be sought regarding the legal and tax implications of any cash pooling structure.</p>
<p>Once the company’s cash has been effectively pooled, any surplus can either be reinvested into the company to minimise external borrowing, or invested for profit.</p>
<h3 id=""nordic-pooling"">Nordic pooling</h3>
<p>Also known as ‘balance netting’ or ‘Nordic cash pooling,’ single legal account pooling is the solution most commonly used by Nordic companies and their subsidiaries in the region (the subsidiaries of MNCs from outside the region may prefer to use conventional zero-balancing).</p>
<p>In this form of cash pooling, a company opens a single master account with its bank. It also maintains ‘mirror’ accounts for the different entities within the pool, in order for them to keep their separate balances. These are not physical bank accounts with a legal existence, they are simply entries in a virtual ledger. The only legal account held by the company is the master account.</p>
<p>No physical transfer of funds occurs between the master and the mirror accounts. The company’s divisions use the mirror accounts as normal accounts, as if they were not part of a cash pool. The cash flows into and out of the mirror accounts which are then adjusted and recorded in the balance of the master account. Both overdrafts and interest can only apply to the master account.</p>
<p>Nordic cash pooling by and large remains the dominant form of cash pooling since its inception in the 1980s. However, with more and more of the large corporates using sophisticated ERP systems to do in-house reconciliations, many have implemented a zero-balancing cash pool as they can keep track of their internal debts and claims in those systems, rather than in the Nordic cash pool.</p>
<p>This type of pooling arrangement has its advantages. For example, since it is compatible with the payment factory concept, corporates who use a Nordic pooling solution can reduce the need to execute complex payment/collection-on-behalf-of (POBO/COBO) procedures.</p>
<h3 id=""cross-border-pooling"">Cross-border pooling</h3>
<p>It is usual to pool a company’s cash in each country by currency initially. Once local pools have been set up, cash can then be further concentrated using a regional cash pool. Solutions across the Nordic-Baltic region are also available, usually on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3 id=""cross-border-interest-compensation"">Cross-border interest compensation</h3>
<p>As an alternative to a physical cross-border pool, companies can ask their banks to set up a cross-border interest compensation structure in order to enjoy the benefits of a cash pool without actually creating one. This is a limited form of notional pooling which allows for a partial offset of interest for balances in different countries and currencies, despite the capital adequacy rules.</p>
<p>In this type of arrangement, the bank takes into account the balance of all the domestic cash pools and then pays interest as if the accounts were pooled. This avoids any need to translate cash balances into a common currency, which can be very useful given the number of currencies in the Nordic and Baltic region.</p>
<p>Although similar to notional pooling, interest compensation differs in that a different approach is taken in calculating the interest due. The bank applies improved interest rates – higher credit rates and lower debit rates – to the participating account balances, based on the offset between the credit and debit balances of the participating accounts.</p>
<p>Interest compensation set-ups are generally more popular in the Baltic countries than physical cross-border pooling arrangements. Again, this may change as Latvia and Lithuania join Estonia in adopting the euro.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management-banks"">Cash management banks</h3>
<p>Aside from the practicalities of cash management in the region, choosing the right bank or banks to work with is of course a major consideration. Many so-called ‘global’ banks do not have significant on-the-ground presence in the Nordics and Baltics, where local and regional banking groups (predominantly Nordic) dominate. In the early 2000s, there was a lot of focus from global banks on building a presence in the region, but their efforts diminished following the onset of the financial crisis. For this reason, companies looking to do business in the region may find that their needs are best answered through establishing a local relationship.</p>
<p>The major cash management banks in the region include, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Danske Bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nordea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swedbank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""residency-restrictions-for-cash-pooling"">Residency restrictions for cash pooling</h3>
<p>When considering setting up a cash pool in the Nordic-Baltic region, note that the ownership of bank accounts can have an effect on the company’s cash pooling structure, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Denmark</h5>
<p>Both residents and non-residents are allowed to participate in cash pooling. However, restrictions apply to intercompany lending to parent companies outside the EEA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Estonia</h5>
<p>Both residents and non-residents are allowed to participate in cash pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Finland</h5>
<p>Finland allows both resident and non-resident accounts to participate in cash concentration but some restrictions apply when setting up arrangements that include non-resident companies. Legal advice should be sought regarding these restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Iceland</h5>
<p>All transactions between resident and non-resident accounts need to be reported on a monthly basis to the central bank. Further information should be sought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Latvia</h5>
<p>Both residents and non-residents are allowed to participate in cash pooling. However, since Latvian banks are not permitted to offset net credit and debit balances on their balance sheets, notional pools can be expensive to operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Lithuania</h5>
<p>Both residents and non-residents are allowed to participate in cash pooling. For the same reasons as cited for Latvia, notional pools can be expensive to operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Norway</h5>
<p>The combination of resident and non-resident accounts in a domestic cash concentration structure is subject to lending rules. Restrictions apply on inter-company lending in cross-border cash concentration structures, so including non-resident accounts can be challenging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Sweden</h5>
<p>Cash pooling can involve both resident and non-resident accounts, with the approval of the central bank. There are however restrictions on intercompany lending to non-EEA parent companies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, aside from residency restrictions, close attention should be paid to each country’s thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules.</p>
<h3 id=""innovation-and-co-operation"">Innovation and co-operation</h3>
<p>Given that the market is dominated by a handful of large banking groups, there is a high degree of uniformity in the cash management products and services on offer across the region. Nevertheless, the Nordic banks are always looking for new ways to assist their clients in achieving greater cash management efficiencies. For example, since the introduction of SEPA, a growing number of Nordic banks have been phasing out their current direct debit solutions in favour of an automatic e-invoice standing order, a recurring e-invoice process.</p>
<p>The treasury technology vendors in the Nordic and Baltic regions are largely the same vendors that capture the market across Europe and, in the case of the top two TMS vendors (SunGard and Wall Street Systems), most of the rest of the world. However, some focus on regional delivery, such as Swedish TMS provider, CRM, and Finnish IT services company, Tieto (although both of these companies do venture beyond their home markets).</p>
<p>The nuances of the region mean some vendors have created country-specific services – Euroclear, for example, has established national Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) in Sweden and Finland to meet domestic post-trade handling requirements.</p>
<p>Co-operation is a recurring theme in the Nordic and Baltic markets. This attitude is reflected in the pro-business environment that the countries embrace. According to the Doing Business 2016 ranking compiled by the World Bank, all the countries of the Nordic-Baltic region are ranked in the top 25 globally, with Denmark third and Norway, Finland and Sweden in the top ten.</p>
<p>In short, the Nordic and Baltic countries are linked by common cultural, historical, political and economic ties, together with common interests to ensure stability, security and welfare in the region and further afield. It is a region that may push into the furthest reaches of Northern Europe but it is clearly very much in touch with the rest of the world.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>During a briefing in the country’s capital at the end of 2015, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, Mehmet Simsek, reported a rise in that year’s growth forecast to 4% from the earlier 3%. Citing economic “momentum” and domestic political stability, Simsek added that the government expect annual GDP expansion will reach 5% in 2017 and 2018. Fast-forward to May of this year and Standard &amp; Poor’s had revised Turkey’s credit rating to stable from negative. The firm also evidently recognises the Turkish economy’s resilience in the face of global and local threats to the country’s stability.</p>
<h3 id=""making-an-impression"">Making an impression</h3>
<p>These recent signals add to an ever-growing list of Turkey’s achievements in recent years. GDP has increased from US$230bn in 2002 to US$799bn in 2014 and in the same given period, GDP per capita rose from US$3,492 to US$10,395. Turkey represents the 16<sup>th</sup> largest economy in the world and has been expanding its reach; exports totalled US$158bn at the end of 2014.</p>
<p>There is a unique set of factors working in the country’s favour – for example, Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, is also the largest city in Europe. It is the only city stretching across two continents and over 50 countries from three continents are within a four hour plane journey. But the country doesn’t rest on its laurels; Turkey’s economic performance is recognised as an example for other emerging markets. A recent World Bank report, titled ‘Turkey’s transitions’, explores the country’s transition from lower to higher middle income in order to share learnings with interested developing countries. In terms of what has driven Turkey’s economic progress, the country’s “economic integration into global markets and among advanced and less developed regions in Turkey” was identified by the report.</p>
<p>This development and integration, of course, is also of interest to those who do, or wish to do, business in the country. According to the Central Bank of Turkey, foreign direct investment (FDI) into Turkey reached US$16.5bn in 2015 at a growth rate of 32% from the previous year. In 2015, the country attained the highest ever annual FDI since the global financial crisis with the monthly average exceeding US$1bn.</p>
<p>The country’s currency, the lira, however, could be cause for concern. It is one of the key emerging market currencies that comes under pressure as a result of market events – the Federal Reserve raising interest rates again, for example. No country is without its challenges, though, and the outlook, in general, is very promising. For example, the Investment Support and Promotion Agency noted the country’s attractiveness to foreign investors is likely to increase further with the realisation of a number of reforms, which have been defined in the 64<sup>th</sup> Action Plan – a government reform with numerous incentives for the private sector to flourish. Support for students and graduates, interest-free loans for entrepreneurs, and rural development incentives, for example.</p>
<p>In a 2014 report prepared in collaboration with the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEİK), Deloitte identified three major opportunities available for foreign investors planning to invest in Turkey:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The stable and continuous growth of the Turkish economy, with the goal of becoming one of the top ten economies in the world by 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its strategic location with strong historic and cultural links that would afford investors access to the whole Middle East market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A favourable demographic distribution of the population with a very high ratio of young people.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, the country’s location drives a noteworthy trend, says Soyer Ersoy, Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC Turkey. “Many corporates decide to make Turkey their regional treasury hub to cover the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions.”</p>
<p>Treasury in the country, in general, is strategic, collaborates with the businesses it serves and is using automation and treasury centres of excellence to consolidate and standardise finance and accounting activities, he adds. “Mostly, treasury departments are very mature and centralised, consisting of former bankers and treasurers with experience globally and locally.”</p>
<h3 id=""supporting-corporate-growth"">Supporting corporate growth</h3>
<p>Against this promising backdrop, all eyes are on the country’s future. For treasurers wishing to operate in Turkey, a strong banking group to support the company’s activities will be a necessity. HSBC has been present in Turkey since 1990 and in February this year, the bank announced its commitment to the Turkish market. HSBC was amongst the banks that weathered a radical macro and financial sector adjustment programme, implemented in the aftermath of the 1999-2001 financial crises in Turkey. The Banking Sector Restructuring Program is largely credited for the turnaround of fortunes for Turkey’s banks. Banking legislation was also adjusted in accordance with the relevant international regulations and the European Union (EU) banking directives.</p>
<p>“Now, the banking sector in Turkey enjoys a leading position in the world with an ever-growing asset size and strong equity structure, protecting it against shocks that may arise from loans or turbulent market conditions. This strong equity structure enabled Turkish banks to weather the storm well during the liquidity crisis in 2008,” says Ersoy.</p>
<p>The Turkish banking industry is highly developed and competitive. There are 47 local, international and participation banks in Turkey, according to The Banks Association of Turkey in May 2016. “International banks bring with them new technologies and risk management techniques, funds for the banks in need, regulations which can reduce the amount of financial capital that may flee the country in times of crisis and continued lending following shocks that could have a negative effect on the local banking sector,” says Ersoy.</p>
<p>In terms of regulation, the sector is well-regulated. All local and international banks are monitored and governed by two primary regulatory authorities: the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) and the Central Bank of Republic of Turkey (CBRT).</p>
<h3 id=""payment-instruments"">Payment instruments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cash is mainly used for low-value retail and commercial transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit transfers are used for high value payment transactions. All credit transfers are automated and can be initiated via bank branch, ATM, telephone, mobile or online. Please also note that there are no low value payments in Turkey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct debits. Although direct debits are not widely used, they are available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheques are mainly used for large-value commercial payments. The use of cheques in Turkey can cause operational issues – although the use is declining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Card payments. The use of card payments has increased rapidly in recent years; there were 57m credit cards and 105.5m debit cards in circulation at the end of 2014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electronic banking is also available from all of the country’s commercial banks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From a global liquidity and cash management perspective, internet and mobile banking users increased by 34m in 2014, representing a 300% increase from 2009, according to the Turkish Banking Association. Therefore, there is “much demand for technology to grow and innovation is highly appreciated by corporate banking clients”, says Ersoy.</p>
<p>As banks continue to heavily invest in high-tech and user-friendly solutions, HSBC’s Global Liquidity &amp; Cash Management Team (GL&amp;CM) in Turkey prides itself on innovation. For instance, HSBC launched a Virtual Account solution last year in Turkey that “has been welcomed by the market”, says Ersoy. The solution allows identification of payer information attached to collection to facilitate the reconciliation process and achieve timely management reporting, and can be managed by HSBC or an ERP.</p>
<p>The GL&amp;CM team offers an enriched proposition with a fully aligned cash management, liquidity management and cards proposition to the Turkish market. As a direct member of all local collection and payment systems, HSBC Turkey provides a full range of payments and cash management products and services. The local sales team also provide a consultative approach to support connectivity and SWIFT solutions.</p>
<p>According to Ersoy, the banks’ services are a recognition of the fact that the same online banking tools popular with international corporate clients, such as FX treasury tools and/or efficient customs tax payments online tools, are also very important for local customers in Turkey. “Local or international banks who can provide these tools have considerable shares in these large corporate clients.”</p>
<h3 id=""overcoming-hurdles"">Overcoming hurdles</h3>
<p>As with most countries, there are some nuances for treasurers to be aware of. “Turkey can be a complex and challenging market requiring adaptability and persistence,” says Ersoy. When compared to the SEPA countries and US cheque and cash collections, he says, payments practices are somewhat different for corporates in Turkey. Post-dated cheques in the market, for example, are an issue. Cheques are still frequently used in the commercial segment and are a part of daily life. HSBC, as a direct member of the clearing system provides electronic solutions to customers for cheques.</p>
<p>Turkish laws and regulations regarding tax issues within group companies is a key point that treasurers should be aware of, on top of local cash collection practices. There are some regulations around liquidity management, such as notional pooling – a common practice in Europe – that are not allowed in Turkey. “Liquidity management is basically regulated in the context of companies rather than financial institutions in Turkey. Therefore, before entering into any type of liquidity structure, companies will be expected to seek their own tax and legal advice,” says Ersoy.</p>
<h3 id=""all-eyes-ahead"">All eyes ahead</h3>
<p>Turkey’s natural position at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia means the country is a regional logistics base and the transportation sector a source of economic growth and employment. Turkey’s current logistics industry size is estimated to be around US$80-100bn and is forecast to reach US$108-140bn by 2017. In addition to a customs union agreement with the EU (all customs practices are aligned to WTO standards) and ambitious government plans for infrastructure improvements across road, rail, air and sea transport channels, it is perhaps unsurprising that trade plays an important role in Turkey’s economy. According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the EU is Turkey’s largest economic partner, accounting for around 40% of Turkish trade. It has been an EU accession country since October 2005 and, in accordance with its accession talks, has adapted a number of its policies and procedures in line with EU standards.</p>
<p>There shouldn’t, therefore, be too many shocks for European treasurers. What’s more, there are no exchange control restrictions affecting inward or outward investment, the repatriation of income or capital, the holding of currency accounts or the settlement of current trading transactions. Corporate income tax is 20% (reduced from 30% in 2006) and the dividend withholding tax rate is 15% on distributions of profit to non-resident shareholders and amounts repatriated by a branch to its head office. Dividends distributed by a resident Turkish entity to another resident Turkish entity are exempt from dividend withholding tax.</p>
<p>Since current global market conditions are volatile, treasurers are likely to be (rightly) cautious about exploring new markets. But Turkey is often heralded as a leading emerging market economy. In April this year, Bloomberg reported that Turkey is defying domestic challenges and offers one of the best risk-adjusted returns in emerging markets, second only to Colombia.</p>
<p>And as banks such as HSBC confirm their commitment, access to a “trusted and recommended banking partner, with a broad range of innovative and relevant products and services, and the financial strength and stability to support their business in the future”, says Ersoy, is assured.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>According to the European Commission 2015 winter forecast, GDP growth in France, the Eurozone’s second largest economy, is expected to rise 1.4% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. Having stagnated over the three years prior to now, lower oil prices, low inflation and sustained wage growth encouraged private consumption throughout 2015. Whilst positive consumer sentiment should remain a growth engine, drivers of growth, in a globally competitive environment, should be diversified. Aptly, Audit firm EY predict that France’s economy will become less reliant on consumer spending (EY Eurozone Forecast, October 2015). EY suggests that businesses will accelerate their investment spending supported by pro-competitive reforms in the country, underpinning an expected increase in consumption and export volumes.</p>
<h3 id=""gaining-traction"">Gaining traction</h3>
<p>Encouraged by the euro’s depreciation and the French government’s competitiveness policies – such as a reduction of labour costs, increased flexibility of the labour market and a greater promotion of Research and Development (R&amp;D) – foreign trade will make a positive contribution to growth throughout this year (+0.2 GDP points in 2016, the same as in 2015, according to the French Economic Observatory). And the foundations are in place to support this; the World Bank Group’s Ease of Doing Business 2016 report ranked France first globally for trading across borders, alongside 14 other countries.</p>
<p>In France, HSBC’s barometer of Trade Confidence amongst corporates, declined slightly in H2 2015 (a Trade Confidence Score of 119) compared to six months earlier (127), but it appears to reflect a less optimistic view regarding the global outlook rather than in-country pessimism. The number of respondents expecting global economic conditions to improve in the short term fell 30%, but the Trade Confidence Score (TCS) remains firmly in expansion territory and the majority of companies surveyed (60%) continue to expect trade volumes to increase in France. HSBC’s Trade Forecast Report, produced in conjunction with Oxford Economics, predicts France’s exports, in current US dollar terms, will grow by just under 1% in 2016, but will pick up steadily towards 5% a year by 2020. Germany will remain France’s largest trading partner and is its primary export and import destination.</p>
<h3 id=""a-value-proposition"">A value proposition</h3>
<p>The country’s economy boasts leading companies in a number of manufacturing sectors, including aerospace, pharmaceuticals and agri-business, as well as in the automotive and railway sectors. And this global leadership is supported by generous government support for France’s cutting-edge R&amp;D – the French tax credit can reduce the cost of research by almost a third, for instance. A supportive environment for R&amp;D activity (Deloitte, October 2015 Global Survey of R&amp;D Tax Incentives), in addition to the country’s successful educational establishments, will continue to support France’s activity at the top end of the value chain (<a href=""#chart-01"">see Chart 1</a>).</p>

<p>As such, it is no surprise the country is a large recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI). Certain declarations and permits are necessary but there are limited restrictions to FDI – in fact, France offers multiple investment incentives, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). With a number of trade corridor links relating to France, appetite to invest in the country remains high as it is still ranked fourth place after the US, China and the UK regarding FDIs. Key investors into France come from the US, Germany and UK.</p>
<p>Asides from also being the most visited country in the world, maintaining the third largest income globally from tourism, other contributing factors to France’s attraction as a place of business include: well-maintained industrial infrastructure, one of the most developed transportation systems in the world and a highly educated labour force – the country has the highest number of science graduates per thousand workers in Europe, for instance. “External companies, from China and Middle Eastern countries for example, are coming to France as the first port of call in Europe. It’s a decision based upon getting access to the Eurozone via a stable economy in a stable environment,” says Christophe Roy, Head of Payments &amp; Cash Management, HSBC France. “Having a financial centre in France, together with operational centres, is something we are seeing from a lot of corporates looking to manage their European activities.”</p>

<p>Christophe also expands on the latest developments: “The HSBC team is also looking at new innovative technology to create flexible, more efficient solutions. Long-term investment in HSBCnet Internet Banking and HSBCnet Mobile will see the deployment of new mobile solutions in different markets, such as B2B mobile collections. HSBCnet, the online e-banking platform, is an accessible gateway to effective corporate financial management on a global scale. Corporates can manage payments, receivables, liquidity and the changing value of their assets with one secure, global solution; connecting markets and giving you the real time information to compete in today’s business environment.”</p>
<p>France boasts a mature financial sector, one where cash management solutions are driven by corporates. “There are strong relationships between corporates and banks. The treasury association also leads technical discussions on the evolution process in cash management,” says Christophe. “It is different to countries where banks may lead those discussions.” HSBC has a unique position, dating back to 1894, in the competitive sector that is France’s multi-bank environment – the country has 170 commercial banks, 88 branches of foreign banks and 110 savings, cooperative and rural banks operating. “HSBC is one of the largest international banks and our extensive network ensures we can support domestic requirements with strong local knowledge.” No other foreign bank has a nationwide branch network. Also operating in the country are purely international banks offering offshore capabilities and locally-focused banks. “For corporates looking to successfully establish operations in France, choosing a banking partner with global reach and local knowledge is a good starting point,” says Christophe.</p>
<p>In terms of competitiveness in the country’s banking sector, there are two things corporates should note, according to Christophe. Firstly, because of the current regulatory environment and specific technical requirements, some international banks are withdrawing to their local markets. “Secondly, and hugely important, is the SEPA environment. As the result of the creation of a zone where all electronic EUR-denominated retail payments are to be treated as domestic payments, a local bank can offer services all over Europe.”</p>
<p>What’s more, the XML format of ISO 20022 affords banks, and corporates rich information regarding payment information. “One of the key parts of efficient cash management is clearly managing that information well,” says Christophe. Aptly, the European agenda on e-invoicing using XML format is being pushed as a means linking invoices to payments. “It will afford the ability to make a payment against real electronic invoices. It will be a real change in the industry in terms of control and transparency over the transaction and the reconciliation of a corporate’s payment activity,” says Christophe. “Once you have this electronic invoicing information coming together with the payment information, you can converge the working capital of the supply chain activities with cash management.”</p>
<p>This matches current ongoing trends, Christophe observes, where treasurers are looking for more and more visibility. “Getting information faster, with more accuracy, helps treasuries manage working capital activities as well as protect themselves against fraud and money laundering.” These are areas of concern, increasingly so, for treasurers.</p>
<p>Overseeing this environment is France’s central bank, The Banque de France, responsible for implementing and controlling interest rate policy, and formulating credit and monetary policies. The three French authorities with supervision powers over money laundering regulations are: The Prudential Control and Resolution Authority (ACPR), The National Enforcement Commission and The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Banks and credit institutions must make certain declarations to the Ministry of Economics and Finance service against money laundering.</p>

<h3 id=""payments-innovation"">Payments innovation</h3>
<p>Electronic payment opportunities available to corporates in the country are on the rise. Instant payments, for example, have been “silently revolutionising” the landscape, according to Christophe. “It may change the business to consumer (B2C) relationship as instant payments can be a direct competitor to card schemes.” When banks offer instant payments, without dependence on the main card networks, it could change the way the industry is using banking payments.</p>
<p>Christophe also believes the growth of fintechs “will be a gain for both banks and fintechs and, ultimately, corporates”. Why? Because, “in a new ecosystem”, fintech companies will bring a lot of innovation and value add technology, but banks will continue to be important accompaniers, not least because of important regulatory control reasons. For corporates, Christophe advises: “Follow ongoing projects in order to anticipate the practical consequences on your daily activity. The digital revolution has not finished surprising us.”</p>
<h3 id=""points-of-interest"">Points of interest</h3>
<p>Aligned with the developments in electronic payments is an increased governmental will to do more regarding anti-money laundering activities. As mentioned earlier, “corporates are spending more to ensure their payments and cash management processes are resilient. The responsibility is falling on them more and more. The bank, however, is here to help with these concerns that are playing on treasurers’ minds,” says Christophe.</p>
<p>The benefits of the Eurozone are clear – integrated financial markets, reduced cost of trading, and a stronger presence in the global economy, for instance – but recent troubles, including the Grexit dilemma, migrant crisis and worries over Russian aggression, are hard to ignore. What treasurers should look for, therefore, is a single entry point which offers collaborative innovation and stability amidst volatility. France offers that: an economy with secure offerings in terms of banking environment, infrastructure and investments, as well as a recognised focus on the value-add end of the chain.</p>
<h3 id=""international-presence"">International presence</h3>
<p>Christophe concludes: “HSBC’s extensive local presence and global footprint gives us access to 85% of world trade flows. We can also manage cross-border requirements with global reach and recently became the first bank to implement a two-way RMB sweep between Europe and China.</p>
<p>With our international connectivity and footprint, HSBC is committed to supporting our clients and helping them discover the strongest avenues for business growth, helping them increase control over their cash flow, optimise their working capital and help connect to opportunities in Europe and beyond.”</p>

<h3>Payments instruments in France</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Payments cards.</h5> <br/>
<p>The use of payment cards in France has increased in the past decade. Visa and Mastercard are the principal payment card brands issued in France.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheques.</h5> <br/>
<p>Cheques are declining in use due to the increasing preference for electronic payments – both for high value and low value transactions. They are, however, still a common cashless payment instrument, particularly for retail payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct debits.</h5> <br/>
<p>Direct debits are available in France and are used for low-value recurring payments. On 1<sup>st</sup> August 2014, SEPA direct debits replaced all legacy direct debit schemes in France. SEPA direct debits can be settled on a same-day basis via CORE or STEP2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Credit transfers.</h5> <br/>
<p>Credit transfers are used for both high-value corporate and low-value retail payment transactions. Companies with a gross turnover above €15m must use credit transfers for tax and social security payments. All credit transfers are automated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Electronic banking.</h5> <br/>
<p>Electronic banking is available in France and offered by all of the country’s banks. The SEPA-compliant Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard (EBICS) is used in France. EBICS is a secure, IP-based, XML-file transfer protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Mobile banking.</h5> <br/>
<p>It is offered by many of the country’s banks, but remains mainly retail orientated.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Germany is the largest economy in Europe and the fourth largest by nominal GDP in the world. Although Germany’s economics ministry decreased the country’s growth forecasts slightly from 1.8% to 1.7% in October, the German economy shows solid growth. 2015 GDP growth forecasts of 1.6% from EY and 1.5% from HSBC research confirm the country’s stable upward trend and the return from a mid-2014 slump.</p>
<p>Lower oil prices, currency depreciation and a robust labour market have acted as a stimulus for better-than-expected domestic consumption. In fact, consumer confidence in the country sits near a 14-year high according to a poll this year by market research company, GfK. Whilst growth isn’t immune from risks such as the challenging market conditions in the single currency zone, analysts expect that the German economy will be propped up by strong consumer demand throughout the rest of the year and into 2016.</p>
<h3 id=""maintaining-good-form"">Maintaining good form</h3>
<p>Although its advantages have been widely debated, the German economy is also benefiting from the European Central Bank’s (ECB) €1.1trn quantitative easing (QE) programme. In April this year – as QE pushed yields on German bonds with a maturity of as long as nine years below zero – the DAX Index closed at a record high.</p>
<p>In 2015, the country achieved its highest ever score from The Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom, making its economy the 16<sup>th</sup> freest globally. Improvements cited by a corresponding report include marked advances in labour freedom and in policy areas related to market openness. These developments to economic freedom – openness to global trade, freedom from corruption and reliable business environments, for instance – are beneficial to overseas investors. “There is an open and welcoming foreign investment regime in Germany,” says Stephen Price, Country Head of Commercial Banking for HSBC Germany.</p>
<p>In addition, “Germany is in the centre and the heart of Europe. From here you can reach both the eastern and western parts of Europe quite easily,” explains Gabriele Schnell, Head of Payments and Cash Management for HSBC Germany. Its optimal location has traditionally led to Germany being leveraged as a hub for investments and trade logistics. Moreover, its infrastructure, according to Schnell, is “well-developed” and received recognition in IMB World Competitiveness Yearbook 2015, ranking ninth globally.</p>
<h3 id=""international-presence"">International presence</h3>
<p>As such, it is unsurprising that Germany is a major export country. In fact, as Carola von Schmettow, CEO of HSBC Germany, explains, “Germany is one of the top export nations in the world.” However, she continues, “Germany is highly dependent on the global trade environment.” Given that the pace of trade is slowing somewhat globally, how has the country kept its position as a leading exporter?</p>
<p>Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, reported in December 2014 that, as the economy remains in remarkably good shape, German corporates are able to seize opportunities in foreign markets. The country’s Mittelstand (mid-market segment) has looked towards faster growing markets, where average growth rates far exceed those of the Eurozone, explains von Schmettow. For instance, China is now one of the country’s biggest trading partners and Asia is predicted to be Germany’s fastest growing export market over the next 15 years.</p>
<p>Closer to home, almost two thirds of German exports are within Europe. Harmonised standards and guidelines within the EU, free trade and the single currency within the Eurozone are some reasons for this. “The implementation of SEPA – unifying domestic and foreign bank transfers technically and regulatory – has been a major step in the direction of standardisation,” says Schnell. There are no longer restrictions to intra-European payments. What this means is that “one account, for instance in Germany, could be sufficient to settle your transactions across multiple euro countries,” says Schnell. For corporates, the possibility this allows to centralise payment processes is even more attractive than before because of increased transparency and reduced complexity and costs. In addition, the execution time of one working day enables a day-specific scheduling of transactions.</p>
<h3 id=""attraction-for-multinationals"">Attraction for multinationals</h3>
<p>Germany is also an attractive prospect for foreign corporates looking to expand into Europe. Germany Trade &amp; Invest (GTAI), the economic development agency of the Federal Republic of Germany, reported in April that Germany attracted a record €3.2bn in foreign investment in 2014. The number of new investors reached an all-time high and the number of new projects in Germany rose by a fifth as well as the value of projects. The largest green field investor was China, followed by the US. According to Robert Marsh, Group Treasurer for Matthews International Corporation, a provider of brand solutions and industrial automation solutions, with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and several subsidiaries in Germany: “Germany is a gateway to Europe suitable for our international strategy.”</p>
<p>“There is a strong interest in the technological expertise and the research capabilities in Germany as well as the infrastructure and generally reliable, transparent processes,” explains HSBC’s Schnell. All of which, she notes, is appealing to an increasing number of foreign corporates. And, by choosing Germany, overseas corporates are offered “a highly developed legal and political framework that provides a good deal of security,” says Price. The country is arguably a representation of stability in an otherwise volatile environment. Not only does it offer a resilient economy that represents relatively low risk with low inflation and low unemployment, from a workforce point of view, Price adds that Germany’s working population is highly trained, well-educated and committed to IT developments.</p>

<p class=""management-summary""><em>Matthews International Corporation, headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA since 1850, is a provider of brand solutions, memorialisation products and industrial automation solutions. Matthews, with more than 10,000 employees, has a presence in over 100 locations in more than 25 countries around the world. Matthews conducts business in Germany under a variety of trade names, including Saueressig, Schawk, IDL Worldwide, Anthem, Brandimage, Caggiati and Matthews Automation Solutions.</em></p>
<p>Robert Marsh, Treasurer, and Markus Pennekamp, EMEA Director of Finance, explain why Germany is an important market for Matthews and give their top tips for doing business in Germany:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Germany represents a core component of our international strategy, serving as our company’s gateway to Europe. We have been doing business in Germany for more than 15 years and it has developed into one of our key European markets. When assessing opportunities globally, we identified several strong German-based businesses that shared our markets and corporate culture, representing good investments to expand the reach of Matthews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany offers an excellent combination of a strong domestic market and an outstanding infrastructure. In addition, Germany has a strong talent pool with reach across Europe which contributes to further strengthening our international strategy and enhancing our growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany is a cooperative jurisdiction to operate from for a US-based business perspective. Although local regulations and laws differ from those in the US, support from the German Chambers of Commerce and public authorities is easily accessible, providing invaluable assistance to foreign companies such as ours in navigating applicable local requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany is fully integrated in the Eurozone, creating a number of possibilities for future shared service and treasury centralisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the German market is currently very favourable for providing working capital and longer-term financing solutions including capital market instruments. Matthews have only just begun to investigate these opportunities, but the current low interest rate environment creates a variety of possibilities for attractive local funding (Schuldscheindarlehen – German Private Placement, for instance).</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""legal-considerations"">Legal considerations</h3>
<p>For any business entity wanting to conduct operations in the country, decisions will need to be made under which form they want to do business. Generally, foreign investors will function through a subsidiary or branch – that is, an overseas company can set up a German branch as a place of business without necessarily forming a subsidiary. The registration of a foreign company branch must be made with the commercial register at the given location of that branch; application content will vary depending on the legal form of the overseas company. But, in general, registration must include: approvals by the German state (if required), the company’s foreign legal registration, the legal form of the company, persons with power of agency and applicable laws.</p>
<p>Should a foreign investor wish to set up a separate subsidiary, many investors decide to establish a limited liability company (GmbHs – ‘Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung’). For the foundation of a GmbH the investor would have to (among other things) adopt articles of association in notarised form and file the company with the commercial register. Since the shareholders of a GmbH can control and instruct the management directly (which the shareholders of a public limited liability company – AG ‘Aktiengesellschaft’ cannot), foreign investors generally prefer to establish a subsidiary in the form of a GmbH.</p>
<h3 id=""banking-sector"">Banking sector</h3>
<p>Although there has been significant consolidation in Germany’s banking sector over the past decade, there are still a high number of banks operating in the country, including 168 domestic commercial banks, 36 foreign-owned banks and 109 foreign bank branches. As expected, these include most of the large international cash management banks, which offer full services. “It is a very competitive market and to that extent banks have to be very innovative in the payments and cash management space,” says Schnell.</p>
<p>Moreover, funding conditions are favourable, despite German banks having to contend with a number of measures the ECB has put in place. Compelled by the recent phase of stress testing in autumn 2014, banks have had to readjust their balance sheets to meet capital ratios set by regulations. All 24 German banks that took part completed the tests successfully.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the new bank tax introduced in January 2011 by the German government expects banks to inject up to €1.2bn every year into a reserve fund to finance any future bank bailouts. This all points to a stable banking sector that is doing all it can to safeguard against external shocks.</p>
<p>Apart from the ECB, bank supervision in Germany is carried out by the German Financial Supervisory Authority – known as BaFin – and the central bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, in accordance with the Banking Act. The Bundesbank is a member of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB).</p>
<h3 id=""paymen-instruments"">Payment instruments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cheques.</h5>
<p>Cheques are declining in use in Germany due to the preference for electronic payments for both high-value and low-value transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Payment cards.</h5>
<p>All payment cards issued in Germany are SEPA-compliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cash.</h5>
<p>Cash is still popular in Germany. In fact, the country remains one of the most cash-intensive advanced economies globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct debits.</h5>
<p>Direct debits are available and typically used for low-value recurring payments. In February 2014, SEPA direct debits were introduced to replace Germany’s pre-authorised direct debit scheme until February 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Credit transfers.</h5>
<p>Although credit transfers can be paper-based or automated, all paper-based ones are truncated into electronic items. They are used for both high-value corporate and low-value retail payment transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Electronic banking.</h5>
<p>Electronic banking is commonplace – all of the country’s leading banks offer e-banking solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""support-for-international-companies"">Support for international companies</h3>
<p>Against this backdrop, how can corporates successfully establish operations in the country? Choosing a banking partner with global reach and local knowledge is a good starting point, says Price. For instance, HSBC offers a team of specialised and dedicated members from their International Subsidiary Banking (ISB) team. These relationship bankers are experienced in facilitating market entry and providing guidance to international companies. They can provide corporates with “direct on-the-ground support in key markets,” explains Price. “Entering a new geography is often a challenging and, at times, a worrying occupation for corporates.” But, considering the international footprint of HSBC, the bank is well positioned to support companies in overcoming cultural issues and issues of communication and connectivity as well as the day to day role of support with issues of funding and FX. “The ISB team ensures the required level of understanding of how to operate in Germany is consistently provided, minimising the chance of unforeseen surprises for the corporate,” continues Price.</p>
<p>This particular approach to relationship management offers foreign corporates ease of access into a country whose advantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reliability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency and a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitive edge</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Place it on a strong footing and, as von Schmettow concludes, “make Germany the ideal starting point for multinationals wanting to do business in Europe.”</p></div>

<p>Matthias Wehrle, the company’s Head of Accounting gives his top tips for doing business in Germany – and some considerations for German-based corporates looking to Asia for expansion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As in most countries, you have different local regulations and laws. So, before you set up a business overseas, it is important to clarify your company’s needs and be aware of new business procedures. That said, setting up a successful enterprise in Germany is relatively straightforward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important, especially when considering Asian markets, to find a good banking partner who can inform you about local nuances and keep you updated on regulatory changes. The HSBC team in China keeps Testo AG up-to-date and is well-placed to help with the company’s liquidity needs at both a domestic and international level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For German corporates doing business in China, it is also essential to keep up-to-date with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). It is the most important regulatory department in China for corporates and is responsible for the management and monitoring of cross-border trade and FX. Corporates will need to ask about every regulation in every Chinese province separately, however.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To keep up to date in Germany, Asian corporates can ask the International German Chamber of Commerce for the latest information, as well as relying on their chosen bank partner for regular updates.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>In February this year, the European Commission (EC) set out proposals to establish a Capital Markets Union (CMU) across its 28 member states; a move that it is hoped will precipitate a major rebalancing of financial intermediation across the continent. But if the EC really wants the idea of a pan-European capital market to become manifest, it had better make sure it considers the powerful role that FinTech might play in making that happen.</em></p>
<p>Most readers will by now be well acquainted with the story. A global recession combined with a financial crisis, followed by a more localised European financial crisis and recession, led to a deluge of strict banking regulation that stifled the supply bank credit to European firms. As access to banking channels dried up, larger corporates turned to the capital markets and, in unprecedentedly favourable borrowing conditions, drove bond issuance to new record highs. Those companies in the Eurozone that are too small to tap bond investors for funding have not, however, been quite so fortunate.</p>
<p>They are not small in number. A YouGov survey of 218 medium and large European companies and published by the law firm Allen &amp; Overy in 2014, shows that 43% of corporate funding comes from banks, a figure which has changed little from the 44% that was reported when the survey was first conducted five years before. Correlation does not always equate to causation, of course. But the way that a less bank-reliant economy like the US managed to avoid the sustained malaise still affecting Europe has been used by some commentators as testimony that Europe is too reliant on its banking sector for financing and needs to beef up non-bank finance.</p>
<h3 id=""a-capital-markets-union"">A capital markets union</h3>
<p>The vision of a single European market for capital did not begin with the ideas set out in the Green Paper ‘Building a Capital Markets Union’, published earlier this year by the European Commission (EC). From the very beginning, the principle of free movement of capital has been at heart of the European project, shaping the policy agenda. The consultation recently kicked off by the EC, which sets out the case for the creation of a single European-wide capital market, is just the latest hopeful example of its influence on policy.</p>
<p>The first mention of the need to develop European capital markets was actually made in a paper written by Brussels policymakers nearly 50 years ago. It is striking to hear the similarities in language between now and then. “In all the member states, the financing of economic growth is coming to depend more and more on the capital market, and the establishment of wider markets, and close co-operation of economic policies would facilitate this growth,” the report declared.</p>
<p>Does it sound familiar? The underlying motivation for pursuing the goal of a pan-European capital market is different, perhaps more urgent, now than it ever was before though. Back then the explicitly stated intent of capital market reform was to lay the groundwork for the unification of foreign exchange markets. Today, the single currency is already a reality. Unfortunately, though the very concept of monetary union is in increasing jeopardy as a consequence of the debt crisis in the Eurozone periphery and a far from convincing economic recovery almost everywhere else. The purpose of CMU now, then, is no longer to pave the way for the euro, but to save it.</p>
<h3 id=""rebalancing-finance"">Rebalancing finance</h3>
<p>Reading the Green Paper it is clear that policymakers have their work cut out if they are to succeed in their ambition. A number of issues are identified in the document. These include the barriers to access the capital market, the need for sustainable securitisation activities, and the differences across legal jurisdictions that continue to impede companies who wish to issue private placements outside of their domestic market.</p>
<p>In a study by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) published in February 2015, the latter, in particular, was found to be a significant impediment to investment in European companies. The AFME report, which surveyed global investors holding around €9trn assets under management, revealed that 65% of investors blame market fragmentation (lack of information and understanding of the differences across markets) for holding back investments in Europe. A further 60% cited discrepancies in rules across member states.</p>
<p>In the Green Paper, the EC also cites – albeit briefly – the role that new financial-technology (FinTech) companies can play in driving this integration. If one looks at these areas of focus in tandem with the banking union reforms also currently being implemented, then it quickly becomes clear what basket European policymakers are putting their eggs in. It is not with the bank-dominated financial intermediation.</p>
<p>“The ECB has supported research that concludes that Europe is overbanked,” says Nicholas Véron, Senior Fellow at Bruegel, a European think-tank specialising in economics. “It is pretty clear that if you have a deep capital market you can mitigate this vicious circle between banks and sovereigns somewhat because you have an alternative for credit allocation if banks become impaired.”</p>
<p>For the corporate sectors of certain countries, like the UK, that have relatively small capital markets these initiatives could be particularly beneficial. It is widely acknowledged, for example, that the UK capital market is not big enough for large UK-based corporates and, as such, many have to look to international markets when they decide to issue debt. That gives companies based in the US, for example, a material advantage when it comes to financing. So CMU, while a very important step, is perhaps more important for some countries than others.</p>
<h3 id=""in-the-digital-age"">In the digital age</h3>
<p>If the EC and ECB are serious about making a success of the CMU initiative, however, the two bodies would be well-served to give more thought to what role new technological innovations might play in all of this. Although, as noted above, the paper did acknowledge that European law has so far “insufficiently (integrated) the benefits of digitisation,” solid proposals around how to redress this issue for the benefit of digital innovators were in scant supply.</p>
<p>This shortcoming was highlighted in a paper published this year by the European Digital Forum, a think-tank and policy network led by the Brussels-based Lisbon Council and innovation charity Nesta. “I was really surprised to see that the digital technologies challenge was not fully addressed in the Green Paper,” Sergey Filippov, Associate Director at the Lisbon Council and author of the report told Treasury Today. “What we believe, and what we say in our paper, is that it is not really possible to regulate separately for a CMU and to facilitate digital innovations in the European market.”</p>
<p>The two ought to go hand in hand, because if the fundamental objective of the CMU is to reduce the European financial system’s over reliance on the banking sector then FinTech might have a lot to offer to that end. We have seen how, in recent years, developments in digital technology have led to the emergence of new types of financial service providers and new funding vehicles (see, for instance, the rise of P2P lenders who have had such great success filling the bank void in SME financing space of late). Policy initiatives integrated into the CMU framework that would help such firms grow and intermediate more in such areas – channelling funding to SMEs who have had bank credit lines withdrawn, for example – would, arguably, be very much in accord with the CMU objectives.</p>
<p>As such, The Lisbon Council is calling for a “stronger technology mandate embedded in the forthcoming CMU proposals” and, secondly, for capital markets to be given a more prominent status in the Digital Single Market strategy. “The European Commission directorate-general for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union (DG FISMA) and directorate-general for communications networks, content and technology (DG Connect) should work together energetically to drive a policy agenda forward,” the report demands.</p>
<h3 id=""innovators-and-collaborators"">Innovators and collaborators</h3>
<p>It is important to emphasise that nobody, least of all the EC is suggesting we replace an overdependence on one type of financier (the banks) with another (capital markets investors and FinTech). It is merely that a more diverse financial system with more non-bank funding and more non-bank financial providers will be a safer, more stable system that is better placed to fund growth. The point that the likes of Filippov are trying to make is that capital markets should be for everyone: start-ups and financial services incumbents alike.</p>
<p>Indeed, far from seeing the rise of new digitally-enabled alternative finance providers as a competitive threat, it is becoming increasingly clear that the banking sector – or at least the greater part of it – see opportunities for themselves in the space. Disruption is, increasingly, giving way to collaboration.</p>
<p>“Some banks have swum against the tide, but a lot of the others are actually reacting in quite a positive way,” says Filippov. “They genuinely think it is a good thing for the financial system; they can collaborate with them and access some niche market that is not their market.”</p>
<p>We have seen numerous examples of such collaboration of late. One might recall, for instance, that in recent years both RBS and Santander have struck up partnerships with P2P lending firms like Funding Circle which will see them refer customers they have turned down for business loans. But collaboration between banks and FinTech is not stopping at investment into already established innovators. The banking industry has also been investing increasing resources into helping new financial companies with novel ideas get off the ground.</p>
<p>For instance, every year since its launch in 2011, SWIFT’s Innotribe Start-Up Challenge has served as a venue through which start-ups can present their ideas to leading banks, financial institutions, technology vendors and other professional services providers to attract potential collaborators. SWIFT rates and screens those start-ups using a network of over 500 volunteers, bankers, consultants, and academics. They also work with a network of approximately 20 industry experts who coach those start-ups in pitching their ideas to banks.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Fabian Vandenreydt, Head of Markets Management, Innotribe, the SWIFT Institute and Partner Management at SWIFT, believes banks and other financial institutions have a big role to play in fostering the innovations being developed by start-ups in the Fintech space. “I think the word ‘disruption’ is sometimes a bit abused. I don’t think many (Fintech companies) are there consciously to disrupt anything. They may facilitate some reengineering of some functions in banking but, as we have seen, many of them are also willing to work with the banks.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, all banks have to comply with regulatory requirements,” Vandenreydt says. “They are seeing a changing landscape, however, and in areas where there are themes that they see as important, they want to do something, but often they don’t have the internal resources to support it. So instead, many are opting to work together with some of these Fintech start-ups.</p>
<p>The rapid rise in interest in this space has been triggered by the requirements of the end customers – be that individuals or corporates – for transparent rapid, and low cost solutions,” he adds. “I think what the Fintech companies do is they make building blocks that can then be assembled to address some of those requirements for the end-customers. If you take, for example, big data or distributed systems, or P2P lending, these are all building blocks that when assembled may make the life of the end-user easier. Now, whether these will be revolutionary remains to be seen. But P2P lending, clearly is starting to have traction, to the point that a lot of banks are wanting to be part of what is going on the space as well.”</p>
<p>Many of the large international banks have also established their own FinTech accelerators. Back in 2011, for instance, Citi was one of the first to launch such a service with creation of various Innovation Labs (which now number five globally). Like SWIFT’s Innotribe, the ultimate objective is to explore new ideas and service concepts and collaborate with start-ups (and the bank’s corporate and institutional clients) to develop, test, pilot and launch new solutions.</p>
<p>“One way to think of the digital challenge is as a threat,” says Rajesh Mehta, Managing Director, EMEA Region Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. “But the other way, the way we prefer to look at it, is as a massive opportunity to provide more value added services and products to our clients. Clients are increasingly becoming more digitally savvy. Because of this, we need to consider how we can use and develop new capabilities that will benefit corporate treasurers and CFOs. Many of these clients are commenting on the dichotomy between their personal financial lives and the way their institutional banks still operate. We are working to bridge that gap.”</p>
<h3 id=""baby-steps"">Baby steps</h3>
<p>Predicting the future is always a risky undertaking, but can we determine, on the balance of probabilities, the extent of the change we are likely to witness in Europe over the coming years?</p>
<p>AFME, who in November 2014 published a report outlining potential objectives for a future pan-European capital market, is among those who caution that the road to CMU will be a long one. Some of the issues highlighted in the EC’s paper such as tax, insolvency reform and securities law will need to be negotiated with member states. This can take some time, says Paul McGhee, AFME’s Director of Strategy. “It has identified some issues that are really long term. For example, in the case of withholding taxes and the taxation of debt interest relative to equity, member states are responsible for those levers. So there are going to be some big political challenges ahead.”</p>
<p>If it were easy to reach the sort of agreements between member states then a CMU might have been accomplished nearly half a century ago when the idea was first mooted. Had that been the case the financial history of Europe might have been very different. Perhaps, as a deep, pan-European debt market developed, companies would have had a much more diverse set of funding sources to choose between. That was not to be, however, and instead Europe continued, right up until the financial crisis, to become more and more bank dominated.</p>
<p>Other experts agree that the rebalancing of financial intermediation in Europe will be a gradual process. “Financial intermediation changes very slowly,” says Bruegel’s Véron. “The dominance of the banks in Europe is so extreme that even if it was massively corrected over the next five years it would still probably be excessive. There is no way that in the course of just a few years you could have the same level of capital market activity that we see in the US, because the EU is probably the most significant bank dominated economy in the world.”</p>
<p>But gradual though it may be, change will eventually come. Part of this transformation is likely to be policy-driven, as evidenced by the proposals set out in the EC’s recent Green Paper. But part of it will also be organic, coming, as we are already witnessing, from a burgeoning FinTech sector ready to fill the void left as banks retreat from certain, no longer profitable, segments of the market.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that the bankers will find themselves in any way redundant in the future European financial market. But that the sector’s role will change. Just as banks play a vital role in the functioning of capital markets – as book runners or lead arrangers on behalf of issuers, to name but one example – they are, through accelerator programmes and other forms of collaboration, also becoming increasingly important to the nascent FinTech sector.</p>
<p>In the end, the degree to which Europe can rebalance financial intermediation will largely depend on the extent to which legislators are able to agree new rules consistent with a vision of Europe in which the free movement of capital is a central, indisputable principle. That was the vision European policymakers had for the future European financial system back in the 1960s. It remains the vision today.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia has emerged as a successful independent capitalist country. The strong consensus against the preceding regime, in the government and local populations, proved robust enough to outlast inevitable deprivations and instil a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>To this day, as Juris Paegle, Head of Cash Management in the Baltic countries for Nordea identifies, the country’s “political stability and, in a way, political will, leads to financial and tax predictability – a factor often mentioned as a strong reason why international treasurers typically favour Estonia over its Baltic neighbours.”</p>
<h3 id=""emblematic-history"">Emblematic history</h3>
<p>Fruitful structural reforms, and the country’s economic boom in the early 2000s, have also helped its appeal as a business location, and resulted in the country being named one of the ‘Baltic tigers’. Estonia embraced advantageous memberships – including joining the EU in 2004 and seizing connectivity with the Baltic Sea region – which helped boost the country’s credibility and popularity with foreign investors. The country experienced rapid economic growth in 2000-2008 with an average annual growth rate of 7% per year. Furthermore, by 2001, 75% of GDP came from private companies.</p>
<p>While Estonia was not immune to the financial crisis of 2008, the country’s reaction, was impressive. Budgetary discipline included new labour laws that implemented wage cuts and rapid employment adjustments. In fact, “the country was able to maintain an AA- rating during the global crisis period,” explains Tõnu Palm, Chief Economist for Nordea Bank AB’s Estonia branch.</p>
<p>Austerity measures – such as a 16% decrease in the public administration workers average pay – may have been less successful had more political resistance been experienced. But the Estonian population endured the economic hardship (many young unemployed people did migrate elsewhere in Europe, however). Today, stable economic policies and open markets fostering sustainable growth, investment appeal and entrepreneurial activity continue to be typical for the nation. In fact, with an average GDP growth rate of circa 2.4% year-on-year during the last two quarters (Q4 2014 and Q1 2015) Estonia posted the highest growth in the euro area.</p>
<h3 id=""trading-effects"">Trading effects</h3>
<p>The country benefits from a strategic location between European, Nordic and Russian markets and the economy has managed to assert itself with remarkable aptitude on the international stage – foreign trade plays a major role in the economy, the export of goods and services exceeds 95% of GDP.</p>
<p>Manufacturing volume now exceeds the 2008 pre-crisis level, driven by exports (70% of volume). Yet, due to the challenging geopolitical situation related to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, lower energy demand, and the still sluggish recovery of Estonia’s key trade partner – the euro area – exports have been expanding only modestly. Total goods exports were up just 3% year-on-year in Q1 2015, following a 6% growth rate posted in H2 2014.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the overall outlook for the euro area and Estonia remains positive, in the form of a cyclical recovery, which needs to be backed up by investment into productivity. “Growth continues to be generally slow in Europe but we expect it to pick up. In Estonia, the main long-term engine of growth has always been and will continue to be exports of goods and services as the domestic market is small,” explains Nordea’s Palm. Expected strong growth in important export partners, for example, Sweden (accounting for 18% of merchandise exports), coupled with a slow recovery in Finland (15%) in the coming years should help to revive exports demand. The EU accounts for 72% of Estonia’s exports. Palm also predicts that improved sentiment in Germany and growth in Scandinavia will boost Estonian exports.</p>
<p>In March 2015, Nordea’s Palm predicted that “a temporary soft patch in exports will be followed by a gradual pick-up in H2 as Euro-area demand recovers.” According to research by SEB, during this ‘soft patch’, favourable economic conditions – including strong household incomes (wages and salaries have been increasing to the largest extent amongst the Baltic states) – that encourage robust private consumption are ensuring Estonia’s resilience to external uncertainty.</p>
<h3 id=""peer-comparison"">Peer comparison</h3>
<p>Against this backdrop, Estonia is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in the Eurozone in 2015, despite Swedbank’s revision for the country from 2.9% down to 2% growth.</p>
<p>“It’s important for a country’s progression how competitive their economy and business environment is,” explains Palm – and Estonia is ranked 29<sup>th</sup> globally in 2014’s Global Competitiveness Report. The country scores highly for its macroeconomic environment (fiscal and monetary indicators, savings rate and sovereign debt rating) but receives its worst score for market size.</p>
<p>In comparison with its regional neighbours, Estonia holds its own. The World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2015 guide benchmarks economies against the ‘frontier’ – the best regulatory practice observed by the guide since 2005 – where Estonia scores 78.84, 2.37 points closer to the frontier than the regional (OECD high income countries) average on the ease of doing business. Globally, Estonia ranked 17<sup>th</sup> for its ease of doing business in 2015.</p>
<p>“Estonia has transparent policies and effective laws that establish clear rules. The investment-friendly tax system, in addition to the environment of economic and politic stability, are good reasons to consider doing business in Estonia,” explains Kristel Truu, Head of Cash Management Sales at Nordea’s Estonia branch.</p>
<p>Estonia’s stable business environment also attracts competitive foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2013, the average FDI (as % of GDP) for the EU was reported at 1.8%, whereas Estonia received 7.4%. In that same year, the country had the lowest level of sovereign debt to GDP in the EU, at 10% compared to a regional average of 87%.</p>
<h3 id=""euro-implications"">Euro implications</h3>
<p>Although euro adoption in 2011 contributed to the country’s increased competitiveness, ensuring the trust of foreign investors and receiving better loan conditions, “the implementation of SEPA was a drawback from a speed point of view,” explains Irene Usvasalo, Head of Cash Management at Pohjola Bank. Her colleague, Rita Kernumees, Senior Advisor for Cash Management, explains that prior to SEPA, Estonia had been one of – if not the – fastest country for payments processing.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>In 2007, for example, Estonia was the first country to permit online voting in a general election, boasts one of the fastest broadband network connections and free Wi-Fi is commonplace. “Estonia has benefited from the ability for faster information technology (IT) development by not being hindered by an outdated and overly extensive infrastructure,” explains Hannes Kaadu, Country Manager for Pohjola Bank.</p>
<p>Back in 2005, the Estonian IT sector contributed to 9.2% of the country’s GDP but, as Priit Alamäe, CEO of software company Nortal, explains: “it has been the fastest growing sector in the country by far and now generates closer to 15% of GDP.” Furthermore, the wide uptake of IT solutions provided indicate the eagerness of Estonians to use innovative solutions in all fields of life – education, employment and health care, for instance. Aptly, Estonia boasts high cybersecurity levels, rated fifth in the world by the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI); online security is “a strength the government continues to invest in,” explains Palm.</p>
<p>The development of an IT-driven economy is led by the Estonian government’s strategic choices. For example, the government has increased the availability of integrated e-solutions with its national ID card. The chipped photo ID stores digitised data about the user – “this card can then be used for identification, for logging into an internet bank, accessing public and financial tax services and for signing agreements electronically, for example,” explains Kernumees and more than 80% of the population possess the ID card. In Estonia, a digital signature is just as valuable as one in ink and using e-signatures saves the Estonian economy approximately 2% of GDP each year. Moreover, “people spend very little time filing their tax returns and identifying themselves with service providers and banks,” says Veiko Räim, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury for Eesti Energia.</p>
<p>In 2014, “as the first country in the world, Estonia launched its e-residency services to people outside of Estonia,” says Usvasalo. As part of Estonian government’s national Open Government Partnership (OGP) commitments for 2014-2016, after approved face-to-face identification by the authorities, non-residents can receive an Estonian ID card (officials have now rolled out identification services that can be handled by the country’s embassies abroad). E-residency provides access to digital services, wherever the user is in the world – and regardless of whether they have a business or other relation with Estonia as the country does not require businesses to set up in bricks and mortar in order to operate there.</p>
<p>“It is an innovative idea, making the most out of the IT infrastructure that the country has developed over the years,” explains Räim. According to Paegle, it is evident that Estonia’s “e-environment” is a strong driver for investments and will remain so in the future. The uptake of Estonia’s e-residency, however, has been slow.</p>
<h3 id=""payments-and-banking-sector"">Payments and banking sector</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Payment cards.</h5>
<p>The use of payment cards has become increasingly popular in Estonia. It is estimated that 1.45 million debit cards and 347,944 credit cards were in circulation at the end of 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Credit transfers.</h5>
<p>Credit transfers are widely used in terms of both volume and value – payments from corporates are mainly conducted by credit transfer. On 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014, SEPA credit transfers replaced all predecessors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct debits and standing orders.</h5>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 also marked the replacement of the legacy domestic direct debit system with an e-invoicing based standing order service. SEPA direct debits apply for cross-border services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheques.</h5>
<p>Cheques have always lacked popularity in Estonia. Now, their use for day-to-day transactions has been largely phased out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Truu explains that Estonia’s banking sector is relatively “young and, therefore, has been able to skip some steps.” For example, according to Truu, the disregard of cheques is indicative of the demand for paperless solutions. “You can say that Estonians are not going to the bank – rather they are choosing to log into banking services electronically.”</p>
<p>Estonia’s banking sector comprises nine licenced banks and seven branches of foreign banks (which all are from the EU). “The banking sector is well capitalised and the country has the lowest public debts in the EU,” says Palm. It is dominated by the Nordic banks (according to the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority [FSA], Swedbank, SEB and Danske controlled 77% of bank deposits in the first half of 2014), but all of the banks operating in Estonia “offer competitive solutions that are needed for both growth domestically but also for international companies,” explains Truu.</p>
<p>Eesti Pank, the central bank of the Republic of Estonia, is a member of the European System of Central Banks and oversees the country’s financial sector. The main functions of Eesti Pank include: to participate in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy in the euro area, ensure financial stability, operate reliable settlement systems, regulate cash circulation and advise the government on stable economic development.</p>
<p>“Estonia relies on bank-based financing rather than capital market-based funding,” says Räim. “What is missing – due to a combination of the market being too small and liquidity too low – is capital market financing,” explains Kaadu. Corporates can, of course, tap into the international markets but, according to Kaadu, “that isn’t a very attractive choice – especially considering the availability of local bank financing.” While the banking market “sometimes doesn’t have the most sophisticated products available,” according to Räim, “this is an exception rather than the rule.”</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-appeal"">Treasury appeal</h3>
<p>“The emphasis placed on e-Estonia (having enhanced digital services and networking) is important in the corporate sector,” says Palm. Technology, of course, is helping the country gain increasing global recognition as a viable corporate landscape but the business environment is supported by several other factors. Euro adoption in January 2011 certainly helped by simplifying capital investment and FX hedging processes.</p>
<p>Further factors include the favourable tax system, for example. Kaadu explains that “Estonia has a unique taxation system where profit is taxed at the moment of distribution and not at the moment of earning the profit. Profit distributions (dividends) are taxed at a rate of 20% (calculated from gross payment). As long as no dividend payments are made, no corporate tax will apply.”</p>
<p>On a daily basis, if you want to reinvest your profits then there is no corporate tax payable, explains Alamäe. Additionally, since 2000, Estonia’s strain of e-services (of which selected are now also available to non-residents) has included an e-tax office so all reporting requirements are submitted and filed electronically. The new coalition government, according to Palm, is set to “continue the past course with a simple and transparent tax system but has plans to make further adjustments to the taxation of dividends to attract more treasury offices and holding companies to the country.”</p>
<p>Moreover, setting up operations in Estonia has low associated risks. Estonia has the second lowest score for money laundering financial risk globally in the 2014 Basel Anti-Money Laundering Index. “The country’s stable foundation, history of conservative economic policies, continually improving IT systems and business friendly environment over the last 20 years all make a case for why international companies have set up business operations in Estonia,” explains Palm.</p>
<p>Yet one area of concern is Estonia’s labour market. The country boasts an educated, skilled and multilingual workforce but the population is small and ageing. Besides the ageing and limited labour supply there is a challenge to accelerate value-added growth explains Palm. However, according to Räim ageing population creates another challenge of “how to keep people working for longer and to re-train employees to meet labour market requirements.”</p>
<h3 id=""investment-potential-a-favourable-outlook"">Investment potential: a favourable outlook?</h3>
<p>Investment in Estonia is somewhat a case of whether you see the glass as half full (corporate capital investment has increased by 60% from its lowest level in 2010) or half empty (current investment only makes up three-quarters of its pre-crisis volume). The country’s competitive economy is hindered by lingering uncertainty in nearby countries. Growth prospects and geopolitical concerns for important export partners are also somewhat blunting the appetite for investment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nordea’s economic review from March 2015 reports that investment will recover in 2016 “with a pick-up in exports and a rise in the share of EU co-financed state investments.”</p>
<p>Investors appreciate predictability and stability. Looking ahead, with the “government set to continue with a structural budget balance policy,” according to Palm, Estonia’s market-driven economy should demonstrate further resilience to external risks. “The country’s pragmatic approach will continue and ensure that although GDP per capita will catch up fast, competitive factors will remain attractive for foreign investors,” explains Kaadu.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>“What’s the worst that could happen?” That’s a question all conscientious corporate treasurers need to ask themselves every once in a while. Exceptional risks with potentially catastrophic consequences, however improbable, must always be considered; then, once thought through, contingency plans should be drafted and filed away, with the hope of course, that they will never be needed.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers have received plenty of reminders of the need for such planning since the beginning of the year. The Eurozone crisis is back after several years of respite. And there have been numerous occasions over the past several months in which treasurers may have felt the need to get reacquainted with those earlier prepared Grexit contingency plans (circa 2012); the same plans, of course, which have been gathering dust ever since Mario Draghi bought some time with his famous “do whatever it takes” speech.</p></div>

<blockquote>When people see increased volatility there is a natural tendency to hedge more. But if you follow that line of thinking and start hedging further forward, the corporate may find themselves in a situation where the market moves against them.</blockquote>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>To be clear, even in the immediate aftermath of the Syriza election victory, when speculation around Greece’s future in the Eurozone project was at its height, most political analysts and economists thought that Greece will not, on the balance of probabilities, be leaving the euro in the immediate future. “At this stage, we see the risk of Greece leaving the euro as small,” says Adam Chester, Head of Macroeconomics, Commercial Banking, at Lloyds Bank. “It is difficult to make any strong statements at this stage about what the election in Greece means, because negotiations between Greece and the so-called Troika are likely to be ongoing over the next few months. But I think the markets have taken some comfort from the rhetoric that has come out since the election that suggests while [Syriza] are very much looking to reverse some of the austerity measures, they are also very much wedded to staying in the single currency.”</p>
<p>Yet, the recent election of this new, left-wing, anti-austerity government in Athens who are now appearing to engage in brinksmanship in their negotiations with the “Troika”, means it is a possibility that must at least be considered. Even after February’s apparent ‘breakthrough’ in negotiations (the striking of a deal that will extend the current bailout deal for another four months) the fact remains that this crisis, as it was three years ago, is far from resolved. It is likely that the European authorities, particularly the European Central Bank (ECB), will continue to be tireless in their efforts to keep Greece in the single currency. The problem, notes Philippe Gelis, CEO of foreign exchange provider Kantox, is that there are limits to what central banks can influence. For evidence of that, look no further than what happened recently to the Swiss franc. “I’m sure that the Swiss national bank wanted to maintain the CHF peg with the euro,” says Gelis. “But what they realised was that it was no longer possible for them to go on buying euros and printing CHF. I think it could be the same with the ECB. They will not accept a ‘Grexit’, but if at some point it becomes unsustainable, then who knows?”</p>
<p>If that scenario were to play out it is not difficult to imagine, especially with the pressure other nations in the periphery would come under, it precipitating a complete loss of investor confidence in the euro. Some commentators are already speculating that such an event would send the single currency plummeting, potentially, to levels against the dollar not seen since in the history of the currency. It is easy to see why, then, Gelis’s clients have expressed grave concerns about the situation to him in recent discussions. “If this happens, we will probably see for the first time the euro being equal to one dollar,” says Gelis. “Clearly, a Grexit would see the euro lose a lot of value.”</p>
<h4>A ‘lost decade’?</h4>
<p>Greece or no Greece, the Eurozone economy remains in an incredibly perilous position at present. After growth ground to a halt in mid-2014, analysts do not expect to see any meaningful rebound in GDP in the year ahead. A research report published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill) at the end of last year, for instance, forecasts 1.3% GDP growth in 2016 – up just 0.1% from 2015 – and CPI inflation to average 0.5%.</p>
<p>The big fear, of course, is that Europe might be heading into a deflationary spiral of the same sort that afflicted Japan during its ‘lost decade’, an economic mess from which it is only now emerging. Given that the ECB is now committed to a programme of quantitative easing this, analysts say, is also unlikely. According to the base-case of ratings agency Fitch, for example, we are facing a number of years of sub-targetd inflation not, thankfully, Japan-style deflation.</p>
<p>Analysts at Lloyds Bank concur. While the Eurozone is currently experiencing negative inflation, a sustained, broad-based fall in the general price level is not something they believe to be on the horizon. “We think it is largely due to the fall in energy prices that we’ve seen,” says Chester. “You cannot dismiss the risk [of deflation] if conditions in the Eurozone were to deteriorate markedly from here. But given the amount of stimulus that is now being poured into the Eurozone, both in terms of QE, the fall in energy prices, and the weakness of the currency, our forecast is that over the medium term prices will begin to rise again.”</p>
<p>However, if Europe does indeed slip into deflation – and clearly we must be conscious of the risk – what will the implications be for the region’s corporates? Obviously deflationary spells are negative for all businesses, regardless of size or sector. The real cost of debt rises, asset values decline and consumers defer spending on the grounds that a good or service might be acquired for cheaper tomorrow.</p>
<p>Even so, Mike Dunning, Head of European Corporates at Fitch Ratings believes that deflation poses a much greater risk for some types of business than it does others. “At one end of the scale, you’ve got large multinationals, the likes of Nestle and Siemens, who are diversified with core operations in strong economies,” says Dunning.</p>
<p>“It won’t be good for them, but it won’t be a dire situation either. At the other end of the scale, the small and mid-sized enterprise, we think will be hit very hard. Then in the middle, you’ve got corporates who are sitting in periphery countries which still need to rebalance following the sovereign debt crisis. We think they will be affected disproportionately, especially those in cyclical industries, because those economies are still struggling to emerge from recession and structurally rebalance so the impact of any deferral in consumption would be felt more acutely here than in Northern Europe.”</p>
<p>Corporates will not be completely bereft of options, should deflation begin to manifest itself in Europe in the next couple of years. Capital expenditure plans could be cut back to steady-state levels, for example, spending just enough to keep the business ticking over. Certain companies, those in research and development (R&amp;D) heavy sectors such as technology will be faced with a very unenviable predicament, however: cutting capex might cost them their competitive advantage.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen that with Japanese tech companies. They lost momentum and missed a number of technological shifts that were occurring globally because they were not spending enough on R&amp;D,” says Dunning. As such, companies in this sector would be closely monitored by the ratings agencies if deflation were to take hold.</p>
<p>These are budgeting decisions that reside outside of the treasurers remit, strictly speaking. However, treasurers should at the very least be cognisant of the options given that the strategy which is decided upon might, potentially, impact the whole spectrum of treasury activities from financing to risk mitigation and cash management.</p>
<h4 id=""in-the-dark"">In the dark</h4>
<p>If there is one thing that is certain in Europe at present, it is uncertainty. With numerous central banks across the world now engaging in beggar thy neighbour currency policies – the ECB being but the latest to join the conflict when QE was announced – there remains a distinct lack of clarity around where the market might take us in the coming months or even years. We can see already how this is going to play out in the currency markets. According to recent research by BofA Merrill, realised FX volatility has now reached its highest non-crisis level in two decades (<a href=""#chart-1"">see Chart 1</a>). The only other occasions in the past 20 years when the magnitude of currency swings have been higher were during the Russia and Asian crises of the late 1990s, and in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse.</p>

<p>In such an unpredictable environment, any kind of extended hedging strategy in which a treasurer uses forwards to lock in the rates could be beneficial or could be detrimental and play against their competitive advantages, says Yuri Polyakov, Head of Financial Risk Advisory at Lloyds Bank.</p>
<p>“When people see increased volatility there is a natural tendency to hedge more,” says Polyakov. “But if you follow that line of thinking and start hedging further forward, the corporate may find themselves in a situation where the market moves against them. That’s a lesson a lot of companies learnt just recently, following the fall in oil prices. Airlines should be happy right now that energy prices have halved. On the other hand, if they have hedged in the past 12-18 months and are locked in at higher prices, the capacity to put in additional hedges now is very limited.”</p>
<p>These experiences could, Polyakov believes, lend more consideration to the case for an options-based hedging strategy. The question of whether corporates should use options, and in what circumstances, has long been a matter of debate in the world of corporate risk management, of course. Typically, there are two camps. On one side, there are those treasurers who argue that there is not enough transparency in option instruments and that, coupled with the accounting complexities, does not make them an ideal instrument for corporate hedging purposes. Other treasurers, meanwhile, take a more positive view. For them options are a useful instrument and have enough internal strength to be able to demonstrate to the board that there are certain situations in which they are the most suitable strategies to deploy.</p>
<p>The latter group’s case is becoming ever more difficult to counter with everything we are seeing taking place in the Eurozone at the moment. “I think in the current market conditions the case for considering options-based hedging is becoming stronger,” says Polyakov. Moreover, those who already use options are realising that they need to be smarter in the way that they use the instruments. Often, such instruments are most effective when only used to hedge the big moves in the market, rather than day-to-day volatility. “This calls for a risk management strategy which will clearly define the ability of the business to take a little bit of uncertainty, and only hedge the uncertainty beyond that,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""whats-the-plan"">What’s the plan?</h4>
<p>Options contracts are undoubtedly useful instruments in today’s uncertain markets. As we all know, there are some risks that derivatives cannot hedge, however. Greece leaving the Eurozone is one such example.</p>
<p>What is needed instead is good contingency planning, says Dimitris Papathanasiou, Coca-Coca HBC’s Financial Risk Manager. Coca-Cola HBC used to be headquartered in Athens but moved to Switzerland in April 2013 following the initial outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis. But with an operational footprint retained in Greece, the trauma of a Grexit and treasury’s options in terms of limiting the fall out is something Papathanasiou has given much thought to.</p>
<p>“There are many elements in a contingency plan that a corporate could look at,” he says. Perhaps the most important of these is cash. First and foremost treasurers would want all of their assets to be outside of the country (<a href=""#chart-2"">see Chart 2</a>) – which is near impossible, of course – and would want external liabilities to be locally denominated. But there are a whole host of other areas that could be affected, from payment issues, to supply chain stability to credit issues with your customers. There is no ambiguity around what Papathanasiou deems to be the principle concern, however. “When putting together a contingency plan the big thing on your mind is how you can keep on working with a local banking system facing trouble,” he adds. “In general we try not to keep balances in the country. We have always used a centralised cash management pool, so fortunately we have a relationship only with highly rated international banks.”</p>

<p>Before one can draft their plan, one must first understand the impact of events in question. This is of fundamental importance, suggests Lloyds’ Polyakov. “The one exercise I would encourage everyone to do is to assume it does happen and then try to understand the potential impact,” he notes. Take, for example, a treasurer at a European multinational with a subsidiary in Greece. If, after analysis has been performed, the treasurer concludes that revenues from that region will halve in the eventuality that Greece leaves the euro but the overall impact on company earnings is only marginal, the company may be in a position to take that hit. Meanwhile, if the data shows company earnings will be impacted significantly, a more protective strategy might be required.</p>
<p>“A good example is how people are dealing with what happened in Russia recently,” says Polyakov. “There are plenty of companies who have seen earnings in Russia halve. However, some of these same companies remain very focused on the market and a couple that have actually increased their inventory. They will tell you it’s about positioning and that they are prepared to take the volatility.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>What does Polyakov believe the strategy should be to deal with risk events of significant impact? “If there is no way you can possibly hedge it,” he says, “you need to create enough liquidity and enough expectations management so that the company can withstand the shock and move on to redefine the strategy in the new environment. If it does happen, understand the impact, make sure you have enough liquidity, deal with it and move forward.”</p>
<h3 id=""think-the-unthinkable"">Think the unthinkable</h3>
<p>Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s new and rather eccentric finance minister recently likened Greece’s position to the line in the Eagles Song ‘Hotel California’ in which Joe Walsh sings “you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.”</p>
<p>The message was unmistakeable. Greece, he wants the world to know, is not going anywhere despite the rising speculation in the midst of negotiations with the Troika. Leaving the euro would just be too painful for all parties, not to mention difficult considering there is no mechanism in place for forcing a country out of the euro (nor, for that matter, to guide a country who wants to leave of its own accord). But like Victor Hugo once wrote in Les Misérables, “Nothing is more imminent than the impossible. What we must always foresee is the unforeseen.” That, particularly at this moment in time, would seem to be the perfect motto for corporate treasury professionals with interests in Europe.</p></div>

<p>What is known as modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the remaining Anatolian parts of the defeated Ottoman Empire. Following a period of one-party rule, the number of political parties has expanded in the country, although democracy has been interrupted by instability and military coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980, and an ouster of the Islamic-oriented government in 1997.</p>
<p>Turkey’s economy is predominantly free-market based and is led by its industry and service sectors, with its traditional agricultural segment also accounting for a significant portion of employment. In recent years the automotive, construction and electronics industries have played an increasingly important role in the economy, overtaking the textiles sector, which has traditionally been one of Turkey’s key exports. Turkey’s primary import trading partners are Russia, Germany, China and the USA, and its top export trading partners are Germany, Iraq, the UK and Italy. The country applies the EU customs code, and has free trade agreements with a number of countries, including the EU and the European Free Trade Association.</p>
<p>In May 2014, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time in a year, dropping the rate half a percent to 9.5%. Although some economists were critical of the reduction, claiming it could lead to Turkey exceeding its 5% inflation target, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan argued the opposite – that the rate cut was not bold enough to stimulate investment.</p>
<p>Erdogan’s comments caused concern in some quarters about the government putting political pressure on the central bank. But the debate over stimulating economic growth also put the spotlight on Turkey’s recent record of growth. Though the country registered GDP growth of 2.17% in 2013, it had been as high as 9.2% in 2010, and as low as -4.8% in 2009. Indeed, Turkey has fluctuated between positive and negative economic growth since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>In the near term, there is reason for cautious optimism. In a May 2014 research note, analysts at Morgan Stanley said they expected GDP growth in Turkey to remain limited to 2.5% in 2014, but to recover in 2015, reaching up to 3.9% for the year.</p>
<h3 id=""household-debt-challenge"">Household debt challenge</h3>
<p>One threat to Turkey’s growth is the country’s level of debt, both corporate and consumer. “After the global financial crisis, we saw significant growth on the personal lending side. Some of this has come at a time where rates have been significantly lower – mid- and high-single digits – than rates have been historically in Turkey,” says David Aserkoff, an Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>Turkish household debt as a share of disposable income has rocketed from 7.5% in 2003 to 55.2% in 2013. “This rapid acceleration in loan growth suggests to us that it will become more difficult for the country to engineer domestic-demand driven growth in the coming years,” says Celal Celikcan, Country Treasurer at Citibank Turkey. The government has even gone as far as to urge Turks against using credit cards, and the banking regulator has put in place caps on card limits.</p>
<p>“The significant increase in the debt levels outstanding we have seen did not proportionally increase the payment burden, as rates were low. Now rates are rising, and the central bank is starting to put macro-prudential regulation on the banks to limit consumer lending. We do not think that it’s a significant problem, but it is something a lot of investors are watching more closely now than they did say, a year ago,” adds Aserkoff. Investors are also likely to be watching movements in the lira exchange rate.</p>
<h3 id=""lira-liquidity"">Lira liquidity</h3>
<p>The Turkish lira (TRY) is relatively liquid for an emerging market currency, with the spot market estimated to have a daily volume of around $10 billion. “Volume- and liquidity-wise the TRY spot market can be said to be one of the leaders of the emerging markets, along with the MXN, BRL and RUB,” says Citi’s Celikcan.</p>
<p>The TRY has weakened against the USD since 2013. “The currency has depreciated a lot over the last year, from around 1.80 to around 2.10, where we are now. That’s a 15% move in a year, and it was even higher – as weak as 2.30. Higher rates at the central bank have helped steady it, and the slightly better environment for emerging market FX in the last couple of months has also helped steady it,” says J.P. Morgan’s Aserkoff. “Turkey does have significant export competitiveness again, so to a certain extent the drop in the currency has been a positive, and I think going forward we should expect a relatively firm Turkish lira,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""payments-landscape"">Payments landscape</h3>
<p>Turkey’s payment infrastructure is reasonably advanced. Furthermore, two developments in recent years – one on the infrastructural side and the other on the regulatory side – have laid the foundations for an even more advanced payments network in the future. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has recently made a significant change to the country’s payments and securities settlement systems by differentiating transfers between customers and transfers between banks. The move is intended to make the system more flexible, effective and technologically efficient.</p>
<p>In addition, the ‘Law on Payment and Security Reconciliation Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Organisation,’ passed in June 2013, introduced a new regulatory landscape covering the principles and procedures of payment and security reconciliation systems, payment services, payment organisation and electronic money organisation. Within this framework, new definitions and license requirements were established, requiring certain organisations to take further action in order to achieve regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>The four largest banks operating in Turkey – Türkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, Türkiye Is Bankası (Isbank), TC Ziraat Bankası AS and Akbank – control more than half of the banking sector’s total assets. Three of the largest seven banks in Turkey – TC Ziraat Bankası, Halkbank and Vakifbank – are state‑owned. In all there are 47 banks operating in Turkey, of which 13 are investment banks. For banks operating in Turkey, the repatriation of capital is subject to the approval of the country’s Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency.</p>
<p>Several Turkish banks already have the infrastructure in place to enable mobile P2P payments. Given Turkey’s young population (see the section on demographics below), and the large number of mobile telephones in use in the country (almost 68 million according to the CIA’s World Factbook, ranking Turkey 20<sup>th</sup> in the world by number of mobile phones in use), a proliferation in mobile payments seems inevitable. As of May 2013, 15 banks in Turkey offered mobile banking services.</p>
<p>The use of cheques is gradually declining in Turkey, although they are still widely used for high value corporate payments. The use of direct debits is possible in Turkey, although they are still not widespread.</p>
<p>The ‘Law on Payments and Securities Settlement Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions,” introduced by the central bank, provides legal support to developments in the payments area and has strengthened financial stability by supporting the efficient and uninterrupted operation of these systems. Further regulation supporting the use of electronic payments is expected, which should drive growth in the space.</p>
<p>Bank regulation is handled by Turkey’s Banking Regulation and Supervisory Agency. Transactions between residents and non-residents must be reported to the central bank, and banks are responsible for submitting transaction data to the central bank on behalf of their corporate clients. Turkey’s Central bank operates TIC-RTGS, the country’s real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system. It also operates a retail RTGS payment for the consumer space, which was launched at the end of 2012. Cross-border payment instructions are channelled through SWIFT; settlement takes place through accounts with correspondent banks abroad.</p>

<p>Turkey is relatively well developed in terms of cash management services, with a wide range of products available, including electronic banking, payments, liquidity management and information monitoring, as well as traditional accounts payable and accounts receivable tools. An increasing number of banks in Turkey are also capable of building more complex products by integrating different product sets, including the provision of e-invoice integration for payments, card integration for direct debits, and payments with e-signatures and mobile signatures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This should be a great country to invest in, and companies that have got it right so far have done incredibly well.”</p>
<p><cite>David Aserkoff, Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While traditional liquidity and investment products are widely available in the Turkish market, and the provision of more complex services is increasing, the range of sophisticated products on offer remains limited. However, changes in the regulatory landscape have allowed some local players to develop domestic and cross-border cash concentration solutions, albeit restricted to a certain extent by Turkish tax law and fiscal policy. Turkish corporates therefore lag slightly behind their European peers in terms of the cash and liquidity management solutions and investment products they can call upon.</p>
<p>Demand and time deposits are available in TRY, as well as in several major foreign currencies. Time deposits in Turkey typically have maturities of one, three, six or 12 months. Equities and corporate bonds are settled on a T+2 basis. Government securities settle on either the trade date, or on a negotiated settlement date.</p>
<p>Single-currency cash concentration is allowed in Turkey on an in-country basis between resident and non-resident entities. Cross-border cash concentration is also allowed, although owing to exchange controls its use is somewhat limited. Notional pooling, however, is not permitted in the country.</p>
<p>From a taxation perspective, the standard corporate tax rate in Turkey is 20%; capital gains by resident companies in Turkey are also taxed at this rate. There are no tax rules governing cash pooling arrangements in the country.</p>
<p>The Turkish government’s plans to make Istanbul an international financial hub should boost the provision of cash management services over the coming years. Another development that would undoubtedly boost the sophistication of cash management in the country would be EU membership.</p>
<p>Turkey has made a bid for accession to the European Union (EU), although potential full EU membership is generally considered to be a number of years away. Should it be approved, one of the key and immediate benefits would likely be that it would give foreign investors in the country a much greater sense of stability.</p>
<p>Turkey is a republican parliamentary democracy. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), has been in office since 2003, and Abdullah Gul has been president since 2007. Many have tipped the AKP to win the next parliamentary elections in June 2015, in which case Erdogan could move over to the presidency, and Gul could move in the opposite direction into the premiership.</p>
<p>And Turkey’s economic and political future looks reasonably bright, at least judging by the country’s demographic profile.</p>
<h3 id=""demographics-triple-crown"">Demographics: triple crown</h3>
<p>One of the country’s key strengths is its demographics. “Turkey wins the demographics triple crown,” says J.P. Morgan’s Aserkoff. “With its large population, population growth, and high per-capita GDP, Turkey matters. MNCs need a Turkey strategy. The country has done a great job, since the crisis began, in diversifying its export base out of Europe into MENA and the rest of Africa. Now that Turkey is rebounding we’re seeing Turkish exports into Europe growing again quite quickly and double-digit year-on-year gains into markets like Germany and Italy. The population continues to grow. This should be a great country to invest in, and companies that have got it right so far have done incredibly well. It’s pretty obvious that the opportunities are massive,” he says.</p>
<p>Turkey’s young population alone – the median age is below 30 – is a key indicator of the opportunities its demographics present. But beyond its demographic strengths, the country also benefits from its key geographic positioning.</p>
<p>“As a natural bridge between both east and west, and north and south, Turkey creates an efficient platform to major markets across Europe, Eurasia, the Middle East and North Africa. Having such a strategic location, multinationals increasingly look to Turkey as a growth engine for their regional business. Turkey offers a robust platform for economic expansion on a regional scale, enabling MNCs to leverage local capabilities,” explains Citi’s Celikcan.</p>
<p>He says basing a regional corporate hub in Turkey has several key advantages. “Turkey provides access to 56 countries and multiple markets with a combined GDP of $25 trillion within a four-hour flight distance. The country also has extensive trade agreements with countries in the region and a vibrant business sector with a business-friendly investment environment,” he adds.</p>
<p>Given Turkey’s demographic and geographic advantages alone, MNCs without a Turkey strategy would be wise to start drawing one up now.</p>

<p>Turkey has recovered from deep economic crisis by undertaking a series of reforms. Throughout the 1990s, the Turkish economy was characterised by very high inflation and economic instability. The most severe crises were those in 1999 and 2001, the latter almost bringing the country’s banking system to its knees. In the wake of the 2001 crisis, fiscal policy, structural reforms and monetary policies were successfully implemented, supported by a stand-by programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The country continues to capitalise on these pro-business reform measures. The double-digit inflation that was holding back growth (consumer price index (CPI) stood at 68.5% in 2001) was reduced to single digit inflation by 2004 and the prospects for EU accession began to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).</p>
<p>Despite the global economic crisis, Turkey attracted nearly $9 billion FDI at 2010 and $83 billion of FDI in the past eight years, which shows an excellent indicator of the Turkish economy’s strength today.</p>

<h4 id=""legal-and-regulatory-requirements"">Legal and regulatory requirements</h4>
<p>Due to the IMF-backed programme and EU accession aspirations, legal and regulatory regimes in Turkey are broadly comparable with those in Western Europe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The banking sector is overseen by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA, known locally as BDDK). The BRSA was established in 2000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is responsible for maintaining price stability. The CBRT also administers exchange controls and regulations together with the Turkish Treasury, though the exchange regime is quite liberal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In compliance with central bank reporting regulations, all transactions between residents and non-residents need to be reported each month, as do overseas FX transactions exceeding $50,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally accepted accounting standards – International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) – were introduced for listed Turkish companies on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2006 and became a legal requirement for all companies from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2007.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Taxpayers whose legal or business centres are in Turkey, ie ‘residents’, are subject to taxes on their worldwide income. If neither the legal nor business centres are in Turkey, the company is classified as ‘non-resident’ and is therefore subject only to tax on income generated within Turkey.</p>
<h4 id=""taxation=framework"">Taxation framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The standard rate of corporate income tax for the 10/11 year is 20%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest on deposits is subject to 15% withholding tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withholding Tax: Withholding tax will be applicable when borrowing from offshore non-financial institutions. Under the Corporate Tax law, interest payments arising from loans received from abroad are subjected to withholding tax rate as shown below;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Banks and Financial Institutions: 0%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others: 10%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non finance companies and special purpose vehicles established in ‘tax haven’ countries: 30% (withholding tax rate for the others is not applicable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International institutions and governments: 0% Turkish corporate tax law imposes a debt/equity ratio of 3:1 for thin capitalisation.This ratio is increased to 6:1 for related-party financial institutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 1<sup>st</sup> January 2007, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model transfer pricing guidelines came into effect in Turkey. All commercial transactions between related parties must therefore be documented and made at arm’s length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banking and insurance transactions are subjected to BITT (Banking and Insurance Transaction Tax) and also are exempted from VAT.</p>

<p>There are currently 48 banks operating in Turkey, of which 20 are foreign-owned and three are state-owned. The largest of the commercial banks is Garanti Bank as of year end 2010. There are also four participation banks, which are banks using Islamic finance techniques.</p>
<p>There has been some consolidation in the market since 2000, when 79 banks were in operation. Approximately 30% of the country’s total banking assets is owned by the state.</p>
<p>Foreign banks have brought new technologies with them, making the country increasingly attractive to new investors. Internet banking, for example, is now widely used not only for payments but also for balance reporting and account statements.</p>

<h4 id=""payments"">Payments</h4>
<p>The main payment methods in use in Turkey are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cash.</h5>
<p>Still the preferred choice for retail payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Credit transfers.</h5>
<p>Mainly used for corporate transactions but also for payment of salaries/pensions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct debits.</h5>
<p>Usage is limited but new facilities are being developed to widen adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheque.</h5>
<p>Still fairly popular. In 2009, 21.5m cheques were processed by the clearing houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Card payments.</h5>
<p>Usage has increased significantly and Visa and MasterCard are the principal issuers. By the end of 2010, 46.9m credit cards and 69.9m debit cards had been issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Promissory notes.</h5>
<p>A popular instrument among local Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""clearing-and-settlement"">Clearing and settlement</h4>
<p>The Turkish payments structure is made up of three main systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>TIC-RTGS.</h5>
<p>The Turkish real-time gross settlement system which is operated by the Central Bank and used for all domestic electronic payments. Settlement is same day with immediate finality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Interbank Clearing Houses (ICHs).</h5>
<p>A network of 22 Inter-bank Clearing Houses, which process and settle cheque payments. Cheques are truncated and processed electronically. Clearing is same day but settlement does not take place until the following day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Inter-bank Card Centre (BKM).</h5>
<p>A commercial bank-owned centre which processes and settles all card payments by electronic net settlement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A giro system run by the post office is also used to process electronic payments not covered by the TIC-RTGS.</p>

</div>
<p class=""management-summary"">Vestel Electronics, with 24 companies, is the leading player in Turkey and global markets in consumer electronics, white goods and digital products segments. Vestel ranks among the world’s biggest original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers. Vestel is the second largest exporter of Turkey.</p>
<h4 id=""the-challenge"">The challenge</h4>
<p>Vestel operating with nine foreign trade companies across Europe in multiple market segments, ranks among the top three manufacturers of LCD TV and among the top ten manufacturers of home appliances generating a significant revenue stream.</p>
<p>Vestel wanted to centralise cash received from exports in several European countries. As part of the same goal, Vestel needed easier electronic access to account balances to monitor and manage liquidity centrally and to enable more accurate cashflow forecasting. An associated aim was to streamline Vestel’s payables process, minimise costs and automate reconciliation of export proceeds. Vestel’s second objective was to improve working capital cycle by financing open account import transactions.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution"">The solution</h4>
<p>Citi offered a number of solutions to increase visibility, to mobilise and optimise liquidity. Firstly, through Citi’s TreasuryVision<sup>®</sup> cash management platform, Vestel is able to monitor third party bank and Citi accounts and is also able to review its regional working capital positions at a consolidated level.</p>
<p>Secondly, using CitiDirect<sup>®</sup> online banking Vestel is able to manage its payables smoothly through a single platform, customise payment authorisation levels and access all entity accounts for reporting and payment activities.</p>
<p>Thirdly, using target balancing and account receivables matching, Vestel has automated the centralisation of cash in London for seven countries and consolidated its export receivables. Citi’s integrated account receivable matching tool will enable increased operational efficiency for Vestel.</p>
<p>As a final solution, Citi offered import factoring to provide short-term financing for import transactions. This solution improves the working capital cycle without increasing import costs, while creating operational efficiencies for Vestel.</p>
<h4 id=""the-result"">The result</h4>
<p>Vestel has benefited from real-time online global visibility of all its accounts, optimisation of liquidity and improved workflow management as a result of the solutions designed and implemented by Citi. Vestel and Citi, whose business relationship started in 2003, have strengthened their partnership further during this project.</p>
</div>
<h4 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h4>
<p>Whereas traditional liquidity and investment products are widely available in the Turkish market, few sophisticated products are on offer. However, the changing regulatory landscape and pro-business outlook has allowed local players to develop domestic and cross-border cash concentration solutions. Notional pooling is not permissible in Turkey but single currency and one-country pooling are available.</p>
<p>Local businesses are also focusing on their cash conversion cycles as concerns grow around the tightening credit climate. Optimisation of the supply chain is a particularly popular topic among SMEs as the sector has been playing an ever more important role in the country’s expanding trade volumes. Companies are seeking to decrease processing times and increase efficiency.</p>
<p>While local corporates continue to improve their business acumen through experience and foreign input (both capital and intellectual) there is, however, still ample opportunity to invest and get ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>In terms of short term investment, interest may be earned on current and deposit accounts. Accounts can be held in both Turkish lira and foreign currency domestically and abroad, although currency conversion restrictions apply in rare cases.</p>

<p>Switzerland suffered a recession in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis. The Swiss National Bank reacted quickly, lowering interest rates in a bid to boost the economy and stabilise the Swiss franc. The government implemented a number of fiscal stimulus programmes, including a rescue package for one of the country’s largest banks, which suffered heavy losses as a result of the crisis.</p>
<figure class=""photo left""><img alt=""Photo of a snowy mountain scenery in Switzerland"" height=""200"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/10/2010-10-tt-03-cp-matterhorn-switzerland-scenery-299x200.jpg"" width=""299""/></figure>
<p>Switzerland has one of the most powerful economies in the world, ranking top in the World Economic Forum’s latest Global Competitiveness Report. The country’s main exports are chemicals, electronics and precision instruments (including watches). Switzerland is also famous for its banking industry; however, it has come under increasing pressure to review its long tradition of bank secrecy. As one of the most legally and politically stable countries globally, Switzerland has always attracted businesses and today is a major location for regional treasury and trade hubs.</p>
<h3 id=""legal-and-regulatory-requirements"">Legal and regulatory requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Banks in Switzerland are regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). FINMA supervises most banking-related activities as well as insurance companies, stock exchanges, securities dealers and other financial institutions. FINMA is a merger of three regulatory bodies – the Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI), the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC) and the Anti-Money Laundering Control Authority. Its aim is to protect creditors and investors, and to ensure the general functioning of the financial markets in accordance with financial market legislation, in order to enhance Switzerland’s competitiveness as a financial centre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is Switzerland’s central bank. The National Bank Act (NBA) of 2003 is the basis on which the SNB operates, and it outlines minimum capital reserve requirements for the bank. The SNB is responsible for the country’s monetary policy and for overseeing the clearing system, SIC. Its primary goal is to ensure price stability in order to create an environment for economic growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codified by the Swiss Banking Act of 1934, the principle of bank secrecy is considered one of the central aspects of banking in Switzerland, and is something to which all market participants must adhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no restrictions on the import and export of capital (foreign exchange controls).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switzerland is a free-market economy and, in principle, no price controls exist. It is one of the most stable legal and political systems globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switzerland is a federal republic of 26 cantons with responsibility for healthcare, welfare, law enforcement, education and tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switzerland took first place in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness report 2009-2010 due to its market and political stability, innovation, business culture, effective and transparent public institutions, infrastructure and labour market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switzerland was placed third (behind Norway and Luxembourg) in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Global Quality of life Index 2009. Scored well for political freedom and civil liberties, life expectancy, job security and governance (not well evaluated for family life, though).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The global hub for private banking and regional headquarters of global non-European multinationals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no formal transfer pricing legislation in place in Switzerland; however, all related-party transactions between Swiss entities must be carried out at arm’s length. Switzerland adheres to the OECD guidelines on transfer pricing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of thin capitalisation rules, minimum equity ratio requirements are in place for each asset class. For example, receivables may be debt financed by 85%, investments by 70% and intellectual property by 70%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""taxation-framework"">Taxation framework</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Companies with their registered office in Switzerland are considered resident for tax purposes. Resident companies are taxed on their worldwide income, except for profits derived from foreign branches or foreign immovable property, which are exempt. Non-resident companies are taxed on profit derived from branches and immovable property located in Switzerland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corporate income tax is payable on net profits. Tax is levied at both the federal and cantonal/communal level. The federal tax rate is 8.5%; however, income and capital taxes are deductible, resulting in an effective federal tax rate of 7.8%. The tax rate levied at cantonal level varies from canton to canton, resulting in a combined effective tax rate of around 13-22%, depending on the place of residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capital gains on the sale of assets are treated as ordinary income. Capital gains derived from the sale of a stake of at least 20% (10% from January 2011) in a resident or non-resident company will benefit from participation relief, provided that stake has been held for more than a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switzerland’s holding company regime grants tax privileges to companies whose assets primarily (at least two-thirds) consist of investments in subsidiaries, and that conduct no other business activities in the country. Any such company benefiting from the holding company privilege is exempt from cantonal/communal tax, resulting in an effective income tax rate on non-dividend income of 7.8%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mixed company tax privilege is granted to companies with predominantly foreign business activities. This applies if at least 80% of the income is derived from foreign sources and if at least 80% of business expenses are incurred abroad. Foreign income of a mixed company is therefore taxed at an effective rate of 9-11%, while any income derived from Switzerland is taxed at the usual rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Confederation levies withholding tax, which is deducted at source from distributions made by Swiss entities at the following rates: pension fund benefits – 15%; insurance benefits – 8%; ‘investment income’ – 35% (including corporate dividends and interest from bank accounts, bonds and debt instruments). This can be reduced to 0% under a tax treaty with some countries. Switzerland currently has in place more than 80 double taxation treaties. Under the Switzerland-EU Savings Agreement, a reduced rate of 20% is applicable on the returns on savings of citizens of EU member states, and no withholding tax is levied on cross-border dividend payments between related companies residing in EU member states and Switzerland that meet the relevant criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard rate of VAT is 7.6% (8% from January 2011). Certain goods and services qualify for a reduced rate of 2.4% (2.5% from January 2011) and others are exempt altogether.</p>

<h4 id=""local-banking-sector"">Local banking sector</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Swiss banking system is based on the model of ‘universal banking’. This means that all banks can provide all services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two banks account for over 50% of the value of the balance sheet of Switzerland’s entire banking sector: they are UBS and Credit Suisse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 24 cantonal banks in Switzerland, which are either fully or majority owned by the country’s 26 cantons and half-cantons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regional banks in Switzerland are universal banks that voluntarily restrict their activities to a specific region, offering the benefit of customer proximity and localised knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private banks in Switzerland operate as individually-owned firms, collective and limited partnerships, and are among the oldest banks in the country. They generally do not publicly offer to accept savings deposits, but provide asset management services to private clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are more than 160 institutions in Switzerland considered foreign-controlled banks organised under Swiss law and branches of foreign banks, according to the Swiss National Bank statistics as of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2009.</p>

<p>In terms of volume and value, electronic credit transfers are the most popular form of business payment, although small companies still tend to use paper-based credit transfers.</p>

<li>
<h5>Cards.</h5>
<p>There has been significant growth in the use of payment cards in recent years.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study"">Case study</h2>
<h3 id=""rapid-integration-following-cadbury-acquisition"">Rapid integration following Cadbury acquisition</h3>
<img alt=""Kraft Foods"" class=""logo org"" height=""33"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/kraft-foods-logo-2010-100x33.png"" width=""100""/>
<p class=""company-profile"">Kraft Foods is the world’s second largest food company with annual revenues of $48 billion. The company sells 11 brands with revenues exceeding $1 billion, including: Kraft, Jacobs, LU, Maxwell House, Cadbury, Trident, Milka and Philadelphia. More than 40 of its brands are at least 100 years old, among them Toblerone.</p>
<h4 id=""the-challenge"">The challenge</h4>
<p>Following its $18.9 billion acquisition of Cadbury earlier this year, Kraft Foods wanted to integrate the Cadbury business units into its European cash pool structures (account opening, target balancing, CitiDirect® online banking) for cross border and foreign currency payments and receipts.</p>
<p>The EMEA project encompassed the opening of 89 new bank accounts at Citi London and three new bank accounts at Citi Toronto for 37 different Cadbury entities. All accounts needed access to CitiDirect. In addition, 76 new accounts held by 26 entities needed to be added to Kraft Foods’ existing target balancing arrangement. Being able to offer full integration of Cadbury’s ERP with CitiDirect for import/export of payment files and bank statements was also a requirement. The timescale for the project was tight: accounts representing the majority of Cadbury’s turnover needed to be integrated within three months of the start of the project.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution"">The solution</h4>
<p>Rigorous planning, co-ordination and precise execution were critical, given the ambitious implementation timetable. Given the scale and breadth of the project, there was considerable legal documentation. Before the first project meeting Citi obtained a list of Cadbury entities joining Kraft Foods’ cash pool so that a list of documentation required for every entity could be prepared. Once the project was launched, Citi specialists held calls by region with Cadbury treasuries to go through – line-by-line where necessary – their documentation queries. Both parties appointed specific documentation managers. Kraft Foods was supported by Citi with regular conference calls throughout implementation.</p>
<h4 id=""the-result"">The result</h4>
<p>Citi’s substantial resource commitment to the integration of Cadbury to Kraft Foods’ cash management structure ensured that all deadlines were met. Kraft Foods made full use of the knowledge available at Cadbury business units, in many cases before key staff left. Most importantly, Kraft Foods gained rapid control over Cadbury’s cash – an essential requirement given the significant cost of the acquisition. The EMEA project was implemented concurrently with initiatives for North America and Latin America.</p>
<p>Kraft Foods’ positive experience of the project has prompted it to consider other projects together with Citi. “It was great to work with a team that consistently delivered high-quality services and often made the seemingly impossible possible for us” says the Kraft Foods International Treasury Team.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""clearing-and-settlement"">Clearing and settlement</h3>
<p>In Switzerland, payment transactions are handled primarily by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), commercial banks and PostFinance (the banking arm of the Swiss Post Office). The country’s clearing system (SIC) is operated by SIX Interbank Clearing on behalf of and under survey of the Swiss National Bank (SNB).</p>
<h4 id=""sic-swiss-interbank-clearing"">SIC – Swiss Interbank Clearing</h4>
<p>Switzerland has a single clearing system, SIC, which handles both high-value interbank payments and low-value retail payments. SIC was launched by a working group of Swiss banks in 1987 and is operated by SIX Interbank Clearing – a private sector enterprise jointly owned by the Swiss banks. In total, 447 banks now participate in SIC, 108 of which are outside Switzerland. In 2009, SIC settled 386m transactions worth a total of CHF 59.8 billion.</p>
<p>SIC is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system which incorporates a queuing system. In any balance transfer, the sending bank must hold the necessary reserve balance in its account with the Swiss National Bank. A pending transfer may be held in a queue while the necessary funds accumulate from incoming payments. All transactions are final and irrevocable upon execution.</p>
<p>Collections via Direct Debit are also settled through SIC – this service is called LSV+; as are B2B Direct Debit collections – this service is called BDD.</p>
<h4 id=""eurosic"">euroSIC</h4>
<p>Euro payments in Switzerland are cleared via an online system called euroSIC. Switzerland is not a direct participant of TARGET2, which links all the euro clearing systems within the Eurozone. Instead, the Swiss Euro Clearing Bank Gmbh (SECB) in Frankfurt supervises euroSIC and provides the link to TARGET2 through its membership of the German RTGSplus clearing system.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-pooling"">Cash pooling</h3>
<p>A recent amendment to the withholding tax and stamp duty rules was introduced by the Federal Council in June 2010 in order to make it easier for companies to set up cash pooling structures in Switzerland. Previously, many corporates were discouraged from establishing cash pools in the country as collective fund borrowing activities would attract withholding tax on interest payments, and in some cases, stamp duty as well.</p>
<p>Under the new amendment, intragroup financing will fall outside the scope of collective fund borrowing activities and will therefore be excluded from withholding tax and stamp duty. The new amendment became effective from 1<sup>st</sup> August 2010 and it is hoped that it will help Switzerland to become a more attractive location for multinational companies to establish their cash pooling structures.</p>

<p>The Swiss stock exchange (SIX Swiss Exchange) was formed in 1995 from a merger between three existing exchanges located in Geneva, Basel and Zurich. As one of the world’s most technologically-advanced securities exchanges, SIX Swiss Exchange has an integrated electronic trading platform. In 1999 it launched the electronic SWX repo market and SWX New Market – a high-growth market. In 1998, in a joint venture with Deutsche Börse AG, SIX Swiss Exchange launched Eurex, the first transnational derivatives exchange</p>

<p>France is the world’s second-largest agricultural producer after the US, with 70% of its exports going to other EU member states. Agriculture as a share of the country’s GDP is declining, however. The services sector, for example, is steadily increasing its share of the country’s economic activity and is responsible for the vast majority of new job creation in recent years. France has a strong tourist industry and is the world’s number-one tourist destination, receiving around 80m foreign visitors each year.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the global financial crisis, the French government passed a €26 billion stimulus plan which allocated investment in infrastructure and tax relief for small businesses. Further funds were set aside in order to protect French companies from foreign takeovers and to promote strategic investment in science and technology, for example. Having suffered from a recession in the aftermath of the crisis, the French economy was one of the first to return to growth, which it did so in Q2 2009.</p>
<h4 id=""legal-and-regulatory-requirements"">Legal and regulatory requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In France, licences for banks and investment firms operating in the country are granted by the Comité des établissements de crédit et des enterprises d’investissement (CECEI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Comité consultatif de la législation et de la réglementation financières (CCLRF) was set up in August 2003 to reorganise the regulation of the banking and insurance sectors. The CCLRF must review all legislature (including EU regulations and directives) relating to the banking, finance and insurance industries before they become law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign exchange controls no longer apply to non-residents looking to start or acquire a French business, unless the investment is considered direct (when the foreign investor acquires more than 20% of the capital of a French company). Under these circumstances, the investment will be subject to the control of the authorities. Investment in areas such as national defence or public health also requires prior approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounting standards in France are in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. In January 2010 the Autorité des Normes Comptables (ANC) replaced the Conseil National de la Comptabilité (CNC) as the body responsible for overseeing France’s national accounting standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France has implemented anti-money laundering legislation which comprises the three EU money laundering directives. France is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and as such observes most of the FATF-49 standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""taxation-framework"">Taxation framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A territorial tax system operates in France, meaning that tax is imposed only on profits made by a resident or non-resident enterprise operating in France. The taxable income of such enterprises covers total income from business activities carried out in France, including interest, rent, royalties and capital gains. Resident companies are not normally subject to tax on income from foreign sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dividends received by a French parent company from its subsidiaries are 85% exempt from tax, providing the parent company has held no less than 5% of the capital of the subsidiary for at least two years. The remaining 5% is subject to the normal corporate income tax rate (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corporate income taxation (CIT) is imposed at a standard rate of 33.3%. A social contribution surcharge of 3.3% also applies on any CIT charge exceeding €763,000. Lower rates apply to SMEs that are at least 75% owned by individuals or other qualifying SMEs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withholding tax is applicable at 25% on dividends and 18% on interest paid to a non-resident company by a French company. However, under the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive, dividends paid by a French company to an EU parent company are exempt from withholding tax, providing the parent has held at least 10% of the French company for no less than two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VAT rates range between 2.1%, 5.5% and 19.6%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thin capitalisation rules state that interest paid to related parties is fully deductible providing the rate is calculated at arm’s length. Interest will not be fully deductible if it exceeds the following three thresholds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Related party debt/equity ratio of 1.5:1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25% of adjusted current profits for the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest income received from related parties (if the company uses the funds to finance other affiliated companies).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer pricing rules stipulate that in the event of a transaction not being carried out at arm’s length, profits may be adjusted by the French tax authorities.</p>

<h5>Direct debits.</h5>
<p>These are widely used for utility payments for instance as well as tax instalments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheques.</h5>
<p>Traditionally the most popular cashless payment instrument, cheques have declined significantly in favour of electronic payment methods, and their use is now mainly confined to retail. However, over 75% of the Eurozone’s cheque payments are effected in France.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Payment cards.</h5>
<p>Bank cards are now the most commonly used cashless payment instrument in France. E-money is also quite widely used, the most well known e-purse being Moneo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Other payments.</h5>
<p>A titre électronique de paiement (TEP) is an alternative to a direct debit; a titre interbancaire de paiement (TIP) is an inter-bank payment order for remote payments; a lettre de change relevé (LCR) is an electronic commercial trade bill, functioning much like a post-dated cheque; a billet à ordre relevé (BOR) is an electronically-processed promissory note.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""clearing-and-settlement"">Clearing and settlement</h4>
<p>France’s national clearing system is known as TARGET2-Banque de France. It is the country’s national component of the pan-European TARGET2 RTGS system and has fully replaced the existing Transferts Banque de France (TBF) and Paris Net Settlement (PNS) systems. The country’s multilateral deferred net settlement system for retail payments is known as CORE, which replaced the Système Interbancaire de Télécompensation (SIT). CORE is operated by Technological Systems for Exchanges and Processing (Systèmes Technologiques d’Échange et de Traitement – STET).</p>
<h4 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h4>
<p>French residents may hold foreign currency or euro-denominated accounts both domestically and abroad. Non-residents may open foreign or domestic currency accounts in France. Domestic currency accounts held by both residents and non-residents are convertible into foreign currency.</p>
<p>Cash concentration is permitted in France, and all the major banks offer cash concentration services. Any cash concentration arrangement must fulfil the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A single participant must control all companies participating in the cash pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All operations must be carried out at arm’s length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All participants must sign an agreement detailing the extent and conditions under which the pooling of cash may take place. The agreement must respect the corporate interest of each participant and must be authorised by a special deliberation of the board (conseil d’administration).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before submission to the board it is recommended that the agreement is submitted to the relevant auditors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above restrictions apply to cross border sweeps also.</p>

<h3 id=""unique-payment-and-liquidity-solution-for-western-europe-generates-improved-efficiency"">Unique payment and liquidity solution for Western Europe generates improved efficiency</h3>
<img alt=""Michelin logo"" class=""logo"" height=""37"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/michelin-logo-2010-120x37.png"" width=""120""/>
<p class=""management-summary"">Michelin is the world’s number-one tyre producer, manufacturing 177m tyres and 16m maps and guides in 2008.</p>
<p>In 2005, Michelin decided to select a single bank for mass payments and liquidity management for 14 western European countries, 22 entities, over 90 accounts and 1.2m transactions a year. The company wanted full centralisation and mobilisation of its subsidiaries’ cash with a goal of zero balancing for perfect optimisation of cash. As part of this goal, Michelin required strong forecasting tools and processes at country level to give its central treasury a complete visibility of its positions.</p>
<p>Michelin planned to automate and secure each subsidiary’s payments processes by rationalising the number of payments, formats, delivery channels and authorisation workflows. It also wanted to improve its shared service centre’s efficiency. Starting in 2006, Michelin also harmonised its Oracle ERP application across the region to ensure it had, among other things, a clean and updated beneficiaries’ database and mapping tools that allowed a fully automated integration and reconciliation of its bank statements.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution"">The solution</h4>
<p>Citi proposed a single, central, secured delivery channel and one file format for all western European mass payments, including suppliers, payroll and tax. A pan-European cash pool structure combining domestic zero balancing accounts and cross-border zero balancing accounts in major currencies was established in London. These accounts are fed to the ultimate header account at the end of each day.</p>
<p>A global electronic banking platform gave the treasurer of each subsidiary local control and visibility of payments. The solution included payroll monitoring and a payment calendar for other types of payment. A central customer service point of contact was established, with local language support where appropriate.</p>
<p>A central implementation manager and technical implementation manager were responsible for the project. The project was outlined in a legally binding service level agreement outlining every detail of the process as a safeguard against any misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Citi won the mandate in 2006, completing the first phase of implementation in September 2006. By the end of 2007 implementation was concluded within all of the initial countries covered by the project.</p>
<h4 id=""the-result"">The result</h4>
<p>As a result of the solution’s success – and Michelin’s close partnership with Citi – the solution was extended to Romania in 2008, Poland and Hungary in 2009, with North America to be added in 2010.</p>
<p>Michelin has achieved substantial cost efficiencies by reducing its payment costs, using its shared service centre effectively and optimising its cash utilisation. Working capital was improved by increasing the control and visibility of the company’s payments and liquidity. The project increased centralisation but it has also extended the responsibilities of local treasurers, whose support enabled successful implementation.</p>
</div>
<p>The legality of notional pooling is in doubt due to the difficulty under French law of establishing the legal validity of the cross guarantees within the framework of a multi-company pooling structure. This is required in order to enable the bank providing the pooling service to get legal right of set-off in the event of bankruptcy. Without this guarantee, the bank would be unable to net off balances within the pooling structure for the purpose of regulatory capital reporting.</p>
<h4 id=""short-term-investments"">Short-term investments</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Current accounts.</h5>
<p>Banks pay interest on deposit accounts and current accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Time deposits.</h5>
<p>Time deposits are offered with maturities ranging from overnight to medium term (maturities exceeding two years are rare). Interest is only paid on time deposits with maturities of one month or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Certificates of deposit (CDs).</h5>
<p>These are offered by banks. They usually have maturities of between three and six months and may have fixed or variable interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Commercial paper (billet de trésorie – BT).</h5>
<p>Offered by companies and public authorities, commercial paper is popular with commercial banks. Maturities range from a minimum of one day to a maximum of 12 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Mutual funds.</h5>
<p>Residents can transfer excess funds into mutual investment funds called OPCVMs (organismes de placement collectif en valeurs mobilières). They are a popular and a flexible method of short-term investment in money, bonds or equities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Treasury bills (bons du Trésor – T-bills).</h5>
<p>These are issued regularly by the Agence France Trésor to commercial banks and funds. Discounted T-bills have maturities ranging from two weeks to one year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Repos.</h5>
<p>France’s repo market is the busiest in the Eurozone. Repo maturities are generally between one day and one week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""market-trends"">Market trends</h4>
<h5 id=""the-end-of-etebac"">The end of ETEBAC</h5>
<p>Banks in France provide a range of electronic banking services, traditionally offering Échanges Télématiques Banque-Clients (ETEBAC) capabilities. ETEBAC is generally perceived as the most common method of bank connectivity for French corporates. At the beginning of 2008, however, Orange Business Service announced the end of the X25 network which supports the ETEBAC protocol. As a result, from September 2011 ETEBAC will no longer work.</p>
<p>The end of the X25 network will see the fixed-length payment file formats of ETEBAC 3 being replaced with variable formats such as XML ISO 20022, Idoc and Paymul. ETEBAC formats are not compatible with SEPA, whereas these new formats will allow a migration from domestic protocol to pan-European protocol under the SEPA initiative.</p>
<p>With the transition from ETEBAC, the French banking authorities have recommended SwiftNet and eBics (Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard) as possible replacements. eBics had been adopted in Germany since 2007. Other alternatives are e-based banking solutions, such as CitiDirect.</p>

<h3 id=""russia-an-economy-in-transition"">Russia – an economy in transition</h3>
<p>The dissolution of the USSR in 1991 marked the start of a long decline in Russia’s GDP as the country underwent transition to a market economy. This led to fiscal imbalance and culminated in a banking crisis in 1998. However, a variety of factors, including the devaluation of the rouble, tax reform and a tightening of fiscal policy, soon improved political and social stability and an increase in the price of Russia’s main exports (oil, petroleum products, gas and metals), contributed to the recovery of the country’s economy.</p>
<p>While the Russian economy was hit by the global economic crisis in 2008, the government took steps to mitigate the effects of the crisis, with a controlled devaluation of the rouble to respond to falling oil prices. Certain industrial sectors, including energy, transport and telecommunications, also received financial aid.</p>
<p>The government is also looking to invest in infrastructure and to take steps to diversify the country’s economy going forward. The recently reduced profit tax rate (from 24% to 20%) is among the lowest of the world’s major economies, and it is hoped that this will encourage investment in certain industries.</p>
<h3 id=""legal-and-regulatory-requirements"">Legal and regulatory requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resident accounts in domestic currency (RUB) are convertible and can be held domestically and abroad. Likewise, residents can also have foreign currency accounts both domestically and abroad, providing they notify the tax authorities. Non-residents are permitted to hold domestic and foreign currency accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central bank reporting is applicable to all payments between residents and non-residents alike. All reporting is handled by the banks themselves; however, companies are ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exchange rates are announced on a daily basis and are based on quotes for the RUB and other currencies against the USD. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has the power to intervene in the inter-bank currency exchanges and OTC inter-bank market in the event of any major discrepancies in the RUB exchange rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign investment in a domestic project or company considered to be strategically important is normally restricted to 49%. In sensitive strategic areas this is further limited to just 25%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) regulates market competition by ensuring compliance with Russia’s competition law. Any state aid granted to a commercial entity must first be approved by the FAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measures to tackle money laundering include the reporting of transfers between individuals exceeding RUB 600,000 and transactions with immovable assets exceeding RUB 3m to the Federal Financial Monitoring Service. In addition, the CBR keeps a close watch on the banking system. Banks are required to keep track of all money transfers that take place without the opening of an account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""taxation-framework"">Taxation framework</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The general corporate profits tax rate is 20% (having been reduced from 24% in response to the global economic crisis), consisting of a federal portion (2%) and a regional portion (13.5-18%). Companies are required to make monthly advance payments of profits tax, amounting to one-third of the quarterly advance payment for the previous quarter. Companies may choose to calculate advance payments on a monthly basis, taking into account actual cumulative profits from the beginning of the year to the end of the month in question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withholding tax at 15% is applicable on all dividends paid by Russian companies to their foreign parent. Dividends paid to Russian shareholders are subject to 9% withholding tax. All other types of income carry withholding tax of 20%, except for income from international freight, which is taxed at 10%. Withholding tax may be reduced under the terms of a double taxation treaty, of which Russia currently has more than 60.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value added tax (VAT) is payable quarterly by all corporate business (including offices and branches of foreign companies) registered with the Russian tax authorities, and individual entrepreneurs. The standard rate of VAT is 18%, although a reduced rate of 10% is applied to certain foods, children’s goods and medicines. Certain activities are exempt from VAT including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The lease of accommodation/office space to accredited foreign representatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical services and the sale of medical equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banking and insurance services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services of lawyers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of loans and gambling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer pricing rules apply to related parties in accordance with arm’s length prices. The Russian tax authorities may review transactions between related parties; the burden of proof is on the authorities to provide evidence that the price used is not the market price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thin capitalisation rules apply to interest paid to a foreign parent who holds more than 20% of the capital of the Russian company under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Russian company is in debt to the foreign company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Russian company is in debt to another Russian company affiliated with the foreign company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Russian company has a debt for which the foreign company/affiliated Russian company act as guarantor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the loan from the parent company is more than three times the Russian borrower’s capital, interest on any excess debt is not deductible.</p>
</li>

<h4 id=""local-banking-sector"">Local banking sector</h4>
<p>The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) was established in 1990 under the ‘Law on Banks and Banking’. The CBR plays a supervisory role over the Russian banking sector and is responsible for maintaining stability of the rouble.</p>
<p>Within the scope of the CBR’s role are the following: it is the sole issuer of roubles and manages currency circulation; it acts as the lender of last resort to credit institutions; it issues licenses to, regulates and supervises all credit institutions; it is also responsible for the continued functioning of payment systems.</p>
<p>The Russian banking sector is characterised by a very large number of small banks. During the early 1990s when banking regulations were looser than they are now, a large number of domestic banks were established.</p>
<p>The number of banking licences peaked at around 2,500 in 1995 and the banking sector has since continued to consolidate to around 1,100. Nevertheless a large proportion of the country’s banking assets (42.1%) is controlled by just five state-owned banks.</p>
<h4 id=""payments"">Payments</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cash.</h5>
<p>Cash is still used for 90% of all payments in Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Payment cards.</h5>
<p>These are the most common form of cashless payment instrument. There are around 119m cards in circulation, but their use is mainly concentrated in large cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Credit transfers.</h5>
<p>These are the second most widely used cashless payment instruments. The majority of transactions are carried electronically. Most credit transfers are processed by the BESP RTGS system or the CBR’s net settlement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct debits.</h5>
<p>The third most common form of cashless payment instrument, there are two main types of direct debit: payment requests and collection orders. The majority are processed by the CBR net settlement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheques.</h5>
<p>Rarely used, there are no central bank rules as to their usage and layout. Instead, cheques are administered by individual agreements between the credit institution and the customer. There is no inter-bank cheque clearing system currently in existence in Russia.</p>
</li>

</div>
<p class=""management-summary"">Diageo is the world’s leading premium drinks business and established its presence in Russia in the early 1990s.</p>
<h5 id=""the-challenge"">The challenge</h5>
<p>In 2008, Diageo Russia decided that it wanted its 100 distributors to take early delivery of November/December goods (the drinks industry’s peak period) in September/October to mitigate some operational challenges. In return, it offered the distributors extended credit. “As the financial environment worsened, the company became unwilling to assume a similar exposure in 2009 and sought an alternative solution to manage the risk while achieving the same operational objectives,” explains Selim Baraz, finance director for Russia and Eastern Europe Region for Diageo.</p>
<h5 id=""the-solution"">The solution</h5>
<p>Diageo Russia began negotiations with the Russian insurance company ROSNO (which is 97% owned by Allianz/Euler Hermes) to insure some of its exposure to the distributors in summer 2009.</p>
<p>“We rapidly recognised that this insurance policy afforded us a greater opportunity than simply managing the risk of our distributors,” says Baraz. “In early 2008, we had talked to Citi – our main bank in Russia and a long-time partner domestically and internationally – about receivables finance. However, given the exposure to a number of small domestic distributors the only possible solution at the time entailed full recourse, which failed to get the risk off our balance sheet, and was consequently rejected. The insurance policy made a non-recourse programme possible.”</p>
<p>Citi developed an innovative Credit Insurance Account Receivables programme that leveraged the cost of Diageo Russia’s insurance policy with ROSNO more effectively. “By combining ROSNO’s insurance with a factoring programme to monetise Diageo Russia’s receivables and improve cash flow, the company was able to achieve two objectives at once: managing risk and reducing working capital,” says Baraz.</p>
<h5 id=""the-result"">The result</h5>
<p>A deal between Citi and Diageo Russia was signed in mid-2009 and on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2009, a first tranche of receivables were financed through the Credit Insurance Account Receivables programme. The parties expect the programme to be expanded during 2010 to a wider universe of distributors.</p>
<p>Although documentation for the programme was time-consuming in order to meet the needs of Diageo Russia, ROSNO and Citi, implementation went smoothly. Diageo Russia has improved its working capital – and offloaded its receivables from its balance sheet – through a receivables financing programme that was feasible only because of Citi’s innovative risk sharing with ROSNO. Diageo Russia is currently considering whether the Credit Insurance Account Receivables programme can be replicated in other CIS markets.</p>
</div>
<h4 id=""clearing-and-settlement"">Clearing and settlement</h4>
<p>The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) oversees the country’s payment system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>BESP (Bank Electronic Speed Payment) RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system.</h5>
<p>This system was introduced by the CBR in December 2007 to manage the clearing of urgent, large value, RUB-denominated payments. Payment instructions are processed and settled individually in real-time across participants’ CBR settlement accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>CBR automated net settlement system.</h5>
<p>The majority of non-urgent, low value transactions are processed in batches in RUB by the CBR’s processing centre several times a day. There are 78 regional branches acting as processing centres, 59 of which carry out settlements on a centralised basis (the remainder operate on a decentralised basis).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Other clearing systems.</h5>
<p>Transactions which are not processed by either of the above two systems may be processed by one of the following: CBR correspondent accounts, correspondent accounts opened by credit institutions with each other, correspondent accounts at clearing non-bank credit institutions or intrabank settlement. The most popular is the settlement system of the state-owned Sberbank (Savings Bank of the Russian Federation), which is the country’s second-largest clearing and settlement system. It operates the only national clearing system for bulk retail payments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h4>
<p>Cash concentration, zero balancing and domestic notional pooling are offered to residents by a number of banks, subject to certain legal and currency control restrictions. Cash concentration structures are only available in RUB-denominated accounts. There is currently no clear legal framework in this regard, so independent legal advice should therefore be sought.</p>
<p>For non-residents, foreign exchange controls on the cross-border movement of funds make cross-border cash management difficult. Cross-currency cash pooling is not permitted.</p>
<p>Notional pooling between different resident entities is permitted in line with Russia’s arm’s length transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules.</p>
<p>Electronic banking is becoming increasingly popular in Russia, with international banks and leading domestic banks offering electronic banking services.</p>
<h4 id=""short-term-investments"">Short-term investments</h4>
<p>Bank demand and time deposits are popular short-term investment instruments with Russian companies. Government bonds, such as treasury bills (GKO) and federal loan bonds (OFZ) are issued by the Ministry of Finance through auctions held by the CBR; however, demand for these is low. Corporate bond issuance is on the increase. Zero-coupon promissory notes known as veskels are popular with banks, since they offer better yields than government bonds, corporate bonds and deposit accounts. Money market funds are not commonly available in Russia.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Is SEPA the answer to every treasurer’s prayers? In this Business Briefing we examine the range of tools available to help treasurers handle pan-European receivables, payables and liquidity management with maximum efficiency.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-priorities-in-2010"">Treasury priorities in 2010</h3>
<p>In a tough economic climate, treasurers will yet again have a number of core battles to fight this year. These will predominantly centre around controlling cash as they tackle receivables, payables and liquidity management. Corporates should therefore be looking to optimise efficiency and minimise cost by automating processes wherever possible. This is in itself another battle; particularly with technology spend being put on the back burner in many companies. Leveraging market opportunities will therefore be key to success in 2010, together with building an optimal treasury model across the fragmented European payments landscape.</p>
<h4 id=""receivables-management"">Receivables management</h4>
<p>The very nature of a company’s receivables brings complexity and fragmentation, as Andrew Ponsford, Executive Director, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services, explains, “Receivables are rarely centralised. This is because the corporate may have certain cash/coin and paper requirements in some countries, cheques may not be used in one country but are commonplace in another, and there are differences in electronic instruments and tax environments. There is a great deal of complexity here, but that also means a great deal of opportunity to achieve greater control, visibility and efficiency.”</p>
<h5 id=""challenges-1"">Challenges</h5>
<p>The major hurdles facing corporates today in terms of receivables management include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Visibility.</h5>
<p>No longer an administrative function but a strategic one, accounts receivable is seen as one of the cornerstones of good cash management. As such, companies are looking for better quality, more reliable data that is end-to-end. Now more than ever companies need to know who owes them money, how much, and when it will be paid. But how can this be achieved with minimal disruption to existing business processes and without significant expenditure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Forecasting.</h5>
<p>A knock-on effect of having sub-optimal visibility over receivables is difficulty in forecasting. This is one of the most important and yet most frustrating tasks for treasurers. Where is the cash coming from? When is it due to be paid? Where does it need to be next? What is my borrowing requirement? How much can I invest and when? Spreadsheets can no longer perform all of the necessary tasks and checks to ensure that forecasts are accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Non-standard transactions.</h5>
<p>In any business there will always be exceptions to the rule – and this is certainly true in receivables. Dealing with disputes and chasing up late payments is time consuming, particularly when different systems are used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Legacy instruments.</h5>
<p>Added to the challenge oh5f mastering exceptions is that of paper processing. Documents are easily mislaid or filed incorrectly. This results in greater inaccuracies and inefficiencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=""solutions-1"">Solutions</h5>
<p>The first step for companies looking to optimise their receivables management is to assess their current processes. This is where an outsider’s view can be particularly useful in identifying pain points. “At J.P. Morgan, our approach is to understand what the client’s existing infrastructure is, what their business priorities are, and to identify where efficiencies can be made,” says Ponsford.</p>
<p>One of the most important steps in optimising receivables management is adopting market initiatives, such as the SEPA Direct Debit, to help automate processes.</p>
<h5 id=""sepa-direct-debit"">SEPA Direct Debit</h5>
<p>The world’s first pan-regional, cross-border direct debit instrument, SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) is a simple and cost-efficient way to collect high volume payments across Europe. The SDD offers many benefits to corporates, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Greater control over collections.</h5>
<p>Authorised SDD transactions carried out through the Business to Business (B2B) scheme are irrevocable. This provides full control over the collection of payments, giving increased visibility and oversight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Standardisation.</h5>
<p>Formats will be the same across all SEPA countries, meaning that return codes and return timeframes will also be standardised. This will lead to more efficient exception management together with a simpler technical infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Improved reconciliation.</h5>
<p>SEPA allows for guaranteed transmission of 140 characters of remittance data, where currently the character count ranges from 40 to 60 depending on the country. Reconciling invoices and payments received should therefore become simpler and more efficient. Electronic reconciliation should also become easier, mitigating the need for paper processing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ponsford adds, “Previously, SEPA had been seen as an instrument for corporations with operations in multiple European countries. The SDD however is also going to be extremely useful for the domestic market as well, especially for countries where direct debits aren’t currently used. As such, this really will be a much more cost-effective, efficient and agile mechanism for collecting receivables.” Eventually, domestic direct debit schemes are likely to disappear, so early adoption of the SDD will give an advantage.</p>
<h4 id=""payables-management"">Payables management</h4>
<p>Payment services within the European Union are notoriously fragmented: individual countries have adopted their own standards, rules, practices and procedures for managing and processing payments. The growth in electronic payments has also led to an incalculable number of different payment systems being used. This has made cross-border payments time-consuming and costly. This is where the single market vision comes into its own. As key stakeholders in the SEPA initiative, banks should be actively encouraging their clients to pursue their SEPA plans and helping them to make the most of the opportunity it presents.</p>
<h5 id=""building-an-optimal-treasury-structure"">Building an optimal treasury structure</h5>
<p>Operating a centralised treasury slitructure, using a payments factory for example, can help corporates to achieve the full benefits of SEPA. These benefits include: major cost reduction, improvement of internal controls, standardisation of best in class risk management processes and elimination of system redundancies. Other potential benefits include reduction in number of banking vendors and rationalisation of bank accounts. Although SEPA is a definite step in the right direction, significant challenges remain:</p>
<h5 id=""challenges-2"">Challenges</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Multiple clearings and formats.</h5>
<p>While domestic clearing schemes have historically ensured a high degree of efficiency and security within each country, on a cross-border level, the interoperability of domestic schemes is a real hurdle. With no end-date agreed for legacy clearings, which system should be used until SEPA migration has been completed? What if the account is not reachable by SEPA? Working across different countries and systems also requires the preparation of payments in different local formats. This increases the manual work flow and presents interoperability issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>BIC and IBAN requirements.</h5>
<p>Unlike domestic credit transfers which use BBANs, using the SEPA credit transfer requires BIC and IBAN codes. What is the best way to go about making sure these are correct and complete? Should the company store both formats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Central bank reporting.</h5>
<p>There is a lack of consistency in central bank reporting requirements across the EU, with some countries exempt. How can this be managed efficiently, particularly if bank accounts are centralised?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=""solutions-2"">Solutions</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Multi-channel, multi-format offering.</h5>
<p>While SEPA can be beneficial to all companies, it is also a large undertaking. Therefore it is important to give corporates the choice of having domestic clearing systems as well as providing access to the SEPA compliant PE-ACHs. This is particularly true for smaller corporates and those operating in non-euro countries. Offering format conversion services – eg mapping EDI and ERP formats to XML – is also optimal to help corporates to recognise the benefits of SEPA, rather than viewing it as an added cost and administrative burden in the short-term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Intelligent routing.</h5>
<p>In instances where an account may not be reachable by SEPA, the next best alternative clearing channel should be automatically sought by the bank. This minimises delays and costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>IBAN derivation services.</h5>
<p>Some banks, such as J.P. Morgan, are offering value added services whereby they will derive the IBAN from the existing BBAN to ensure that a SEPA payment can be made. These conversion services, including IBAN back to BBAN, mean reduced administration for the corporate and increased certainty of payment transmission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Online, real-time reporting.</h5>
<p>Web-based reporting tools are becoming increasingly popular as companies move towards automated and paperless solutions. Central bank reporting (CBR) can be carried out and monitored online on a country-by-country basis. SEPA will also assist in this regard as it aims to abolish the administrative burden of CBR by 2012.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Our job is to take the pain away from the clients and to ensure that we offer solutions that support every client’s needs. Really, it’s about having multiple channels available and converting that into a single channel in-house, putting the complexity on the bank’s side rather than the corporate’s,” says Ponsford. “At J.P. Morgan we are there to support the different types of business that our clients carry out with a number of solutions to simplify client operations through this time of change.”</p>

<p class=""management-summary"">Sony Pictures Entertainment is part of Tokyo-based Sony Corporation and is involved in film and television production and distribution. The company reported sales figures of JPY 717.5 billion ($7.2 billion equivalent) for the year ending 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2009.</p>
<p>With operations in many different territories, achieving centralisation is a key objective for the treasury department at Sony Pictures. Sandra Ruckdaschel, Director of Treasury for Sony Pictures explains: “We want to streamline our cash operations worldwide in order to achieve centralisation. At the moment we use a zero-balance cross-border sweep within the Eurozone to centralise all our net credit balances and allow us to invest the surplus with Sony Global Treasury Services – the in-house bank. Other priorities for us include optimising the value of balances across the company, improving collections and payables efficiency, reducing costs and standardising payment processes across Europe.”</p>
<p>Working towards this aim, the company decided to pioneer a SEPA solution for its third-party vendors across Europe. “We started out using a more expensive wire transfer method, but over time, we switched to domestic ACH solutions in various countries. Now we are trying to streamline processes further by using cost-efficient solutions such as SEPA. We implemented a J.P. Morgan host-to-host File Management Services (FMS) solution approximately five years ago, which gave us a single submission channel with multiple country coverage. Now it’s simply a case of changing our payment methodology to use IBAN and changing the configurations in our systems. We are currently rolling this out across Western Europe,” says Sandra.</p>
<p>The solution has streamlined the company’s payment processes and reduced the costs involved in paying third-party vendors. “SEPA is definitely going to have a big role in our company. We may also find the SEPA Direct Debit of use in the future for business-to-business collections, and we intend to explore this further in 2010.”</p>
<p>“Relationship was key to implementing this solution”, remarks Sandra. “If J.P. Morgan has the capability, or even has the willingness to work with us to create that capability, we will always be open to partnering with them.” An added benefit of working with J.P. Morgan has been the file conversion service offered by the bank across the different countries in which Sony Pictures operates. “It helped us minimise man hours in IT and SAP support by standardising payment instruction formats, because there is one solution and not a multi-bank solution.”</p>
<p>In addition to SEPA, Sony Pictures is looking at using SWIFT SCORE in the future. “We see a definite trend here. We’ve contacted our peers that are using SWIFT and they say that it is beneficial. We would like to be able to get our banking information from all over the world in one consistent format, to help with positioning, forecasting and accounting entries.” Sandra sees technology as being critical to treasury operations going forward, particularly as many companies are reducing headcount.</p>
</div>
<h4 id=""liquidity-management"">Liquidity management</h4>
<p>Optimising liquidity should always be a core discipline within treasury strategy. But at times when access to credit is severely reduced and borrowing costs are far greater than those corporates have become accustomed to, companies are looking to their internal cash reserves to ensure that these are being used as efficiently as possible. This can be a difficult task:</p>
<h5 id=""challenges-3"">Challenges</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Managing multiple accounts.</h5>
<p>Running an organisational structure across different countries with varying legal and tax regimes usually means a large number of bank accounts and therefore banking systems. This in turn makes consolidating account balances tricky, leading to impaired visibility at a regional and global level, particularly for companies operating on a decentralised basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Maximising yield.</h5>
<p>With interest rates at record low levels, finding the right liquidity management tool is crucial. Corporates want security – with minimal counterparty risk – but they also need yield. How can this be achieved efficiently?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Administration.</h5>
<p>Manual processes surrounding account opening and closing as well as security measures, such as signatory updates, are extremely time consuming. There is also significant margin for human error here. What is the role of banks in helping their clients to reduce account administration?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Visibility.</h5>
<p>Using multi-bank reporting to give visibility of cash no matter which currency, bank or location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=""solutions-3"">Solutions</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border cash concentration.</h5>
<p>Although concentrating cash in one place may not provide the yield benefits of yesteryear, it can provide optimal use of liquidity by reducing the need for bank funding as inter-company loans are leveraged. Moreover, online portals can provide real-time updates for corporates, not only on specific transactions but also on the status of their overall liquidity structures. This means improved visibility, which can in turn lead to more efficient investment of surplus cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Pan-European notional pooling.</h5>
<p>The local cash balances of each subsidiary – concentrated by relationship banks in country – can be centralised automatically using an overlay structure run by the pooling bank. Notional pooling reduces the interest paid on debit balances and increases the interest received on credit balances, thereby optimising yield. Notional pooling also allows for local control of cash, which helps to overcome the tax and legal obstacles involved in pan-regional cash management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Revisiting the basics.</h5>
<p>“On a day-to-day level, the majority of administration issues arise from simple tasks such as security entitlements. It’s important not to get distracted by the seemingly more important things and to make sure reporting is accurate and systems are operating at optimal levels, with the highest degree of automation. Banks need to help their clients to gain control over the fundamentals and to access as near to real-time data as possible,” says Ponsford.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""innovation"">Innovation</h4>
<p>Aside from providing these core solutions, banks are the key innovators in this space. J.P. Morgan for example recently developed a rules-based investment programme called Cash Trade Execution (CTE) with another client Google Inc. Through the solution, Google transfers excess operating cash into a J.P. Morgan investment account, which is swept into time deposits with a broad range of pre-screened bank counterparties. CTE also tracks the counterparty exposures and ensures these stay within pre-agreed limits, thus enabling adherence with risk policies and diversification in investment, whilst freeing up treasury staff.</p>
<h4 id=""looking-forward"">Looking forward</h4>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s CTE solution also demonstrates a new mode of thinking among banks – that is the collaborative effort. Banks are increasingly recognising the need to provide a service to their customers; not everything revolves around price anymore. “On the back of this, we have also seen increased openness of the banks towards bank agnostic channels. I believe it’s a natural evolution of the industry,” remarks Ponsford. SWIFT is one of the major players in the bank agnostic space. SCORE (Standardised Corporate Environment) for example allows corporates to exchange files with any registered bank through a single SWIFT interface. This essentially means independence from bank proprietary connections and greater straight through processing. Moreover, SWIFT has developed messages in line with the XML standards which also underpin SEPA. The solution supports centralisation initiatives, creating greater efficiency, visibility and control over cash flow: the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Electronic bank account management (eBAM) is another initiative launched by SWIFT that is designed to standardise and streamline the account opening, closing and maintenance procedures between corporates and banks. This initiative again highlights the themes of increased customer focus, compatibility and collaboration. “From our perspective, we think it’s an absolute step forward,” concludes Ponsford. “Since it helps our clients spend more time and resource on the real business of treasury, it is something that we are actively encouraging.” The task that remains for the corporate is to choose a banking partner that can service their needs with appropriate solutions, whilst evolving with their company and the industry.</p>

<h3 id=""a-seasoned-economy"">A seasoned economy</h3>
<p>Negotiations to join the EU began when Poland became the first of the central European countries to overthrow communist rule in 1989. In September of that year, a new Solidarity trade union-led government came to power. The new government then set about transforming Poland’s centrally planned economy into a free market economy via the Balcerowicz Plan, which was introduced in 1990.</p>
<p>Under the Plan, the country’s economy was quickly turned around as state-controlled prices were lifted, subsidies to industry were largely retracted and the Polish markets were opened up to international competition. The reform journey was not easy, however, as the state had kept many prices artificially low, and prices of goods and services reportedly rose by as much as 600%.</p>
<p>By the mid 1990s, the Polish economy was one of the most rapidly developing economies in Europe. This growth was backed up by new reforms introduced in 2002, which were designed to complete the country’s economic transformation.</p>
<p>Although Poland was criticised at the time for being so heavy-handed in its reform measures, these have proven to be invaluable in the current climate. The tight monetary regulations mitigated an asset bubble similar to those seen in other European economies in recent months.</p>
<p>The Polish zloty has been freely floating since 12<sup>th</sup> April 2000. In September 2008, the Polish government indicated that it is working towards a euro adoption date of 1<sup>st</sup> January 2012. It is envisaged that the adoption of the euro will make Poland even more attractive to inward investors, though the country’s EU membership, competitive advantages for businesses and good geographical links to the East are already appealing to outside investors.</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment into the country, which reached €10.7 billion between January and October 2008, has been helped by the investment incentives offered by the Polish government in the form of state aid, tax exemptions and financial grants. Poland has also established a number of Special Economic Zones, which offer preferential business conditions, including grants for the creation of new jobs and exemption from real estate tax.</p>
<p>Recently, the Polish economy has been in the headlines as the country secured a $20.6 billion loan from the IMF. The government has fought off speculation that the funds are to aid a struggling economy by issuing statements saying that the funds are purely precautionary. As the country has a history of sound economic policies and experience of battling previous crises, the Polish economy looks well positioned to withstand the turmoil.</p>
<h4 id=""legal-and-regulatory-requirements"">Legal and regulatory requirements</h4>
<p>Doing business in Poland means adhering to simple principles and regulations, as would be expected in any developed economy. Help with understanding these requirements is available from the Polish Information and Foreign Investment Agency.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As Poland’s independent central bank, the National Bank of Poland is responsible for the stability of the country’s banking sector and currency, the development of monetary policy and payment systems and the management of official reserves. Central bank reporting requirements apply to transactions between residents and non-residents, with details of the reason for payment required for transactions in excess of €12,500. When a resident opens an account abroad, this must be reported to the central bank. If the account abroad is held in foreign currency, the account holder must provide the central bank with quarterly balance reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of 1<sup>st</sup> January 2008, supervision of the Polish banking sector has been conducted by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA). Prior to this, supervision was the responsibility of the Commission for Banking Supervision, though the Commission’s scope was relatively limited and less intent on the evolution of the Polish financial markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polish GAAP do not differ widely from IFRS and companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange must ensure that their accounts adhere to IFRS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign exchange controls are generally not imposed for transactions within the EU, EEC or OECD. However, certain transactions with other jurisdictions may require authorisation from the Polish Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, any transactions totalling more than €10,000 must be transacted through a bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two main Acts governing business activities in Poland: the Economic Freedom Act of 2<sup>nd</sup> July 2004 and the Commercial Partnerships and Companies Act of 15<sup>th</sup> September 2000. According to the Economic Freedom Act, foreigners from the EU/EEA may establish and conduct business in Poland under the same conditions as local enterprises.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""taxation-framework"">Taxation framework</h4>
<p>Polish Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Law states that a company is deemed to be resident in the country if its seat or place of management is located in Poland.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resident companies pay CIT at a rate of 19% (for the 2009 tax year) on all earnings, irrespective of their source. Non-resident companies are only charged CIT on the income earned in Poland. Companies must file an estimated tax return to the Polish authorities by 31<sup>st</sup> March and then pay the difference once the final return has been submitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capital gains are taxed as corporate income at a rate of 19%. Any losses may be carried forward for a maximum of five years, although the maximum deduction allowable in any given year is 50%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dividends received by a Polish company from another company within Poland or the EU/EEA are not subject to tax, subject to certain conditions. However, dividends paid by a resident Polish company to a non-resident company are subject to a 19% tax, unless a tax treaty or the EC parent-subsidiary directive applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The withholding tax rate levied on interest and royalties paid to a non-resident is 20% unless a tax treaty or the EC interest and royalties directive applies. Under the directive, Poland can apply a 10% withholding tax until 30<sup>th</sup> June 2009 and a 5% withholding tax until 30<sup>th</sup> June 2013. After that date, the full exemption will apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VAT in Poland is levied at a rate of 22%; however, reduced rates of 7% and 3% apply to certain goods and services. If a business has an annual turnover of less than €10,000, VAT registration is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thin capitalisation rules apply in Poland, using a debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1, to interest on loans and debt securities as well as irregular deposits and bank accounts. However, if the Polish bank debt is guaranteed by a parent company, the thin capitalisation rules do not apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arm’s length transfer pricing principle must be applied to transactions between a related Polish entity and a foreign taxpayer where one company participates in the control of another, or a third party controls both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inter-company loans are subject to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5%. This levy is also referred to as the Tax on Civil Law Transactions. However, as of 1<sup>st</sup> January 2009, several exemptions to this levy have been introduced, including loans granted to companies by their shareholders.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5 id=""local-banking-sector"">Local banking sector</h5>
<p>Poland has the largest banking industry in Central Europe and the majority of the sector is foreign-owned. The country’s banking sector has grown in terms of capabilities, with corporate banking becoming of increasing importance. With this growth, the level of regulation has also become more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Although growth in the Polish banking sector is expected to slow as a result of the financial crisis, analysts predict that the sector will end 2009 in positive figures, which is an illustration of the country’s resilience.</p>

<h5 id=""payments"">Payments</h5>
<p>A variety of payment instruments are still in everyday use in Poland. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cash.</h5>
<p>Particularly popular for conducting retail transactions, cash continues to play an important role in the Polish payments landscape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Credit transfers.</h5>
<p>The most widely used non-cash payment method in Poland, credit transfers are popular for business-to-business transactions and for high-volume and high-value payments. Although electronic facilities are in place for credit transfers, many are still carried out according to a manual, paper-based process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct debits.</h5>
<p>Poland’s central bank introduced the direct debit system in 1997 and usage has increased significantly since its introduction. However, the percentage of payments processed by direct debit still remains small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Debit/credit cards.</h5>
<p>Plastic cards are becoming increasingly popular in Poland and between 1998 and 2008, the number of cards in circulation rose from 3.9m to in excess of 30m.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheques.</h5>
<p>Rarely used in Poland due to former communist practices, cheques are of little importance in the Polish payments system. Cashiers’ cheques are, however, widely used to withdraw cash.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class=""case-study"">
<h2 id=""case-study"">Case study</h2>
<h3 id=""a-longstanding-relationship-in-poland"">A longstanding relationship in Poland</h3>
<h4 id=""netia"">Netia</h4>
<p>Netia is a leading independent fixed-line telephony and broadband internet operator in Poland. The company provides services via its state-of-the-art, fibre-optic backbone network which covers major Polish cities (over 5,000km) as well as on the basis of local access networks. Citi has supplied Netia with a variety of different cash management services in Poland for over 10 years.</p>
<p>Netia provides a wide range of fixed-line telecommunications services, including voice, data transmission, internet access and wholesale network services. On 29<sup>th</sup> June 2008, Netia acquired Tele2 Polska. This acquisition was a significant move in realising Netia’s mass market strategy. Netia’s broadband initiatives have resulted in a total of 441,000 customers at the end of March 2009 and the company aims to have more than 525,000 broadband customers by the end of 2009.</p>
<p>With such rapid growth in subscribers, the company needs to have effective cash management solutions in place. Citi helps Netia to manage its cash more efficiently through payments and collection services such as Direct Debit, Speed Collect and Prepaid Services. Malgorzata Babik, Public Relations Director, explains, “Citi provides current account management services for Netia in Poland. Without the services provided to us, Netia simply wouldn’t be able to manage the volume of current receivables from subscribers. Thanks to Citi, Netia is able to effectively manage payments from subscribers and achieve visibility over the company’s bank accounts, which is crucial. Citi is a core banking partner for those corporate treasurers looking to find ways to increase their operational efficiency in the country and region.”</p>
</div>
<h4 id=""clearing-and-settlement"">Clearing and settlement</h4>
<p>There are three main inter-bank clearing systems in Poland:</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<th>System</th>
<th>Clearing type</th>
<th>Transaction types</th>
<th>Value dates</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SORBNET</td>
<td>RTGS</td>
<td>High value, above PLN 1m</td>
<td>Same day, immediate finality</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ELIXIR</td>
<td>Multilateral net settlement</td>
<td>All payments below PLN 1m</td>
<td>Same day, end-of-day finality (depending on payment format)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TARGET 2</td>
<td>RTGS</td>
<td>All payments in EUR</td>
<td>Same day, immediate finality</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>The business-to-business direct debit system, known as GOBI and used for clearing values exceeding €10,000, has largely failed to take off as the bank support network for it is limited.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the euro to Poland, SEPA will, of course, impact heavily on the payments landscape, and it is expected that this will also encourage the wider adoption of electronic banking systems.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h3>
<p>The most commonly used cash management technique in Poland is zero balancing. Domestic cash concentration is widely used, but the legal framework surrounding cash concentration is vague, making set-up difficult from a compliance perspective. It is thought that the government is reluctant to define any legal cash pooling structure as doing so may reduce the revenue gained from charging stamp duty on inter-company lending. However, banks have worked with the Polish tax authorities to create solutions which are deemed satisfactory.</p>
<p>While cross-border sweeping is permitted, it can also be difficult to implement due to stamp duty levies between different legal entities and possible exchange controls, depending on the jurisdiction. Central bank reporting requirements must also be met.</p>
<p>Notional pooling can also be difficult to arrange, as again there is no strict legal definition of this term in Polish legislation. Moreover, under local regulations banks are not allowed to offset debit and credit balances, meaning that cash pooling structures</p>
<p>are often different to those seen elsewhere in Europe. Some banks offer so-called interest enhancement products in Poland to help to overcome these hurdles through group netting of interest. Interest on debit balances is offset against interest on credit balances.</p>
<p>In Poland, interest can be paid on all accounts held by both residents and non-residents, including current accounts. The most popular short-term investment vehicle in use in Poland is bank term deposits. These can be offered in local and major foreign currency and generally have a maturity of one, three, six or 12 months, though some may extend for two to three years.</p>
<p>Aside from bank deposits, the other short-term investment instruments available in the Polish market include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Commercial paper.</h5>
<p>Usually issued by large corporates to domestic investors in Poland as a means of raising funds cheaply. Maturities vary between one month and a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Certificates of deposit.</h5>
<p>These short-term promissory notes, issued by commercial banks with a maturity ranging from one month to a year, cannot be resold under Polish regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Treasury bills.</h5>
<p>Issued by the Polish Ministry of Finance, with maturities usually of three, six and 12 months and a minimum value of PLN 100,000. These are sold at auctions held by the NBP but can also be bought on the secondary market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Repurchase agreements.</h5>
<p>Although rarely used, repos are offered on treasury bills by certain banks operating in Poland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>NBP.</h5>
<p>The National Bank of Poland issues its own bills, which have a maturity of one week and are usually issued to banks as a means of managing liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Money market funds.</h5>
<p>Although widely available in PLN, interest in domestic money market funds in Poland has dropped over the past 12 months as corporate bonds and deposits have been giving more favourable returns. The market for foreign funds in Poland, although expanding, is still in its infancy.</p>

<h3 id=""citis-capabilities-in-poland"">Citi’s capabilities in Poland</h3>
<p>Citi has had a presence in Poland since 1991, first through Citibank (Poland) SA and then through Citi Handlowy following the merger in 2001 with Bank Handlowy w Warszawie SA (the oldest commercial bank on the Polish market, established in 1870). Today, Citi is one of the largest financial institutions in Poland, employing over 5,500 people. Offering an extensive range of corporate, investment and consumer banking products and services, Citi serves in excess of 20,000 corporate customers and 1m retail customers through cutting edge distribution channels and a network of over 250 branches throughout Poland.</p>
<p>Over the years, Citi has gained vast experience in providing cash management, trade financing and trade transaction processing for companies, and financing their day-to-day business as well as investments. In fact, Citi Handlowy was the first bank on the Polish market to deliver a one-way, multi-entity, zero-balancing structure to its clients. This is a truly novel and advanced solution tailored for effective management of capital group liquidity. The benefits of using this solution are of particular significance in the current economic climate as it enables the effective use of company cash without the risk of liquidity loss.</p>
<p>In 2005, Citi opened a Centre of Excellence in Poland to provide high quality operations and technology services to the bank’s entities around the globe. Under the initiative, two Citi public limited companies – Citibank International Plc and Citibank Europe Plc – also established their branches in Poland. The branches operate in close collaboration with Citi Handlowy and provide high quality products to customers.</p>
<p>Citi Handlowy’s solutions, global experience and local expertise can significantly reduce operating costs and increase financial efficiency for small, medium and large companies alike. Online banking capabilities and the extensive network of Citi branches all over Poland ensure quick and convenient access to all of the world-class services offered.</p>

<h3 id=""a-springboard-for-global-growth"">A springboard for global growth</h3>
<p>In the World Bank’s 2009 survey comparing regulation across global economies, the UK ranks 6<sup>th</sup> out of 181 countries for ease of doing business worldwide. The UK operates a business-friendly regulatory environment and has attracted significant amounts of foreign direct investment in recent years (<a href=""#chart-1-inward-investment-by-category-2003-04-to-2007-08"">see diagram below</a>).</p>
<p>Competition is actively encouraged in the UK market. This is particularly true within the financial services sector, and consequently the UK has grown to become the location of choice for overseas financial institutions and investors. The volume of transactions being carried out in the UK each year also illustrates the leading position of the UK financial services sector, with 53% of world foreign equities turnover and 70% of global bond trading taking place in the UK in 2007.</p>
<p>The UK is an ideal business location for companies looking for both a high-growth and high-value economic environment. As a global leader in innovation, the UK provides the benefits of a world-class reputation and well-forged business links with other major global economies.</p>
<h4 id=""legal-and-regulatory-requirements"">Legal and regulatory requirements</h4>
<p>The UK regulatory environment is specifically designed to be pro-business and is in many ways less strict than the regimes operated by other European countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As the UK’s central bank, the Bank of England (BoE) is responsible for the overall stability of the UK’s financial system and one of the statutory responsibilities of the bank is setting interest rates. There are no central bank reporting or reserve requirements in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial services in the UK are regulated by the single statutory regulator – the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA’s role as legislator has been significantly reduced by the introduction of EU Single Market Directives – in particular the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which was implemented on 1<sup>st</sup> November 2007.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companies operating in the UK must adhere to both general company and industry-specific regulations. One notable regulation is the Data Protection Act 1998, which governs the protection of personal data in the UK. When establishing a business in the UK, it is likely that it will be necessary to obtain a Data Protection licence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UK company law is set out in the Companies Act 2006 (a revision of the 1985 version), which is due to come into full force in October 2009.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UK accounting standards are set by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and apply to all companies operating in the UK. The UK’s ASB is working closely in conjunction with the International Accounting Standards Board to bring UK GAAP in line with IFRS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no exchange controls in operation in the UK, and no authorisation is required either to invest in the UK or to export funds from the UK. However, money laundering is closely monitored under various legislatures such as the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to UK trade regulations, goods exported from the UK must be cleared by UK customs but most services can be both imported and exported freely.</p>

<p>Compared to most other European countries, the level of taxation in the UK is relatively light.</p>
<ul>

<p>Corporation tax is levied on company profits, ie trading income and capital gains, on a tiered basis:</p>
<figure>

<p>The UK operates two systems of annual self-assessment for companies, whereby SMEs have nine months after the end of the accounting period to pay their tax and larger companies (that have profits in excess of £1.5m) pay in quarterly instalments, two of which must be paid within the relevant tax year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign companies operating a branch have been subject to revised tax legislation since 1<sup>st</sup> January 2003. Under this new legislation, a branch is treated as if it were a separate enterprise operating in the UK. This means that the deduction of interest that can be claimed for tax purposes will be reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dividends received by a UK company from a foreign company will be subject to corporation tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A withholding tax of 20% is applicable on dividends paid to non-residents by REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). The same amount of withholding tax is also levied on interest paid to non-residents, unless subject to a tax treaty or exempt under the EC Interest and Royalties Directive. Royalties paid to non-residents are subject to 22% withholding tax, unless the above exceptions apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stamp duty is charged on the transfer of UK shares at 0.5%. Stamp duty is also payable on property at rates on a sliding scale of 0%-4%, depending on the value of the property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UK government lowered its standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on 1<sup>st</sup> December 2008 as an incentive to boost retail sales. The cut will remain in force until 31<sup>st</sup> December 2009. Companies with a turnover in excess of £67,000 (2008) are liable to register for VAT purposes. The UK does not charge VAT on basic goods such as food, transport and children’s clothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer pricing rules in the UK are extensive and apply to transactions with both domestic and foreign companies. Transactions must be carried out at arm’s length, although SMEs are now exempt from this requirement, except in specific circumstances.</p>
</li>

<p>The UK’s banking sector has been hard hit by the financial crisis, and has had to lean on the Bank of England, the UK’s lender of last resort, for support against toxic assets. Under the UK Banking Act 2009, which came into force on 21<sup>st</sup> February 2009, the BoE can provide support to financial institutions in distress without disclosing its actions publicly. This provision is intended to prevent a ‘run’ on an ailing institution, ie to stop customers and shareholders from withdrawing all their funds. The Act also guarantees that eligible depositors are insured up to the value of £50,000, should a financial institution fail.</p>

<p>The UK’s trade association for payments and clearing is APACS (Association of Payment Clearing Services), which was set up in 1985. In March 2007, however, the UK Payments Council was established, and tasked with setting a strategy for UK payments. The Payments Council initiated a public consultation on a National Payments Plan (NPP) for the UK at the end of 2007. The aim of the plan is to improve the existing domestic payments framework within the UK as well as adopting wider developments such as the Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The consultation on the plan covered all major payment instruments in use in the UK, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cash.</h5>
<p>Approximately two-thirds of personal transactions are currently carried out using cash and estimates suggest that by 2016, 45% of personal payments will still be made in cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheques.</h5>
<p>The usage of cheques has declined significantly in the UK in recent years, from 9.5 million users in 2000 to 5.7 million in 2008. Under the NPP the Payments Council is aiming to eliminate cheques altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct debits.</h5>
<p>Over 50% of regular bills in the UK are paid by direct debit and discounts are frequently offered for paying by this method. Development of a business-to-business direct debit scheme is being investigated under the NPP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Direct credits.</h5>
<p>Frequently used by businesses to pay employees and suppliers, direct credits have been significantly improved by the introduction of the UK Faster Payments Service in 2008, enabling funds to be transferred within hours rather than days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Debit/credit cards.</h5>
<p>Plastic cards are extremely popular in the UK, with over 90% of the adult population having at least one debit or credit card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Contactless and prepaid cards.</h5>
<p>This is a growing technology in the UK, which has been boosted by success of stored value cards such as Transport for London’s Oyster card. Business use of such technology is slowly increasing.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""enhancing-and-expanding cross-border-payment-capabilities"">Enhancing and expanding cross-border payment<br/> capabilities</h3>
<h4 id=""xafinity-paymaster"">Xafinity Paymaster</h4>
<p class=""management-summary"">London-based Xafinity Paymaster, a premier provider of pensions administration, collections, and payments, handles more than £2 trillion in transactions annually for 150 UK public sector and private organisations.</p>
<h4 id=""the-challenge"">The challenge</h4>
<p>With an increasing number of UK pensioners spending their retirement years in various destinations around the world, Xafinity Paymaster (Xafinity) needed to find a faster, more efficient way to deliver pension payments to retirees in their currency of choice. Each year, Xafinity administers approximately £10 billion in payments to two million pensioners, more than 30,000 of whom now request payments in foreign currency. Looking forward, an estimated three million UK pensioners will be living abroad by 2050.</p>
<p>As a third-party pension administrator, Xafinity’s cross-border payment capabilities are determined in large part by the global reach, payment processing, and data management capabilities of its banking partner. Xafinity approached Citi to help it expand and streamline its foreign currency payment offerings and gain better access to, and control over, critical data related to its cross-border payments.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution"">The solution</h4>
<p>Recognising the combined potential of Citi’s global reach, together with its technological capabilities, including WorldLink® Payment Services and the CitiDirect® Online Banking platform, Xafinity chose Citi to create a cross-border payment solution that would both enhance its current capabilities and enable it to realise new business opportunities.</p>
<p>As one of the most comprehensive cross-border payment portfolios in the marketplace, WorldLink® provides Xafinity with the ability to make electronic or paper-based payments in 180 countries and 137 currencies. The flexibility and ease of integration of the Citi solution enabled Xafinity to migrate cross-border payments to 24,000 pensioners to the new platform smoothly in less than three months.</p>
<p>This transition was invisible to payment beneficiaries and required no changes to Xafinity’s host system. In addition, straight through processing resulted in faster execution of payments, in some instances 20% faster. One-stop web-based access to transaction information has also given Xafinity more control over both its transactions and information about them. Whereas in the past Xafinity relinquished much of this control to its previous payment provider, it can now access real-time transaction information and reports, allowing the company to provide better service to its customers and more timely responses to pensioners’ enquiries about the status of their payments.</p>
<h4 id=""the-benefits"">The benefits</h4>
<p>By partnering with Citi for its cross-border payment needs, Xafinity is reaping the benefits of increased automation, reliability and security. Moreover, the company can leverage its new flexible and expanded cross-border payments capabilities to both grow its business with existing clients and attract new ones. David Nunn, banking service director at Xafinity describes Citi’s solution as “a market-leading international payments service that is fully integrated with the services that we offer to public and private sector clients.”</p>
</div>
<h4 id=""clearing-and-settlement"">Clearing and settlement</h4>
<p>There are four main inter-bank clearing systems in the UK. A two tier-access structure is in operation in each of these clearing systems, with direct settlement members and indirect participants. Settlement between direct members is effected using accounts held at the Bank of England.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>CHAPS.</h5>
<p>The UK’s sterling-based RTGS for urgent, typically high-value wholesale payments. There is no upper or lower limit on the value of the payment and the system operates between 0600hrs and 1600hrs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>UK Faster Payments Scheme.</h5>
<p>Launched on 27<sup>th</sup> May 2008, this ‘near real-time’ clearing system is operated by CHAPS Co and allows both businesses and consumers to generate or receive payments at any time of day. Payment values are currently restricted to £10,000 for immediate payments and £100,000 for standing orders. Funds are normally made available to the beneficiary within two hours and in January 2009, the system processed 18,679,000 transactions totalling £6,208,000,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bacs.</h5>
<p>An ACH used to process regular bulk electronic payments and collections. Bacs operates on a three-day processing cycle and also offers a direct credit service for euro payments within the UK. Transactions are subject to a value limit of £999,999,999 and in the 12 months to 31<sup>st</sup> January 2009, Bacs processed 5,656,620,000 transactions totalling £3,937,323,000,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheque and Credit Clearing.</h5>
<p>This covers cheques in both sterling and euro drawn on banks in England, Scotland and Wales. Cheques drawn in Northern Ireland are processed locally. The clearing cycle for cheques in the UK is three working days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h3>
<p>Cash management products in the UK are highly sophisticated, helped by the fierce competition between providers. Under UK regulation, both physical and notional cash pooling are permitted between residents and non-residents, and multilateral netting is allowed, as are most common cash management techniques. Corporate bank accounts in the UK are usually current accounts and interest is generally paid on these, but at a low rate. Both residents and non-residents are eligible to open sterling and foreign currency accounts. Overdrafts can usually be obtained through agreement and are commonly used as a source of short-term funding, though fees are of course applicable.</p>
<p>The main short-term investment instruments available in the UK market include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Commercial paper.</h5>
<p>Usually issued by large corporates as a means of raising funds, with maturities up to 12 months. Investor appetite has however declined significantly as a result of the financial crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Certificates of deposit.</h5>
<p>Negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) allow investors to place money at market rates, generally for a period ranging from one week to five years. CDs are fully tradable but the minimum amount that can be invested is usually £50,000, with increments of £10,000 thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Treasury bills.</h5>
<p>Issued by the UK Debt Management Office, usually with a maturity of no longer than 91 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Money market funds.</h5>
<p>These aim to provide an attractive rate of return on short-term deposits, through a diversified portfolio of investments. Many of the UK’s larger money market funds have seen significant inflows of investment since the financial crisis began as investors seek to mitigate risk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Medium-term notes, with a maturity usually ranging between five and ten years, floating rate notes and structured products are also commonly used investment instruments in the UK.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""the-nordic-and-baltic-region"">The Nordic and Baltic region</h3>
<p>With a population of 31 million, the Nordic and Baltic region comprises a wide variety of languages, cultures and living standards. Yet the Nordic countries – Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark in particular – have much in common by sharing a similar way of life and social structure. In addition, the Nordic countries are also bound by the common history of the region and their longlasting relationships.</p>
<p>The three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – are all former constituents of the Soviet Union and only regained their full independence in 1990/91. In 2004, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania together joined the European Union. Despite their similar size and common history, the Baltic countries are fundamentally a geographic region that remains culturally diverse.</p>
<p>All three countries have re-established their historic trading ties to the countries of the Baltic Sea area and first and foremost, the Nordic countries. As a result, companies operating both within and outside of Northern Europe often regard the Nordic and Baltic states, at least in economic and business terms, as a single region.</p>
<h3 id=""business-in-the-region"">Business in the region</h3>
<h4 id=""economic-development-and-competitiveness"">Economic development and competitiveness</h4>
<p>While the Nordic countries are among the most highly advanced economies in the world, continuously achieving economic growth that is superior to the EU average, the Baltic states have experienced a brisk growth in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition the Nordic and Baltic region is highly competitive, which is illustrated by the fact that three Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden and Finland) featured in the top four of the most recent Global Competitiveness ranking published by the World Economic Forum. The ranking, which compares the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the world’s economies, has seen the Baltic countries rise into the top 40 worldwide.</p>
<h4 id=""technology-and-infrastructure"">Technology and infrastructure</h4>
<p>One reason for the economic success of the region is the strong political emphasis on technological development. The economic strategy of promoting not only research and development of telecommunication and information technology, but also its adoption and use across society, has enabled the Nordic countries to maintain comparatively high levels of social welfare provision.</p>
<p>The Baltic countries – and in particular Estonia – have used similar strategies, reflected in the wide use of computers and mobile phones and the accessibility of the internet, to manage the difficult transition from planned market economies to economies that are fit to join the European Union and eventually adopt the euro.</p>
<p>The high levels of technological infrastructure and IT used by companies and the public in the Nordic and Baltic region is highlighted in the Global Information Technology Report that was also released by the World Economic Forum. Denmark and Sweden are the top two countries in this ranking and all the Nordic countries are in the top 10. Estonia’s successful promotion of IT in society and business, has lifted it into the top 20 of the world’s economies in the use and development of information technology.</p>
<h4 id=""market-entry-barriers-and-market-access"">Market entry barriers and market access</h4>
<p>Foreign companies that seek access to the region will generally not face any particular problems as all countries, with the exception of Norway, are EU members and EU laws and regulations apply throughout the region. The Nordic and Baltic countries who are also keen to attract foreign direct investment and companies from the EU will not find the conditions to enter the region more burdensome than elsewhere in the EU. In fact, EU membership of the Baltic states has presented many multinationals with the opportunity to integrate their operations in these countries much more efficiently.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-activities-in-the-nordic-and-baltic-region"">Treasury activities in the Nordic and Baltic region</h3>
<h3 id=""banking-in-the-region"">Banking in the region</h3>
<p>The banking sector in the Nordic and Baltic region is closely integrated and dominated by local banks. As in other countries, the banking sector in the Nordics has been characterised by fundamental restructuring and the adoption of new technology E-banking services have become more widely offered and used than in the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>At the same time, many banks in the Nordic countries have expanded during the past decade. In order to increase their customer base and seek new business opportunities, several banks first expanded their operations into the neighbouring Nordic countries, either by setting up subsidiaries and branches or through outright mergers and takeovers. The relatively low cultural barriers between the Nordic countries facilitated the process. In a second stage Nordic banks moved into the Baltic countries by acquiring the largest Baltic banks. Today the Baltic banking sector is dominated by large Nordic banks.</p>
<p>As a result of these developments, a distinct Nordic approach to banking has been introduced to the Baltics and a number of Nordic banks provide service coverage in the entire Nordic and Baltic region.</p>
<h4 id=""payments"">Payments</h4>
<p>The focus on the adoption of new technologies in the Nordic countries is reflected in high rates of payment automation, with a higher proportion of electronic payments and a more advanced use of e-invoicing than in other European countries. At the same time, cards and credit transfers are more widely employed than elsewhere in the EU. The relative efficiency of giro transfers has also meant that direct debits are less common in the Nordics.</p>
<p>The Baltic states are catching up quickly in terms of payment automation. However, the differences between the Baltic countries in the electronic processing of payments remain pronounced. Estonia is the most advanced country in this regard, whereas Latvia, and to a greater extent Lithuania, are still managing the transition from paper-based to electronic payments. Cash remains an important payment method in the Baltic countries, while the use of cheques and direct debits is fairly limited.</p>
<p>Despite the diverse nature of the payments landscape, banks are offering modern e-banking and e-invoicing solutions covering the entire region. The trend towards more efficient and streamlined payment links in the region will continue once the Baltic countries adopt the euro as this will also mean that they are going to be eligible to join TARGET, the European payment system that links domestic Real Time Gross Settlement systems for cross-border credit transfers.</p>
<h4 id=""cash-management-services-a-holistic-view-of-treasury"">Cash management services – a holistic view of treasury</h4>
<p>Nordic banks have a long experience in the provision of cash management services. Traditionally, Nordic banks followed successful domestic companies through their development and expansion stages and responded to the corporate demand for solutions that suited varying degrees of cash management centralisation and geographical reach.</p>
<p>Many Nordic banks try to gain a competitive edge through advanced customer relationship management and differentiated delivery channels. In addition, banks such as SEB are taking a holistic view of cash management. SEB has developed the concept of the Cash Management Value Chain™ in order to enable corporates to benchmark all aspects of their liquidity handling to that of the world’s most advanced companies.</p>
<p>Global Head of Cash Management at SEB, Erik Zingmark, explains there were two main reasons for establishing the Cash Management Value Chain™ concept: “After so many years of working with sophisticated clients we had acquired a great deal of knowledge in liquidity management and customers’ internal financial processes. The Cash Management Value Chain™ structures this knowledge and experience in order to offer a more generic approach to our clients. The second reason was the introduction of quality management techniques, like lean production, which includes working capital management. The Cash Management Value Chain™ is the response to this trend by offering maximum value from a banking perspective.”</p>
<p>The Cash Management Value Chain™ is organised along five mega-processes of liquidity management (encompassing purchasing and sales), cash positioning, cash flow forecasting, short-term investments/funding and payments. In each area, SEB is able to offer the tools necessary to improve a company’s liquidity management effectively. “The main focus is to release tied-up capital and in turn to increase the control over funds,” says Zingmark. “By improving the quality of the liquidity management you will also reduce the costs.”</p>
<p>The concept aims to improve the efficiency and cost of cash management by looking beyond the mere banking fees and transaction charges and focusing on efficiency gains in the handling of administrative processes. This is achieved through a team of dedicated advisers that analyses a company’s current processes on the basis of best practice and individual organisational needs.</p>

</div>
<p>Deutsche Post World Net integrates the services of Deutsche Post, DHL and Postbank. The group employs around 550,000 people in more than 220 countries and posted revenues of 60 billion euros in 2006. In the Nordic and Baltic countries Deutsche Post World Net is represented by its transportation and logistics firm DHL.</p>
<p>Deutsche Post AG has a centralised treasury with regional treasury centres that are based at the company’s headquarters in Bonn, Germany, Singapore (Asia Pacific) and Fort Lauderdale (Americas). The Nordic and Baltic countries are managed from a European regional treasury centre. In 2003, Deutsche Post’s group treasury focused on integrating the Nordic and Baltic countries into the group’s global cash pools. According to Carola Schmitz-Becker, Deutsche Post’s Head of Cash Management, the group already had local cash pools in the area, which needed to be concentrated in a regional cross-border cash pool. In the subsequent tender Deutsche Post selected <strong>SEB</strong> as the cash management provider for the entire Nordic and Baltic region.</p>
<p>Schmitz-Becker explains that there were two main reasons influencing this choice. On the one hand the company wanted to manage the region from only one access point. Schmitz-Becker states: “We did not want to deal with a dedicated account manager in each individual country, but wanted instead to have one designated account manager for the region as a whole.”</p>
<p>In addition, Deutsche Post had trouble integrating the typical Nordic cash pooling form, where all single transactions are swept into the concentration, into its in-house banking system. In order to align the Nordic and Baltic cash pool with the group’s other regional cash pools, Deutsche Post’s treasury preferred a zero balancing approach whereby all transactions are grouped for each entity. Schmitz-Becker explains: “At the time none of the banks involved in the tender was able to offer zero balancing for the entire region. However, <strong>SEB</strong> was able to develop a solution which enabled us to receive aggregated zero balanced account positions for each entity, which we could then integrate into our in-house banking system.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Post now manages a Nordic and Baltic cash pool in which account balances from across the region are concentrated (in local and foreign currencies) at the end of each day. The comparatively small size of the Nordic and Baltic region for the group, which has an annual turnover of €2,000m in the Nordic countries and about €45m in the Baltics, meant that Deutsche Post AG required an easy and efficient solution in terms of implementation and management covering the whole region. But as Schmitz-Becker states, “Once the initial problem of zero balancing was solved by <strong>SEB</strong> we did not experience any problems with the region at all.”</p>
</div>
<h4 id=""cash-pooling"">Cash pooling</h4>
<p>Banks have focused on regional solutions reflecting the business relationships within the Nordic and Baltic area. Even though services such as cash pooling are fairly new to the Baltic states, the strong influence of Nordic banks ensured that domestic cash management solutions today are commonplace and cross-border cash pooling is well developed throughout the region, albeit primarily practiced by large multinationals.</p>
<p>The provision of treasury services, such as cash management, remains a complex issue, as the region encompasses seven countries with different cultures, languages, regulations and currencies.</p>
<p>So far Finland is the only country that has joined the euro, whereas the Baltic states are expected to join in the near future. Denmark and Sweden, on the other hand, have rejected the euro-introduction and Norway is not a member of the EU. Consequently, any regional cross-border cash pool structure becomes complex simply due to the number of currencies involved. In addition, notional pooling – even though permissible – is a relatively expensive solution for banks in the region as they are not allowed to offset debit and credit balances for capital adequacy purposes.</p>
<p>Due to the practical limitations to notional pooling, Nordic banks have developed genuinely Nordic cash pooling solutions in the form of cross-border interest compensation, which is a limited form of notional pooling that allows for a partial offset of interest for balances in different countries and currencies.</p>
<p>For many foreign multinationals, the key to managing cash in the Nordic and Baltic region is to have one access point to the region and to manage all countries involved from there. This approach guarantees a uniform implementation process with centralised support and harmonised account opening procedures and documentation. However, not all banks are able to offer this service.</p>
<p>Many multinationals also often demand cross-border zero or target balancing solutions, to match their cash pool set-ups elsewhere in the world. This is also catered for by some of the banks in the region.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-issues"">Regulatory issues</h3>
<p>Any business activity taking place in more than one Nordic or Baltic country will need to take different currencies, tax and legal systems into consideration. However, on the whole legal and tax regulations are not particularly restrictive in the Nordic and Baltic countries compared to other regions. In part this is due to the EU membership of the Baltic states, which required the countries to align legal and tax regulations with EU laws.</p>
<p>The implementation of EU regulations has not yet taken full effect in all Baltic countries and some EU directives, such as the EU Interest and Royalties Directive, will be implemented in stages. Regulations likely to affect treasury activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Lending rules.</h5>
<p>The funding of operations in the region may be affected by lending rules. Countries such as Finland or Norway restrict lending between resident and non-resident companies. Other countries, including Denmark, apply similar restrictions to non-resident companies located outside the EU or EEA (European Economic Area).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Thin capitalisation.</h5>
<p>Thin capitalisation rules, which were introduced to restrict the amount of debt financing by foreign shareholders or related parties to their subsidiaries, are effective in Denmark, Latvia and Lithuania. All three countries have restrictions on inter-company or shareholder loans and related interest payments that exceed a debt to equity ratio of 4 to 1. Loans and interest payments, which in theory represent an opportunity to move taxable profits out of the region, are no longer tax deductible as business expenses if the ratio is exceeded. Norway has similar rules but no specific debt to equity ratio is given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Withholding tax.</h5>
<p>Inter-company lending in the region may also be subject to withholding tax (WHT), as is the interest received on bank deposits. While WHT can be credited against a company’s corporation tax it limits the company’s liquidity. Lithuania and Latvia will eliminate WHT on bank interest paid to non-residents in 2009 and 2011 respectively. Until then different WHT rates will apply. Denmark and Finland also impose WHT on interest paid to non-resident companies unless they meet specific conditions.</p>
<p>WHT may also be due on dividends and royalties paid to resident companies in Denmark and non-resident companies throughout the region. In most countries, WHT payable can be limited or eliminated by applicable tax treaties or under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, if specific shareholdings requirements and other criteria are met. Non-EU member Norway has similar exemptions for non-resident companies located in the EEA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Transfer pricing.</h5>
<p>The pricing of inter-company transactions is another way of moving profits from high taxation to low taxation countries. Transfer pricing regulations attempt to prevent the charging of unrealistically low or high prices on inter-company transactions compared to the price of transactions between unrelated parties. All Nordic and Baltic countries follow the OECD guidelines on transfer pricing, which require all trades between related parties to be documented and conducted at arm’s length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Central bank reporting.</h5>
<p>In all countries of the Nordic and Baltic region, except Finland, cross-border transfers exceeding pre-defined limits must be reported to the local Central Bank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It should be remembered that the legal framework in the region is constantly changing and likely to tend towards a greater degree of harmonisation. The introduction of the euro in the Baltic countries which is anticipated in the near future will result in further changes, but also further harmonisation, and will almost certainly facilitate business activities in the region even further.</p>
<div class=""profile"">
<h3 id=""seb-merchant-banking"">SEB Merchant Banking</h3>
<p>SEB Merchant Banking is the leading merchant bank in the Nordic and Baltic region. Over the years, we’ve followed many of the region’s companies and financial institutions from that first fledgling stage – until they’ve become world players in the international arena. From that perspective, we see ourselves as part of a much greater industrial and commercial whole.</p>
<p>Working together with our customers, we produce administrative and financial value. That’s why we do all our development work – whether it be systems for forecasting liquidity, netting or account management – in close collaboration with our customers. And we’re convinced that this is one of the reasons why both Euromoney and TMI have ranked us best cash management bank in the Nordic and Baltic region in 2004, 2005 and 2006.</p>
