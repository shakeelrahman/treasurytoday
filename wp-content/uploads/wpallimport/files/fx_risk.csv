<div class=""copy__body""><p>Foreign exchange is a significant cost for many businesses. A recent survey by Australian fintech Fluenccy suggested that SMEs in the UK paid more than ten times as much as corporates for FX when using their banks last year and lost an average of £17,000 on their international payments through a combination of excess fees and bad trades.</p>
<p>Fewer than 10% of the small businesses surveyed had access to a system that allowed them to monitor and control the impact of FX on their business. Fortunately, there are a number of steps companies can take to establish a full understanding of their exposure to foreign currencies.</p>
<p>FX risk can be divided into primary and secondary categories, the first of which being the actual cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and the second being the supply chains and macro risks driving FX exposure. An example of the latter is how exposure in Brazil can be affected by events in Argentina or Chile.</p>
<p>“In order to catalogue such risks, treasury teams need to think through the data they have on their outlays and receipts globally,” says Bob Savage, Head of FX Sales North America at BNY Mellon.</p>
<p>Companies should take the time to understand the main types of risks across their industry and identify best practices across their peer group to ensure alignment with competitors, suggests Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Financial Markets Sales, Sharad Desai.</p>
<p>“A global review of exposures at parent company and subsidiary level will ensure accurate understanding of group exposure,” he says. “Companies should also assess the hedging risk generated by foreign investments.”</p>
<p>Companies with multiple divisions, each with different pricing criteria, will have multiple sources of FX exposure. Within an industrial engineering firm, for instance, machine production, spare part provision, and service delivery will all generate different exposures.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is the forward discount/premium of the currencies involved. “European exporters typically sell in currencies with higher interest rates than the euro, such as the US dollar or the renminbi,” explains Antonio Rami, Co-Founder of currency management automation software provider Kantox. “In this case, currency hedging entails a forward discount that must be effectively managed.”</p>
<p>The scale of the company will also determine its ability to mitigate FX risk. A large corporate is likely to have a dedicated treasury management team with in-house experts as well as external partners, allowing it to implement a variety of risk management protocols.</p>
<p>“For a small business it is better to focus initially on the areas that are likely to affect the business the most and build from there,” suggests Laurent Descout, Co-Founder and CEO of treasury services platform Neo. “Integrating a modern treasury management system into the business operations is the next important step.”</p>
<p>Atlas FX is a provider of foreign exchange risk management services. The firm’s Vice President, Strategy and Operations, Scott Bilter, says corporates need to go beyond the data readily available from their ERP system, create a forecast of future FX exposures, and put proper results analytics in place to understand the sources of FX variance.</p>
<p>“Getting each of these steps right requires a lot of expertise and treasury teams are often understaffed and highly rotational,” he warns.</p>

<p>California-based Electronic Arts has almost 10,000 employees worldwide and annual sales in excess of US$5.5bn. International revenue accounts for more than half of its sales, which means it is exposed to the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates across a number of currencies.</p>
<p>Strengthening of the US dollar relative to the euro, sterling, the Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, South Korean won, and Polish zloty has a negative impact on its reported international net revenue but a positive impact on reported international operating expenses – particularly when the US dollar strengthens against the Swedish krona and the Canadian dollar. The company hedges a portion of its foreign currency risk by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of 18 months or less.</p>
<p>The company’s treasury department processes around US$1.5bn every quarter across all transaction types, explains Grace Antonio, Treasury Manager. “We review all exposures – balance sheet and cash flow – via our exposure management system and our financial planning and analysis forecasting tool,” she says. “We use spots, forwards and swaps to minimise our underlying exposure to currency.”</p>
<p>Antonio adds that the company reviews its FX hedging strategy with its FX committee every quarter.</p>
<p>“We evaluate the types of hedging product we use regularly, but based on our strategy we don’t often make changes,” she says. “We have a rolling layered approach to our programme and even with changes in the market, we typically stay the course.”</p>
<p>This strategy has worked well of late, with foreign exchange adding US$78m to the company’s capital resources in the last financial year.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Accurate forecasting – supported by a competent treasury management system – and centralised treasury enabling netting of foreign currency exposures are steps corporates can take to establish a full understanding of their exposure to foreign currencies agrees Ruth Bellinger, Head of IRFX Macro Sales UK at BNP Paribas Global Markets.</p>
<p>Options for minimising corporate exposure to FX volatility in current market conditions include adhering to a treasury hedging policy. A ‘layered’ approach remains popular whereby as certainty of forecasting increases in the shorter tenors, the amount hedged increases.</p>
<p>Borrowing in the currency of the asset or hedging via derivatives (such as cross currency swaps or rolling FX swaps) is another option.</p>
<p>“Highly structured derivatives may offer preferential exchange rates but will have additional restrictions whereby the hedge notionals may change on maturity or the hedge may fall away – usually at a time when market rates have moved adversely,” says Bellinger. “Hedge accounting is also more challenging for these structured derivative hedges.”</p>
<p>For cash flow hedging, the rule of thumb is to use forwards for highly predictable exposures and options for uncertain cash flows. Corporate treasuries with long-term emerging market currency exposures face the choice between hedging at the expense of significantly affecting the return on the investment, or bearing the risk of significant currency devaluation.</p>
<p>“For balance sheet exposures, once the net exposures are determined companies should use a rolling programme with forwards with matching tenors as they provide the best offset from an accounting perspective,” says Desai. “For long-term exposures including foreign borrowings, term hedges such as cross currency swaps can be used to mitigate the FX risk.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Companies need to keep up with a last moving market in order to buy and sell the necessary currencies (or their derivative products) quickly, efficiently and at a low cost. This is almost impossible to do successfully without access to the right data as well as real time FX market rates and execution capabilities.</p>
<p>“The fact that there still are many manual processes around FX risk management is pushing corporates towards further automation to improve efficiency and internal controls,” states Descout.</p>
<p>Customised analysis of an organisation’s FX exposures can also make a crucial difference. Minimising exposure requires an understanding of what could go wrong from all potential sources of variance and applying a stress test to each one, suggests Bilter.</p>
<p>“It is ultimately accomplished by properly hedging, but the devil is always in the detail,” he adds. “Reducing forecast deviation, having properly timed hedging workflow to avoid unnecessary slippage against accounting rates, and being able to interrogate any re-measurement inconsistencies are all necessary elements in minimising FX volatility.”</p>
<p>According to Desai, corporate treasurers have increasingly turned to options this year in response to pandemic events. The need to react to external events demands constant monitoring of currency hedging strategies.</p>
<p>“Hedging strategies require constant review and removing hedges when there is no longer a need for them is a clear principle for lowering FX ‘noise’ in the balance sheet,” says Savage. “However, while this seems simple some exposures end quickly and the unwinding of hedges takes time – balancing liquidity against spreads is more art than science.”</p>
<p>Desai refers to a significant shift this year with a growing number of so-called ‘black swan’ events prompting corporate treasurers to increase the frequency of their hedging strategy reviews.</p>
<p>These strategies should be continuously reviewed to reflect the diversity of pricing criteria and the widespread adoption of flexible pricing in many industries, adds Rami. “As expectations for short term interest rates shift, so does the situation firms face in terms of forward points,” he says. “That calls for continued assessment of hedging strategies.”</p>
<p>Descout reckons any strategy designed to monitor FX exposures and hedge against risks should be monitored at least every day and ideally in real time.</p>
<p>“Relying on spreadsheets is simply unworkable and outsourcing this important task can result in slow decision-making, poor service and high costs,” he says. “Recent advances in technology mean it is possible to access all of the key services corporates need – such as real time data and analytics, access to live FX rates, execution and hedging capabilities and multi-currency accounts to make and receive payments – via a treasury management system.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Significant volatility in an unhedged currency or from a hedged currency with a hedge percentage below 100% might indicate a need for a change in strategy.</p>
<p>“Significant volatility from ‘spot slippage’ would indicate the need for either an improved workflow, an improved hand off between income statement and balance sheet trades, or improvements to how FX liquidity trades are managed,” says Bilter. In this context slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a currency trade and the price at which the trade is executed.</p>
<p>A sizeable market shock or heightened currency volatility could require an immediate review of a programme that was running fine. In the case of cash flow hedges where the business units are involved in their specific strategy, it is important for treasury to review these hedges with the business unit at least annually as some key aspects of the business may have changed.</p>
<p>“Removing hedges where exposure is minimal is fine if the administrative burden of hedging is greater than the stress-tested risk of leaving the exposure unhedged,” adds Bilter. “Understanding why the exposure is limited is important though. Was it larger before and is only temporarily smaller? It may still need to be monitored, even if left unhedged.”</p>
<p>Bellinger also suggests a hedging strategy should evolve as the company changes, whether this is a strategic change in the company’s direction or as a result of disposals or acquisitions.</p>
<p>“The merits of removing hedges for currencies to which the corporate has limited exposure depend on the currency – the limited exposure may be in an emerging market which has much greater volatility and a small position may create a significant P&amp;L impact from market movements,” she says.</p>
<p>The ability to forecast future exposures has been the subject of much conjecture among treasury teams over the last 18 months. The pandemic has seen many companies experience unexpected impact on their order books with major discrepancies in what was forecasted and hedged.</p>
<p>With this uncertainty likely to persist for some time, corporates would be well advised to keep their FX risk management options open.</p></div>

<p>FX strategy at Takeda, Asia’s largest pharmaceutical group, has continued as normal throughout the currency volatility caused by the pandemic. The company’s balance sheet FX hedging programme and net investment hedge scheme sees it hedge against the month-end rate, forecasting and rolling its FX exposure forward, explains Assistant Treasurer, Financial Risk Management, Urs Berger, speaking from the Japanese company’s Zurich base.</p>
<p>Key risks in the strategy include any sudden shortage in liquidity, or the market rates fluctuating the day month end falls or the following day, when the company readjusts its positions after month end. Despite a spike in both those risks back in March, the company didn’t deviate from a core strategy specifically structured to protect its P&amp;L from currency fluctuations and just the kind of background financial turmoil that hit in March.</p>
<p>“We use a systematic approach because it makes the economic situation largely irrelevant,” says Berger, adding that the company is currently exploring ways to develop the strategy further by hedging currency risk on future cash flows not yet recorded on the balance sheet. “Such a hedging programme would only cover highly probable cash flows where the company can apply hedge accounting, but it is the latest innovation in strategy at the firm,” he says.</p>
<p>What has been relatively seamless for Takeda has proved more challenging for other companies, however. Many corporates exposed to supposedly risk-free, developed market currencies during the early weeks of the pandemic, have found currency moves have eaten into their profit margins and combined with illiquidity in a perfect storm. It has shaken many companies out of an enduring belief that currency volatility won’t affect them, and that they don’t require hedging programmes.</p>
<p>Others, where managing FX risk came below other immediate priorities like looking after staff and managing liquidity, also found themselves exposed. With more currency storms approaching as the markets prices in big swings in exchange rates around the US presidential election and Brexit transition, recently burnt companies are seeing FX risk in a new light.</p>
<h4 id=""one-burnt"">Once burnt</h4>
<p>In the Nordics it’s sparked a new interest from corporates who either didn’t hedge or had very low hedging ratios prior to the pandemic, based on a belief that trading conditions in the region had, and therefore always would be, benign. Not so now following the Norwegian kroner shedding nearly 30% of its value against the dollar in March triggered by the pandemic and collapse in oil prices. “Many corporates in the region didn’t have hedging policies, especially against neighbouring countries. Now we are seeing more treasury teams look to safeguard the company against currency volatility and concentrate on their core business. They want to remove the headache of volatility that can quickly become a migraine,” says Jesper Bargmann, Head of FX Sales at Nordea in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>For companies with hedging policies in place, the response is more nuanced. Rather than increasing their hedging ratios, many have adopted a wait and see approach. Although treasury teams know they will have to buy and sell currency next year, few have the confidence or certainty in forecasts to commit to hedging all that risk at this stage. “Clients who have always hedged 18-months ahead may be hedging more like 12-15 months ahead. A client who always used a hedge ratio of 75% may now be using a hedge ratio of 50%. Extrapolating from 2018 and 2019 flows doesn’t mean much when the world has been turned on its head,” explains Jonathan Pryor, Head of FX Sales at Investec.</p>
<p>The problem with the COVID crisis is rooted in companies’ inability to predict their future cash flows – even for the next three months. “Hedging every order is impossible if you don’t know your future income or expenses,” says Nordea’s Bargmann, who says companies are hunting for more flexible strategies that combine a typical forward contract with options (and the right to fulfil contracts or not) for greater flexibility.</p>
<p>Although companies still want products that give them a guaranteed hedge, they also want an element of flexibility when it comes to the amount they want to buy, agrees Investec’s Pryor. “A lot of the work we’ve done with clients is around providing them with zero premium solutions given guaranteed hedges with an element of flexibility.”</p>
<p>In other trends, banking experts observe heightened interest amongst corporate clients in the macro drivers and economic factors that move markets – especially amongst those without comprehensive hedging strategies in place. “People are watching inflation, GDP and employment figures like hawks,” says Pryor. Although volatility has fallen, currencies remain jumpy, especially if the market considers a government’s response to the pandemic wrong around, say, lockdown rules or the amount of stimulus, opening-up the risk of a sell-off. A particular concern at Takeda is US inflation, where any spike might impact interest rates, says Berger. “If they increase the interest rate, we will have higher costs of carry and higher hedging costs,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""banking-relationships"">Banking relationships</h4>
<p>Market volatility and spikes in pricing have also shone a spotlight on corporates’ banking relationships. At Takeda, where the balance sheet hedging programme is currently augmented by additional hedging exposures because of Takeda’s ongoing acquisition of Shire, banking partners’ ability to hedge in a short period of time has been key. “We placed big orders in a short period of time,” says Berger. “Banks might not always be able to quote because they have their own counterparty risk exposures.”</p>
<p>A diverse number of counterparties as opposed to relying on specific banking partners has proved invaluable. “We trade via automated trading platform FXall with many FX banks and can therefore diversify counterparty and liquidity risks, as well as ensuring best price execution,” he says. “In times of high FX volatility we expect our banks to enable liquid trading volumes at the best price.”</p>
<p>That said, the cost of hedging has fallen since the peak of the pandemic and implied volatility is at low levels. “We have a market that feels so fragile and volatile, but still, a six month option doesn’t currently cost that much,” says Investec’s Pryor.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, experts note increased demand amongst some corporates to hedge emerging market currency risk. Although many companies active in emerging markets are volatility veterans with clear strategies in place, others were left exposed. The crisis proved that emerging market currencies can move a lot more than the majors from a percentage perspective. “Emerging market currencies can move so quickly that even relatively small exposures matter – sometimes more so than larger exposures to stable currencies,” says Investec’s Pryor.</p>
<h4 id=""automation"">Automation</h4>
<p>Demand for automated strategies could also get a boost from the pandemic. FX has always been at the forefront of automation, mostly between the interbank market and brokers. In one trend, more small Nordic treasury teams without dedicated members of staff looking at FX are exploring automated FX payment and clearing of currency balances, as well as automating liquidity swaps. “Rules based automated hedging is new in the market and a very interesting development within next Gen FX,” says Nordea’s Jesper. Under these solutions, software speaks to a customer’s ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning System) to define a hedging policy from the order book, hedge and then execute trades with chosen banks.</p>
<p>He cautions, however, that rigid automated strategies based around a fixed hedge profile don’t necessarily fit the changed corporate landscape and new pandemic-induced factors driving underlying business strategy. Automated strategies offer the most compelling solutions viewed on their own merits in the context of the markets. “The number of FX transactions is huge, so if companies can automate it to run in the background, they can stop worrying and also eliminate operational risk. It’s like a self-driving car – you may feel safer in this than driving with your friends,” he concludes.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>When it comes to currencies and commodities, the markets are unusually volatile. In attempting to smooth the ride, hedging can be a useful tool for treasurers. But what are the common mistakes and what constitutes best practice when using this risk management strategy?</em></p>
<p>In today’s volatile currency and commodities markets, treasurers crave certainty from both a cash flow and a P&amp;L perspective (even if with full certainty the job would cease to exist). To hedge or not should never be a foregone conclusion, especially under the current circumstances, so now is a good time to review strategy and policy.</p>
<p>Doing so should ensure the approach taken is fit for purpose, not least in light of the hedge accounting changes implemented under IFRS 9 that became effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018 at least for those corporates that have elected to adopt it.</p>
<p>But there is an even more pressing reason for treasurers to rethink hedging. Although the profession typically errs towards the vanilla end of the hedging spectrum, doing it badly still risks destroying more value than was originally at risk.</p>
<h3 id=""alignment"">Alignment</h3>
<p>“When we help companies review hedging strategies, it is not uncommon to find that decisions are not aligned with the company’s claimed hedging objectives,” notes Ian Farrar, Partner, Corporate Treasury Leader at PwC China &amp; HK. “Equally, a closer look at these strategies may reveal that they are only optimal at certain points in the range of commodity or currency rates.”</p>
<p>An example of this would be where the use of certain instruments might be a sound strategy when oil prices are low, but not further up the curve. “We often find there is also an element of commodity basis risk,” continues Farrar. “Corporates often do not hedge their entire exposure – frequently on the grounds of availability of suitable instruments, a lack of clarity where they might uplift bunkers, or because the cost of a matching instrument is prohibitive.”</p>
<p>For hedging strategies in currency markets, the practice can generally be split into two main areas: FX exposures arising from trading, and exposures arising due to foreign currency debt. “Historically, many Asian companies have not hedged, or, for those that have hedged, under-hedged their FX exposure from trading activities,” notes Farrar.</p>
<p>In some cases, this was because these companies were actively taking a position on future currency movements. In others it was due to inadequate forecasting capabilities. Indeed, if a corporate cannot reliably estimate the extent of their currency exposure in any period, it is often prudent to scale back hedging activities.</p>
<p>Treasurers that have hedged tend to use simple instruments – swaps and forwards. But in the past few years more are now considering options-based products; in Asia this is particularly the case for those dealing with RMB, says Farrar.</p>
<h3 id=""a-new-view"">A new view</h3>
<p>When first engaging with hedging, the tendency is to judge the success of efforts based on whether or not a better rate was achieved, notes Farrar. Instead, he says, “treasurers need to measure their hedging strategy based on whether it achieved their objectives, regardless of whether a hedge ‘won’ or ‘lost’.” A ‘win’ in this respect therefore might mean the company managed to fix its cash flows successfully, giving it certainty.</p>
<p>“There is a lot that can be done to manage ongoing volatility,” comments Farrar. “It’s largely a question of making sure decisions made in the name of risk management are being made for the right reasons.”</p>
<h3 id=""underlying-effects"">Underlying effects</h3>
<p>Joseph Braunhofer, Deputy Group Treasurer at Smith &amp; Nephew, notes that often the transactional exposures hedged do not appropriately represent the full risk a company is exposed to. However, when seeking to establish the most effective hedging approach, he sees the basic structure of the organisation and the contracts it has entered into as having the defining role.</p>
<p>For Smith &amp; Nephew, FX risk is for the most part concentrated in hubs, effectively centralising it and making it easier to manage. “If you are managing it on an individual basis across lots of decentralised entities you may be winning on one side but losing on another,” he warns.</p>
<p>Ideally, before implementing any FX hedging strategy, Braunhofer advises examining the fundamental economic risks within the company. “When you are analysing the economic risks underlying a business, sometimes it is not always immediately apparent what the FX risk is,” he notes.</p>
<p>“Contracting and procurement may have negotiated a contract in GBP, however this could be linked to an underlying USD market price. This could create an underlying FX risk within that contract that you don’t know about – or you may be transferring FX risk to one of your suppliers which you will ultimately pay for,” he explains.</p>
<p>To overcome this situation, he says it is vital to get into the detail in the first instance, “in order to fully understand what’s happening all the way through the chain”. For this to be possible, he adds that finance and other teams need to support treasury in getting the best available data.</p>
<p>From here it will be useful to assess and compare those risks versus industry peers, making a judgement on what certain FX movements will do to the company’s overall competitiveness in its market. Braunhofer accepts that it can be difficult to get competitor information of this nature and urges treasurers to be “a little bit more creative” here, exploiting other sources where possible.</p>
<p>Having created a view of the underlying risks, and benchmarked them, another useful step is to build in a view of the prevailing business environment. “In a business where margins are typically over 20%, Braunhofer believes that the treasurer might feel that doing less FX hedging may be entirely acceptable “because the worst possible outcome of all currencies moving against the business might only knock 1% off the overall margin”.</p>
<p>In any given year, this will still dent profitability. But for the high-margin player, it is unlikely to tip the business over the edge in terms of complying with any bank covenants, for example. However, for low margin businesses, the potential for losses and risks related to covenant compliance alone may dictate the decision to hedge or not.</p>
<h3 id=""accurate-forecasting"">Accurate forecasting</h3>
<p>As a hedging programme is implemented, it is important to looking at the accuracy of cash forecasts and underlying flows for it to be effective. “Typically, companies are hedging 12 or 24 months out so it is vital to know they are not doing so on the basis of flawed data and then having to unravel that as the maturity date approaches,” comments Braunhofer.</p>
<p>The starting point of accuracy here is a matter of attending to the cash forecasting basics. “Most corporate treasurers recognise that this can be very difficult but if you are not doing some form of variance analysis on your cash forecasting, then it’s probably not going to get any better and you’ll never know how accurate you are.”</p>
<p>There are various systems and processes that can be used to improve cash forecasting, depending on whether it is for operational, tactical or strategic purposes (short, medium or long term). These include the receipts and disbursements method, distribution modelling, exponential smoothing and regression analysis.</p>
<h3 id=""modelling"">Modelling</h3>
<p>It is useful for treasurers to develop an approach to modelling risk in the context of hedging. In recent times, Braunhofer notes that the portfolio value at risk (VaR) approach has become the leading edge in hedging practice.</p>
<p>VaR calculations come in many forms (and complexities) and can be estimated by multiplying ‘market value’ by ‘price volatility’. Portfolio VaR essentially enables risk to be equated across products and for the aggregation of that risk on a portfolio basis.</p>
<p>A VaR model might, for example, measure the confidence (as a percentage) of the worst-case loss, under normal market conditions, across the base currency, over a given period due to adverse price moves. This calculation can be used to calculate VaR of individual positions and, subsequently, portfolio VaR.</p>
<p>Risk modelling can quickly become a complex proposition and adopting the more arcane techniques is not for everyone. “I would prefer to keep things as simple as possible,” states Braunhofer. Some market-data tools available to treasurers have modelling functionality built into them, allowing “anyone with a good handle on their exposures” to overlay concepts such as portfolio VaR with “relative ease”.</p>
<h3 id=""flexibility-and-framework"">Flexibility and framework</h3>
<p>With more extreme market movements than would otherwise have been anticipated, companies that are increasingly global in reach and connection, and the positive effects of having easier access to more accurate, relevant and timely data, companies are better able to understand the underlying elements.</p>
<p>Best effort now needs to be, and can be, better. As such, says Desiree Pires, Co-Head Corporate Sales, UK Financial Markets at Standard Chartered, “it is no longer prudent to have a one-size-fits all treasury hedging policy, and nor is it sensible to continue using a policy that was written a decade ago”.</p>
<p>The current trading environment and market volatilities are dictating the need for a more flexible hedging approach. Indeed, rigidity in today’s environment can create exposure to additional risk or cost.</p>
<p>With EUR and GBP forward points close to record highs, for EUR or GBP sellers it may be worth extending tenor of hedges to lock in the attractive forward points. For commodity purchasers, hedging for example base metal or energy in EUR rather than USD terms may mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices, says Pires.</p>
<p>“The record lows we have had in interest rates over the last few years encouraged many treasuries to fix their debt costs for longer term. Brexit GBP-related weakness may also bring opportunities for UK companies with foreign earnings or foreign companies with UK costs to lock these in for a longer period.” Being able to lock-in that cost gives the predictability that companies and stakeholders crave. This only comes from policy flexibility.</p>
<p>There may be certain accounting or finance considerations around the timing of a hedge, but Pires says treasurers should generally be striving to create market awareness across the organisation, up to board level, to try to reshape outmoded policy in the most appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Indeed, there must be an understanding of the nuances that exist, for example, between certain currency pairs, or at certain times in the market cycle, in order that the right degree of flexibility is sanctioned. And it needs to be sanctioned because shifting back and forth on tenor, for example, might, as Braunhofer notes, “look a little like speculation”.</p>
<p>Allowing treasury to do something different where necessary, possibly even look at FX options, as PwC China &amp; HK’s Farrar suggests above some Asian businesses exposed to RMB are now doing, is clearly foresighted.</p>
<p>However, policy flexibility to the point of allowing ad hoc decisions is effectively no policy at all, cautions Pires. “When hedging, there will always be a need for a framework and guidelines,” she declares. “These typically warn against speculation but also provide certain tolerances within which treasury can operate.”</p>
<p>With more data available to build a better picture of the business and its risks, setting and fine-tuning limits, and understanding where the pain-points are, is now entirely possible.</p>
<h3 id=""practical-measures"">Practical measures</h3>
<p>In beginning to mitigate exposure risks, it should be apparent that treasurers should start by examining market conditions before taking the plunge. However, warns Pires, “spend too long studying the markets, or wait too long for it to reach a good level, and it might run away from you”. Setting time guidelines can avoid ‘paralysis by analysis’.</p>
<p>The cost of hedging should be a consideration too. It needs to be balanced by the benefits and the value of the underlying business; certain (usually emerging market) currencies, for example, may not be worth hedging because they are simply too expensive.</p>
<p>When adopting a hedging methodology, a ‘rolling layered approach’ is often advised as a practical means of reducing cash flow volatility. With a two or three-year horizon, for example, the treasurer would hedge a larger percentage of FX for the first six months (policy suggesting perhaps between 50% and 80%), reducing the percentage progressively to perhaps a tail hedge towards maturity.</p>
<p>The liquidity of the market will often dictate tenor; commodities tend not to be overly liquid beyond 18-months to two years, making a longer tenor unlikely. That said, an airline might take a different stance to a food manufacturer, so policy might dictate a very different approach.</p>
<p>But perhaps hedging can be approached in a different way altogether. As Farrar says, it may now be time for treasurers to look closer at options. Indeed, in certain cases, especially where there is uncertainty around the underlying, Pires says the ‘insurance’ of a simple option (as opposed to more complex derivatives, which are unlikely to gain acceptance amongst treasurers) “can outperform a rolling forward hedging programme”, giving lower volatility on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>It is worth noting too that where at an individual entity level, hedging may seem like the right thing to do, across a group, there may be natural – and therefore more cost effective – offsets that can be used instead, notes Jacqui Drew, Director, ION Treasury and Chairperson of ION’s Hedge Accounting Technical Taskforce.</p>
<p>Information is key here, she says. It is imperative that a company can identify all inflows and outflows across a company and across the asset classes including FX and commodities. The company can then identify any natural offsets in the first instance which would significantly reduce the volume of hedging and therefore the hedging costs.</p>
<p>Looking at exposures in siloes, where commodities and FX trades are treated entirely separately, is inefficient. “A more advanced treasury will be able to look at these exposures across the portfolio and gain an understanding of the correlation and potential offset of the different risks,” she notes. “We have worked with companies who have noted a 40-50% reduction in risk when considering the correlations across asset classes by using advanced risk functionality like Cash Flow at Risk. Cash Flow at Risk is relevant to corporates who are not looking to trade out of their hedging positions immediately and are looking to manage cash flows rather than balance sheet value.”</p>
<p>Technology, subject matter experts and banking partners will be a valuable source of input and of data in this respect, especially when seeking correlations and performing calculations and analysis. But where information can be shared internally, then it should be. Aside from the adoption of technologies that can facilitate sharing across the organisation – and here cloud solutions can prove beneficial – the different functions harbouring relevant data using independent market data can be helpful in treasurers adding value to the organisation.</p>
<p>It is here that treasurers can explain that helping to discover the different exposures being faced by the business will help level volatility and increase certainty through a better-executed hedging strategy. Ultimately though, it means driving growth and increasing profitability. Few could argue with that.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Recent currency market volatility has highlighted the need for many treasury teams to pay close attention to FX risk-management. For this reason, treasury teams are introducing technology into their FX workflow. It can enable them to streamline FX processes, better manage currency risk, and conduct post-trade analysis, as part of a programme to proactively seek continuous improvements.</p>
<p>Sime Darby Motor Group (HK) is one company that has taken this approach. The company used to struggle to manage the financial risk surrounding its foreign currency forward supplier payments. Treasury could not lock-in the costs of its trades and execute at fair market prices. It also had difficulty providing accurate forecasts to management.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, treasury revamped its pre-trade FX risk management process by deploying Thomson Reuters cross-asset pre-trade analytics solution. This allows treasury to determine the fair market value of FX forward contracts by utilising trusted calculators and unbiased market-data. The same solution allows Sime Darby Motor Group (HK) to assess ongoing mark-to-market pricing and benchmark their performance.</p>
<p>Using this technology has revolutionised how the company manages its FX exposures and delivered multiple benefits. “We have reduced the pricing of our FX forward contracts and short-term financing, lowering the overall cost to the business,” says Chan Man Wai, Treasury Manager at Sime Darby Motor Group Hong Kong. “Additionally, we’ve enhanced our negotiation power when dealing with the banks. We now also have documentary evidence to show management that treasury is executing hedges at the best market price and adding value to the organisation.”</p>
<p>Sime Darby Motor Group HK is also enjoying a more streamlined and automated FX trade workflow. This is something that Raj Melvani, Head of Market Development, Corporates &amp; Commodities, Asia at Thomson Reuters says corporates building a centralised treasury operation should look to do. “For a majority of organisations, Treasury is considered a cost centre meaning there’s always pressure to do more with less,“he says. “Automating the FX workflow plays to these goals and allows treasury to generate cost and resource savings through increased efficiency.”</p>
<p>Beyond this, automating the FX workflow brings further benefits. Melvani explains that it allows treasury to deploy better controls and encourage segregation of duties. “Treasury can also aggregate trades across the group and execute from a single location. This reduces fees and treasury may improve pricing.”</p>
<p>An automated FX workflow also allows corporates to conduct post-trade execution quality analysis (EQA), something being considered by more corporates. Indeed, a <a href=""#poll-01"">poll</a> of the audience during the webinar found that 85% see value in using post-trade analysis to benchmark FX deals.</p>

<p><br/>Dan Guille, Director, Transaction Sales at Thomson Reuters, isn’t surprised by this. He says corporates are more focused on how they trade with counterparties and if this is delivering value. Guille explains that EQA allows corporates to get into the “nuts and bolts” of FX risk management. Significantly, it highlights whether corporates are paying the market-rate for their deals or if better pricing can be achieved elsewhere. As an illustration, EQA can show treasurers if better-pricing can be achieved by trading a certain currency at a particular point in the day or by using a different bank. “This is valuable data for a treasurer and allows them to make small tweaks to how they trade, which often results in significant cost savings.”</p>
<p>Melvani concludes by highlighting that these tools do not require significant investment – something that previously deterred some corporates in Asia. “FXall is deployed in the cloud,” he says. “This lowers the cost of installing and operating the system. It also means it can be scaled-up or down as FX trade volumes change. As a result, there is no reason that all corporates can’t achieve end-to-end FX excellence today.”</p>

<h5 id=""philippe-jaccard"">Philippe Jaccard, Head of Liquidity Management, ANZ:</h5>
<p>When FX volatility is high, the immediate reaction is to hedge any visible exposure by buying forwards, non-deliverable forwards, or options. And with so many currencies in Asia, the task can quickly become daunting, or the cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>Hedging is essentially buying financial products at a premium. Hedging too little can carry a heavy price (aside from the premium), but hedging too much can also cause losses. It’s like a heavy drinker and a chain smoker, with a bad diet, deciding to take on expensive health insurance upon realising their lifestyle is unhealthy. That insurance may secure the best room in the hospital but it won’t prevent the sickness.</p>
<p>Mitigating FX volatility should be a process managed internally using an adequate currency exposure management framework. Get on a diet! It is best to start with the profit and loss (P&amp;L) and splitting in- and out- cash flows by currencies to derive a net position within the company’s normal annual business cycle, which could be seasonal in the fashion and sports industries, for example.</p>
<p>The business cycle is defined by the time it takes to absorb currency volatility up and down the supply chain. For example, luxury watches may not have to pass on any negative movement whereas commodity goods traders may have to pass on the change immediately.</p>
<p>Once a net P&amp;L position for the appropriate time horizon is derived, a similar process needs to determine the structural exposure in the balance sheet – splitting assets and liabilities by currencies to derive a net equity position. If all assets and liabilities are valued in the same currency, there may be very little FX exposure left other than the P&amp;L. However, a company using heavy capital goods with an international replacement value may need to hedge the FX mismatch if the debt is in the domestic currency.</p>
<p>Once the P&amp;L and balance sheet exposures are well understood, consider redenominating supply chain contracts to minimise any currency mismatch. And do the same for assets and liabilities. Perhaps a US dollar loan could reduce the exposure if the company’s assets are mostly denominated in US dollars. This is a time where a gutsy treasurer could increase the mismatch to capitalise on a weakness but they better get the CEO aligned!</p>
<p>Lastly, the treasurer needs to ensure the shareholders’ expectations are aligned; do they expect a dividend in the next 12 months? How do they value FX exposure? Do they already hedge the risk? Do they consolidate the full balance sheet or just collect the dividend? This is usually established in a Treasury Board policy and approved at a shareholders’ meeting. It defines how much risk is acceptable, how the dividend will be paid, and in what currency.</p>
<p>Once it has been all worked out, the treasurer can start considering buying FX insurance products. The buying process can be centralised in a treasury centre, aggregating notional positions across the company. That would leverage the expertise of professionals, and secure access to the best prices in financial centres such as Singapore or Hong Kong. However, this could also come at a price if underlying cash flows no longer match the hedging gains and losses booked in different jurisdictions. This could cause unpleasant tax surprises: gains on a hedge may be treated as profit in one jurisdiction without the countervailing loss being netted out because it’s booked in another country, for example.</p>

<h5 id=""wolfgang-koester"">Wolfgang Koester, CEO, FiREapps:</h5>
<p>Automation! Automation! Automation! A trend that accelerated after the financial crisis of 2008, treasury professionals are now fully embracing automation. This movement came to Asia via Asia-based subsidiaries of large multinationals. Headquarters of North American and European companies needed to know what their global currency exposures were and they needed the accurate data quickly. To remedy this, they turned to financial technology solutions to help manage exposures for all their subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Today’s FX management programmes are less and less manual, and people are embracing modern technologies to run their formerly spreadsheet-based programmes. These technologies, especially the use of currency analytics to identify and manage currency exposures, provide access to accurate, complete and timely data and enable corporations to run an automated FX risk management programme, protecting them from volatile currency moves.</p>
<p>Now that treasury professionals in Asia have embraced automation to mitigate the impact of FX volatility, they need to figure how they can further leverage automated technologies to continue to streamline processes.</p>
<p>Automating FX is a key step in protecting earning and the improved operational efficiencies, deeper insights into currency trends, time savings and reduction in errors and risk enable companies to uphold the industry standard Management by Objective (MBO) of less than one cent EPS impact. Additionally, running an end-to-end automated FX programme, from data aggregation to analysis and trade execution, allows for corporations to pull data from multiple source systems, manage more currency pairs and reduce transaction costs of trading.</p>
<p>The need for technology that aggregates and analyses currency data is only going to continue to grow with the widespread adoption of international accounting standards. In the last ten years, treasury professionals that have chosen to leverage technology in order to better mitigate FX volatility have seen a 50% reduction in risk and have been able to increase their hedge ratios.</p>
<p>Treasury teams today are driven to leverage financial technology that provides insight into their exposures and enhanced analytics and reporting. Ultimately, for treasury professionals in Asia to mute the impact of FX volatility to their financial statements, they need to implement a technology-driven FX risk management programme that provides a better understanding of their currency risks and enables them to manage them fully.</p>

<h5 id=""sandip-patil"">Sandip Patil, Regional Head of Liquidity &amp; Investments &amp; Financial Institutions Group Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi:</h5>
<p>The last 18 months have been a rollercoaster ride for most treasury professionals in Asia in terms of navigating the FX markets. Starting from the Brexit referendum in June 2016 to the US presidential elections in November 2016 in the developed markets and closer to Asia, regulatory changes in Malaysia’s Foreign Exchange Administration rules in December 2016, these key events have certainly kept most treasury professionals in Asia extremely busy. The lack of depth in some of the local Asian swap markets, the limited hedging tools and the myriad of conditions that must be met in some jurisdictions before a hedge is permissible, all made the task of mitigating FX volatility a challenging one.</p>
<p>In Asia, companies with formal FX hedging policies typically mitigate their FX volatility by adopting a layered rolling hedge strategy. These hedges often do not extend beyond the 12 months’ horizon due to uncertainty in the forecasting and the costs involved in executing longer-term hedges. It is often a balancing act, especially when the cost of carry is high, and more so if a company operates in an environment where its pricing strategies are very much dependent on the actions of their close competitors. Whilst locking in their FX exposures may yield certainty in terms planning and budgeted rates, this may be detrimental especially when the market moves in the opposite direction of one’s hedges, leaving competitors with little or no hedges, the ability to price more aggressively to gain market share.</p>
<p>Spots, forwards and swaps are still the instruments of choice although savvier treasury professionals in Asia are slowly beginning to use FX options to enhance their overall hedge portfolio. Unlike their counterparts in the developed markets, treasury professionals in Asia are still reluctant to pay up on option premiums. In instances where hedging policies permit the usage of options, zero cost options are often preferred versus vanilla outright options. It is encouraging to note that some companies are beginning to adopt a more pro-active approach in managing their FX exposures arising from their strategic corporate decisions, such as a competitive bidding situation in an M&amp;A by working closely with their trusted advisors on deal contingent hedges.</p>
<p>Companies with a sizeable footprint across Asia have realised the importance of centralised treasuries, not only from a liquidity management perspective but also from the FX exposure management lens. With centralised treasuries in Asia, companies can leverage off their platforms and processes to manage both their cash positions and FX exposures simultaneously. This is critical given the diverse market and regulatory landscape across Asia, ranging from regulated markets to liberal ones.</p>
<p>The setting up of intercompany netting programmes and in-house banks have enabled companies in Asia to benefit from a reduction and consolidation of FX deals and to reap cost savings arising from minimisation of external transactions and FX costs, in addition to the operational efficiencies and benefit of improved visibility and control of cash that result from such centralisation.</p>
<p>In 2016, some companies took a quantum leap with their FX transformation project where they collaborated with their key partner bank to deploy the next generation of tools to manage their FX risk and associated payments. As companies across Asia continue to focus on cost and operational efficiencies, centralised treasuries with streamlined programmes across both liquidity and FX management may be the way forward.</p>

</div>
<p>In a recent webinar hosted by Treasury Today, Neill Penney, Managing Director, Trading at Thomson Reuters outlined what the new global code means and why it may be a good time for treasurers to take a deeper look into their FX activity.</p>
<p>The new code aims to establish principles of good conduct for the entire FX industry globally and whilst the code is not cast in tablets of regulatory stone, it will sit alongside existing national regulations. The code sets out to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent market applicable to the buy and sell side.</p>
<p>As Neill Penney stated: “The code is not regulation, but it defines conduct expected by regulators and regulators intend widespread adoption. This is the industry’s last chance to write its own rule book.”</p>
<h3 id=""six-key-principles"">Six key principles</h3>
<p>The code of conduct is organised around six guiding principles as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ethics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information sharing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management and compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmation and settlement processes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, adherence is the key aim of the new code and in order for it to be as broadly applicable as possible, the code is written with proportionality in mind. Adherence is a public declaration of support and, whilst the exact form is yet to be determined, it may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Public register</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent certification</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adherence is also based on an “all or nothing” approach; cherry-picking is not allowed.</p>
<p>It may be a good idea to keep abreast of the new code as it becomes clearer and review your treasury policy and procedures manual to ensure inclusion if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>The final publication of the complete FX Global Code is targeted for May 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Smith Awards 2016 Highly Commended Winner – Best Risk Management Solution</strong></p>
<p>This project’s focus on risk mitigation was a Highly Commended Winner in the Best Risk Management Solution category.</p>
<p>Hilton’s story is noteworthy in the degree of turnaround relative to the original problem. They had a large, complex portfolio of intercompany loans, maintained in multiple databases and without a policy governing associated transactions. It had no comprehensive visibility to aggregate positions or exposures. Hilton had no prospective sense of potential FX risk to earnings or cash flow. Lacking that information, it had no ability to mitigate either risk. Today, Hilton’s intercompany loan portfolio has been reorganised and dramatically simplified.</p><p>This webinar was held on Wednesday 8th February 2017.</p>

<p>Recent bouts of volatility in the currency markets, fuelled in part by the Brexit vote and then the US presidential election result, is increasing the importance of prudent FX management among corporate treasury departments of all shapes and sizes. This is supported by the findings from Treasury Today’s recent Voice of Corporate Treasury Study. When asked “What are you going to be prioritising over the next 12/18 months?” the findings from the universe, comprising over 350 corporates, revealed the number one area rated as very important was foreign exchange risk management/hedging. Furthermore, when asked to select from a list, currency volatility was cited as presenting the greatest risk by a clear margin.</p>
<p>The challenges corporate treasurers often face around transparency and control of foreign currency receipts further underline these risks as a focal point. When not being actively managed, corporates’ FX receipts are typically processed by financial institutions utilising standard/board FX rates. Details including conversion rate, remitter and original amount are not known upfront, as the corporate is generally notified of the execution only after their account has been credited.</p>
<p>In an attempt to manage unhedged FX receipts, corporates typically take one of the two approaches, both of which have operational and commercial disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Approach one: clients hold multiple currency accounts in which they accumulate receipts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approach two: clients ask their bank(s) to contact them for every foreign currency receipt which requires conversion in order to agree upon an FX rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As David J. Cooper, Head of the FX4Cash™ Product Specialist Team, Deutsche Bank in Asia remarks, “If clients have taken the first approach and manage FX receipts via multi-currency accounts, they could be holding unhedged FX exposure in non-core currencies, with balances only utilised on an ad-hoc basis. Furthermore, they face potential non-FX related costs and/or risks associated with managing multi-currency accounts, including operational, reconciliation and audit costs, as well as bank fees.”</p>
<p>And for corporates following the second approach, the manually intensive process is both expensive and inefficient. The human element prevents immediate execution and exposes the client to FX risk on applicable receipts. Additionally, the process still lacks timely transparency of the flows, potentially impacting liquidity planning for their liabilities.</p>
<h3 id=""innovating-to-meet-market-needs-and-challenges"">Innovating to meet market needs and challenges</h3>
<p>It goes nearly without saying that banks and other service providers have been alert to many of the challenges faced by corporates. Spending a significant amount of time listening to clients and observing market trends, Deutsche Bank has paid particular focus to local currency invoicing, expansion of shared services centres (SSCs) and their growing demand for pan-regional solutions, as well as the rise of intra-Asian trade.</p>
<p>“This dialogue and analysis highlighted a market gap wherein a fully comprehensive foreign currency receipts offering was not available for the corporate client base,” says Cooper. “Acknowledging the positive impact a solution could make for our clients, we focused on this opportunity area for investment.”</p>

<p>In doing so, Deutsche Bank developed a solution to effectively manage clients’ foreign currency receipts, without the need to hold currency accounts except in the core functional currency. Clients can issue a single settlement instruction to all their payors and direct all receipts to the required account.</p>
<p>Clients can engage with Deutsche Bank in two different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Instructing Deutsche Bank to manage their foreign currency receipts through pre-defined conversion rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interacting via the FX Payments App (on Deutsche Bank’s Autobahn App Market) to manage foreign currency receipts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Providing enhanced visibility and control over their foreign currency receipts, the solution allows clients to decide what receivables get converted, how they get converted (automatically or manually), when they get converted, and where they are credited to.</p>
<p>In giving optionality around these decision points, clients can determine their own level of engagement throughout the life-cycle of their FX receipts process. This flexibility is an integral piece of the bank’s product strategy when it comes to providing self-service capabilities across a growing spectrum of cash and treasury management services.</p>
<h3 id=""providing-a-strategic-solution"">Providing a strategic solution</h3>
<p>Deutsche Bank offers this solution through its FX4Cash™ Receivables platform, which functions as follows in response to the what, how, when and where decision points:</p>
<h5>What gets converted</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clients can receive in up to 35 currencies (subject to market). The funds are converted and credited to a currency and an account of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients can also choose to accumulate receipts and book a single FX trade against them. For example, companies in the travel industry might receive multiple small receipts in foreign currency. With this capability, the platform allows them to accumulate and execute larger conversions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>How they get converted</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clients can choose to auto-convert below a certain threshold amount, at real time rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients can manage large value payments (above a pre-defined amount) themselves; choosing to either override conversion rules and settle in the same currency or convert to the currency of their choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>When they get converted</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Payments can be converted immediately upon receipt, the client can choose to defer the FX conversion (subject to local regulations) to meet future payment needs, or as mentioned above, receipts can be aggregated to book larger, single FX trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email alerts can be issued at various stages in the process, including reminder alerts for receivables pending action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Where they get credited</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Funds can be converted and credited to the client’s account with Deutsche Bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternately, the client can choose to route funds to their preferred cash management bank post-conversion, subject to local market regulations and restrictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing corporate clients with additional transparency, a variety of reporting options are available. The solution offers standard reporting, dedicated reporting and online dashboard visibility – at summary and transactional level. Real-time and/or execution rates are evidenced per transaction by a date and time stamp.</p></div>

<p>Adrian Brown set the scene by emphasising the presentation’s focus was on operational FX rather than strategic FX, the latter being well understood and well served. He went on to pose questions around some commonly misunderstood themes, including, “do you know there is a margin and do you know what that margin is?”</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<h3 id=""making-effective-cross-border-payments"">Making effective cross-border payments</h3>
<p>Wim Grosemans offered some interesting advice around how to identify delays and errors in the cross-border payments process and steps to take to improve efficiencies. He also highlighted some tips when sending US dollars to the US, RMB to China and RUB to Russia. He explained, “including the BIC and IBAN in your payment is the standard, but not for all currencies or countries.” BNP Paribas offer a practical guide to making payments in over 130 currencies: see <a href=""http://cashmanagement.bnpparibas.com/currency-guide"" target=""_blank"">cashmanagement.bnpparibas.com/<br/>
currency-guide</a></p>
<p>Grosemans then discussed the new SWIFT gpi initiative scheduled for 2017 and mentioned its key benefits: <strong>Transparency on fees, same day use of funds, track and trace feature and full payment information</strong>.</p>
<h3 id=""optimising-receivables"">Optimising receivables</h3>
<p>This section highlighted two main operational challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>While SEPA has contributed to harmonising formats for credit transfers and direct debits, treasurers still face disparate payment behaviours in the Eurozone where clients tend to insist on using legacy payment methods – like the RIBA in Italy. Outside the Eurozone this is obviously a problem as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As transaction volumes and client numbers go up, it is becoming increasingly important to allocate funds automatically in the right place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The BNP Paribas Virtual IBAN solution enables corporates to combine the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allocation of a unique IBAN account number to each of a company’s clients. Clients will pay using this IBAN which corresponds to a BNP Paribas branch. The funds will end up in a single physical bank account with this virtual IBAN showing in reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocation of a virtual IBAN per collecting business unit, helping to allocate the funds automatically in the right place, again using one physical bank account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Grosemans explained, “should you wish, you could also use such a structure to automatically reallocate funds to an account in another currency. BNP Paribas can offer this in an expanding number of countries and payment instruments, domestic and cross-border alike.”</p>
<h3 id=""liquidity-management"">Liquidity management</h3>
<p>The major challenges and opportunities BNP Paribas would identify in an international corporate environment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improving the accuracy of treasury forecasting – this depends on organisational set-up and infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving global visibility on cash – this gets more difficult as the number of partners a company is working with are multiplied and if it is addressed as global or regional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimising yield on the consolidated cash position – interest rates on long and short positions are not quite the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralising global liquidity and unlocking any “trapped” cash.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Grosemans concluded: “The chances are you will be better off with a combination of cross currency notional and/or physical pooling. Bear in mind that by implementing a strategy to manage currency mismatches in liquidity management, ultimately you will further optimise your overall working capital management – avoiding the need to reach out to external financing, mobilising short-term investments and eliminating inter-bank margins for the offset positions.”</p>
<h3 id=""five-steps-to-conclude"">Five steps to conclude:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conduct an operational audit of FX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the right balance between maintaining currency accounts and using international payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use international payments effectively.</p>
</li>

<p>Ericsson’s exposures are huge. They operate in virtually every country, except North Korea, and trade in 100+ currencies comprising more than 500 currency pairs. Managing foreign exchange risk is, therefore, a major challenge for the Ericsson treasury team, especially in such volatile times.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this challenge, the Ericsson treasury team, led by Magnus Attoff, Head of Financial Risk Management &amp; Operations have worked to transform how it manages FX risk enabling the company to dramatically improve its currency risk management. Over the three years of this incredibly impressive transformation project, Ericsson has executed over US$20bn in currency hedges.</p>
<p>Ericsson’s story, and the company’s use of the FiREapps currency analytics platform, was detailed in a recent webinar hosted by Treasury Today and highlights how the provision of better currency information is driving smarter currency decisions which has led to some very impressive outcomes.</p>
<p><a class=""btn"" href=""/webinar/previous-webinars#2016-11-ericsson"">Watch webinar now</a></p>
<h3 id=""a-spotlight-on-the-solution"">A spotlight on the solution</h3>
<p>Importantly, Ericsson needed to nimbly support three different types of hedging environments – restricted, on-shore and off-shore. “Our primary issue was to gather our exposure data in a much more timely manner. We have a protect our balance sheet policy which means we are trying to get to zero, or as close to zero FX P&amp;L as possible,” Attoff explained.</p>
<p>During the webinar Attoff spoke about how Ericsson is now much more a learning and changing organisation. He also focused on one primary issue; data accuracy, and both he and Wolfgang Koester, CEO FiREapps explained how the data, process, structure and technology issues are inter-linked. They also emphasised the importance of a single SAP platform, the need to align the corporate strategy and to obtain the buy-in across the enterprise from functions with responsibility for risk, accounting, control, markets and information technology.</p>
<p>Key performance indicators (KPIs) were also cited as key and one clear overarching goal to guide their ongoing performance and improvement stood out – FX P&amp;L as close to ZERO as possible. Ericsson approached this ambition by focusing upon four primary areas:</p>
<h5>Time:</h5>
<p>The team needed to use less time collecting data and more time running value added analysis and forecasts.</p>
<h5>Insight:</h5>
<p>The global scale of their business meant they needed to strike the optimal balance between local and regional insight.</p>
<h5>Flexibility:</h5>
<p>They needed flexibility in order to apply different strategies across the myriad of regulatory environments to which Ericsson is exposed.</p>
<h5>Collaboration:</h5>
<p>They needed to nimbly support the three different hedging environments mentioned above.</p>
<p>The results are staggering – 33% faster decision-making in the monthly cycle (2 days less), US$2m+ per year in cost savings (US$6.7m in total) and 180 days per year of unnecessary processes eliminated (human capital impact).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I had told you I could take risk off and save you US$2m a year, would you have believed me?”</p>
<p><cite>Wolfgang Koester, CEO, FiREapps</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attoff summarised the key learning points from his transformational journey under three key headings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Don’t get deterred</h5>
<p>Smartly designed plans for evolution of the programme initially broke and the entire team had to find new solutions quickly to maintain momentum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Get the right people to buy-in</h5>
<p>Having the right mix of accounting, risk, IT and controlling on the team made all the difference when we were hitting setbacks and hurdles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>You need a shared, clear goal</h5>
<p>Having a clearly understood and mutually shared goal of equipping our people with more time to act as strategic risk managers.</p>
</li>

<br/>
<p>The aftermath of Brexit, perhaps more than any recent shock in a G10 currency, clearly highlighted there are still two camps of corporate treasury organisations – those who are empowered to be proactive about corporate currency management, and those who are still left on reactive footing.</p>
<p>Leading into Brexit, the proactive teams ran scenario analyses and projected the potential effects of a sharp GBP devaluation (or the versa); and further potential ripple effects. As the odds flipped, many teams ‘tightened’ (raised) hedge coverage for exposures such as GBP, USD and EUR. In the days before, these teams double-checked analyses, ensuring scenarios were still intact and as projected. Each time, the ‘current state’ and ongoing expectations were communicated to executives, and the cycle repeated a few days later and a couple of weeks later.</p>
<p>For these global teams, shocks and fluctuations happen – this is business as usual. But, thanks to proactive steps, financial results were insulated – no reaction required.</p>
<p>Contrast the proactive team’s actions with the reactive group. These teams scrambled for weeks, not only to accurately report the present impact, but also the future, expected impact.</p>
<p>So, in context, what steps have corporates been taking since to mitigate further risks?</p>
<p>Short term: companies in the proactive boat ‘stayed the course’. There have been further shocks which resulted in slight surprises (early October GBP) but for the most part it is business as usual.</p>
<p>Of the corporates caught in reactive mode, many used this opportunity to build internal support to empower proactive currency management. These corporates have been:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clearly documenting and communicating (internally) the existing currency process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively working to identify holes in process or programmes that result in poor timing or inaccurate analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging strategic partners such as banks, who have a plethora of value-adding services to offer, to empower their teams to manage this new, volatile environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Long term, both sets of organisations (proactive or not) are now going through yearly planning cycles in which an eye is focused on understanding the volatile markets and securing operational results, globally. This cycle is where pricing adjustments (and other tactics) come into focus. That said, while pricing adjustments and sales freezes are not new (Apple, 2014 Russian ruble crisis) they are often a last resort; taking other internal measures is often preferred and more cost effective/competitive.</p>
<p>Teams who were not prepared for Brexit but now have internal support, are taking a long-term view, putting into place programmes which prevent further internal shocks. Those who were proactive are staying the course. Both are/may still be reviewing pricing changes. In truth, the only bad (apparently dangerous) strategy after the latest shock is doing nothing. We’ve already witnessed, privately, the demotion of practitioners as CFOs were surprised that currency risk was not managed; and publicly, we have already seen a UK-based CFO (Sports Direct) step down amid continued currency impact and fallout.</p>

<p>The Marmitegate illustrates the consequences of sharp currency fluctuations and the effect that they might have on the profit margins of importing companies like Unilever.</p>
<p>A sharp currency movement can have an immediate impact on the costs of an importer, and the pound sell-off after the Brexit Referendum – which has devalued approximately 20% against both the euro and the dollar – has put Tesco and Unilever in an awkward situation. Who is to blame for the price hikes?</p>
<p>The answer would have to be found on the terms of the agreement between the supplier and the retailer. In that sense, we might be in one of these three scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The contract includes a clause that contemplates currency risks. The supplier has the right to change prices in case the exchange rate fluctuations exceed a certain margin. It might be that these margins are wide and that Tesco did not anticipate that the pound could drop to a 30-year low, as it happened. However, if this is the case, Tesco would be assuming the currency risk, even if indirectly, as Unilever is entitled to pass their higher costs in foreign currency to the product. It is on Tesco to choose between reducing their own margins and hold prices steady or maintain their margins and increase product prices, and face losing customers to competitors with cheaper options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contract establishes a fixed price during a specific period of time. These contracts only contemplate a renegotiation when that period (six months, one year, 18 months) expires. The supplier takes the currency risk in the interim. In this case, Unilever would be responsible for establishing a currency policy that guarantees steady profit margins for the total volume of sales during the period of the contract. If such is the case, Unilever would not be entitled to change the prices of its products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contract does not consider currency risk and the supplier wants to renegotiate prices because his costs have increased. It is unlikely that Unilever did not have any clause to cover its risk against pound devaluation (either regarding margins as in the first case, or in terms of time, as in the second case). In such a scenario both parties would have to negotiate who assumes the impact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Currency fluctuations multiply impacts on corporate profits, as margins are eroded by several times the size of the movement. To explain, if your profit margin is 30%, a 15% decline on the currency exchange would not translate in a 15% drop on your profits, but would slash 50% of your earnings.</p>

<p>The Brexit decision certainly came as a surprise to many organisations and in line with well-publicised predictions the pound has suffered a wide-scale depreciation against other currencies. This volatility has impacted companies in different ways. A lot depends on the size of the organisation, its home market and in what currencies it transacts. For instance in sterling terms, an exporter pricing in foreign currency would have become more competitive of late. An importer, however might be finding these times a little more challenging.</p>
<p>That being said, the impact of Brexit on the currency market has put FX risk and the management of this clearly into focus for most companies. The need for an effective and robust FX policy is clear. Those companies, who have typically not managed FX risk proactively, may have experienced an unexpected FX gain or loss situation and therefore should consider the merits of having a policy in place. Whilst, on the other hand, those treasury departments that do have a legacy policy should be checking that this remains viable in these times of material changes to exchange rates.</p>
<p>No matter how this policy is drafted, however, treasury departments must always remember that its main objective is to manage the risk; not play the market. As such, any treasury policy should be able to hold firm, no matter what events occur in the market, by making it more robust to turbulence and clearly understood by all, including the board.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, treasurers in those companies impacted by the currency volatility have a chance to highlight the function’s strategic worth. Educating the key stakeholders within the business is a treasurer’s responsibility so that this often overlooked risk is clearly understood along with methods of mitigating it.</p>
<p>Long term, there are some fundamental and long-standing challenges that must be overcome for treasury departments to effectively manage FX risk. Key to this is ensuring that the information flow including forecasting is as accurate as possible. This will allow treasury to have a better understanding of what to hedge and what not to hedge and how to separate transaction from translation risk.</p>
<p>Key areas to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The objective of treasury is not to play the market but to manage risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result of the Brexit vote may have taken organisations by surprise, so when it comes to the impact of FX there will be winners and losers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For companies actively engaged in business that is not in their domestic currency, it is crucial to have an understanding of the risks involved and have a clear FX policy in place, even if the policy states that there will be no FX hedging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury must not be dogmatic and therefore be open to revisiting the policy in light of the major shifts in FX rates that have been experienced.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>In 2015, currency volatility couldn’t be kept out of the headlines. Today, a big question for many corporates is when, and where, the next shock will come from and, perhaps more importantly, am I prepared? In this article, experts from the world of banking, consultancy and corporate treasury share their views on how to best manage currency risk in a volatile world.</em></p>
<p>It has been a year in which the management of currency volatility has been firmly in the forefront of treasurers’ minds as a number of events caused sharp movements and shocks to global currency markets. These ranged from the Swiss central bank’s sudden unpegging of the Swiss franc from the euro; one of the most dramatic central bank announcements of recent times, and an event that created a selling tsunami in the market that brought a number of FX brokers to their knees. Other notable instances include China’s shock devaluation of the RMB in August, an event which served to exacerbate the already volatile currencies of many emerging economies such as Brazil, Malaysia, Turkey, Russia and Indonesia. Today, the threat of a currency war is real and its potential implications for corporates and their earnings could be profound.</p>
<p>We are already seeing this in the financial statements of many companies. Data compiled by the Frontier Strategy Group, for instance, highlights that $51bn was lost by the 211 European and North American companies surveyed due to negative currency impacts in the first half of 2015. Whilst these losses are the direct impact of currency volatility there are other impacts that, arguably, remain hidden including the potential risk of a ratings downgrade and the increased cost of access to capital.</p>
<p>Many predict that this volatility is here to stay, at least for the time being. The reason being that the two main causes of volatility, the divide in policy between the US Federal Reserve and the world’s other major central banks and the continued weakness of commodity prices that is creating a general malaise in the global economy, look set to continue. And whilst this trend is a ‘known’ (to borrow on old expression used by a former US Defence Secretary) that corporates can look to manage, it is the ‘known unknown’, namely that corporates cannot easily predict what direction currencies will move and when, that makes hedging such a challenging activity to get right.</p>
<h3 id=""understanding-the-risk"">Understanding the risk</h3>
<p>Whilst currency risk is an ever present challenge, the recent bouts of volatility, and the losses suffered as a result have certainly caused treasurers to become more attentive to its management in the past year. The difficultly, however, is that currency risk is a complex subject that cannot be approached with a broad brush. The first step that treasurers should take, therefore, is to make an attempt to understand the different types of currency risk and from where these exposures arise. A research note published earlier this year by PwC succinctly highlight the three key exposures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Economic exposures.</h5>
<br/>
<p>These arise from selecting markets and choosing office and factory locations plus the currency profile of your competitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Transaction exposures.</h5>
<br/>
<p>These arise from generating revenues and incurring costs in various currencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Translation exposures.</h5>
<br/>
<p>These arise from the revaluation of foreign currency balances (cash, receivables and payables) in accordance with accounting rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this knowledge in tow the next step is understanding how these various exposures manifest themselves. Unfortunately, as with most aspects of managing currency risk, this is rarely, if ever, a straightforward task. As Yann Umbricht, Partner and Treasury UK Leader at PwC explains: “You only begin to see that risk management processes are not working effectively when there is a crisis and unexpected FX gains or losses begin to appear in the profit and loss account. The challenge then is understanding why and where your risk management process has failed.” According to Umbricht the reasons for this are typically multi-faceted and are not often obvious.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Managing currency risk is complex because the end-to-end process flows far beyond the office of treasury. “The exposure begins from the strategic decision to buy or sell in a particular market,” explains Umbricht. “It then flows all the way through to accounting where the impacts of these decisions are seen. Treasury sits somewhere in the middle of this.” It is Umbricht’s view that the only way to effectively manage the risk is for all these departments to work together to clarify what the organisation is trying to achieve and then build a robust and agile risk management framework that defines who will do what and when.</p>
<h3 id=""bringing-it-home"">Bringing it home</h3>
<p>A corporate’s FX management policy should, if completed correctly, outline what exposures to manage – be they economic, transaction or translation related – and how. And there is no single right answer – it really depends on each individual corporate’s exposures and how these impact cash flows. Following analysis, some corporates may wish to hedge every exposure, some may wish to hedge part, while others none. According to Mike Robertson, Global Head of Transactional FX at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), whether a treasurer chooses to hedge an exposure in part or fully, is still doing something. “The question corporates should therefore ask themselves is what is the best approach to manage their exposures and why. This analysis should lead to a risk management framework to work within.”</p>
<h4 id=""chart-1"">Chart 1: Total currency volatility</h4>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/risk-management/fx-risk/2016-01-tt-10-rm-chart-01-total-currency-volatility-967x658.png?la=en&amp;hash=34AE35A0E14E6611AACEA770165361B4"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Chart 1: Total currency volatility"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/risk-management/fx-risk/2016-01-tt-10-rm-chart-01-total-currency-volatility-967x658.png?la=en&amp;hash=34AE35A0E14E6611AACEA770165361B4"" width=""967""/></a></p>
<p class=""source""><em>Source: Frontier Strategy Group</em></p>
<p>With this framework in place the final piece of the complex jigsaw is ensuring that the decisions are being made from accurate forecasts built with accurate data. Of course, the issue of accurate cash flow forecasting opens another Pandora’s Box of challenges for corporates, but without this it would be almost impossible to effectively hedge currency risk. This again places the onus outside of the treasury office and onto other departments. Treasurers, therefore have a vital role to play in ensuring that these departments understand what they need and how to ensure the data they are inputting is robust.</p>
<p>Building a robust framework and ensuring that the data it has is correct is something that the Honeywell treasury has strived to achieve over recent years. Over half of Honeywell’s sales are outside its home market, the US, meaning that changes in FX can have a meaningful impact on the company’s reported financial results. “We therefore place a lot of focus on managing FX and have built a solid framework, using both people and systems, to gather and analyse information around FX and our exposures.” To do this, Jim Colby, Assistant Treasurer at Honeywell and his treasury team have worked closely with other Honeywell business units and senior management to ensure exposures are reported correctly. “Systems are important and are the means by which we input the data, aggregate our exposures and understand the impact they have on our company. But it is perhaps even more vital to educate people within the business to understand the various risks.”</p>
<h3 id=""to-hedge-or-not-to-hedge"">To hedge or not to hedge?</h3>
<p>With this information at hand, the company will then need to decide whether to hedge or not. Naturally corporates should not hedge just for the sake of it and, whilst losses during extremely volatile times may be painful in the short term, the treasurer should not panic as currency movements over the long term are often offset by price changes, thus reducing the real risk.</p>
<p>Once the decision what to hedge has been taken, the next call to be made concerns what particular product is to be used. Again there are many factors that play into this decision including: what is being hedged, why, and for how long. Other factors, including senior management’s understanding of hedging products, may also influence this decision.</p>
<p>Despite the recent bout of volatility the products that corporates use to hedge have not changed a great deal. The four most commonly used FX derivatives remain futures, options, forwards and swaps. Yet, in recent months there has been debate within the profession around the usage of these products for hedging particular transactions. Take for example FX forwards, the most commonly used corporate hedging instrument. Whilst the efficacy of these instruments for the purpose of hedging the major currencies remains unquestioned, some corporates have closely examined the effectiveness of forwards in the hedging of EM currencies. This is primarily due to the fact that, quite often, the risk premium on these products is very expensive. Corporates may therefore wish to consider various options contracts instead which are known to have a lower premium than forwards.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is something that the Honeywell treasury team and Colby have recently been investigating. “Currently we work exclusively with forward contacts because these deliver the greatest amount of certainty which, we want in our results,” says Colby. “Yet, in recent months we have been exploring the use of options to hedge certain currencies.” For Colby the benefit of using options is that treasury can ensure some degree of certainty whilst also preserving the upside on its underlying exposures. “Some currencies have been on a continuous downward trend, as have been many EM currencies, this therefore could be a logical step to take.”</p>
<p>Of course, vanilla instruments can be layered with complexity to create exotic derivatives, but it is largely recommended that corporates keep their hedging strategies simple. “This is down to the levels of understanding that senior management has,” explains PwC’s Umbricht. “If you go to the board with a complex instrument, even if it is the perfect hedge, if the board can’t understand it they will probably not agree to its use. Choosing a simple hedge can also significantly reduce the complexity associated with hedge accounting.” Also, if the hedge goes wrong then there can be significant repercussions on the business and it is unlikely that a treasurer would want their name attached to that.</p>
<p>However, a hedging instrument can only go so far. “Natural hedging is always preferred because financial hedging has a finite life, each hedge has a maturity date and after this you are exposed again,” says Colby. “That is why I think finding ways to develop natural offsets to your currency exposures is a more permanent solution to mitigate currency risk.” Yet, with many things related to driving change to implement natural offsets is not a treasury issue alone. “Natural hedges are ultimately a business decision,” says Colby. “Treasury can find these and help the business understand them but there needs to be coordination and cooperation across the business to push these through and make lasting change.”</p>
<h3 id=""overcoming-the-regulatory-pressures"">Overcoming the regulatory pressures</h3>
<p>As if treasurers do not already have enough to contend with, given the recent volatility, hedging strategies are also being impacted by regulatory pressures. For Honeywell’s Colby, this has manifested itself in two ways: “It is tough to meet the reporting requirements that have come from European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and Dodd-Frank. For instance, we need to report all our European inter-affiliate activities with the European authorities within 24 hours of trading.” To be able to comply, Honeywell has had to invest significant amounts into sophisticated technology.</p>
<p>Aside from this, Colby also sees the Basel III regulations having an impact on the pricing of derivatives. “The increased bank capital and leverage requirements have made certain products more expensive,” he says. “Especially longer dated derivatives. As a reaction to this it wouldn’t surprise me to see corporates roll shorter-dated hedges in order to reduce the cost.” There is still value to be found in the market, however, because of variations in the way that Basel III has been implemented across the globe. “We use FXall as our multi-dealer FX platform and this enables us to send our deal request out to a wide market and obtain the best deal.”</p>
<p>Banks it seem are also recognising the issue and are innovating in order help their clients. Bank of America Merrill Lynch for example has recently launched a product, CashPro® Flow, which guarantees the rate for a set time period, yet this isn’t classified as a derivative and can only be used for transactional volumes. “The treasury risk in the trade and payment space is largely predicable and thematic,” says Suzanne Janse van Rensburg, EMEA Head of Liquidity for GTS at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “This product therefore allows corporates to reduce the FX background noise and focus on the real FX exposures.” It is Janse van Rensburg’s belief that this is a space where banks will continue to innovate in order to ensure that corporates have the tools and services they need to support them in an uncertain world.</p>
<p>With experts saying that currency volatility is not likely to be going away anytime soon, and regulation adding further pressure on the resources of both corporates and banks, innovation may be key to ensuring that corporates can continue to navigate this landscape effectively. But, as Honeywell has proved, when it comes to hedging FX, corporates would be well-advised to keep it simple and do the basics correctly – report, understand and act. This is the key to protecting corporate cash flow – however volatile the markets become.</p>

<div class=""copy__body"">
<h3 id=""naturally-exposed"">Naturally exposed</h3>
<p>Rather than paying to use hedging instruments, many corporates will analyse their cash flows and try to spot natural hedges within their business. Yet, Jan Vermeer, Director at Belgium based consultancy firm Treasury Services, believes that, when analysed closely, what is perceived to be a natural hedge is often not effective.</p>
<p>“The mistake that corporates make is that they attempt to apply cash management techniques to risk management,” says Vermeer. “For example, if $100 comes into the business and $100 leaves then this is net $0 and it would seem the exposure is naturally hedged.” But Vermeer highlights that while this is true, a corporate is also assuming that the risk sensitivities of the two cash flows are equal, which is very often not the case.</p>
<p>Vermeer believes that the reason for this is because transactional FX exposures exist in two categories: committed exposures such as outstanding invoices and receipts and anticipated exposures predicted in forecasting. “These two exposures have different sensitivities,” explains Vermeer. “Committed exposures for instance are not sensitive to changes in prices due to exchange rate movements. Yet, many corporates I speak to who naturally hedge assume that the sensitivities are equal. And with more corporates moving to natural hedges because of the increasing cost of derivatives, in many cases they are actually neglecting their risks and this can result in increased volatility in earnings.”</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>The USD has made significant gains against Asia ex-Japan (AXJ) currencies for three straight years. This weakness in AXJ currencies has been driven by a combination of Fed policy tightening expectations, weak external demand and a collapse in commodity prices. The currencies which have been the hardest hit, not surprisingly, are the largest net commodity exporters in the region – Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>We believe corporate treasurers in the region have now almost entirely embraced the expectation of continued USD strength both in the run-up to and beyond the first Fed rate hike in almost a decade. In line with that, corporates in Asia with USD payables have steadily increased their hedge ratios over the past year or so. As such, while we could still see incremental hedging-related USD demand post the Fed hike, we do not expect a ‘taper tantrums’ kind of market stress scenario, as corporates are much better hedged compared to 2013. In India, for instance, central bank data as well as our own proprietary FX flow data supports the view that corporates with FX liabilities have shown an increased propensity to hedge. The Reserve Bank of India reported that hedge ratios on external commercial borrowings and foreign currency convertible bonds had improved to 41% during April-June 2015, compared to only 15% during July-August 2014.</p>
<p>Hedging strategies for corporates with net USD receivables have not been uniform across AXJ markets. In India, given the very attractive carry, exporters have either increased the hedge ratios or extended the duration for which they hedge their receivables. However, in Malaysia, where domestic currency depreciation has been far more entrenched and the carry is not as attractive, exporters have generally remained on the sidelines awaiting better levels to sell USD-MYR.</p>
<p>In North Asia, China’s FX policy is in transition from an official focus on the CNY value against the US dollar to a focus on the CNY’s value against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. This creates scope for greater two-way variability in the USD-CNY spot rate and over time will likely prompt more active hedging of forward CNY-denominated receivables and overseas FX payables by corporates in the region. So far, MNCs in Asia have been particularly active in hedging their FX exposure. Mainland China exporters appear to have scaled back their USD forward sales following the August China fix reform and mainland importers may have boosted holdings of USD deposits onshore. However, there is still considerable growth for more active China importer hedging of FX risk – not least as the domestic options market finally springs into life.</p>
<p>Commodity prices at multi-year extremes have sparked an upturn in corporate hedging activity both by producers and consumers with a particular focus on metals (such as copper and aluminium). Consumers may have been active in longer forwards locking in depressed prices while option strategies potentially help protect producers from balance sheet stresses associated with any new downdraft in global commodity prices.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>There has been considerable concern about currency volatility building over the last year. The weakening euro at the end of 2014 and early 2015, and the devaluation of RMB over three days in August 2015, were events that focused corporate minds on hedging possibilities that their companies perhaps had not previously considered in earnest. Last year also saw commodity prices plummet. Ensuing hedging strategies aimed at benefitting from such declines have tended to be industry – and often entity – specific. Chinese airlines, for instance, tend not to hedge fuel, giving rise to windfall gains compared to other airlines locked in at much higher rates. Unhedged airlines, however, are obviously susceptible to future increases in the price of oil if they remain unhedged.</p>
<p>Given the recent sea change for commodities and currencies, now might be a good time for corporates to revisit their hedging strategies. But such a review across Asia Inc is not necessarily evident from available information. When we help companies review hedging strategies, it is not uncommon to find that decisions are not aligned with the company’s claimed hedging objectives. Equally, a closer look at these strategies may reveal that they are only optimal at certain points in the range of commodity or currency rates. For example, the use of certain instruments might be a sound strategy when oil prices are low, but not further up the curve.</p>
<p>We often find there is also an element of commodity basis risk. Corporates often do not hedge their entire exposure – frequently on the grounds of availability of suitable instruments, a lack of clarity where they might uplift bunkers, or because the cost of a matching instrument is prohibitive.</p>
<p>Hedging strategies in currency markets can generally be split into two main areas: FX exposures arising from purchases/sales (‘trading’) and exposure to foreign currency debt. Historically, many Asian companies have not hedged, or (for those that have hedged) under-hedged their FX exposure from trading activities. In some cases, this was because they were actively taking a position on future currency movements. In others it was due to inadequate forecasting capabilities; if a corporate cannot reliably estimate the extent of their currency exposure in any period it is often prudent to scale back hedging activities. Those companies that have hedged tend to use simple instruments – swaps and forwards. We are, however, seeing more companies at least considering options-based products, particularly those dealing with RMB.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2016, we hope to see a slight change in the mind-set of some companies, typically those new to hedging. These companies tend to view the success of their hedging based on whether or not they achieved a better rate. Instead, treasurers need to measure their hedging strategies based on whether it achieved their objectives, regardless of whether a hedge ‘won’ or ‘lost’. For example, did they ‘fix’ their cash flows successfully, so they had certainty? There is a lot that can be done to manage ongoing volatility; it’s largely a question of making sure decisions made in the name of risk management are being made for the right reasons.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>The Asia Pacific region has suffered from a significant amount of volatility in recent years. Within treasury departments, companies are having to adopt new strategies to manage these volatilities – and even look to ways to profit from them. We are seeing companies respond in a couple of different ways. At a higher strategic level, companies are having to re-evaluate their hedging policies and strategies and on a tactical level, they are attempting to view and manage their risk holistically across the enterprise.</p>
<p>Strategic reviews are being undertaken by many companies attempting to better define the risk/return profile of the enterprise. These endeavour to ensure that all risks are identified and quantified before policies are formulated to manage these risks. Increasingly, these policies are becoming a matter of consideration for the board who need to agree on the nature and structure of hedging strategies. Factors for consideration in a strategic review include: minimising year-on-year cash flow volatility, protecting financial targets, managing financial risk within a board approved risk management framework, maximising the use of increasingly tight bank counterparty credit risk and available credit lines, approving an appropriate budget for option premiums and defining the size of mark-to-market position of derivatives. Corporates will, of course, also be looking at competitor hedging strategies.</p>
<p>Tactically, one of the hurdles to effective hedging has been that many businesses place a distinction between currency hedging and commodity hedging. Traditionally, commodity hedging has taken place in the procurement department, while currency hedging is carried out by the treasury. However, there is increasing recognition that there is correlation between these two risk areas, and effective risk management cannot be pursued while these are siloed. Most businesses recognise the most effective hedge is the natural offset. Therefore, corporates need a holistic view of commodity price risk, FX exposure risk, and liquidity (interest rate risk) to maximise the benefit of possible offset. This can be hard to measure and control when commodity hedging is managed by procurement, FX risk by treasury, and liquidity risk by finance.</p>
<p>Consequently, more and more companies are bringing these risk areas together under a single management – risk management, treasury or finance. This presents many benefits, including: improved risk management across the enterprise by enabling complete visibility to correlated risk factors, maximised value of hedging expenditure by eliminating ‘double hedging’ and improved decision-making by enabling integrated risk modelling, simulations and analytics reporting. Corporates can also measure pre and post trade hedge effectiveness to minimise earnings volatility. This enables the enterprise to automate hedging rules and methodologies to ensure that hedges are being correctly designated. This benefits finance by giving reassurance that earnings statements are being correctly reported and subject to minimal volatility. Finally, being able to measure hedge effectiveness and minimise earnings volatility enables the business to automate the application of hedge accounting rules and methodologies to ensure hedges are being correctly treated. It also provides reassurance that earnings statements are being correctly reported.</p>
<p>Globally, we are seeing the rise of corporates with considerable exposure to commodity and currency risk through their supply chain evaluating solutions to best help them hedge and manage considerable input price changes to their business.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Since June 2014, the price of benchmark Brent crude oil has fallen to around USD50 per barrel (bbl), touching the lowest point in more than five years and about 58% lower than its year-to-date peak of USD115/bbl in mid-2014.</p>
<p>A number of factors have caused the oil price to plummet, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strong growth in US production, which has pushed imported crude back onto the international market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resumption of significant Libyan oil production (from 200,000 barrels of oil per day (kbopd) in June to 900kbopd by the end of September).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weaker than expected global demand, particularly in Europe and Asia with China production rising at its slowest pace since 2008; the IMF reducing global economic growth forecast for 2015 from 4% to 3.8%; the OECD reducing its expectations for economic growth through 2015; and noting an increasing likelihood for the eurozone to re-enter recession.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This downturn has been exacerbated by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries being unwilling to cut production. Instead, they have preferred to defend their market share through an aggressive “price war”.</p>
<p>As a consequence, oil majors, mid-tiered and oil services companies have been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures.</p>
<h3 id=""braving-volatilities"">Braving volatilities</h3>
<p>To weather lower oil prices, some immediate steps company boards may consider include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deferring major projects requiring significant capital expenditure (capex).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Booking impairments following asset write downs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selling and leasing back pipeline infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making redundancies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cutting discretionary spending.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The current period of price drop is the longest peak-to-trough decline since the 1980s. Although analysts suggest oil prices are likely to remain at depressed levels for the foreseeable future, such protracted swings will not last forever.</p>
<p>With some market estimates suggesting USD150 billion of capex is at risk if the oil price remains around USD50/bbl, swift action is essential.</p>
<p>One priority is for companies to quantify their exposure under different oil price scenarios for the period ahead and to determine how resilient they are. Findings from this modelling may call for the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduce usage of cash: reduce overall capital expenditure by delaying discretionary and non-essential projects. If possible, boards should consider reducing dividends to ride out the current downturn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain adequate liquidity buffer: exploration and production companies with an insufficient liquidity buffer should consider reducing or deferring capital expenditure accordingly. Additional funding measures should be considered to repair stretched balance sheets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migrate from organic to inorganic growth: delay investment or replace projects with opportunistic acquisitions. Explore the possibility of substituting organic growth with inorganic growth, which is earnings accretive. Strategic mergers and acquisitions are likely to increase as illustrated by the Halliburton acquisition of Baker Hughes in November 2014 and more recently Shell’s acquisition of BG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reserve for the future: acquisitive firms have maintained a lower leverage level to keep “dry powder” for future acquisitions. If leverage is not high, potential acquirers should issue now to build a liquidity buffer. If leverage is high, consider raising equity to strengthen the balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce financing costs: consider refinancing higher cost debt and lock in lower rates available in the current low interest rate environment, replace short-term debt with longer tenor debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy strategic hedges: establish a hedging policy that ensures appropriate action can be taken when the opportunity arises. Issuing in US dollar provides a natural hedge as oil is a US dollar-denominated commodity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, treasurers should examine tactical measures to optimise processing efficiencies and drive down often hidden costs across their treasury operating environment. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Benchmark and optimise working capital: review end-to-end treasury processes and front-to-back operations to ensure best-in-class solutions are deployed for optimal working capital management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In that regard, we have worked with our clients using Citi’s Treasury Diagnostics benchmarking tool to measure their treasury practices relative to their industry peer group. The diagnostic is specifically designed to evaluate treasury practices by measuring a company’s performance relative across six critical areas of treasury operations: Governance and Controls, Liquidity Management, Cash and Working Capital Management, Subsidiary Funding and Repatriation, Risk Management and Systems and Technology.</p>
<p>Based on a detailed questionnaire providing insight on the client’s treasury performance, a customised benchmarking report is generated. This is then evaluated against industry peers and best-in-class companies, namely, those that continually set benchmarks of truly world-class practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Control and visibility of cash: treasurers should also review their existing cash flow forecasting (CFF) processes. Manually intensive processes, which typically use Microsoft Excel to gather data from operating entities before the treasurer has a clear view of cash availability across the organisation, should be improved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As cash availability and CFF assume even greater importance, how fast this information is collated, transmitted and disseminated is critical to ensure excess cash is deployed to where it is most needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cost control for travel and entertainment spend: since discretionary spending is an obvious area for cost cutting, it is surprising that some organisations have not yet deployed regional or global solutions to capture, manage and monitor travel and entertainment spend. Implementing such a solution to capture consolidated spend data on a globally consistent platform will ensure companies’ spend policy is adhered to. Redirecting spend to strategic partners can also generate volume discounts and working capital benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilise procurement cards: the order-to-pay process can be significantly enhanced by redirecting spend from traditional channels to procurement cards, which are also known as virtual or ghost cards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By driving spend to strategic partners willing to take card-based payments, companies can reduce the inherent cost of traditional order-to-pay processes: cost reductions can be generated as companies’ working capital benefits from a significantly longer settlement period.</p>
<p>For merchants accepting card-based payments for procurement, it enhances the commercial relationship, which in turn may direct more spend towards them as they become strategic partners.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evaluate counterparty risks: treasurers should assess the risks of counterparties embedded in their supply chain to minimise the impact on their company’s financial health.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the strength of these relationships, collaborative action such as redeploying key assets following project postponement may help ensure utilisation rates and associated cash flows are maintained.</p>
<p>Greater oversight of account receivables processes ensuring credit limits and commercial terms are not breached are critical to reduce and eliminate the incidence of bad debts and fraud. Preemptive action is essential and an important part of ensuring the health of key suppliers does not move to impairments.</p>
<p>Sustained oil price weakness will continue to challenge the industry. Whilst history suggests that this episode will pass, opportunities abound for treasurers who take swift action to implement a more robust treasury operating platform so that their organisations are better placed when the upswing takes hold. Doing so is not an option, but an imperative.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Various multinationals have bemoaned the bottom line impact of currency volatility since the start of this year. Diageo, for example, blamed it for a fall in revenues from Latin America and the Caribbean, while Volvo sought to minimise the impact of FX volatility by announcing plans to build a plant in the US.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Unilever’s first quarter results were boosted by favourable currency movements and Danone also came out ahead. But the experiences of Unilever and Danone are untypical according to the latest FiREapps currency impact report, which found that North American and European corporates reported a combined negative currency impact of almost $40bn last year.</p>
<p>Corporates on the other side of the Atlantic were most affected – North American companies reported $27.1bn in total negative currency impact for 2014, a 53% increase since 2013. And the impact wasn’t limited to a few big names either; in the final quarter of last year, 46% of North American and 51% of European companies had to report material currency-related impacts.</p>
<p>But what can treasurers do to minimise FX risk, especially in the emerging markets?</p>
<h3 id=""tackling-volatility"">Tackling volatility</h3>
<p>Andrew Gage, Global Head of Research at FiREapps, recommends that the approach to managing emerging market (EM) currency volatility should be the same as for developed markets. “Inter-company loans, hedging, option and natural hedges are all potential methods of countering risk – for companies with and without operations in emerging markets.” Therefore, he concludes, “the best strategy you can employ is having complete data.” He accepts that borrowing in local currency and managing working capital effectively can help reduce the impact of currency fluctuation, but also refers to the importance of having a full understanding of exposures and flows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sander van Tol, Partner at treasury consultancy Zanders has a slightly different view: it has always been important for corporate treasury to manage their exposures on EM FX, but higher volatility and increased exposure has made it even more important, he observes. Compared to developed countries, he sees some material differences in the management of these specific risks, which can be categorised as: the regulatory environment; a lack of liquidity; limited hedging products and higher hedging costs.</p>
<p>“The regulatory environment is a key driver in EMs. The majority of EM currencies are restricted and not freely convertible, but because some are linked or pegged to another currency or basket of currencies, a proxy hedge could be a solution.” For instance, five out of the six currencies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are pegged to the dollar, so a dollar hedge means a hedge in these five GCC currencies. Another example is the Chinese yuan, which is pegged to a basket of international currencies. The downside of such a proxy hedge is the uncertainty that a country can choose to unpeg its currency, which makes the hedge highly ineffective.</p>
<h3 id=""local-borrowing"">Local borrowing</h3>
<p>Rando Bruns, Group Treasurer at Merck, observes that high interest rates in many EM countries make hedging expensive and economically uninteresting. Corporates will have to live with that risk and apply a long-term view, he adds. “Local borrowing can be an instrument to reduce exposure, although the high interest rates need to be weighed against this exposure.”</p>
<p>Borrowing in local currencies is one of the traditional techniques used for FX exposure management. To the extent that timing differences between revenues and expenses can be managed, FX exposures can be managed at a lower cost and at a lower volatility to the financial statements explains Patrick Trozzo, Vice President for Reval. “However, many companies are also employing technology and more advanced strategies by automating the process of gathering FX exposures across multiple entities and efficiently netting them to optimise the execution of FX derivatives and reduce transaction fees.”</p>
<p>According to Ronald Leven, FX pre-trade Strategist at Thomson Reuters, the impact of currency fluctuations is largely a by-product of mismatched exposure profile for assets and liabilities. “Hence, local borrowing (when possible) can be a very effective tool for buffering a firm from currency fluctuations.”</p>
<h3 id=""avoiding-volatility"">Avoiding volatility</h3>
<p>Another technique for reducing the impact of EM currency movements, says Lauren Goodwin, an Associate Practice Leader Global Analytics at Frontier Strategy Group, is for corporates to consider country-specific factors since these can provide meaningful information as to where currency volatility may be most rampant. She suggests the questions corporates could ask include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where are central banks most likely to be controlled by political factors (rather than economic logic), thus, leaving them more susceptible to volatility?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which countries have meaningful FX reserves that can be used to protect the currency in the event of a global macroeconomic shock?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would multilateral or local banks be willing to lend to the government (buy bonds) in the event of trouble?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is liquidity a serious risk?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of what treasurers can do to manage EM volatility, she says clients should consider ‘operational’ hedging, which can buffer the treasury against large currency movements. “At the higher-risk end of the spectrum, corporates could complete a strategic acquisition to lessen the impact of currency on sourcing and production.”</p>
<h3 id=""moving-money"">Moving money</h3>
<p>The ability to move money out of certain countries is usually investigated carefully before a corporate invests in a country in the first place, explains Brian Welch, Director UserCare Treasury Consultancy. “Sometimes companies will invest in a particular country because of its economic potential, but if there are potential problems about paying dividends out of those countries the initial investment may be made with loans rather than equity, as the loans are sometimes more easily repaid. Similarly, finance from within those countries might be possible and preferable, so that any balance sheet exposure can be offset by local loans in the same currency.”</p>
<p>In the latter case, a counterparty risk will arise with a domestic bank or other financial institution. Although the local investment legislation might require the corporate to use a local bank – in which case the corporate will aim to use the best rated bank in that country. “There is less risk borrowing from a local bank than investing local cash with the same bank,” says Welch. “There is also the possibility of one of the global banks providing some kind of service.” Many EM countries maintain exchange control regulations to prevent the unlimited transfer of funds out of the country – but the existence of those regulations usually also means that there is an official route by which funds can be transferred out.</p>
<p>In general, the more volatile and free a currency is, the more flexibility corporates have to move money out of the country, says Bruns. “The best example of this is Venezuela, which has a highly regulated FX rate and restrictions on moving money out of the country. Counterparty risk goes along with this.” He also refers to the impact of political stability on a corporate’s ability to move cash as well as on FX rates.</p>
<p>The typical treasury team, according to Gage, often has a blindspot into its EM finances due to a pattern of opaqueness created by how businesses in emerging markets are acquired/integrated. “Legacy systems and processes often create areas that the team cannot see into, create a lag in the system or are not consistent with company-wide processes. These nuances often make it hard, if not impossible to manage the risk associated with these markets.”</p>
<p>The extent to which the typical corporate treasury team has sufficient resources to effectively manage emerging market currency exposure depends on the size of the organisation, says Bruns. “Having said that, I believe it is good to be rather close to those currencies.” Improvements in the process of moving money in and out of EMs, according to Trozzo, have somewhat cushioned the impact of emerging market currency volatility on corporates. He goes on to explain that there are fewer cases of rigid currency conversion restrictions, which had been driven previously by frequent periods of hyper-inflation.</p>
<h3 id=""additional-considerations"">Additional considerations</h3>
<p>Factors such as banking infrastructure and political stability are taken into account when assessing risk in an EM, although Trozzo observes that such issues are of less concern than they were in the 1990s. Globalisation and investment in technology have upgraded banking infrastructures worldwide and many EM countries have established local financial markets that connect to global financial markets.</p>
<p>David Blair, an independent Treasury Consultant based in Singapore, observes that currency volatility is not limited to EMs, though the EM volatility has been exaggerated by dollar strengthening. According to Blair, EM currency volatility has yet to directly impact on exchange controls, while borrowing in local currency and managing working capital effectively can help reduce the impact of fluctuation. “Hedging is possible in most Asian EMs, both onshore and offshore via non-deliverable forwards and many treasurers are actively hedging. The typical multinational company will also have local currency receivable and hard currency payable for sales and the reverse for production.</p>
<p>“Funding local sales operations in local currency reduces risk, as does producing and selling in-country. Long day sales outstanding (DSO) in local currency add to risk; efficient working capital management, therefore, is vital.” Blair also warns that many corporate treasury teams lack the manpower to effectively manage EM currency exposure. “Most treasuries are under-resourced and multinationals that have centralised globally for cost reasons are left with no or limited EM expertise.”</p>
<p>According to Leven, recent earnings releases would suggest that the strong dollar has been a much bigger issue for corporates than volatility, causing potential credit problems for a lot of EM companies that are dollar-funded. Since most corporate exposure to EMs has a long time horizon, political stability is probably the number one issue, he continues. Banking infrastructure may also be a factor in determining whether to hedge on- or off-shore.</p>
<h3 id=""risk-appetite"">Risk appetite</h3>
<p>Market makers’ reduced appetite for risk, general uncertainty in the commodities market, increased regulation and continued uncertainty over Greece’s future as a member of the Eurozone have all contributed to volatility, explains Jon Dovener, Head of Emerging Markets, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. His colleague, James Buckle, Director of Industrials, says treasurers will usually try and use a well-established bank with a local presence and understanding, which can give them a real-time assessment of the local risks. “Alternatively, they may be inclined to use the local market’s leading bank. Any treasurer will value a local presence in a region deemed to have certain socio economic and political risks.”</p>
<p>Resources could be a factor – but approach and governance are more important according to Peter Wong, Associate Director, PwC Corporate Treasury Consulting in Hong Kong/China and Founding Chairman of the International Association of CFOs and Corporate Treasurers (IACCT) China. “A recent PwC corporate treasury survey found FX risk was the number one risk exposure, yet only 8% of treasurers adopted an active or dynamic approach that took into account business strategies and activities (including physical supply chain) with the goal of maximising market opportunities and profitability and cash flow.”</p>
<p>While accepting that borrowing in local currency and managing working capital effectively can reduce the impact of currency fluctuation, Buckle adds that certain larger corporates have a preference to fund centrally for a number of reasons (including cost), so may elect to utilise synthetic funding options such as a cross currency swap as opposed to borrowing locally.</p>
<p>“We see several differences in EM FX hedging strategies,” says van Tol. “The first is that exposure is managed from a portfolio perspective in which the imperfect correlations between the different currencies lower the exposure and hence hedging costs. Furthermore, corporates apply a shorter hedging duration in order to decrease costs of carry. Thirdly, more option structures are used to protect the corporate against specific event risks of a very material depreciation of the currency. The final difference is that macro-economic outlooks are used to determine a risk map or consensus on currencies to be used as guidance on hedge ratios.</p>
<p>“In order to reduce transaction risk, corporates can either change to invoicing in hard currencies or use FX adjustment clauses in their sales contracts. Whether this is possible depends very much on the market and sector you are operating in.” Van Tol believes that treasurers need to change their approach, strategy and hedging instruments: investing in specialised exposure quantification and dynamic hedging strategies pays off but normally, as he explains, that is only perceived as such after the occurrence of an event risk – the depreciation of the Russian ruble or the peso crisis, for instance.</p>
<p>Goodwin observes that any increase in global risk or major tightening by central banks (particularly by the US Federal Reserve, likely in Q4 2015) will lead to a reduction in EM flows and amplified currency volatility. “Currency volatility itself doesn’t make counterparty or credit risk more likely, but the causes of currency volatility do. The impending US interest rate hike is increasing volatility and makes countries with high proportions of corporate and sovereign dollar-denominated debt (much of Latin America, Angola, Kazakhstan) vulnerable to currency volatility while increasing the likelihood of capital controls.”</p>
<h3 id=""external-pressures"">External pressures</h3>
<p>Welch acknowledges that the decision to expand operations into a new EM will come from the sales or manufacturing parts of a company and such momentum is often difficult to stop with treasury concerns about banking infrastructure or political stability. Companies with EM operations are likely to be supported by a reasonably sized treasury team, but EMs are often challenging, he concludes.</p>
<p>“External advice from the local offices of the major accounting firms is usually essential, together with advice from the global or local banks. There will also be a need for local financial staff and expertise, although they may not be officially part of treasury.</p>
<p>“The local banking facilities may be quite different from European banking, possibly with a higher usage of cash and cheques and less secure methods of collection and delivery. Practical local treasury management issues are possibly more time consuming than EM currency exposure management,” he concludes.</p></div>

<p>Despite having a team of only two EMEA-based treasury professionals, Wyndham Worldwide, one of the world’s largest hospitality companies, has significantly improved its FX risk management practices as part of a wide-reaching treasury transformation project. The goal was to improve visibility over the company’s FX exposures, which had historically been reported manually via a push methodology. This lack of visibility resulted in missed exposures and unnecessary profit and loss volatility. It was clear that something needed to change.</p>
<p>Hear how Wyndham’s ambitious treasury transformation project has seen the company centralise its FX risk management decision-making, whilst optimising its liquidity management structure. Milestones include creating an in-house bank, implementing a netting programme, and establishing a single-entity multicurrency notional pool. As a result, the treasury team has been able to garner significant improvements in its FX scorecard metrics, together with impressive cost savings and process efficiencies.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In considering this question one needs to understand why corporates have historically hedged (or not) translation risk and whether a change in volatility should cause a review of the underlying drivers of hedging decisions. In essence, organisations need to first establish what is important to them and what their risk appetite is, for example, whether revenue or earnings volatility is critical or protecting covenants – then they can determine the appropriate way for managing these risks.</p>
<p>As a first observation, global organisations often align the currency of their debt (actual debt or through swaps) to the currency of their value drivers to provide some protection of equity value against FX volatility. This is typically profits but could also be the balance sheet. However, an approach like this alone is unlikely to protect top line numbers as the impact will depend on quantum and accounting treatment.</p>
<p>For a typical company, FX hedging objectives often aim to protect either or both cash flows and local currency profits. As a result, transaction exposures are the main exposures that are hedged, whereas pure translation exposures are less routinely hedged for a number of reasons. A key reason being that translation of overseas profits does not generate a cash flow until they are repatriated as part of dividends or in the repayment of loans. Additionally, hedging translation risk with derivatives (such as forwards or swaps) which have a net cash impact, poses the risk of introducing a new cash flow risk.</p>
<p>Another key reason relates to investors’ expectations and communication. Those investing in global businesses should know and understand the exposures involved – assuming there has been clear communication from the business on the manner in which the exposures are or are not hedged. Investors may welcome the currency exposures and can manage their own currency risks. There are, however, situations where hedging of translation risk may be beneficial, or even necessary. For example, when there is the need to protect reserves or tight covenants, such as maximum gearing or minimum tangible net worth. For some industries with a key focus on certain earnings KPIs, such as earnings per share (EPS), hedging translation risk may also be critical. In both cases, the accounting treatment will need to be carefully considered to ensure the desired accounting objective is achieved. Even in these cases, it would be rare for a company to hedge consolidation of its top line, eg revenue. Focus would typically be on the balance sheet, profit measure, or both.</p>
<p>Any major change in hedging framework in response to volatility changes is yet to be seen. Despite this, it is a trigger for many to re-consider the long- and short-term impacts on the factors that drive their current hedging strategy. Companies with a quantitative approach might find that the higher volatility or movements in FX rates have resulted in (increased) hedging triggers being reached. Other responses may also be triggered – for example, the negotiation of a more neutral definition of certain covenants to remove inconsistency between FX rates used for balance sheet and, respectively, income statement translation. Likewise, development of new dialogue with investors to reconfirm their understanding and appetite for the currency risks presented. Ultimately, unless corporates feel their original policy is no longer applicable, or was not as robust as it should have been, a change in volatility should not change the reasons to hedge translation risk.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>One of the most discussed FX subjects in corporate treasury at the moment is how to understand and also mitigate specific translation risk. This might come as a surprise, as in the past firms tended to manage most categories of translation risk only passively, and whatever hedging did occur was only through necessity. This is because corporate treasuries were keen to prevent losses on the shareholder’s equity (capital) account, wanted to protect its credit rating or the exit value of a specific sale of an asset, for example.</p>
<p>This passive approach towards translation risk for fixed asset items, eg buildings and equipment, by and large, continues to be unchanged. It makes sense thanks to factors such as hedging costs due to interest rate differentials and changes in exposure value due to FX being predominately recorded in the cumulative translation account (CTA) within shareholder’s equity, in addition to the general view that, over the long run, exchange rates are mean reverting. Hence, hedging can potentially impose a negative impact on cash flows.</p>
<p>Although applying the theory of mean reversion as a basis for translation risk policy certainly has merit, recent emerging market (EM) volatility should flag caution to its validity, especially for those corporations who adopt a similar approach and have significant translation exposures in the emerging markets.</p>
<p>But then, what has been the catalyst for change? What type of translation risk is of concern? A change in the market environment, led by a strong USD cycle and higher FX volatility, has triggered a significant number of discussions among corporate treasurers relating to intercompany loans – especially in the emerging markets (EM). Specifically, these discussions have centered upon how intercompany exposures have impacted, or can potentially impact, earnings at both the subsidiary level and in consolidation at the parent level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the breach of local capitalisation rules, potential regulatory requirements stipulating the need to re-capitalise the local subsidiary due to FX losses, as well as tax consequences have also raised questions. Cause and effect vary from firm to firm, but frequently subsidiaries have experienced difficulties in raising local EM working capital. This may be due to local regulations, lack of EM liquidity or other associated costs.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, many subsidiaries have turned to the parent for financing, often in hard currency, as this is perceived to be the most cost-effective solution. This method of financing is by no means uncommon and has been practiced for years by global corporate treasuries. So then what is the concern?</p>
<p>In practice, there really should be no concerns as translation risk is hedged either by the local subsidiary or parent, or where the funding is designated as long term in nature (and as a consequence changes in value due to FX would stay in CTA). But problems have surfaced when neither of the above applies and where the hard currency loan from the parent remains either partially or entirely unhedged. Under this scenario, all changes in the value of the liability/loan due to spot FX would impact the income statement of the subsidiary and, ultimately, the parent. Unfortunately, a number of corporations are experiencing the latter case and as a result have seen large and unexpected losses in their earnings.</p>
<p>Consequently, many treasurers have recognised the need to re-examine their current FX policies. For many, this exercise is not limited to translation exposures but rather encompasses a broader scope of FX risk management. The goal being to assess if current risk management practices are actually aligned with company objectives. A good place to start may be with the EM.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>There is no “one size fits all” answer. It depends on multiple factors, such as shareholders and board risk appetite, existence of covenants or ratios that may require protection. There’s also the cost of hedging, the portfolio of currencies or commodities that may provide a natural offset, and cash flow variability due to realised gains or losses when derivatives are used. Most recently, it’s the translation of profits that has caused the greater concern, particularly for listed groups generating large profit in Europe.</p>
<p>Once the decision whether to hedge or not has been made, many other questions remain to be answered. For example, what instrument should be used, should it be limited to debt instruments, long-term derivatives or shorter-term forward contracts or even options? Is it profit translation, dividends, net asset value of foreign operations or all of the above? How far forward should the hedge be and how much should be hedged? Should the book or the economic value be subject to the hedge? Does it matter if the interest differential is favourable?</p>
<p>When all of these questions have been answered, groups still need to monitor very carefully how those hedging policies are affected by movements in the marketplace. Many UK groups were caught by major cash outflows when forward contracts, hedging euro or USD operations matured at the apex of the last financial crisis, creating major liquidity issues and interest cost.</p>
<p>So, should a company hedge or not? Where a group has debts, it appears appropriate to incur the debt in sterling and foreign currencies, in proportion to the market value of the group’s assets. While accounts carrying value is a limited surrogate for market value, pro-rating debt in proportion to net assets still seems more logically appealing than incurring all borrowing in sterling. Alternatively, and for groups with a greater focus on profit, it would also appear appropriate to incur the debt in proportion to the currency profile of profit. Unfortunately, both can very rarely be achieved in practice at the same time.</p>
<p>There is an argument that in the long run foreign exchange rates reflect purchasing power parity and the intervening fluctuations (albeit sometimes very long lived) represent nothing more than noise. As a hedging strategy inevitably involves some element of external costs, this would point towards not hedging at all. However, one needs to be willing to take a long-term view, which may be longer than the time horizons of most shareholders or finance directors and therefore not very popular.</p>
<p>If the foreign operations are so major that the accounting effect of translating those foreign operations into sterling is to produce undesirable accounting volatility, and are predominantly in one foreign currency, a good solution may be for the UK group and hence the parent to adopt the foreign currency, usually the dollar, as the currency of its accounts. This has indeed been done by several companies in the oil sector and also by some in the banking sector in the past. But of course, you then need to consider whether to hedge the group’s sterling operations, illustrating the complexity of the situation.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Just over a decade ago the future for multi-bank portals looked rather bleak. Substantial investments in the technology had been made, but industry take-up was nevertheless lagging. It appeared, for all intents and purposes, that the days of multi-bank portals were numbered.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the present day and the picture is very different indeed. Those providers that managed to endure the difficult early years eventually found a way to be profitable. The limitations of the first, primitive offerings, such as the absence of straight through processing (STP), were eventually addressed and efficiency and convenience became two of the technology’s biggest selling points. Not only did the multi-bank portal survive; it went on to become the most prevalent FX trading solution for corporates on the market.</p>
<p>That has not led to the demise of the single-dealer portal, though. On the contrary, banks have in fact been ramping up investment in their single-dealer offerings. Improving user experience, as well as fostering closer relationships, has been key to the strategy which, evidence suggests, is working.</p>
<p>Since 2009, US software company Streambase has conducted a yearly survey of technology trends in the foreign exchange market. In this year’s survey, which polled 147 professionals involved in trading FX on both the buy and sell sides, multi-bank platforms were found to be the most popular. Just over half (53%) of respondents stated that they use multi-dealer technology. Single-dealer platforms came higher in terms of user satisfaction, however, with a very substantial number of those surveyed (80%) stating that they believe prices on multi-dealer platforms could be improved.</p>
<h3 id=""healthy-competition"">Healthy competition</h3>
<p>Although most of the respondents to the survey are from financial institutions that tend to prefer the more sophisticated single-dealer platforms, the results are still striking. After all, it is well known that price competitiveness is the reason a lot of non-financial corporates use multi-dealer platforms in the first place. For Mitsubishi’s European subsidiary, which brought in its first portal around 12 years ago, that was and continues to be the case. “We chose a multi-dealer platform and one of the key reasons for that was to be confident that we were getting the best price on our trades,” notes Gary Williams, General Treasury Manager at Mitsubishi Corporation Europe.</p>
<p>Treasury will still hop on the single-dealer platforms from time to time, he explains. However, given that the foreign exchange exposures are not enormous, those instances are, he says, few and far between. “If we were to deal something significant we would certainly use a single-dealer portal and talk to the bank direct. That’s because showing everybody on the portal that you have a large deal on the cards can start to affect the price you receive. That’s never a good idea.”</p>
<p>The sentiment that the best price is only achieved through competition on a multi-bank platform is understandably still shared by a large number of treasurers, particularly those at companies that do not tend to find themselves making frequent large trades. “In general, single-dealer portals are not our preference because we want to make sure we get the best rate,” says Dimitris Papathanasiou, Financial Risk Manager at Coca-Cola HBC AG. “We are aware that single-dealer portals have some benefits, but we don’t feel it makes sense to only go to one bank,” he explains.</p>
<p>“Some banks prefer to promote their own electronic platforms by providing better quotes there than the multi-bank platforms. But at least when you use a multi-dealer platform you are pushing the banks to compete with one another, so these dealers are losing our trades.”</p>
<p>But like Mitsubishi’s Williams, Papathanasiou is well aware that multi-bank has its limits. There are, for instance, certain instruments for which single-dealer platforms are better suited. Take options, for example, which he says are not yet available to him through his multi-dealer portal. “Right now most of the banks do not price options in the multi-dealer platform automatically. The process is a bit more manual – you have to go on to the platform and put in a request,” he notes. “But we still get competitive pricing-even outside the platform – as I will never go to just one.”</p>
<p>Most treasurers, like Williams and Papathanasiou, will often speak of price competitiveness first and foremost when the advantages of multi-dealer portals are discussed. However, there are a number of other benefits too. “I think they can offer the best price if that is what they are looking for,” says Jodi Schenck, Managing Director of Global FX eSolutions at Citi. “We are constantly hearing from our clients that there are regulatory or internal compliance reasons why they need to get more than one price. But I would say that it is not always for the best price, it is for a multitude of reasons.”</p>
<h3 id=""best-of-both-worlds"">Best of both worlds</h3>
<p>Evidently, even where there is a stated preference for multi-bank, treasuries still have uses for single-bank offerings. So although much of the debate around FX portals is framed in terms of ‘it’s one or the other’, the reality is that most corporates still need both. “What does that say about single-bank portals?” asks Schenck. It tells us, she explains, that there are other services banks like Citi will provide their clients, which urge them to deal with them in other ways, besides a multi-dealer platform, such as through Citi’s proprietary solution, CitiFX Pulse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are aware that single-dealer portals have some benefits, but we don’t feel it makes sense to only go to one bank.”</p>
<p><cite>Dimitris Papathanasiou, Financial Risk Manager, Coca-Cola HBC AG</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That multi-bank portals are convenient and easy to use is beyond dispute, she adds. But there are certain types of flows where people can get the transparency of pricing and a more efficient means of execution by using a single-dealer platform. Then there are all the additional services that come as part-and-parcel of the package. “We are not going to move away from sales people giving one-on-one colour about what is happening in a particular market,” says Schenck. “Through using our portal they have access to our economists, to our technologists, our risk advisory group, our algorithms and our benchmark execution. So there are multiple ways to get better execution when they are not just looking to get the best price.”</p>
<p>Like Citi, Société Générale does not see any reason why clients must necessarily choose between the two types of FX portal. In fact, the bank is quite emphatic about the neutrality of its stance on the FX portals debate. Although there is some preference amongst non-financial corporates for multi-dealer portals there are still some in the sector that prefer a single-dealer environment, and an even greater number who use both. That’s why the bank, despite launching its own proprietary portal, Alpha FX, in 2009, has continued to focus on improving the offering for those that trade with them from a multi-dealer portal; rolling out functionalities, such as FX options, that some banks reserve for their single-dealer portals.</p>
<p>“For us the most important thing is to be relevant to our clients, however they want to trade. Whatever platform they use we say we will be there on the other side,” says Stephane Malrait, Global Head of FIC eCommerce, Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking. Pascale Moreau, Managing Director, Co-Global Head of Sales, Fixed Income, Credit and Currencies at Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking adds, “we realised that was what we needed to do to effectively support our clients. We needed to be better on a multi-dealer platform as well as developing our single-dealer offering.”</p>
<p>This seems like a sensible strategy. Everyone has their preferences, after all, so why push treasurers to deal in an environment they are unfamiliar with or have reservations about, for whatever reason? “An ex-trader who moves across to the buy-side is going to be used to single-dealer portals, and will probably want to stay in that environment,” says Malrait. Equally, a client who is used to trading on a multi-dealer platform will also be reluctant to change. “Even if you tell them the price is better, they already have their back office processes. So we find that it is usually quite difficult to move a client from one category to the other.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I guess we don’t pick up the phone and have those traditional conversations quite so much anymore.”</p>
<p><cite>Dimitris Papathanasiou, Financial Risk Manager, Coca-Cola HBC AG</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever one thinks about the pricing of deals made on single-dealer versus multi-dealer platforms, there are certainly other factors for corporates to weigh up when sending out an RFQ, as Moreau is keen to point out. “Of course, corporates value best-execution,” she says. “I think price is a very important component of that, but it is not the only consideration. Sometimes it is about picking the right counterparty to the trade, and that might be determined by the relationship you have with the bank, the research and advisory services that is provided, and so on.” The question is to what extent is that relationship influenced by portal choice? Do corporates loyal to multi-bank portals feel their FX relationships have changed as a result of their choice? And does trading near-exclusively on multi-dealer portals diminish their access to such research and advisory services?</p>
<h3 id=""staying-in-touch"">Staying in touch</h3>
<p>“I think the relationship has changed,” says Coca-Cola’s Papathanasiou. It is not necessarily the case that bank relationships have become less important to himself and his team though, it’s more that modern technology has enabled them to communicate a lot more efficiently than they were doing previously, he rationalises. “I guess we don’t pick up the phone and have those traditional conversations quite so much anymore” he concedes. “But we try to be close to the market as much as possible so we do still have discussions from time-to-time. The difference is that these days the interaction through the phone is not every day and sometimes those discussions are conducted on a computer, using Instant Bloomberg (IB), for example.”</p>
<p>It is a similar story at Mitsubishi Europe’s treasury. “I think those relationships are still important but I would say that they have been scaled down somewhat,” says Williams. “Out of the panel of banks we have on our portal, we maintain close relationships with two or three of them.” That is beneficial in a number of ways, he adds. For one thing, it helps them to handle the one-offs – there could, for example, be an order that Williams is not necessarily confident of executing through the platform. In that instance, he would go to the bank directly, as he would to gain access to research or to attend to the convertibility issues sometimes encountered when dealing with certain esoteric currencies.</p>
<p>Even many of the multi-dealer portals themselves acknowledge that good banking relationships are a crucial factor in fulfilling certain trading objectives, including tighter, faster pricing. It doesn’t mean the treasurer has to be on single-dealer portal to maintain those close relationships, they point out.</p>
<p>In fact, some savvy treasurers might want to use both in conjunction with one another when the circumstances call for it, Jim Kwiatkowski, Global Head of Transaction Sales for Thomson Reuters tells Treasury Today. “Some will be using multibank platforms to facilitate straight through processing of trades which have been executed on the phone collaboratively with their bank salesperson,” he notes. “While corporations maintain banking relationships for a variety of reasons, multiple bank counterparties can assist the treasurer in accessing liquidity to execute a particular trade. Some banks may be better able to accommodate a particular currency, size or time of day to meet the needs of the treasurer.”</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id=""the-right-tools-for-the-job"">The right tools for the job</h3>
<p>Ultimately, then, there is room in the market for both single and multi-dealer FX solutions. However, one final piece of advice for treasurers, whatever FX solutions they use, would be to think regularly about exactly what they want to achieve with their FX trading – from lower transaction costs to faster execution, for example – and whether the technology they are using for a given trade is really the right fit.</p>
<p>“It’s therefore important that traders carefully evaluate which execution mechanism is appropriate for a particular objective in order to maximise performance,” adds Kwiatkowski, “And that they continually re-evaluate their choice of trading mechanism based upon their actual results to ensure that their objectives are being met.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>For businesses trading overseas, tackling currency volatility is par for the course. In recent times the Mexican peso crisis, the Asian currency crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the Argentine peso crisis, and the 2008 global financial crisis have all contributed to that volatility – and it’s not about to go away any time soon.</p>
<h3 id=""currency-risk-types"">Currency risk types</h3>
<p>If a financial transaction is denominated in a currency other than that of the base currency of the company there will be currency risk. That risk may exist in a number of forms. Transaction exposure exists around specific receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency. Economic (or operating) exposure is more general and can, for example, affect demand or cost of goods or the movement in value of future cash flows from fixed assets which can subsequently affect the market value of a business. Translation exposure arises where changes in the exchange rate between the currencies in which a company reports (its consolidated accounts) and those in which the company’s assets and liabilities are denominated (usually its overseas operations), impact on a company’s balance sheet. Contingent exposure arises where a firm is waiting for acceptance or rejection of an overseas contract bid, leaving it uncertain as to whether it has a currency exposure or not.</p>
<h3 id=""measuring-currency-risk"">Measuring currency risk</h3>
<p>The level of currency risk a business may be exposed to can be measured using either the variance or standard deviation methods. Variance simply requires noting the points of fluctuation within a spot rate and the spread of those points; it is something a treasurer can do in a spreadsheet. Standard deviation is more involved and requires the observation of how far on average an exchange rate will deviate from the mean exchange rate over a given period when plotted on a ‘probability distribution’ (eg the minimum and maximum statistically possible values).</p>
<p>Analysing the possibility of an event happening at the extremes of possibility (tail risk) – and the potential losses that may be incurred – can be done by corporate or bank-based risk managers using Value at Risk (VaR) modelling. Measuring VaR typically deploys either historical, parametric (variance and covariance) or Monte Carlo simulation techniques (the latter being based on a computer algorithm for calculating the range of outcomes and the probabilities they will occur within a stated scenario). Since the 2008 global financial crisis VaR has taken some flak for being less reliable when identifying very rare but large and extreme swings in the market (so-called ‘tail risk’).</p>
<h3 id=""to-hedge-or-not"">To hedge or not</h3>
<p>In a world of uncertainty, hedging is most commonly seen as a means of using the underlying asset of one financial product (a derivative) to offset potential losses of another. It is not the only option open: in their 2011 publication, ‘International Financial Management’, Professors Cheol Eun and Bruce Resnick said that mitigation of transaction exposure can be effected either through money markets, foreign exchange derivatives (such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options and swaps), or with operational techniques such as currency invoicing, leading and lagging of receipts and payments, and exposure netting.</p>
<p>Economic exposures tend to be handled through operational considerations (such as where to site production facilities). And because translation exposure is an accounting and reporting issue, although hedging with FX derivatives is possible, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of each jurisdiction (or International Financial Reporting Standards) will dictate how FX-based gains or losses in the parent company’s consolidated financial statements can be accounted for (mainly to avoid misleading stakeholders).</p>
<h3 id=""gambling-away-the-profits"">Gambling away the profits</h3>
<p>The increasing dependence by more and more businesses upon international trade has pushed the management of currency exposures to the fore, but for too many it is a risk left unmanaged. “Many businesses are engaging in currency risk management and have some form of policy in place, but there is also a shocking number that don’t,” notes Guido Schulz, Global Head of Strategic Management, AFEX. “These businesses are just playing it by ear; in some cases they get lucky and in some cases they are gambling away their revenue.” The reason for this incautious approach, he believes, is in part due to an ‘old-school’ mind-set, relying a little too much on intuition, but he feels that without the guidance of formal policy, some have adopted a “casino mentality”, watching the markets obsessively and thinking they can beat them.</p>
<p>Some may even see FX hedging as a potential for “lost opportunity”. With this viewpoint, a treasurer may lock in a set of staggered forward contracts for the year but if that currency suddenly strengthens they regret the decision, fretting over how much better they could have done.</p>
<p>Most treasurers tend to be conservative and enjoy security but Schulz says sometimes there is the temptation to reach for “higher hanging fruit that is even sweeter”. This can drive that casino mentality which, as many pro traders will acknowledge, could have dire consequences when the market turns against them (cf, Kerviel, Leeson et al). “There is a draw created by the dynamism of the markets but you have to suppress the urge to play it by putting a policy in place,” he says. “We advise clients to make foreign exchange a non-event for themselves.” He admits that it takes discipline, “but once that risk management strategy is in place you have to stop worrying about the market.”</p>
<h3 id=""policy-rules"">Policy rules</h3>
<p>Despite the obvious excitement pro-trading may create, the way in which a business tackles currency risk is not a decision to be taken by the treasurer, says Philippe Gelis, CEO of peer-to-peer trading platform provider, Kantox. “In my view, in any company, the decision regarding what is hedged and how should be based on a policy agreement made between the members of the senior management team; the treasurer will be the one to implement policy but top management should be involved in what they do and how they do it, from day one.”</p>
<p>According to UK-based Interim Treasurer, Jo Dealey, “many organisations don’t have a hedging policy in place, arguing that they have been alright until now. But how much is it okay to lose? The treasury and management teams need to be protected and the Board needs to know what they are letting themselves in for because getting it wrong can make or break a company.” It is, she adds, the responsibility of the treasurer, along with the FD or CFO, to have a clear understanding of the company’s currency exposures, what the implications are in the context of the balance sheet, banking covenants, share price and so on – and what measures can be taken to defend against volatility.</p>
<p>A hedging policy should firstly note all exposures and the risk this may present (possibly using one of the measurement tools such as VaR or the less demanding variance model). It should then lay down the agreed rules for what is being hedged, why this is being done, by whom, what actions are acceptable, under what conditions and how often all this should be reviewed. An additional operational element, prescribing specific actions to be taken and instruments to use, must have a certain degree of flexibility, Dealey advises. This enables the company to respond quickly to market changes and challenges. Where large, long-term hedges are deployed, she also advises companies to review them regularly, assessing if they still meet the needs of the exposure.</p>
<p>Regardless of content, there has to be hedging policy buy-in from all stakeholders, she continues. “If an organisation enters into a contract without really understanding what the implications are, it can cause heavy losses or even bankrupt a company. If it goes badly wrong, heads will roll.”</p>
<h3 id=""what-if"">What if?</h3>
<p>All risk management contains a strong element of forecasting and for currency risk Gelis strongly advises businesses to base significant hedging decisions on a quantitative model that assumes a worst-case scenario for exchange-rate activity. Indeed, Dealey believes it is vital for anyone looking into hedging to be able to carry out their own ‘what if’ modelling, particularly on larger contracts that are likely to require something more complex than a simple forward. Analysis, she says, does not have to be based on complex algorithms and although there are proprietary systems to assist, spreadsheets are a perfectly functional tool in many cases. It is also reasonable for a treasurer to ask a relationship bank to help do some of the modelling.</p>
<h3 id=""proof-of-product"">Proof of product</h3>
<p>When it comes to product selection Dealey urges a degree of caution. “Banks will try to sell you a solution that might initially seem very attractive, but closer inspection might reveal it to be one that could potentially lock the company into something unfavourable.” For this reason, she says treasurers need to be absolutely sure of what they are looking at. Of course, a good relationship bank should not be encouraging clients to take unsuitable products, but it is always advisable to talk to a few banks to compare and contrast offerings, at the very least to get a feel for pricing.</p>
<p>However, even this comes with a caveat. “If it’s a very large trade, you don’t want every bank to know about it; once the market gets wind of a large deal they will all be on to you at once,” warns Dealey. “I suggest consulting two or three at the most.” Furthermore, if the small selection of banks believe they have each given their client good advice they will all be expecting the trade. This may create an awkward balancing act for the treasurer in terms of share of wallet. “The most important thing is to make sure you have the best cover, whilst also being fair to your relationship banks” says Dealey. This may mean carving up the deal so the banks each have an opportunity to participate and the company gets the best price on each deal.</p>
<p>For a company with a regular hedging programme – an ongoing trade where an estimated cash flow is hedged, for example – if the treasurer has the luxury of not having to lock in to a single point in time, it may be possible to spread that hedge by a certain percentage per month, so it is not taking on market price risk at the locked in date. The actual percentage of a proportional hedge will depend on the exposure, the company’s appetite for risk and the certainty of the cash flow behind it, Dealey notes. It is also possible to mix and match the hedging instruments used for a certain exposure; it does not have to be the same product covering the downside, as long as it is covered according to policy and preferably doesn’t expire or lock-in at the wrong phase of the market (arguably difficult to predict).</p>
<h3 id=""keep-it-simple"">Keep it simple</h3>
<p>Whilst the currency markets are used by many traders to create significant wealth, it is not the role of treasurer, as discussed above, to tackle the complexities that inevitably arise when seeking fortune. “There is a possibility that a company can get itself tied up in the hedging itself without fully understanding what is going on behind it,” warns Brenda Kelly, Chief Market Strategist, IG. “For a company not au fait with the currency markets, or if it is in any way uncertain about it, a simple forward contract would be the better way to start because it takes the surprise out of the hedging scenario.” Forwards are an easy instrument to understand and easy to handle from an accounting perspective. This view is shared by Gelis. “Keep it simple and try to use only products you fully understand,” he comments. Echoing Dealey’s comment above he adds that “some complex products look attractive but may hide risk; we know that banks are very good at marketing and will often try to sell products that are more profitable for them”.</p>
<p>However, in some cases it may be possible, notes Kelly, to use “natural hedges”. A company side-steps the potentially expensive and time-consuming derivatives market by using revenue it obtains in a particular foreign currency to offset expenses it incurs in that currency; this would be standard practice in most jurisdictions where currency controls are in place and cash is effectively ‘trapped’.</p>
<p>Where there is clearly a higher degree of uncertainty about the current price of the currency, the length of time until settlement and the volatility of the market, Kelly believes it might be better to consider trading an ‘option’, which offers the choice but not the obligation to buy or sell at a particular point in time. A euro-sterling cross, for example, would clearly not attract the same level of volatility as an emerging market currency cross, she notes, so here it might be better to use a simple forward contract, only adopting an option strategy when it comes to emerging market trade.</p>
<p>Hedging an emerging market currency cross will always be a lot more expensive but in all cases Kelly advises the need to assess the value of the hedge. “The idea of hedging FX risk is to ward off any volatility in the market and to provide a clearer view of any costs that may be incurred in regards to an investment or trade,” she explains. “But sometimes it is not worthwhile hedging either where the level of underlying volatility does not warrant it, or where the costs can be so much more in terms of using a derivative compared with the cost associated with any volatility in the FX market.” There is no predefined use-case, she notes “so it is worth crunching the numbers to ascertain whether the hedge itself is undoing the profitability of what you are trying to hedge”.</p>
<h3 id=""accounting-for-hedges"">Accounting for hedges</h3>
<p>Hedging can create accounting complexities which must also be understood. Where a supplier is selling in a currency that its buyer’s treasury is not comfortable with (and therefore feels the need to hedge that cost), if the supplier subsequently changes to a more amenable currency, the contract is effectively denominated in a foreign currency (known as a host contract) which creates an underlying exposure for the supplier. In such a case, Dealey says it is “absolutely essential” for the treasurer to know how the supplier intends to price in the new currency.</p>
<p>If the price is fixed, will the supplier be able to afford to sell at the new currency rate or would it damage the supply chain if the exchange rate moves too far in the wrong direction? Alternatively, if the supplier’s price changes according to a pre-defined trigger in the currency market place, somewhere in the contract there must be an embedded foreign currency derivative which will also be triggered. Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), this has to be separated from the host contract and be accounted for separately. The rules of hedge accounting are complex (see Treasury Today, Back to Basics, March 2014)</p>
<h3 id=""no-excitement-needed"">No excitement needed</h3>
<p>As long as a company has a good idea of what its currency exposures are, Schulz argues that it makes sense to hedge. “Even if the market seems benign it just needs something extraordinary to happen to upset the market. Hedging is really a matter of insuring against the unforeseen rather than trying to figure out what that event might look like.” Clearly playing the markets or fretting over missed opportunities helps no one. But sometimes, as both Dealey and Kelly note, hedging can cost more than it saves. Either way, the need for treasurers to work to an agreed company policy is essential, and making their predictable currency exposures “non-events” should be at the heart of every currency risk management decision.</p></div>

</div>
<p>Globalisation is one of the most significant economic concepts ever and yet today most people take it almost for granted. We can walk into a supermarket and pick up fruit and other produce that a decade or so ago no one had even heard of. We buy German cars built in Brazil and clamour for tablet computers designed in California and assembled in China – all done entirely with little notice or ceremony.</p>
<p>Multinational corporates and financial institutions have been engaging in international trade for a very long time but with the aid of modern transport, communication and financing capabilities, it is even easier today for small companies, and even individuals, to expand into overseas markets buying and selling goods and services, from design to delivery and all points in between. Today’s global market place offers buyers and sellers of those goods and services, including labour, far greater choice than they would have had even a decade ago.</p>
<p>But choice in a market can also ratchet up the level of competition considerably between players, which in turn places far greater pressure on all stakeholders to be as efficient as possible, not just in terms of production but also with respect to their financial capabilities. All of which brings the importance of the international banking system and the services available to support international trade to the fore.</p>
<h3 id=""setting-up-overseas"">Setting up overseas</h3>
<p>In the corporate space, one of the first considerations for a business seeking entry into a new country – depending to an extent on size, structure, line of business and geographic location – is how to maximise its trading environment and manage the associated risks with respect to foreign exchange (FX). One of the key functions of any business is payments and, where currency concerns arise, it is essential for that business to align its needs with where its costs are being driven from, says Lisa Francis, MD, Barclays Risk Solutions Group, EMEA.</p>
<p>A high street retailer, for example, will commonly source most of its goods from Asia and, based on currency drivers, payments models are changing. “In China, for example, we are seeing clients move from a tendency to pay in dollars to being able to pay in renminbi,” says Francis. “If they do, the buyer will most likely be taking an additional spread driven by the needs of its suppliers because of exchange rate movements; the buyer is closely aligning its needs to the underlying exposures of its suppliers and so in theory should be driving a harder bargain and facing less cost in terms of their own hedging requirements.”</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In terms of repatriation of profits, there are considerations around tax, of course, but local regulations will impact upon what can and cannot be done (the concept of trapped cash can impact considerably upon the options available). In an initial company set-up of an overseas entity, financing for that process could either be funded via an inter-company loan or through equity. With an equity set-up, it can prove more difficult to get that cash out of certain jurisdictions. With a debt financing model, as the entity starts to generate profit, it can pay down that debt rather than trying to repatriate cash.</p>
<p>There are ways of tackling the movement of funds in and out of an overseas business but the most efficient model will clearly depend on the jurisdiction in which that entity is based. But there is a pressing need to efficiently manage FX exposure risk too. “Often a business will be so focused on how to get money out of the country and what the tax implications may be that hedging becomes a secondary aspect,” notes Gareth Noble, MD, Barclays Risk Solutions Group, FX. “If that is the case, whenever it does move money out, the business can end up facing whatever the market happens to be at the time, potentially losing out.”</p>
<p>For most trade finance deals, where two banks and their respective clients are involved, US dollar is the currency of choice and so there is not typically an FX element based in such deals. There are circumstances that will force a currency consideration that sits outside common currency pairings. “With any discussion about a business transaction that involves a currency outside of the currency of choice, Barclays sees itself as strategic partner and will help a client to think about the risks associated with that, whether cash, FX or interest rate,” says Francis. Whether ahead of time or as the exposure is identified or created, she adds that there will “inevitably be a variety of solutions that Barclays will guide its clients through when helping them mitigate those risks”.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""fx-technology-for-all"">FX technology for all</h3>
<p>From an FX technology standpoint, Francis argues the case for Barclays having “the best solution in the market”. With its BARX platform, she firmly believes most of its clients see it as a differentiator, offering “the best liquidity” for a sole bank provider. Through the BARX model, the bank has developed a wider product set, including its algorithmic FX trading tools, to help the highly competitive professional traders and sophisticated client businesses (typically major MNCs) execute very large flows in less liquid markets or where they wish to leave orders and have ultra-transparent fills.</p>
<p>In the world of automobile design, the latest developments in Formula One eventually trickle down to the consumer market, benefitting all. In the same way, at the mid- corporate level, Barclays’ dedicated e-commerce platform, BARX Corporate, leverages the look, feel and functionality of its institutional platform in a package that has been tailored to the less frenetic, but no less professional, needs of the wider corporate market.</p>
<p>The latter has a number of user-friendly features and functions such as flexible delivery forwards which enable the user to draw down on what is required when it is required, removing the need to manage a large book of FX trades. Also, it has the ability to link FX deals to payments so that whilst both platforms have real-time streaming FX rates, the mid-cap iteration allows secured rates to be linked to corporate payments, avoiding the need for a range of currency accounts. “Few banks can offer that facility, particularly online,” states Noble.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Barclays has also created a platform specifically for clients who process high volumes of low value transactions. Being able to price in multiple local currencies, and converting that price back to the home currency, is something most retailers would love to do but cannot always achieve without relying on credit card companies or other payment providers to offer the exchange service. For Barclays’ clients who wish to price in this way but who have no desire to manage all the different currencies, currency accounts and the attendant currency risk, an online solution awaits.</p>
<p>The platform, BARX NetFX, connects to the client’s own systems to automatically pull FX rates from Barclays and use them to price their goods or services in the local currency on their different websites. “As they make individual sales and the transaction for each is processed, in real-time we can aggregate their positions and automate their hedging,” explains Noble. The customer only sees the local price but the client as the seller can use either Barclays’ live rates with pre-agreed spreads or take the rate that was sent through to price on the website, either way addressing FX risk.</p>
<p>As part of the ongoing development of BARX NetFX, Barclays is pulling in the expertise of its card provider division, Barclaycard. For merchants using the latter for payment acceptance or card acquiring, it will be possible for them to not only offer pricing in different currencies but also, where they are already connected to Barclaycard, for card-acquiring, they will no longer need a separate connection for Barclays to manage their FX element.</p>

<h3 id=""building-businesses-by-building-relationships"">Building businesses by building relationships</h3>
<p>But it is not just a case of hitting the right button at the right time. It is no accident that Barclays knows what its clients want; it has a dedicated FX team whose role it is not just to build relationships with individual clients at all levels, but also to engage with the sectors and industries from which its clients are drawn. Understanding the needs of the industry sector more broadly and the individual businesses translate into “a very good client experience”, says Francis.</p>
<p>Establishing any business on foreign shores can be a challenge and Barclays’ offer of personal service means access to a cross-functional relationship team set up to look at all the local elements of trade in each jurisdiction. This might include support in navigating through relevant documentary, regulatory, legal and taxation points as part of the preparatory work. “It’s like having a local strategic partner that will help them through that stage,” says Francis. FX is an important element of any international trade but the assistance with documentation and administrative processes that can enable a business to function in a coherent way once up and running will, she adds, often hold sway over any rate. “If a client wishes to do business in any country with which they are less familiar, we are able to help walk them through that process either directly or, where we don’t have a cash management presence, through one of our local agents.”</p>
<p>But the need for clients is dynamic; as the business grows and evolves its needs will change. In this respect Barclays has consciously adopted a consultative approach, explains Noble. There is, he adds, no one-size-fits-all offering for a situation that has so many variables. Barclays works hard to understand its clients, including how their business is structured, what the ambitions are and where it is in the cycle of business evolution. Through its product and relationship experts, the bank then looks to deliver a holistic, bespoke solution that helps their clients achieve their ambitions.</p>

<p>Trade reporting under EMIR starts in February 2014 and many companies are going to be caught by the reporting requirements – even for internal trades.  Any company established in Europe that uses derivatives, including FX forwards, will be impacted by the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).  In certain cases, non-EU counterparties will also come under EMIR’s scope.</p>
<p>In this Adam Smith Webinar, we speak with Ahold’s treasury team to understand their experiences of complying with the regulation, with a focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Planning and collecting data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with reporting bodies and banks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gearing up their TMS</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Volatility is not just confined to emerging markets currencies. The G10 currencies have had their fair share of ups and downs too. The US debt-ceiling crisis saw the dollar depreciate against sterling and the euro and go-to safe havens — yen and the Swiss franc — were undermined by local shifts in policy. The Swiss introduced a currency floor in September 2011 and ‘Abenomics’ — named after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — resulted in expansionary monetary policies, which caused the yen to depreciate.</p>
<p>In Q2 2013, 233 companies reported negative currency headwinds, says FX exposure management and analytics provider FiREapps, see Chart 1 below. This was less than the same period a year earlier but an increase of 9% on Q1 2013 and a 10% increase over the 2012 average. FiREapps attributed the increased headwinds in Q2 to currency wars in Latin America and Japan and ‘surprise’ impacts from countries like Australia (FX volatility increased ahead of recent political elections), which continued to significantly erode corporates’ EPS.</p>

<p>FiREapps estimates that for the last two years multinationals have consistently lost money to currency exposures, with second quarter 2013 losses totalling $4.01 billion (an average currency impact to earnings per share of $.03, which is three times higher than the standard industry benchmark). Total currency-related losses for the first half of 2013 reached $7.7 billion, say FiREapps. Quarterly loss estimates are based on analysis of earnings calls of 800 publicly-traded companies — a subset of the Fortune 2000—that have 15% or more of their revenues in at least two currencies.</p>
<h3 id=""geographic-levels-of-awareness"">Geographic levels of awareness</h3>
<p>Yet, as FiREapps points out, currency impacts reported by companies are likely to be underestimates as those that faced strong ‘headwinds’ are unlikely to point them out, and few companies may have quantified the impact. “The other thing you have to look at is the maturity level of the financial disclosure,” says Andy Gage, Vice President, Strategic Market Development, FiREapps. “If you look at the US versus European disclosure, the Securities Exchange Commission puts pressure on corporates to be much more transparent on how FX impacts their corporate performance. Europe is just behind that but they don’t get as much heat as US corporates, and in Asia it is a bit murkier.”</p>
<p>However, Gage believes the devaluation of the Indian rupee last spring has had a profound effect on how financial professionals view currency risk. “There were some huge exposures to the rupee and CFOs do not want to see this happen again,” he says. Others say Indian rupee volatility will make little difference when it comes to treasurers’ awareness of currency risk in general. “I don’t think it will make currency risk a higher priority, as Asian treasurers are not fully aware of all strategies to hedge their receivables and payables,” says Rahul Magan, Corporate Treasury Manager at EXL Services, an outsourcing and transformation firm. “Treasurers’ understanding of FX exposure is very limited in Asia.”</p>

<p>This limited understanding of FX volatility and risk can be attributed to a number of factors. FX is only one aspect of treasury operations, and for Asian companies that are experiencing rapid growth or who are largely domestic focused, FX risk may not be as high a priority as it is for Western companies who have already experienced major international expansion and have a greater awareness of the risks that can bring. “In Asia, understanding of FX exposure is evolving,” says Gage. “It is such a rapidly growing environment in a lot of these markets. One of the challenges about FX and treasury in general is when a company experiences rapid growth they are so focused on staying out in front by supporting operations and distribution that risk management often takes a back seat. By contrast, a US or European corporate puts risk management higher up the priority list. They understand the business and volatility in these markets, and have a more mature view of currency risk.”</p>
<h3 id=""to-hedge-or-not-to-hedge"">To hedge or not to hedge</h3>
<p>While MNCs typically have a risk management policy that is fairly regimented, local companies in developing markets who transact business in a limited number of currencies have more leeway in general, says Gautam Hazarika, Head of MNC Markets Sales, APAC ex-Japan, Royal Bank of Scotland. “There’s an element of the local mindset seeping in,” he explains. “If you are a local Indian company and you have a US dollar exposure what you think is going to happen to the rupee impacts hedging decisions.”</p>
<p>Blaik Wilson, Director, Solutions Consulting, Asia Pacific for risk and treasury management solutions provider, Reval, says treasurers in mature markets tend to be more cautious and passive in their hedging strategies. “They hedge for longer periods,” he says. “In Asia they tend to hedge more short term and are more subjective in their approach. Asian treasurers typically run really good margins, and if you have excess cash you can ride the currency a lot more but as margins get squeezed you need to hedge more.”</p>
<p>Those treasurers with a less coherent and disciplined strategy for mitigating FX risk are more likely to find themselves in reactive mode when currency markets become more volatile. “Arguably, the biggest mistake prospective hedgers make is to wait until volatility increases,” says Ira Kawaller of Kawaller &amp; Co. Brooklyn, New York, which advises companies on their use of derivatives for managing financial risks. “More often than not, it’s not the higher volatility that precipitates the consideration of hedging strategies, but rather it’s the coincidence of higher volatility with an adverse change in the exchange rate moves. The time to develop a hedging programme is before the perception of higher volatility is reflected in derivatives’ pricing.”</p>
<p>Hedging in a competitive market environment can be difficult, says Kawaller. “There is a real concern if you guess wrong on a hedge and your competitors don’t, you could put yourself at a disadvantage. You do not want to be far out on a limb, diverging too much from the rest of industry.” Instead of thinking would one have made or saved money after the fact had you not hedged, Hazarika of RBS says corporates should look at hedging as an insurance policy that can buy them some certainty. “Maximising certainty of cash flows and reducing costs are the key objectives for most corporates,” he says.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Wilson of Reval goes a step further, saying the treasurer needs to give management a clear understanding of the consequences of not hedging, even if they lose on a hedge. “Treasurers in emerging markets need to educate management, and as the business expands into new geographical areas stricter guidelines on hedging are needed.”</p>
<h3 id=""rolling-with-the-punches"">Rolling with the punches</h3>
<p>Magan of EXL Services points to the example of the Indian economy, which as it becomes more globalised, is experiencing a greater inflow of payables and receivables in foreign currencies including the Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar and G7 currencies. Globalisation has also meant there are increasing foreign currency loans (mostly in US dollars) on Indian companies’ books, particularly in the steel sector, which are subject to interest rate and revaluation risks. Magan says hedging strategies linked to derivatives such as plain vanilla forwards, options and interest rate swaps are highly effective tools for mitigating the impact of currency and interest rate volatility on companies’ balance sheets.</p>
<p>Given the current volatility in currencies such as the rupee, Magan says treasurers should hedge their receivables and payables using a layered hedging strategy, which takes into account the nature of their business. “Layering hedging over a rolling six month period means you could start off hedging 95% of your exposures in the first month, then 30%, and so on ( ratios can change subject to the exporting model ),” he explains. “It is always a declining percentage. That gives you more flexibility.”</p>
<p>In a rolling hedging programme, Magan says the treasurer needs to understand the spot level, the implied volatility, historical volatility and where the currency is moving. “Treasurers need to change their mindset to one of managing FX as a vital function,” he says. “FX is the most volatile market in the world. The mindset should not be I have covered my exposure, and then leave it at that. If you are able to use your skill set in the best way then you will be able to pass on any gains from hedging to your clients in the form of a discount and, ultimately, win more business from clients.”</p>
<p>Kawaller says more disciplined companies have hedging horizons that they divide into smaller sub-periods, setting parameters to change how much they hedge in say, six month time spans. “You might hedge 80% of your exposure in the first six months, then 60%, 40%, 20%. You need to have trigger points that foster hedge adjustments. For instance, if you see a deterioration of 2% or 5% in the exchange rate, you can adjust your hedging strategy to take into account changing market conditions and new market information.”</p>
<p>The challenge for most treasurers is that with hedging there is no clear-cut right answer, says Kawaller. “Regardless of how much information you collate you are still in a probabilistic world. That is why you need a roadmap of how you are going to respond. All the time you are making business judgements, which should be based on disciplined considerations of objective criteria.”</p>
<p>Typically, FX managers from leading multinationals have management objectives of less than $.01 EPS impact from balance sheet currency exposures, says Gage of FiREapps. “The best way to achieve that is not to be concerned about specific currencies but instead look at your total portfolio of exposure and manage it in the most cost effective way.” Yet one of the biggest challenges many treasurers face is gaining a clear picture of what their underlying currency exposures are. “Most treasurers struggle to quantify their exposure or loss. If you haven’t got the systems and processes set up it is not that easy to produce exposure data,” says Wilson of Reval.</p>
<p>The challenge of collating FX exposure data is multiplied if your treasury operations are wholly reliant on manual processes. However, by extracting data from ERP and accounting systems cloud-based software solutions such as FiREapps’ FX exposure platform can give treasurers visibility of their balance sheet currency exposure at a more granular level, which helps them to make more well-informed hedging decisions.</p>
<h3 id=""embedded-risks"">Embedded risks</h3>
<p>But FX exposure management is not a hedging-only story, nor is it confined just to the balance sheet. In some emerging market currencies hedging may not even be an option, or the costs may be too prohibitive to make it worthwhile. “Treasurers need to make a decision: am I going to get enough return on my investment in a derivative product to warrant the potential cost of hedging?” says Gage of FiREapps. “If hedging doesn’t make sense you can set up inter-company lending and move cash to reduce your net exposure.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even if you have centralised treasury operations you still need to have an approach that is mindful of the fact that the people that manage these processes are not going to think as coherently as someone managing that risk.”</p>
<p><cite>Andy Gage, Vice President, FiREapps</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hazarika of RBS says treasurers should also focus on uncovering unapparent costs such as suppliers paid in local currency where the contract is linked to an underlying commodity. “When you look at the fine print of a contract, you might pay 100 rupees per item, but if the price of oil goes up by more than 5%, you might have to pay 105 rupees. Such details must be highlighted in the forecasting process so treasury can manage the risk”. Another avenue of managing costs is to change the invoicing currency for suppliers to their local currency rather than, for example, US dollars, so suppliers don’t include a premium into their existing US dollars contracts for managing FX exposures they face today, says Hazarika.</p>
<p>These ‘hidden’ FX risks, which aren’t always reflected in the balance sheet, are much more difficult for the treasurer to identify. While treasury operations may be centralised the underlying business processes that create these type of FX exposure are decentralised. “Even if you have centralised treasury operations you still need to have an approach that is mindful of the fact that the people that manage these processes are not going to think as coherently as someone managing that risk,” says Gage of FiREapps. Wilson of Reval says treasurers need to understand their pricing drivers, and even examine the contracts themselves for embedded currency risk.</p>
<p>For the most part treasurers today are still very much focused on balance sheet currency exposure, which is more obvious as it typically flows out onto the P&amp;L under income and other expenses. More strategic treasurers, however, are starting to turn their attention towards cash flow currency exposure by trying to influence how sales contracts are written and collaborating more closely with their sales teams to make them more aware of how contract decisions translate in currency risk terms, but this is still very much unchartered territory.</p>
<p>At the end of the day managing the different nuances of FX exposure, whether it is on the cash side or on the balance sheet, is about the tools the treasurer has in their toolbox and how they decide to use them. That will then determine the effectiveness of their hedging programme, alongside any metrics and policies they put in place for defining how hedging decisions are made.</p></div>

<p><i>Last month Thomson Reuters, in partnership with Treasury Today, hosted a webinar ‘Managing Currency Volatility in Emerging Markets’ exploring the key factors influencing the recent volatility in emerging markets currencies.</i></p>
<p>Eric Burroughs, Editor FX Buzz, Reuters News, set the scene by discussing the emerging markets vulnerabilities as exposed by the spike in US yields. He also referred to the ‘fragile five’ (a term coined by Morgan Stanley when referring to the currencies of South Africa, Turkey, India, Indonesia and Brazil) highlighting that the currencies of Turkey and Indonesia are particularly problematic and should receive special attention from corporates in 2014. The difficulties seen in India and Indonesia during 2013 also highlighted the severe implications of FX volatility on liquidity. Regulatory pressures in emerging markets, specifically where they are proving difficult in non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) for hedges must also be closely monitored by corporates.</p>
<p>The challenges for corporate treasurers, according to Phil Weisberg, MD and Global Head of Foreign Exchange at Thomson Reuters, is to navigate what is less and less an homogenous asset class. The continued movement away from an environment that was essentially determined by risk appetite to one that is increasingly being driven by the fundamentals and individual stories within each country is not an easy task for corporates to manage. Weisberg suggested that corporates can make strategy decisions that are currency-specific rather than treating these markets like an asset class.</p>
<p>Weisberg saw three major themes for the currency markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, the emerging markets we have been talking about for years have now emerged and their currencies trade similarly to other more mature currencies. He highlighted the Mexican peso (MXN) and Chinese renminbi (CNY) as prime examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second theme Weisberg discussed was regulation. He noted that while the driving principles of new regulations were transparency, reduced risk and increased customer protection, there have been some technical challenges to the liquidity function in adjusting to the changes. He also explained that while some market participants, particularly those in Asia, have taken a ‘wait and see’ attitude towards regulatory requirements, it is important to realise that the rules will soon start impacting everyone in the market, as in the case of reporting trades to swap data repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final theme Weisberg highlighted was the risk management process and practices, such as electronic trading and planning ahead, that corporate treasurers can use to mitigate such risks.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>For his part, Corporate Treasurer at Lenovo, Damian Glendinning, said “the challenge for practitioners is to learn how to navigate the regulatory changes – a challenge that is complicated by the fact that the changes to come have not yet been clarified”.</p>
<p>In hedging currencies, Glendinning recommended treating emerging markets the same as mature markets and stressed that volatility is not necessarily linked to emerging market status. He offered some sound advice to corporate treasurers in suggesting that a clear hedging policy and approach is fundamental for all currencies, not just emerging market currencies. The difference with emerging markets is that they often have exchange controls, which can have an impact on the ability to hedge and lead to increased use of NDFs. It is here that regulations come in and the importance of planning ahead is again necessary.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>A clear policy of currency risk and hedging should be an essential component of every corporate treasury policy. Percentages of transactions to hedge must be determined, the cost of hedging versus the risk should be evaluated and management should be made aware of the trade-offs.</p>
<p>Some currencies are expensive to hedge or cannot be hedged such as the Venezuelan bolivar and Argentine peso. Glendinning suggested that corporate treasurers explore local borrowing or factoring as a means of expediting settlement. Local manufacturing opportunities could also be used to create offsetting exposures, reducing the need for hedging in the first place.</p>
<p>Glendinning stressed that corporate treasurers and management must understand their business models and evaluate the level of risk they are willing to take. It’s important to evaluate cost of hedging vs risk. In their closing remarks, the panellists agreed that corporate treasurers should not wait for the regulations to be crystallised to prepare and craft clear policies and approaches for managing currency volatility in 2014.</p>

<p>Although many corporates run a sophisticated or professional FX execution desk, there are many instances when treasury has difficulty in identifying the sources of group-wide FX exposures and in some cases may still be collecting data on email or spreadsheets. There is a clear need to pay more attention to where and how currency risks arise in addition to developing suitable execution policies. Given this high degree of uncertainty there is now a clear case for focusing on those risks. It is necessary to look at how processes can be streamlined, from identification of exposures right through to hedging.</p>
<p>Corporates can find it extremely difficult to have visibility into all their currency risk. The problems can start as early as identification of when the FX risk is created, and may exist all the way through to how and when that risk is reported either to the regional or global central treasury. What the business does with that exposure once it has been acknowledged then becomes a challenge in terms of precisely which risk is to be hedged and how that hedge may be executed to best effect. In essence, although some businesses may have a sophisticated execution desk for FX, without a full overview of their group’s consolidated exposure, they may be missing the bigger picture in that their hedging programme may miss certain risks that would otherwise be hedged, which in itself may cause other unwarranted risks if hedge transactions need to be modified or unwound before maturity.</p>
<h3 id=""steeped-in-history"">Steeped in history</h3>
<p>For much of its 200 year existence, FX has been one of the defining businesses of Citi. FX at Citi can be traced back to 1897 when it opened a department to facilitate business conducted across international borders – inward investment from Europe and sales into China being just two examples. In 2007, its G10 and Emerging (Local) Market (LM) businesses were combined into a single global FX offering and today the bank trades over 140 currencies out of 83 centres. Against this backdrop of perhaps unparalleled experience, the philosophy of Citi’s Corporate FX Franchise is to guide its clients from the point that FX exposure is created, all the way through the value chain to execution and settlement. As part of its stock in trade, it has created tools, risk mitigation frameworks and thought-leadership programmes based in no small part on talking to its clients about the process.</p>
<p>As well as forecasting errors, faced by many companies – perhaps being derived from a technical deficiency, timeliness and accuracy around their data collection processes – balance sheet exposures may be rooted in silos of information, notes Russell Francis, Managing Director, Head of North American Corporate FX Sales at Citigroup. Data, says Francis, may reside in multiple platforms, different instances of an ERP or general ledger system distributed across the subsidiaries. If these are not integrated with head office, perhaps where M&amp;A activity has led to various legacy systems not being able to talk to each other, it will, he notes, always be difficult to gain proper oversight. Without proper oversight, FX risk cannot be mitigated effectively.</p>
<h3 id=""never-take-the-easy-option"">Never take the easy option</h3>
<p>But data is just data unless a business does something constructive with it, turning it into information. “Arguably some businesses go for the easy end of the FX spectrum where they try to hedge the straightforward elements already on their balance sheet – the accounts receivable (AR) or accounts payable (AP), for example,” notes Joakim Lidbark, Director and Global Head of CitiFX Corporate Solutions. But, he adds “FX risk may sit in various other areas such as procurement – these require the same level of attention”.</p>
<p>There are several other types of FX risk that can be managed to reduce a company’s overall exposure to changes in exchange rates.</p>
<p>An established manufacturer in the automotive industry, for example, will know that its main currency risk exists not in its receivables over the next month or two, but in whether or not it is locking-in its sales over the next two or three years; for a new model launch, it will have researched and planned everything right down to who will be buying it; and it will be confident with its forecasts. For others it is not so clear. “It is a big leap for many corporates but it is one of the most effective ways of reducing currency risk,” notes Lidbark.</p>
<p>But of course it is one thing to gather data on payables and receivables in the short term but quite another to gather the forecasts for two years’ time, and whilst some sectors may be at home with longer-term forecasting and hedging, such as the automotive industry, for others the longer-term view is difficult, even impossible.</p>
<p>The ability and the degree to which a business can forecast depends on its margins and required contract flexibility to a great extent, notes Sam Hewson, Director, Head of UK and Northern Europe Corporate Sales, Citi. A business with very tight margins, one for example in the electronics industry, he says will tend to adopt very short forecasting horizons “because it cannot afford to lock-in two years’ worth of FX rates as it could make it economically uncompetitive in two years’ time”. Conversely, the aerospace, the aforementioned automotive or even the general industrial sectors, where contracts are typically longer, can enjoy a far higher degree of forecast predictability. “Much of it comes down to the expertise and ability of the client, both in terms of technological resources available to identify and capture those forecasts – whether short or long term – and in what they do with those forecasts once they have them.”</p>
<p>It is evident then that not only can it be difficult to obtain the right data in a timely manner, but also that considerations will then arise around whether or not to hedge the full forecast amount and how to handle forecast error within that hedging policy.</p>
<h3 id=""the-importance-of-forecasting"">The importance of forecasting</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding sector variables, Holger Achnitz, Managing Director and Head of Continental European Corporate Sales, Citi, feels that many companies have improved their management and forecasting ability for exposures. “In the 2008 crisis many forecasts were called into question and ever since we have seen businesses exercising more caution in terms of the instruments they apply when they go further out.”</p>
<p>There has been, he notes, a greater degree of interest in hedging through options, in order to maintain flexibility and to not be caught out either by changing market conditions or variations on the original forecast. As transaction-certainty rises, conversion to more symmetrical hedging instruments – forwards – becomes more evident, notes Achnitz. The lesson of the last five years or so that he takes is that corporates value the flexibility in their chosen hedge instrument considerably more than they did before.</p>
<h3 id=""technologys-role"">Technology’s role</h3>
<p>Given the difficulties experienced by many corporates, technology – or rather the intelligent application of technology – is a vital part of an invigorated exposure management regime around FX. With a large swathe of the corporate community still collecting much of the relevant data on emails and spreadsheets, led by error-prone manual processes, accuracy and timeliness may be sacrificed; two elements that can ill-afford to be compromised.</p>
<p>But for many businesses, the business case for IT investment lacks punch. Jodi Schenck, Managing Director, Global FX eSolutions, Citi, acknowledges that treasury is not a bottomless pit of investment and that cost of IT may be called into question. It could be that a business knows the advantages but for commercial reasons is not able to deploy a solution in all markets and has to compromise on the roll-out of a platform because it is deemed too costly to deploy in local markets or all subs. Still, others believe that Excel is the most flexible tool. Although many users admit that it is prone to error and know that there are better ways, it is likely they do not have the means to progress. “I do believe they are trying to move towards greater models of efficiency,” says Schenck.</p>
<p>Of the systems that are in place, Hewson notes that traditionally, Treasury Management Systems (TMS) have been very good at handling the AP and AR, balance sheet and invoicing side of treasury risk management but that such systems have not necessarily been developed to tackle risk from a forecasting perspective. However, piecing together a solution can be something of a compromise in itself; anecdotal evidence (from a FTSE 100 company currently in selection mode for a risk system) suggests that risk tools tend to be very focused, in as much as there is no single offering on the market that covers the range.</p>
<h3 id=""risk-tools"">Risk tools</h3>
<p>Post-crisis, Hewson has observed an “evolution” of how treasurers look at their currency exposures, with more quantitative methodologies, such as Earnings-at-Risk (EaR), Cashflow-at-Risk (CFaR) or Value-at-Risk (VaR), being adopted. But within this toolset there is no one-size-fits-all approach. From a VaR perspective, some corporates have a VaR threshold for their portfolio of currencies and others have a threshold for individual currencies (others having no VaR threshold at all), he notes. Similarly, a number of treasurers have well-documented benchmarks which they are obliged to meet in terms of their hedging policy, whereas others do not work to benchmarks. “The degree of best practice in the corporate space varies considerably, as does the degree of sophistication, all the way from risk identification – through to risk mitigation,” Hewson comments. Variation is observable by sector, by client, by margins; “it all depends what is driving the corporate’s underlying challenges or business model”. Variation can also spell difficulty in meeting the needs of corporates.</p>
<p>However, by talking to different clients in different sectors, Citi’s FX group is acutely aware of the issues of diversity around risk management and knows that not only does the one-size-fits all solution not exist, but also that it is not possible to treat everyone in the same way even if it did. “That means we have to try to tailor each solution to each client because we just do not believe in a one-size-fits-all solution,” explains Lidbark.</p>

<h3 id=""an-individual-approach"">An individual approach</h3>
<p>Risk management for Citi is thus in the first instance based on understanding each client’s business model, trade flows and value chain from where the initial procurement or sale is made, all the way through the supply chain; so from where the FX risk is first created to when it first impacts upon treasury.</p>
<p>For Francis, this means identifying a number of timing mismatches which could exist between where risk is first created and then identified, between where that risk is first identified and subsequently reported to treasury, or perhaps between the point when treasury receives the forecast or the FX risk and when it executes the trade. “There may be a good reason for any of these but it may also be simply that the business does not have the systems, capability or the understanding to act on the information they receive,” he comments.</p>
<p>The point is that first it is essential to understand what is driving client-behaviour, what is generating risk in the pre-trade (eg pre-treasury) space, understanding the client’s risk management policy and then formulating a solution that fits the need. Opening up the conversation is the first port of call.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-to-the-heart-of-the-business"">Getting to the heart of the business</h3>
<p>It was noted above that businesses have generally become more aware and interested in quantifying and managing risk since the 2008 crisis, but not all risks are self-evident. In the second half of 2013 the emerging market sector has faced a “mini-crisis of its own”, notes Lidbark. As a result a number of corporates have woken up to the fact that they may be maintaining too low a hedge ratio for this sector. In one case, where risk was observed on a portfolio-basis, he reports that by collating the type of portfolio exposures the business had from a currency perspective, understanding the type of exposures the business had and how it hedged those exposures, it was apparent that the focus was on a single large exposure. This left a number of smaller exposures – many of which were in the emerging markets – totally unhedged; a stance that, given the decline of the emerging markets and the composition of the portfolio, ultimately proved counter-productive. Had the emerging markets not deteriorated, highlighting the fact that current policy had become so visibly ineffective, the conversation may not have even taken place which of course would have left that risk unmanaged. It is a sobering thought.</p>
<p>The motivation for the conversation around FX risk and hedging policy varies and even though a similar problem may be experienced by a number of different corporates, it is certain that not all will be trying to achieve the same end-result, suggests Achnitz. “Reduction of volatility and risk mitigation can mean a host of different things, depending on what is perceived as risk,” adds Lidbark. In seeking a greater efficacy, it is thus useful in the first instance to establish what the corporate sees as the worst-case scenario, and how this might be measured. “It gives us a good insight into how to measure risk, because it can be done in many different ways,” states Lidbark. The tools of the trade, such as scenario analysis and stress-testing, may have been deployed by risk professionals for many years but they are now becoming mainstream in the push to quantify risk.</p>
<p>In adopting such measures it is necessary for the corporate client to expose certain processes to the bank and to be honest about how it operates because only by understanding how the business operates can the bank formulate an effective response. Once the challenge has been identified and the end-point has been established, the solution design will focus on two key elements: technology and risk mitigation.</p>
<h3 id=""establishing-a-framework"">Establishing a framework</h3>
<p>“We are trying to put in place a framework structured around how to control risk – as opposed to concentrating on the next trade the client should be doing,” explains Lidbark. By talking to clients that have exposures in a host of different currencies, it became apparent that many of their hedging policies were written “in a world that looks a little different from what it does today”, he notes. Such a policy would most likely be G10-centric, with most sales and assets in these countries, and hence preparedness only for G10-based volatility and exposure risk. “Today it is completely different; many companies have outsourced and have assets in Asia and perhaps have sales operations in that region too. As a consequence, these businesses now have to take emerging markets into account when managing risk.”</p>
<p>Indeed, for Europe and US-based corporates, the emerging markets have become so much more relevant in the past few years and so they do pay a lot more attention to hedging policy and execution in those currencies, notes Achnitz. “It used to be just one of the many markets in which they sold their products, but now it has become an essential business area demanding a lot more focus on the risk management process for those currencies.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-single-platform"">A single platform</h3>
<p>On the technology side, Citi offers a web-based platform, CitiFX Pulse. The platform provides corporate treasurers with a whole host of pre-trade and risk management solutions, execution capabilities that are unparalleled in scope and a suite of post trade offerings to round it out. With CitiFX Pulse, a corporate treasury has the ability to deal spot, forward, swaps and options with access to 700 currency pairs, including restricted currencies, both onshore and through regional hubs in almost 80 different countries. Pulse has been built around the accumulated knowledge of the bank’s local markets trading business and its global footprint. A key part of the platform, re-launched in January 2013, is the revamped Exposure Management module. This functionality enables a corporate head office or group treasury to view and manage cash flow and balance sheet exposures in real-time in a visually engaging way. This data can subsequently be “sliced and diced” by subsidiary, region, country and so on. which then allows for netting and hedging across multiple entities, explains Schenck.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of Exposure Management begins with the client uploading details of its hedge policy; what can be hedged and how far out it wants to go, for example, by currency pair and entity, how much they can hedge and in what time buckets risk should be covered. This forms the rules for the system’s subsequent operation. All exposures must then be entered/uploaded into the system along with any associated hedges. This data is then checked against the policy which reports compliance. When hedging is deemed necessary, the platform generates signals based on actual treasury policy and, if outside of policy, clients may transact on pre-configured amounts to get back in line with predetermined policy.</p>
<p>The Citi team has worked with many clients to create a tailored, rules based approach to hedging. Through CitiFX Pulse, signals from some of the bank’s proprietary models can be monitored, generating additional information for corporate treasuries and taking away the discretionary ability to hedge. Over time, and informed by current hedge policy, the system will alert the user as to whether it is over- or under-hedged in a specific currency and how best to stay in line with policy.</p>
<p>While CitiFX Pulse is already an end-to-end solution and includes such features as streaming rates, order management (including algorithmic execution), confirmations and instructions, and end-of-day mark-to-markets on all positions, integration with the main trading and treasury management systems to deliver straight through processing is part of Citi’s roadmap for Pulse, says Schenck. The Pulse platform offers “a lot of assistance to our clients, from the beginning to the end of the process” but, she adds, Citi is committed to continuously improving the user experience and enhancing the functionality of the platform”.</p>
<p>Of course, adoption of CitiFX Pulse is not the end of the relationship and Schenck comments that “we regularly help clients evaluate their policies and decisions, back-test and assess how well they have managed to mitigate their risks”. Indeed, the CitiFX goal is to assist its multinational corporate clients in streamlining execution, enabling them to use their time and ever tighter resources for essential strategy discussions that, ultimately, yield better economic results from a holistic risk management process.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>As companies become more global in their operations and outlook, they are exposed to increased levels of foreign exchange (FX) risk. This may be in the form of an obligation to pay a supplier, or a foreign currency payment the company will receive from a customer. These payments are subject to fluctuations in currencies, which have become more volatile and uncertain since the global financial crisis and its consequences.</p>
<p>“There have been powerful forces at work in the global financial system,” says Robert Minikin, Senior FX Strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong. “Investors in specific markets have been heavily deleveraging; outflows from some types of bond funds are the largest on record in terms of weekly data.” Volatility is occurring across all asset classes, including FX, and corporate treasurers need to be alert to market developments and aware of liquidity conditions as well, he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""recent-developments"">Recent developments</h3>
<p>The internationalisation of China’s currency, the renminbi (RMB), is an important change of the past few years. In July, a survey by Standard Chartered Bank and treasury research company EuroFinance found that 73% of treasurers think the RMB will be the third most important currency (behind the US dollar and euro) within ten years. Of the 307 respondents, optimism was highest among corporates who already use at least one offshore RMB product: 79% think the RMB will be global number three or better. That compares with 70% for those who don’t currently use the currency.</p>
<p>However, the rise of the RMB is not as straightforward as it could be. In June, money market liquidity tightened significantly in China, with inter-bank rates pushing notably higher. This move was much larger than the usual seasonal spike seen in the middle of the year and, in the view of HSBC Asian FX strategists, could start to have more negative consequences for the RMB.</p>
<p>“We have been turning more cautious towards the RMB, and as liquidity has tightened onshore our caution towards the currency has increased. We expect USD/RMB spot to move higher and think USD/RMB FX forward curves will stay supported,” says a research note issued in June.</p>
<p>The sharp move upwards by China’s money market rates has been caused by a combination of seasonal factors, tighter regulations, structurally high leverage and a policy focus, which has shifted away from providing seasonal liquidity to make market participants focus on and try to deal with the root causes of this tightness. China’s money market liquidity tends to tighten towards the end of June when the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) checks banks’ loan-to-deposit ratios (LDRs). Additionally, says HSBC, corporate tax payments in July and seasonally slower FX inflows contribute to tighter onshore liquidity, as seen in a typical widening in the spread between money market funding costs (seven-day repo) and the one-year benchmark deposit rate in June.</p>
<p>Another contributor to the tighter RMB liquidity picture is a decline in FX inflows. In May, monthly FX purchases by banks and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) slowed significantly, from an average of RMB 377 billion in the first four months of 2013 to just RMB 67 billion. “This suggests the regulatory changes to curb speculative and hot money inflows booked as real export/trade financing activities are taking effect,” says HSBC’s research note.</p>
<p>Ivan Wong, Head of Corporate Sales, Greater China at HSBC, says the US dollar rally has been putting significant pressure on Asian currencies in the past few months, with the exception of the RMB. “Corporate customers with operations in China are generally still bullish on the RMB in the long term. There has been some concern of late about a liquidity crunch and economic slowdown, but most companies believe the RMB will pull back a bit but will still be at a good level to enter into hedges,” he says.</p>
<p>“The internationalisation of the RMB is a long-term policy and as it gets more traction there will be greater demand for RMB not only for trade settlement but also for investment and as a reserve currency. Our customers recognise that the Chinese government has realised there was an imbalance in the growth in China in the past and that the new government intends to rebalance and channel economic energy into more productive sectors. People are generally very positive about these moves for the long run.”</p>
<h3 id=""dealing-with-volatility"">Dealing with volatility</h3>
<p>In addition to the rise of the RMB, there are other, more immediate forces at work in the currency markets. The US dollar, which has been on a downward trend for some years now, seems to be recovering, sending some other currencies into sharp declines.</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve’s policy of quantitative easing (QE) has had a marked effect on some currencies. Before a Congressional panel in July this year, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said the institution’s proposed timetable for tapering its $85 billion a month bond-buying programme was not “on a pre-set course”.</p>
<p>Bernanke said the Fed anticipates it will be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of the $85 billion asset-purchase plan “later this year” and end it “around mid-year” in 2014, if the economy evolves as forecast. If economic conditions were to improve faster than expected, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced “somewhat more quickly”. However if market conditions such as employment or inflation were less favourable, easing would continue.</p>
<p>“We are in an unusual market context,” says Standard Chartered’s Minikin. “There is a question as to how well-equipped treasurers are to deal with this environment.” An important issue is to try to understand what type of volatility can be expected from the financial markets going forward. “We have seen a big jump in realised volatility and implied volatility (in the options market). There are extreme moves in particular currency crosses and powerful day-to-day swings.”</p>
<p>Minikin says it is difficult to be certain how long such volatility will last. The sudden surges in some currencies were due to the prospect of Fed tapering only shortly after the news surfaced of an aggressive QE programme in Japan.</p>
<p>Rahul Badhwar, Head of Corporate Sales, Asia ex-Greater China at HSBC, agrees that it is a very challenging period for corporate treasurers. “There have been too many forces at play on the FX market. The correlation with various market events is very high and it is tough for corporates if they have exposure to particular currencies,” he says. “An event that is unrelated to a certain currency may drive it up or down.”</p>
<p>Even corporate treasurers who do not have sophisticated trading networks and FX strategies should understand that “the world is now highly connected”. For example, a domestic business in Thailand that does not export goods and borrows only in Thai baht may think that what happens in US Treasuries has no impact on it. However, says Badhwar, US Treasuries have an impact on yields in Asian commercial paper. “Companies that think they have no FX risk have to realise that the market is highly interlinked. US investors, for example, will buy Thai debt. Across the world organisations are investing in each other which has created global flows and is increasing correlations that didn’t exist ten years ago.”</p>
<p>James Wood-Collins, CEO of Record Currency Management, an independent currency manager, says any hedging decision must be made with “a clear view of the objectives of the programme”. Corporates face two types of FX exposures: cash flow versus cost, where a manufacturer, for example, produces goods in one country and sells them in another country that has a different currency; and balance sheet exposure, where the funding structure of the corporate is in a different currency from the denomination of a liability.</p>
<p>“The issues and challenges for treasurers are focused on ensuring that the objectives are understood, rather than how a particular hedging programme should be implemented. Corporates have to decide how much of their revenues they should hedge. Sometimes treasurers can focus too much on the losses that are attributed to a currency hedging programme and fail to see that there is a gain – they are offsetting an underlying exposure.” While treasurers are happy when a hedge pays out, they are often uncomfortable with the cost of hedging. “There are times in the market when FX options look historically cheap or expensive, based on how volatility is priced. Treasurers always have to take a view versus the rest of the market.”</p>
<p>Corporates have not been confident about the economic outlook for the past three years, says Sean Yokota, Head of Asia Strategy at SEB in Singapore. The stop-and-start nature of recovery has dampened expectations of growth and heightened uncertainty. “The prospect of a possible change in the US Fed’s QE programme, for example, has led corporate treasurers to become even more conservative.”</p>
<h3 id=""new-strategies-needed"">New strategies needed</h3>
<p>Those corporates involved in emerging markets (EMs) have even higher levels of currency risk. “If a corporate has money in EMs, compensation for the currency risk would usually come from higher growth and profitability, or from higher yields. But with US rates rising, EMs don’t look as attractive as they once did,” he says. Volatility in EMs is also heightened by redemption pressures from investment funds that are pulling money out of these markets because their performance is declining.</p>
<p>This point is highlighted by HSBC’s Badhwar. With US Treasury yields around 100 basis points (bps) higher than a few months ago, investors are rethinking their EM strategies, he says. “Investors are finding that many of these markets are not very liquid and they cannot get out of them very easily. The capital outflows cause a problem in Asia because in many countries the amount of investment in the stock or bonds markets by overseas investors can be as high as 30%. When that money leaves the country it puts pressure on the currency.”</p>
<p>Companies operating in EMs have substantial currency exposures, says Petter Sandgren, Head of Markets Asia at SEB. “The increased volatility means most corporates understand that they need to hedge their currency exposures in different ways. They have to be strict about financial policies and follow them closely, even if it implies higher hedging costs.”</p>
<p>The problem for many corporates, he adds, is that unless they are very big they don’t have the resources to have competence in FX hedging and treasury management in individual subsidiaries. “There is a growing trend for corporates to manage currency exposures in the head office or regional treasury centres (RTCs), and to do the hedging on behalf of the subsidiaries. Another option is to use the local currency internally, for example the parent company will invoice in its subsidiary’s local currency, which moves the currency exposure from the subsidiary to the head office.”</p>
<p>Much of this trend has been driven by the reforms in China, which have created an offshore yuan, the CNH, to enable companies to accept onshore yuan payments from Chinese importers and then change that into US dollars at a more attractive offshore rate. In markets with high interest rates, corporates need to strongly control risks and take into account the real cost of doing business in these markets. SEB’s Yokota says: “Many corporates are looking to produce goods in the places where they are selling those goods. The easiest way to hedge currency exposure is to move production to the country in which you are selling those goods.”</p>
<p>Most corporates use FX forwards or FX options to hedge currency risk. An FX forward is an agreement to purchase or sell a set amount of foreign currency at a specified price for settlement at a predetermined future date, or within a predetermined window of time. These instruments help the user to manage the risk inherent in currency markets by predetermining the rate and date on which they will purchase or sell a given amount of FX. Treasurers use them to: protect the costs of products and services purchased overseas; protect the profit margins on products sold overseas; and lock in exchange rates as much as a year in advance.</p>
<p>An FX option is a derivative financial instrument that gives the owner the right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date. Treasurers primarily use FX options to hedge uncertain future cash flows in a foreign currency. The general rule is to hedge certain foreign currency cash flows with forwards, and uncertain foreign cash flows with options.</p>
<p>In 2010 treasury systems supplier SunGard conducted a global study to benchmark FX exposure management practices and FX risk management results. It believed one of the fundamental challenges companies faced as they sought to optimise FX exposure management resulted from a lack of standard processes, uniform policies or other benchmarks to define successful programmes.</p>
<p>The study of 275 finance executives across a diverse set of industries, found that 59% of companies had experienced unexpected, material FX gains or losses over the 12 months to May 2010. It found that difficulty in quantifying exposure data, gaining timely access to data, and achieving data confidence were exacerbating the challenge of forecasting and managing FX risk, driving companies to adopt automated FX management and risk solutions.</p>
<p>Many of the companies surveyed used manual accounting processes to calculate and monitor their FX exposure, thereby increasing their risk for error. “As a result, these companies lack confidence in the data they use to make risk mitigation decisions, increasing their susceptibility to unexpected FX losses or gains,” said the SunGard report. Wide swings in currency and market conditions, which continue today, were compounding these issues. SunGard claimed corporate treasuries should gain more reliable data and increase process automation. FX management solutions would help treasurers achieve this goal by aggregating and modelling data from various sources to identify exposures across the balance sheet, helping them make better hedging decisions and decrease their FX risk.</p>
<h3 id=""then-and-now"">Then and now</h3>
<p>Wood-Collins says the FX environment is very different from that of the pre-crisis years. “Rather than having steady, long-term moves in a currency we now see relatively little movement followed by sudden dislocations. This is a different environment, but the principal challenges remain the same for corporates – to decide the objectives and expectations of a hedging programme, backed by a large degree of realism.”</p>
<p>Standard Chartered’s Minikin says forward planning is required and that corporate treasurers need to anticipate hedging requirements and understand market exposures. “In this environment there can be very abrupt and unexpected FX swings. This forces treasurers to be very alert to specific market exposures and cash flows. They have to anticipate their hedging requirements and understand that their ability to trade at a specific level may be short-lived.”</p>
<p>Going forward, he says, there should be “more order” in the currency markets. “We have to be aware of the underlying economic volatility behind the volatility we see in the capital markets is not that great. Our forecasts for the US are broadly benign; we think there will be 1.8% growth this year and 2.7% in 2014. The US economy is ticking along and inflation is not a big problem. The volatility in the financial markets is not justified by the economy or economic policy. Over time, I think we will gradually edge into a more orderly market environment.”</p></div>

What is political risk? In basic terms, it can be defined as any political event or decision with the potential to impact negatively upon commercial activities. The risk is often grouped and analysed on macro and micro levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Macro-level risks are those which impact all businesses operating within a specific region. Such risks are widely discussed in the media, and include political and civil unrest, energy-price volatility, terrorism, and civil or cross-border conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Micro-level risks are firm or industry-specific risks. These types of risks are, by their very nature, discriminatory. The category includes the risk of a government nullifying a contract with a certain business, or that a terrorist group will target a certain company’s operations.</p>

<p>Most successful multinational companies (MNCs) now recognise that the way in which political risks are managed can have a substantial impact upon performance. This awareness is particularly acute amongst businesses that have had their fingers burnt by political events in the past.</p>
<p>“I think there is a discrepancy between companies who have been operating in highly volatile, highly opaque markets for a long time and those who have not,” says James Smither, Head of Political Risk at global risk analytics company, Maplecroft. Predicting the types of companies that are going to be good at managing political risks is not always straightforward, Smither cautions, but there does seem to be a strong association between those that pay most attention and those who have had negative experiences in the past. “If you went through a very traumatic expropriation in Iran or Latin America during the 1970s, then you will most likely have very rigorous systems in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again,” says Smither.</p>
<p>For most companies, managing political risk to avoid the types of negative experience is the priority. But effective risk management can also help businesses to seize new opportunities which otherwise may have passed them by. Anticipating policy developments, for example, might provide a window to gain first-mover advantage in a particular region.</p>

<h3 id=""political-risk-assessment-and-analysis"">Political risk assessment and analysis</h3>
<p>Before a company can begin to manage political risk, first it must find a way of identifying and quantifying the different threats it faces, and then analyse how these threats might impact upon strategy and its ability to access and operate in different markets.</p>
<p>A combination of political risk assessment and analysis is typically used for this objective. On the macro-level, quantitative risk assessment considers the general attributes and variables of different political environments. Data from specific countries is aggregated to generate an overall score, allowing them to be comparatively assessed and assigned a graded risk level. A number of risk consultancies offer such indices including the Economist Intelligence Unit (EUI), Political Risk Services and Aon.</p>
<p>Maplecroft’s annual Political Risk Atlas (PRA) includes 50 risk indices for 197 countries which are embedded in interactive maps. The atlas includes short-term risks, such as the rule of law, political violence, and regime stability, in addition to longer-term factors such as economic diversification, resource scarcity and human rights.</p>
<p>For the risk manager or CFO, the changing values of such indices can provide a useful starting point for identifying future risk events. For example, if one wished to look at the probability of large-scale social unrest breaking out in a particular country, you might look at indicators such as youth unemployment or the level of government oppression, where any change could indicate a rise or a fall in the level of risk.</p>
<h3 id=""managing-political-risk-the-four-ts"">Managing political risk: the four Ts</h3>
<p>Now that the risk has been identified and evaluated, companies can begin the process of managing it. As is the case with other types of exposure, there are four main ways for a company to manage political risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One option is to tolerate the risk – companies may conclude that the level of risk they face is acceptable and decide to proceed as normal, while monitoring it to make sure that it does not increase in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, if a company decides that the level of risk they face is too high, but wish to continue operating in a particular region or country, then an alternative approach would be to transfer the risk by taking out political risk insurance (PRI) in order to provide a form of financial recourse should the worst happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third pillar is treatment. Treatment involves taking actions that will reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring in the first place. That could mean lobbying a government in the hope of achieving a more favourable legislative outcome or, alternatively, taking certain steps to mitigate the impact of a damaging policy decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where the level of risk is deemed to be unacceptable a decision may be made to terminate a certain activity. What is determined to be an acceptable level of risk may vary between industries and companies. For instance, companies in extractive industries such as mining often have little choice regarding the countries or regions in which they operate. A company which mines for platinum has to go wherever the deposits are, leading them sometimes into more volatile environments.</p>

<h3 id=""a-growing-concern"">A growing concern</h3>
<p>The ongoing social and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has begun to reshape the way companies and investors consider political risk. “The Arab Spring was a sort of ‘9/11 moment’ for political risk,” says Maplecroft’s Smither. “It was a seminal event for companies because even if you were not investing in Egypt or Tunisia, the chances are that your supply chain passes through the Middle East and you would have experienced some form of disruption.” Many of those countries, Smither points out, had been stable for extremely long periods. Their leaders – the likes of Mubarak, Ben Ali, and al-Assad – had in many cases been in power for decades and, furthermore, were seen as friends of the West.</p>
<p>“So that proved to be a big wake-up call for everyone,” says Smither. “People began to realise that just because they know the president of a country and have a good relationship with the administration doesn’t necessarily mean that they are politically safe. What it showed was that even long-standing governments can fall suddenly, leaving companies to deal with a bunch of new faces.”</p>
<p>Lee Garvey, Vice President at Marsh’s Political Risk Practice, agrees with Smither that there has been an upsurge of corporate concern around political risk in recent years. “It is an age-old problem – like with all insurance – people tend to come to market once the house is already on fire.”</p>
<p>Garvey does note signs of a more conscious approach to political risk emerging, with an increasing number of clients now considering the product for all of their investments and projects going forward. “We are seeing clients address political risk in a more proactive rather than reactive way. I think historically that was the case – companies, banks and investors would consider PRI as an afterthought. Now companies are thinking about it as a way to actually enhance the proposition internally with their own credit committees and due diligence process.”</p>

<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> What immediately comes to mind is money market funds (MMFs) and MMF regulation. Could I ask one of the fund managers to summarise for us and for the readership where we are right now with the proposed regulation?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> It’s very slow, Richard. We’ve been talking about potential proposals for a while now and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has some proposals out for consultation.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> I knew the industry was waiting for the SEC, but now suddenly we’ve got this European 3% capital suggestion that has been leaked.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> It does seem that there are a couple of processes running in parallel. There is a fair amount of concern and confusion in terms of how orchestrated those changes will be. The US is proposing to treat some of the funds and investment types differently. It’s not clear whether there is going to be the same approach in Europe.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Let me ask the investors. What are you doing right now?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Well, we’re comfortable being in MMFs today, but we’re starting to prepare for life without them. I’m concerned about what’s in the leaked European proposal because it’ll make life very difficult for most fund managers and investors. So we’re starting to have a look around at other propositions and products, because MMFs may or may not fit the bill in 2014 and 2015.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> I’d say we’re largely in the same position. We concentrate a significant portion of our surplus cash in MMFs and had to ask ourselves whether we should be diversifying, which we are now doing. This may be slightly unfair but I get a feeling that there’s a general inertia amongst corporates on this. I don’t think they really want to admit that the scale of the issue could be coming their way in terms of the potential changes to the landscape. As a result, there could be a bit of a panic, or knee-jerk reaction, when it does come through because I just don’t think we’re necessarily prepared for it.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> I’m starting to form a view that actually a lot of corporate treasuries are slightly behind the curve in terms of all the regulation that’s coming. It’s not just MMFs, you’ve got European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), Dodd-Frank, Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) – a whole suite of regulation that’s going to be pretty onerous on providers and corporate treasurers.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> I agree wholly with what Alex and Matt have said but we’ll be watching the developments closely and at the first sign of MMFs having trouble, we will re-focus on the alternatives that are available to us. Until then we will support them as much as we possibly can, and we’ll put our voice behind those in favour of regulation that will support MMFs into the future.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> I’m not convinced most corporates actually have got alternatives available. They’ll go back to their boards, back to the investment policy, and say ‘well, this is the new world we’re living in. Can we accept a variable net asset value (VNAV)?’ I don’t have an answer to that, but that’s how I see it playing out. At AstraZeneca, we already have the ability to move out of MMFs quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class=""boxed"">
<p>Variable net asset value (VNAV) is seen by many as the only practical and commercial structure by which the money fund industry will be able to exist under the proposed rules. Put simply, the principal value may vary although managers would do their best to avoid this.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> You have a contingency plan in place?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> Well, we could move to treasury-only funds and actually invest straight into US Treasuries, and we’re preparing the legal documentation for tri-party repo transactions. Not on a full scale, but just dipping our toe in the water to see what this product offers; then gradually we could have an exit strategy from MMFs, if that was deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s a ‘perfect storm’ building against MMFs. Regulation is obviously one aspect but there is also low yield, income fees and even negative yield environment. If you put everything together, the question is should we be concentrating so much cash into this one instrument?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I don’t think it’s just MMFs that are being impacted by potential regulatory reform. Regulation is affecting the broader short-term fixed income markets, so you can’t make a decision to move away from MMFs without encountering regulation somewhere else. Proposed regulation such as the FTT and Basel III are just two examples. There are a number of moving parts, and to just focus on MMF regulation in isolation may not be the best approach.</p>
<p>Another point to keep in mind with respect to MMF reform is that we are anticipating in the first instance a ‘proposal’, and not an immediate change in regulation. Any proposal will have to progress through a political process, which will likely take a fair amount of time. Changes are not going to happen overnight.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> There could be a more joined-up approach to our protestations. What we’ve currently got, in terms of MMFs, is working. The industry is well-regulated. If it gets broken up, because of the way regulation moves, then all of the corporate treasurers are going to have a nightmare trying to find homes for their money. So I don’t think it’s actually going to solve anything in the long term. Maybe it is time that we got together to provide a unified voice on the changes we object to on both the investor side and the fund side.</p>
</div>
<div class=""boxed"">
<p>The Financial Transactions Tax (FFT) being proposed in Europe would levy a very small percentage charge on all financial transactions. The effect would be to tax away the return on transactions with very thin margins/small returns.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> The question is, if you apply a doomsday scenario that all investors will exit MMFs, whether the new regulated world is a better place from a risk management, market liquidity and financing perspective? Arguably it’s not. The proposed regulations are going to take an important element of the functioning markets away.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Some of the proposals are pretty sensible and actually nobody would argue with them, such as those around transparency, disclosure, prescribed liquidity, etc. No one is going to have a problem with that. Where there is a problem with the proposals is the capital buffer of 3%, which will hurt the economics of the MMFs and which will be passed onto the investor.</p>
<p>There is also the constant NAV (CNAV) versus VNAV debate, although I think that might not be quite as fundamental as people think. I think investors, with the right outcomes around the accounting and tax questions, will be able to get their head around it, although no one I speak to wants to see the change.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> What’s the industry going to look like in 18 months?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> I think it depends on two fundamental questions around the VNAV/CNAV and capital requirement. If those two issues don’t get resolved favourably, then I see the MMF industry potentially being smaller than it is today. I am interested in the BlackRock and J.P. Morgan Asset Management viewpoints on this.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> It’s a difficult one to predict, obviously. Asking the hypothetical question right now – if MMFs are regulated in such a way that the CNAV structure disappears, will you continue to invest? – isn’t necessarily indicative of what investors will do if they are truly faced with this decision. I think prudent investors will look at any regulatory proposal in its entirety and make a decision based on complete information.</p>
<p>I agree with your thoughts around potential changes to the underlying CNAV/VNAV structure. The typical treatment of the CNAV MMF product as a cash and cash-equivalent instrument is critically important for most corporate investors, and they will also want to understand if this is possible in a VNAV MMF. The tax treatment of the gains/losses on redemptions in a VNAV product is also an issue which corporate investors will no doubt want to understand. I don’t totally disagree with your point that you may see a more concentrated market place from a managers’ perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> It’s entirely possible that the market will shrink for a period of time. But then we’ll have to be looking at what options are available in a low interest rate environment, what solutions are managers coming up with, and what is palatable for investors? It’s quite possible that the industry won’t look as uniform as it does at the moment, which in itself wouldn’t necessarily be a good thing because you potentially lose the slightly commoditised element in this space and being able to compare like products with like.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Alex, what are you going to do with your US dollars in a negative rate environment?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> I have invested in US T-bills, paying 0% in the last two years, in the short term. It was unpalatable to go for a negative interest rate, so I just looked at the curve where there was a pocket to actually get nothing, rather than negative. It partly depends on the environment we would be in, but probably we’d be prepared to pay negative interest for security.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> Just with government risk or bank risk as well?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> I think just with government risk, straight into US Treasuries. But going back to the question, I think that in the next 18 months we will actually be bringing in-house the management of some of our cash, rather than nearly 100% going to the fund manager.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> I think that is something that we’re definitely seeing across the investor base – they are looking at cash balances much more holistically and terming it out. They are separating out what is doable, where they can take the risk and what needs to be instantly accessible – investors are much more focused on that than historically.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> I think the environment changes the context in terms of how you hold cash. If you have a general pool of cash, then you have one set of rules for it. But if you’re holding cash for a specific purpose because you’ve switched into cash waiting for a better opportunity, well, the cost of holding that cash then becomes part of your trade, doesn’t it? And then you make your decision as to whether or not you can lose one, two or ten basis points (bps) on a holding for one, two, three months, while you’re waiting for your next investment opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> And the real yields are negative anyway. Therefore, depending on how long you’re sitting on it, you might be losing value.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I’m just going to go back and pick up on one thing. There is a level of knowledge which has to be achieved around the concept of VNAV funds. The general assumption is that it implies more risk, but this isn’t necessarily the case. You could, for example, see managers introduce VNAV products where the risk profile is more conservative than that of existing prime MMFs, in order to dampen or even eliminate any underlying market NAV volatility. However, this type of approach will make it harder to deliver the yield element of the triad — capital preservation, liquidity and yield – for which MMFs have been so well known and regarded.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> It’ll be whether the settlement is T+0 or T+1. That’s what it’ll come down to in the long term. T+1 is not same-day liquidity.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Let me just understand this settlement point. Are you saying that it would always be T+1 for VNAV funds?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> It’s just very challenging to do true mark-to-market with same-day liquidity. You’d have to have such an early cut-off in order to properly price the funds to then provide the same-day liquidity, which might not be feasible from a trading perspective. MMFs might lose some of their usability if you have a very early cut-off, and there could be potential pricing issues during the day. So that’s the real challenge.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> There’s a lot of cash that we manage from investors who don’t always need same-day liquidity. I understand that some need same-day liquidity, but we see a level of cash invested in MMFs by investors that can accept, for example, next-day liquidity. So banks, if I take an evolving short-term angle, have greater appetite for operational balances, and maybe that’s where some investment is placed for that portion of corporate cash for which there is a clear need for T+0 availability. The dynamics continue to underscore the importance of transparency and the ability to tier or segment cash balances.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> I would guess most corporate policies treat MMFs as overnight, which is technically not correct given that, if you needed to redeem your whole cash balance, it would probably take a few days.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Are you saying the industry will offer both same-day and T+1?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I think the industry recognises that if we want to manage working capital, the ability to deliver on a T+0 basis is critical. Whether or not we operationally are able to get to that is the unanswered question right now. There are some challenges around it, not the least of which is getting accurate market pricing and being able to conclude the determination of the NAV within a reasonable time frame in order to deliver T+0.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Are J.P. Morgan Asset Management and BlackRock having more conversations with investors about segregated mandates?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> Yes, we are. And we were having those conversations a few years ago, but it always felt a little bit academic. When it came down to it, after looking at the logistics of setting up the segregated mandates and model portfolios, then typically what we’ve found is that investors actually shy away from it.</p>
<p>Now it feels more real – that it might be something that is actually going to happen. We are sensing that there is a real change in investor appetite. This is also partly in preparation for the potential regulation changes, so it’s not just yield driven.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> What are the investors around this table thinking about doing?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Well, as I said, we’ve got a similar position to Alex in terms of having high concentrations in MMFs. We have seen banks offer better yields on bank accounts than MMFs, and those are banks whose credit I’m comfortable with. So with yields better than the MMFs, we’ve started to leave our operational cash floats with one bank.</p>
<p>In addition, we’ve looked at evergreen deposits and collateralised deposits, and we’re learning about tri-party repos.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> How does an evergreen deposit work?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Under the new liquidity requirements, there’s a lot more priority given to liquidity that is ‘sticky’, and particularly for deposits over three months. So an evergreen deposit – where you give notice to the bank to mature the deposit but you receive the cash back in three months’ time, or otherwise the deposit will continue in perpetuity, that helps the bank from liquidity ladder perspective and can support a higher yield. You’ve got to be comfortable with the credit of that particular bank; but if you are, that can help.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> We currently use evergreen notice accounts (ENAs). We have some that mature over 35 days, over 60 days and some over 95 days, depending on our view of the risk of the counterparties. We hold those on an evergreen basis and we don’t intend to call upon them until they are no longer economically viable from a liquidity, credit or rate perspective.</p>
<p>They’re structured in a way that we want to keep them within our portfolio because they enhance returns. A small amount of extra risk for an appropriate amount of the yield. The only problem with them is that they never mature unless you call upon them. They never march into that sub-30-day bucket.</p>
<p>But if you’re using it as ‘sticky’ money and plan to keep it there for two years, while getting three month LIBOR+10, then you’re getting 60bps for a two-year deposit when you could get 48bps from rolling it every three months into your maturity bucket. So it’s quite a call to make, and you should take all of that into consideration.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> If you compare the yields that you get on those 35, 60 and 90-day ENAs, does it compare favourably to a three and six-month deposit?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> We’ve done some and rejected others because the numbers just didn’t work. Essentially what we wanted to do was achieve something around one-year money for something that was staying out there at just three months. Otherwise there was just no point going past three months, which tends to be the ‘sweet spot’. So we look at offers on a case-by-case basis and negotiate from there.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> The yield curve is so flat and no one’s paying for any kind of duration up to that tenor, so it’s the evergreen – or that kind of deposit category – that creates a small pick-up in yield because it does help the banks in terms of their liquidity ladder.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> Can I ask Alex a question? In terms of everything that you’re doing – taking things back in-house, fairly intensive layering and all the rest of it – presumably that’s more resource heavy from your perspective?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> Yes, most definitely. We just felt that we’ve got to start de-risking ourselves and put some process in place. Whether that will be the case in the long term, I’m not sure; but certainly, given the size of our balances, it makes sense to be able to do a direct repo transaction ourselves. But you’re right – the more you bring it in-house, the more internal credit discussions you will have over what you’re invested in.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> Investors do four things with their cash: deposit it in financial institutions; invest it in pooled funds, such as MMFs; buy direct instruments, such as commercial paper (CP), certificates of deposit (CDs), etc; or establish a separately managed or bespoke investment vehicle, where they engage the support of an active asset manager.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits MMF investors get is the credit and risk management oversight provided by the underlying asset manager.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> That is the reason why we use you.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> But it’s not ‘fire-and-forget’ – we still want visibility of strategy and holdings.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I agree. I look at the investment alternatives we’ve talked about today: bank deposits, CP, CDs and tri-party repo. We buy every single one of those instruments within a MMF. If you’re achieving a greater yield on a direct basis, it may be partially down to the fee a manager charges for the work they do; but it may also be because you’re taking a level of direct risk that your asset manager simply isn’t comfortable taking.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> I think it’s a Catch-22 situation, in the sense that we’ve got too much exposure to bank debt. If I ask a particular MMF why they haven’t got more corporate paper, they say that there’s not a lot out there.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Whereas the corporate issuers that are in MMFs are consistently the same names.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> It’s also a function of the MMF design, where we’re managing to a short-dated weighted average maturity (WAM), prescribed liquidity buckets, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> A lot of it is to do with issuances as well. We’d all love to buy it, but it doesn’t sit within the risk framework, it isn’t sufficiently rated.</p>
</div>

<figcaption>
<h6>Alex Fiott, AstraZeneca</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> But I’m sure if you asked any corporate investor whether they would like to see more corporate names in a particular MMF, I think the answer would be an unequivocal yes.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> Of course.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> It’s the same for providers. We’d love to do more of it.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Are investors also taking or accepting more risk?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> Sadly, I think yes. I’d love to sit here and say ‘no’, but we are seeing that in some cases. Obviously some of the debate around this table is addressing that issue. It depends how you define risk, but we’re seeing that the yield concerns are pushing investors to do things that they wouldn’t previously have done. So yes, I think some investors are heading in that direction.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I’m not sure I’m sad about it. I think people who want the features that MMFs deliver should be focused on a product that has those characteristics. I think what we’re seeing is connected to the tiering of cash, combined with greater transparency over cash positions. There are strategies that we’re delivering that are offering greater yield and corporate money is starting to be attracted to those strategies. It’s not a replacement for cash investments – it’s a complement to cash investments; and there’s appetite for it, whether in a pooled product or separately managed account form.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> We don’t believe there is much risk-return out there. As Matt was saying, the curve is flat so there’s not a lot of point going beyond three months – and with many banks there’s no point in going beyond one month because you’re only getting a couple of basis points for trebling your term.</p>
<p>For us, the change to risk happens when you come out of the cash market and look to invest out of a zero-yield area into something where you can get some kind of pick up. But that’s a bond investment decision, which is something completely different to the cash market.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> What different things are investors doing and what risks are they taking? Is it duration or credit criteria?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> A bit of duration, a bit of a drop in credit quality and liquidity – all of the above. There is a divergence in terms of client type. One of the things that slightly concerns me when I’m talking to clients is that it’s almost a reversion to pre-crisis behaviour, where you see some of the smaller, less sophisticated clients who are much more sensitive to yield, beginning to think about yield again and maybe start venturing into areas that perhaps they shouldn’t be, or where they should conduct some additional investigation before they go down that route.</p>
<p>With regards to Jim’s earlier point, there is obviously a huge discrepancy between client approaches. There are those who are very informed and well-resourced and will take very prudent decisions. But I’m more concerned about the people who don’t have the resources or the experience perhaps, and may be inclined to forget some of the lessons learned over the course of the past few years.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> It’s interesting looking around this table. I mean Alex is clearly US Treasuries, risk-averse and capital preservation-focused. I’m in the same camp, although focused around MMFs and banks rather than US Treasuries. Steve, are you taking any additional risk?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> Not particularly. It is not right for our cash funds and our ‘on balance-sheet’ monies don’t need to chase yield.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> So I think capital preservation is still key for all of us.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I’m not fully aware of each of your respective investment policies, but I would just say that the approach in the UK does differ slightly when compared to the rest of Europe. As I sit in the UK as well, I do have to sometimes think beyond that. Certainly, from my observations, there is a more conservative investment approach in the UK.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> There’s also the question around the definition of taking more risk. Is putting money with an A-2 corporate in CP more risky than putting it with an A-1 bank in CP? And you can argue there’s a point where the diversification and the movement away from the banking sector actually decreases your risk, even though it’s got a lower rating.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> Yes, exactly. It depends how you define it.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> There’s a trusted advisory relationship that we have with our clients, which means they’re willing to hear us out on options and alternatives to add incremental yield. Adding incremental yield sometimes puts you into a total return-type structure, which isn’t the way cash investors think. However, there’s an opportunity to pick up yield when you access corporate issuance, with a level of incremental credit risk with which we are comfortable. Additionally, from an interest rate perspective, it can be a key component to push out and/or manage duration to a greater extent.</p>
</div>

<figcaption>
<h6>Matt Shelley, 3i</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> And that’s where your trusted advisor relationship and credibility really comes into play, because a significant number of investors will not actually have the resources or skills to do a really good job on credit risk management.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> We’re considering changing our investing instruments and buying a product that, hopefully, can sensibly increase yield. But it’s very hard to pick up 15 or 20 bps in this low interest environment. The problem for a company is on the liability side, where they may be paying 4.5-5% on long-term debt, then getting 20bps for what could possibly be viewed as quite a lot more risk. It’s just not worth it. Therefore, the liability management side of your business is the one that could be making you twist and do something silly.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I understand what you are saying – inside the corporate structure and the need to sell it upstream to management – but we are talking 20 to 40bps in incremental return off the back of a commensurate level of risk.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> Oh, it’s meaningful but it doesn’t really cut your negative carry that much when you’ve issued debt five or ten years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Well, you can’t do much about that, so I think nominal capital preservation remains key. And looking around the room, I’m sure everyone would agree that the financial markets are by no means ‘fixed’.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> There’s a reason rates are low.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> Absolutely. Lots of markets are now looking very ‘frothy’ following the monetary easing by a number of central banks.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> As investors, you’ve talked about staying short and risk-free. Is negative yield acceptable?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> Depends on which bucket we’re looking at – with some of my portfolios, I’ve bought assets with negative yields in order to maintain the investment policy but only in certain groups. Towards the end of last year, we bought some negative Dutch T-bills and Bubills (German T-bills). Therefore, sometimes it is a case of ‘well, if that’s where the markets are, then that’s where they are’, but I’ve kept that to an absolute minimum and haven’t needed to do it this year.</p>
<p>There is currently an 8bps difference between reasonable quality three-month bank deposits and Bubills. If that relationship remains if Bubills go further negative, then I can assure you that Canada Life Investments will not be investing directly with a bank at negative rates. We would either maintain our positions with MMFs, or we would go direct into Bubills.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> We will have to accept negative rates, given our desire for short-term liquidity, either through direct interest rates or forward points on foreign exchange (FX) swaps.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> Are you doing cross-currency swaps for a yield pick-up? No. We have looked at that on the basis that with a dollar base you can invest in Japan with a dollar/yen swap and achieve quite an attractive yield pick-up. But then you look at it more and you realise that you are taking on more bank risk because of a big FX exposure. We considered it because you can transact cross-currency swaps – or you certainly could six to nine months ago with the way the dollar/yen swap worked – to get a yield pick-up through the arbitrage opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Maybe some final words of advice to the reader as to what investors should be doing right now.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> I think there’s a lot to learn about repos, if you’re going down that direct route. Corporates may have naively thought that they could lend cash to one of their strong counterparty banks and receive US Treasuries as collateral in order to get a yield, but the reality is that it’s not quite that simple. You should have frank discussions with your banks as to how you’re going to play out repo transactions and what securities you will accept.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I agree with you that there is a little naivety around the use of repo. This is meant with respect, but I suspect that most investors don’t have the ability to analyse the underlying collateral sets, which may limit the capacity that a product like repo can offer particularly for non-government collateral.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alex Fiott (AstraZeneca):</span> Moving into a space that you haven’t been involved in before means that you should look at a clearing house like Euroclear or Clearstream. Then if you decide to go into direct investments, do you open up a custodian account with one of the big custodian banks? That comes with a lot of associated costs. So then it comes down to why don’t you let the experts – the BlackRocks and the J.P. Morgan’s of this world – manage your cash? Doing it by yourself can be very expensive.</p>
<p>That’s where we are at the moment. We haven’t fallen into either camp but we want to de-risk ourselves, so we are exploring both camps in order to make a decision from there.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Matt Shelley (3i):</span> My advice is to get ahead of all the regulatory changes that are coming. They will have direct impact on your company, but will probably also have an indirect impact because they will change the markets. You may not get to a position immediately where you’re 100% happy with the impact of the regulations, but at least you can get to the point where you understand where it’s not clear, why it’s unclear and what the likely impacts might be. Many treasurers will have to spend quite a large percentage of their working week dealing with regulation now, which wasn’t true historically.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I’ll just say that the benefits of a trusted advisor relationship are becoming increasingly important and investors should take advantage of it now. It’s not that we have all the answers but I think the relationship brings with it a dialogue. Therefore, if you’re thinking about changing your investment policies, you shouldn’t do it in isolation. There’s a lot of interconnectivity in short-term markets and our expertise can often assist corporate investors as they think through and evaluate the evolving landscape. And we welcome the opportunity to talk with clients about these issues.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Steve Matthews (Canada Life Investments):</span> I think the risk-return calculation has come back more into play recently, especially with the yield curve compressing so much – and it’s going to become more difficult before it becomes easier. My advice at the moment is to remain short and wait for the opportunities to invest to come around. If you go chasing after yield and suddenly the regulations come in and the marketplace changes, you could find yourself holding the wrong assets.</p>
<p>I don’t think we’ve seen the last of the trials and tribulations in Europe and there are more echoes to come around and hit the UK market.</p>
<p>There are no answers out there at this moment, therefore in the meantime I’m just keeping short. The problem with that is the additional pressure on banks to take longer cash. So, continue talking to all of the people that you can talk to and explore other options with the banks that you’ve got on your counterparty list. You can almost guarantee that there’s someone within that organisation that will have an idea as to what else you can do with them that meets their requirements and gives you a better pick-up in yields, without necessarily taking more risk.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Britta Hion (BlackRock):</span> We do see there are opportunities out there and we’ve discussed some of them. Perhaps if you go a little bit further out on the curve and think flexibly about what you can do in this environment, then that needs to be worked through in terms of policy and risk appetite with your partners – banks, fund providers, etc. You just have to be fairly creative and come into it with an open mind-set. The feedback loop is very important and then we can come up with solutions that will work over the longer term and are hopefully fairly ‘future-proof’.</p>
</div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>The process of netting can be used in various areas of cash management. In its most basic term it is usually a way of offsetting cash amounts in a way that results in benefits for the corporate, such as reduced transaction costs. However, the scale of the benefit can differ significantly depending upon the type of netting that the corporate is involved with. Many forms of netting cover areas of the banking relationships that the corporate holds, while perhaps the most beneficial form of netting focuses on inter-company transactions.</p>
<h3 id=""payables-and-receivables"">Payables and receivables</h3>
<p>Netting accounts payable (AP) and receivable (AR) could be considered the most basic form of netting. A corporate has obligations to a bank, where it may have a derivative instrument, loan or deposit, and is expecting an immediate payment back from an investment with that bank. At the same time, the corporate may have a foreign exchange (FX) contract with the same bank through purchasing some foreign currency, and needs to pay the bank for that foreign currency. Here the corporate can potentially net these two sums off. This means that rather than waiting to receive its investment back and then paying the FX cost back to the bank, an agreement with the bank can allow the corporate to merely settle the net amount.</p>
<p>This is usually done by arrangement with the bank, to make sure that it is expecting either a net settlement or payment, based on the size of the flows either way. Typically there will be a master agreement in place between the two parties that establishes the right to net.</p>
<p>While this process is technically quite simple, there are many challenges. If the corporate has a $2 billion loan coming back, for example, and also has a sizeable settlement to pay to the bank (such as a large FX deal), the bank may be somewhat wary to net those two off. It is important to ensure that the settlement is done in a timely fashion so that neither party is exposed to daylight exposure, which is an intraday exposure when an account is in an overdraft position at any time during the business day.</p>
<h3 id=""balance-netting"">Balance netting</h3>
<p>Balance netting with relationship banks is sometimes referred to as pooling. For example, the corporate may have a balance in euros in France, an overdraft in Italy and a credit balance in the UK. By arrangement with the relationship bank, it is possible to pool the balance of all of these accounts and then net them off. The corporate ends up with a netted cash position, or a netted pool of accounts, in a particular geographic area. Through the arrangement, the corporate would pay or accrue interest on these accounts, on a netted basis, based on the balance.</p>
<p>Most companies in Europe engage in some element of balance netting. One popular practice is to pool euro accounts, where permissible. These can be offset to ensure that the corporate does not have to physically sweep cash into certain concentration accounts. Using the earlier scenario of accounts in France, Italy and the UK, rather than actually physically shifting all cash to one central account to be balanced out, banks can offer corporates the right to net out and have a pool structure. This can save a lot of money on payments that shift cash around different geographies.</p>
<h3 id=""fx-netting"">FX netting</h3>
<p>Corporates often have the right to offset FX settlement amounts. In one simple example, if the corporate has bought Canadian dollars from Bank A and has sold Canadian dollars to Bank B, these can often be netted off. The corporate may have an agreement where it can net off cross-bank settlement flows, leaving the treasurer to pay only the net to the bank they owe. If Bank B is paying the corporate €100m for Canadian dollars and at the same time the corporate owes €120m to Bank A, then Bank A would receive €100m from Bank B, leaving the corporate to pay €20m to Bank A.</p>
<p>This tactic avoids multiple flows of large currency amounts. The corporate can net them all off and allow the banks to settle between themselves based on the obligations they have to those banks.</p>
<p>FX netting is becoming more common, particularly around continuous linked settlement (CLS). The whole point of CLS is to avoid daylight exposure, by netting exposures out.</p>
<h3 id=""multilateral-netting"">Multilateral netting</h3>
<p>Multilateral netting is perhaps the most interesting form of netting available to corporates. It is a form of netting that is usually done on an inter-company basis where subsidiaries have inter-company payables and receivables. For example, Subsidiary A may buy some elements of the production from Subsidiary B. Subsidiary B may itself be buying some elements that it needs from Subsidiary C, and so on. These inter-company payables and receivables are typically settled on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Multilateral netting allows the treasurer to set up a process where all subsidiaries go into a central repository and log all of their payables and/or receivables. Every subsidiary that is expecting to receive something from another subsidiary goes into the netting session and puts in the amount they are expecting to receive, the currency and which subsidiary it is from. The same is true for subsidiaries that go in to the netting session to declare what they are expecting to pay.</p>
<p>If an organisation has many inter-company settlements, a netting solution will allow it to enter all of these into a central location and then net them out. In a simple example, Subsidiary A needs to buy $10m to pay to Subsidiary B. Subsidiary B needs to buy Canadian dollars and use its US dollars to pay Subsidiary C. In a netting centre, the company can net the two off and the US dollar amount can disappear. It may be left with a euro/Canadian dollar exposure, for example. The end result is that the corporate does not have hundreds of payments in foreign currencies happening between subsidiaries. Instead, there is a limited number of transactions that central treasury has to undertake in foreign currency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multilateral netting allows the treasurer to set up a process where all subsidiaries go into a central repository and log all of their payables and/or receivables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, if Subsidiary A were to pay Subsidiary B without a netting solution, it would have to go to the bank to request the $10m, while its base currency may be euros. In effect, they are doing an FX transaction. Unlike central treasury, subsidiaries are rarely experts in FX and will typically get both a poor rate from the bank and a poor spread on that rate. If a corporate buys and sells foreign currency it will pay a buy/sell spread. For example, if Company A is buying sterling from the US, they may find it at around 1.50. If conversely Company A is selling, it may be around 1.52 for a small FX deal. That spread of $0.02 for every transaction carried out can soon mount up across an organisation.</p>
<p>If the corporate has 600 invoices going between subsidiaries and they are all settled by an FX deal that the subsidiary did with the bank, there will be a lot of spread on currency rates and poor rates on the FX deal as the subsidiaries do not have the same banking relationship as central treasury does.</p>
<p>Netting allows the treasurer to go to the subsidiaries and net down this process, resulting in a consolidated netted position. The central treasury then goes to the bank and carries out the translation of that position into the different currencies. The end result means that, in the case of Subsidiary A based in Europe, it will be told what it needs to pay or should receive in euros. Each subsidiary only has one account, which is in their most suitable currency. A Canadian subsidiary may have payables and receivables in euros, Mexican pesos, Norwegian kroner, for example, but this does not matter. It will only receive one single amount in Canadian dollars. Multilateral netting simplifies the entire process down for every subsidiary, in that each will only pay or receive one amount in their base currency. All of the company invoices will be settled on a netted basis by the central treasury group.</p>
<h4 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h4>
<p>One of the main challenges in implementing a multilateral netting programme is that it is an education process for the subsidiaries which group treasury has to lead. People do not like being overburdened with having to present too much information if they do not understand the reason for this. Multilateral netting is one area in treasury where there is a very tangible return on investment (ROI) for implementation. It is simple to calculate the value saved based on the netting down of all of the spreads.</p>
<p>In terms of setting up a netting process, a corporate will typically start by going to its treasury management system (TMS) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. If it is a payables netting session, it will export all of the payables that it is expecting for the month. These are then uploaded to a netting solution at a certain date every month. There are typically four dates in a netting session:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Presentment date</h5>
<p>– when the payment invoices are input into the netting solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cut-off date</h5>
<p>– at this point the reconciliation is done. Before this time, each subsidiary will double check that its appropriate payables and receivables correspond with what its partner subsidiaries have claimed. This dispute process happens between the presentment date and the cut-off date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>FX settlement date</h5>
<p>– when the central treasury settles the FX on behalf of all of the subsidiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Settlement date</h5>
<p>– when the subsidiaries either receive or pay their money.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two dates here are the most important in the process. When implementing a multilateral netting process, the treasurer needs to educate the subsidiaries on how to get the inter-company payables and receivables reconciled into the netting centre. By pulling some reports the treasurer can demonstrate exactly what they are expecting to receive from the subsidiary and how the dispute process should function.</p>
<p>Being able to pull out accurate information by a certain date is the main challenge of setting up a multilateral netting process. Without a netting centre, a corporate will typically have standard terms of trade. The company’s payable terms may be six to eight weeks in terms of invoices, but internally the treasurer may decide to go to a four-week settlement, always on a particular date. This gives the treasurer control over the internal settlement process. Rather than being on floating terms, everything goes into the netting session on a monthly basis. A netting centre brings more discipline to this process, and allows the treasury to get a better FX rate, less spread and better risk management around currency exposure.</p>
<h4 id=""benefits"">Benefits</h4>
<p>The benefits of multilateral netting mean it deserves consideration by all corporates. If an organisation does a lot of inter-company business, there is no reason why it should not be doing multilateral netting today. The process itself is all about cash flows. Each subsidiary in the netting centre knows when it is going to get paid for any inter-company invoices it has issued. Subsidiaries may have to pay their invoices earlier, but they know exactly which day they will receive cash on the invoices that they are expecting. This brings stability to the timing of cash flows within the organisation.</p>
<p>The netting off of transaction costs means that instead of having around 800 inter-company transactions between subsidiaries, treasury can reduce this considerably. Now each subsidiary just has one payment or receipt. If it costs $10 to make a payment, and the number of payments can be reduced from 800 down to 60, this is obviously a considerable saving for the organisation.</p>
<p>Another benefit of multilateral netting comes from the concentration of payments and receipts. The central treasury can control this process, meaning it can choose to have one bank to do its FX with. Treasurers can reduce the number of banks that they are exposed to from a settlement perspective. Savings are also available on the FX spread. The greater the number and size of transactions the corporate puts through, the greater the potential for cost savings.</p>
<p>Things are also very much simplified from the subsidiary perspective. They no longer have to decide which currencies they need to buy, instead paying and receiving in a single currency. This offers a potential head count cost reduction for the company, as there is no longer a requirement for staff to understand all payments in different currencies. The added discipline of running a netting centre means that internal payments are all received on time. It also gives the treasurer a good forecast capability over internal receivables, allowing them to know what is coming in and when.</p>
<blockquote>

Subsidiaries may have to pay their invoices earlier, but they know exactly which day they will receive cash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ancillary benefit of multilateral netting is found in hedging. When the treasurer is looking for dates to hedge their FX exposures to, if they have a multilateral netting solution they will know that it is typically the 20<sup>th</sup> of every month that their netting happens, for example. Therefore they know the specific date that they are exposed to. This allows treasury to hedge very efficiently and effectively as it reduces timing gaps in their hedging programme.</p>
<p>There are also benefits in terms of trade. As already mentioned, multilateral netting provides a forecastable and accurate set of cash flows in and out of the business. This means that terms of trade could be considerably shorter, as they are not spread out over a time period. All parties involved in a trade know that an invoice received by a certain date will be settled by the relevant date.</p>
<p>The benefits to the dispute process are similar to this, as the multilateral netting process sets up a system that records disputes within the organisation efficiently and effectively. The netting centre becomes the repository for dispute management. The treasurer can then use that to make sure that AP and AR balance.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Japan has been the first major economy to blink in the game of currency valuation. Due to new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive monetary policy, such as a higher 2% target for Japanese inflation, the yen (JPY) has experienced a 20% fall since November. The depreciation has also been a primary driver of the longest weekly run of gains for the Nikkei index since 1959, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>The action is clearly a calculated attempt to wrench Japan out of its 20-year plus stagnation pattern. The idea is that as the JPY weakens, Japanese exporters will become more competitive at the expense of other Asian exporters. A weak currency also increases the cost of imports, thus making domestic producers more competitive in the national economy, again driving growth. (However, the negative side is that it drives up the costs of imports, for example oil, and runs the risk of encouraging inflation.)</p>
<p>This has fuelled fear of a new round of ‘currency wars’, as other countries respond in kind and simultaneously weaken their own currencies in order to stay competitive. The other G7 nations – the US, UK, Canada, Italy, Germany and France – were quick to condemn, using economic policy to target exchange rates; however, the G20 meeting in Moscow, following close after the G7 statement, only called for a “commitment to refrain from competitive devaluations” and stated that “monetary policy would be directed only at price stability and growth”.</p>
<p>Japan responded by leaving the door open for outright purchases of foreign bonds to weaken the JPY further, a move that could put it on a collision course with the US and Europe.</p>
<h3 id=""fx-volatility-possible-rise-in-2013"">FX volatility: possible rise in 2013?</h3>
<p>In 2012 FX volatility – both on an implied and actual level – had fallen back from the elevated levels created in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2007/8, which had affected even ‘safe’ currencies such as the US dollar (USD), the euro (EUR) and sterling (GBP). For example, one-year implied volatility for the EUR versus the USD slipped below 9% on 20<sup>th</sup> November, the lowest since February 2008. On the same day, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s G7 Volatility Index declined to the lowest since 2007.</p>
<p>A low volatility environment persisted in spite of the fact that many macroeconomic risks, such as the Eurozone crisis, the US debt crisis and the central bank’s unconventional monetary interventions, remained to a large extent unresolved. This puzzled many industry analysts over the course of the year.</p>
<p>However, it was the knock-on effect of these unconventional activities – whether direct, such as the active suppression of volatility in the case of the Swiss franc (CHF), or indirect, such as keeping the interest rates low – which helped to dampen volatility, effectively sinking the carry trade. Carry trade is the practice of obtaining funds in a country with low borrowing costs and investing in those nations with higher interest rates. According to Kevin Lester, Director of Risk Management and Treasury Services at Validus Risk Management: “killing off the carry trade effectively kills off a lot of market activity and, in turn, volatility.”</p>
<p>In addition, Lester believes that a retreat in corporate hedging programmes contributed to a low volatility environment. This pull-back happened for a variety of reasons. “One reason is that the global macro uncertainty made corporate’s cash flow forecasting much less certain and therefore made them more unwilling to hedge,” he explains. “In addition, the cost of hedging is going up with new Basel III regime coming in. As we all know, as the cost goes up, the incentive to do it goes down. These factors, among others, came together last year to bring volatility right back down to – and in some cases below – the long-term average.”</p>
<p>Although much of the FX fluctuation seen early in 2013 has been a by-product of JPY developments, it can also be seen as a result of a resurgence in the carry trade, which had its best start to the year since 2007. “If we see – and that is a big if – a return of carry trade activity by the speculative side of the market, then that will be a catalyst for volatility,” Lester says.</p>
<p>Another reason why the FX market is experiencing increased volatility is because of uncertainties surrounding the end game of unconventional central bank actions. “We knew this was coming from the day that quantitative easing (QE) was initiated, but it can take a long time to play out,” says Lester. He highlights Financier and Philanthropist George Soros’ statement at Davos indicating that interest rates will spike this year on the back of inflation. “Even though most people wouldn’t necessarily agree that it will happen this year, it is a sign that people are starting to factor in what the effects of unwinding QE will be and how we can put the genie back in the bottle, so to speak. That will be a source of volatility in the FX market without a doubt.”</p>
<p>A Financial Risk Manager at a large cruise liner company, who asked not to be named, agrees with Lester’s general assessment of the state-of-play. “I think that volatility will increase this year due to the likelihood of government action – no one knows what to expect, so government announcements and central bank actions cause a great deal of activity in the FX market,” she says.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-tools-for-quantifying-fx-risk"">Treasury tools for quantifying FX risk</h3>
<p>When measuring and predicting FX risk, the more advanced treasury group usually employs value-at-risk (VaR) and/or cash-flow-at-risk (CFaR); some even use Monte Carlo simulation to quantify their risk. For non-financial corporates, CFaR is the more appropriate tool, according to Rey Sermonia, ex-Treasurer turned Treasury Advisor, for it gives a probability distribution or range of values of a company’s operating cash flow over a specific time horizon, based on information available today. VaR, on the other hand, focuses on asset values and is usually used for shorter time horizons, such as a day or a week.</p>
<p>The Financial Risk Manager’s approach to assessing FX risk is to look at exposures to each currency and historical and implied volatility to see what the company’s range of outcomes could be from FX revenues/expenses and commitments. She also tries to assess whether the company’s exposure to currencies has any natural offsets (for example fuel) before implementing any hedging. But she admits that there are some disadvantages to using these inputs. “There is no guarantee that historical relationships will continue to hold, nor is there any guarantee that FX will be within its implied range, so we could be relying on information that will bear no resemblance to what actually happens,” she explains.</p>
<p>This is an important point to make, particularly at a time when many are expecting volatility to return to the market. According to Validus’ Lester, treasurers need to be careful about relying too heavily on probabilistic analysis tools because a bias can be “baked” into the analysis and they need to be cognisant of this. “When using these tools treasurers will plug in a volatility number, which would be a relatively low number according to 2012’s market conditions. As a result, treasurers will see their risk reducing and also the value of hedging coming down – but in reality that is a dangerous mistake. It highlights a big flaw in this type of risk analysis tool, which is plugging in a constant for volatility – which is anything but constant.”</p>
<p>Sermonia believes that one could also use the Monte Carlo method. “If I were doing it today, I would use Monte Carlo simulation,” he says. “Monte Carlo is a computerised mathematical technique using algorithms which gives you a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities that they will occur for any choice of action, for example what happens if you hedge versus what happens if you don’t.”</p>
<h3 id=""fundamentals-making-the-hedging-call"">Fundamentals: making the hedging call</h3>
<p>Most treasurers’ gut reaction is that hedging is a good thing, but nothing can be a good thing all of the time. For example, Honda Motor Co. Ltd was one Japanese company caught out by the recent JPY depreciation. According to Reuters, Honda’s CFO Fumihiko Ike reported that the company hedged currency trades three month out (a common practice among Japanese exporters) which meant its fourth quarter sales were booked at JPY levels near a record high.</p>
<p>But how does a treasurer know when – or if – to hedge? Sermonia believes that treasurers shouldn’t be hedging if they can’t identify where the value is coming from. Jonathan Binke, Global Head of FX Products at SuperDerivatives, adds that a company also needs to be clear as to its risk appetite and target levels. “You also need to have an informed opinion about your expectations for the future path of each market you are exposed to. In light of the answers to these questions, you can start to consider the relevant pros and cons of each strategy, and then focus on those strategies that best meet both your targets and expectations for the future.”</p>
<p>The Financial Risk Manager agrees that determining risk tolerance, balanced against liquidity constraints, will help to determine which products to use, as well as how much exposure to hedge.</p>
<p>“Treasury needs to understand the company’s risk tolerance, tolerance for earnings volatility, and whether paying option premiums would be considered, and then determine whether hedging should be done to take some risk off the table.”</p>
<p>Lester identifies three fundamental questions that will help in determining whether hedging is in the company’s best interest:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does FX hedging relate to the internal business? For example, if the business has a lot of pricing capacity and capability, it might not need to hedge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the objective of hedging? Is the company trying to stabilise cash flows, prevent a violation of a lending covenant or improve ability to forecast future cash flows?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is the FX hedging programme integrated with the underlying business?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“Many companies miss the third point,” says Lester. “It is useful to step back and ask where exposures come from – and if they are managed differently, what is the knock on effect to business? It is all about integrating risk management with the underlying commercial objectives of the business.”</p>
<p>Returning to his earlier point, Lester emphasises that low volatility is a dangerous indicator as to whether to hedge or not. “When volatility, and therefore the cost of hedging, is coming down, then it makes sense to hedge more – but intuitively we take the opposite stance based on the expectation that low volatility will continue into the future. But history tells us that a period of calm is followed by a period of volatility. Currently volatility is low and hedging is quite affordable, so all things equal you should be hedging more.”</p>
<p>Robert Wade, Head of Corporate Electronic FX Sales at Deutsche Bank, agrees. “Our view would be that treasurers should use this opportunity, when it is more cost efficient to hedge, to better position their company for the extreme events.”</p>
<p>The Financial Risk Manager adds: “there is no guarantee that FX rates will mean-revert, so not hedging in anticipation of a particular rate returning to more of a historical norm is just increasing exposure. Having said that, I don’t think that companies should rush to hedge when rates get away from them. A measured approach to hedging, with the opportunity to increase hedging if rates become more attractive, is prudent.”</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""the-gold-ticket"">The gold ticket</h3>
<p><em>A recent report from the World Gold Council promotes the use of gold as a valuable option in hedging currency risk in emerging markets.</em></p>
<p>According to the World Gold Council’s report, entitled ‘Gold and currencies: hedging foreign exchange risk’, gold is a much overlooked yet valuable option for hedging FX risk in emerging market currencies. Although gold is not a substitute for an FX hedging programme, it can supplement the strategy in a positive way.</p>
<p>The report argues that there are certain things that work in gold’s favour as part of a hedging strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gold has a negative correlation to developed market currencies, in particular the US dollar, but also applies to other currencies such as sterling and euro, especially during periods of systemic risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is positively correlated to emerging markets growth cycle, as a significant demand comes from emerging markets. For example, India and China have made up about 50% of the world’s demand over the past few years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gold has a lower cost of borrowing than emerging market currencies. To put up a position in India rupee, Brazilian real or Russian rouble would mean borrowing at the country’s (sometimes offshore) interest rate, which is what makes hedges expensive. If a company included a gold overlay, it could borrow cash directly at its local cost of borrowing, which is currently extremely low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It offers tail risk protection. Therefore, if there is a systemic risk within the financial system that creates a flight to quality, then gold is going to benefit. In this way it can be used to hedge away a tail event within an FX exposure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“One thing that stands out – and will always be present – is that gold offers tail-risk protection to investors with or without foreign currency exposure,” says Juan Carlos Artigas, Global Head of Investment Research at the World Gold Council. “But the other three factors also need to be present for gold to be useful as an emerging market currency hedging strategy.”</p>
<h5 id=""key-findings-of-the-report-include"">Key findings of the report include:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Over eight periods of crisis conditions examined in the report, including gold in currency hedging strategies in an emerging market portfolio offered cumulative outperformance of 2.4% above an un-hedged portfolio and over 1% above a currency-hedged portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding a gold overlay to emerging market assets reduced portfolio peak-to-trough declines over the past decade, on average, to 9.2% from a 12.5% decline in currency-hedged portfolios and a 13.1% decline in unhedged portfolios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average costs of hedging a basket of emerging market currencies is currently over 4% compared to less than 50 basis points on borrowing costs for a gold overlay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Over the past few years, gold has become more widely accepted as a source of collateral and a high quality liquid asset,” says Artigas. “Therefore, more corporates are coming to understand the value of gold as one tool in their arsenal to hedge currency risk.” He believes that it is first a matter of “awareness, knowledge and implementation” before it becomes widespread practice among corporates.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""what-is-a-kpi"">What is a KPI?</h3>
<p>A key performance indicator (KPI) is a metric used by organisations to gauge or compare performance in terms of meeting strategic and operational goals. There are two main approaches organisations use for measuring performance – qualitative and quantitative.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Quantitative KPIs are typically based upon financial targets – ie costs as a percentage of total revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualitative KPIs can alternatively be used as a complimentary measure of non-quantitative targets, such as employee satisfaction. These are often measured using more subjective methods such as surveys or questionnaires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some types of organisation are likely to reap more benefits from KPIs than others. For large global organisations incremental improvements in efficiency are likely to have a much greater impact than smaller businesses. But this does not mean that the treasury department of smaller organisations will not benefit at all from frequent performance measurement and improving upon processes.</p>
<p>Choosing which aspects of the department’s performance to measure can itself be a complicated task. KPIs will often vary considerably between treasuries, reflecting differences in policies and objectives. In some organisations there may be a greater focus on external performance – the degree of success in its dealings with external entities. In other organisations there may be a greater emphasis upon internal performance metrics, such as transaction rates, and compliance with set limits.</p>
<p>The table above shows a number of KPIs currently being used to measure treasury performance, in order of their perceived importance. According to Treasury Today’s 2012 European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study, 55% of respondents used cash visibility as their prime KPI to measure overall treasury efficiency, with a further 45% monitoring cash pooling structures.</p>

<h3 id=""why-measure-treasury-performance"">Why measure treasury performance?</h3>
<p>Treasurers are not salesmen; their performance cannot always be measured in tangible achievements. Furthermore, treasurers have many demands placed on them at the present time – managing dwindling liquidity, new regulations in the form of Basel III and Dodd-Frank, and also the migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). With time resources so constrained, why should a treasurer bother making the effort to measure performance? Do they not have more important things to do than calculate the value of some abstract indicator?</p>
<p>Below we have outlined some of the reasons why, to the contrary, measuring treasury performance is very important:

<ul>
<li>
<h5>Control</h5>
<p>Treasury KPIs can be a useful method for exerting control over treasury operations. By regularly assessing the various treasury metrics, management can be assured that all team members are operating as effectively as possible and, equally, any areas of concern will also be highlighted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Risk awareness and mitigation</h5>
<p>The treasury function has assumed increasing responsibility for the management of financial risks in recent years. Keeping a close check on risk management KPIs can help the treasurer understand where the company’s main exposures reside and evaluate hedging effectiveness.</p></li>
<li>
<h5>Illustrating value</h5>
<p>In the past, the treasury departments have sometimes had difficulty demonstrating the value they contribute to the organisation. As a consequence, there has sometimes been a downward pressure on resources. By regularly collecting KPI data, treasurers can overcome these doubts, providing senior management with conclusive evidence of the contribution made by treasury to the organisations bottom line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Improving treasury processes</h5>
<p>KPIs are a great tool for evaluating the efficiency of specific treasury processes. Once treasurers have a snapshot of all the various inputs and outputs of a process, then they can consider ways in which the process can be altered and, if necessary, improved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The role of treasury has changed significantly in the past three or four years. Now it is seen as a very strategic unit within an organisation. There is a lot more emphasis placed within the treasury on helping the business achieve its overall objectives and helping with the strategic direction that the corporate wishes to take.</p>
<p><cite>Jiten Arora, Global Head of Sales, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""are-kpis-applicable-to-treasury"">Are KPIs applicable to treasury?</h3>
<p>Treasury has always been regarded as a cost centre within a corporate – that is a department which adds to operational cost but contributes only indirectly to the bottom line. But a consequence of this was that treasurers often found themselves on the margins of corporations, away from the attention of senior management, and frequently under pressure to minimise expenses and manage with increasingly diminishing resources. In such a setting, measuring treasury performance made little sense – KPIs were far more common in sales departments, where measuring achievement is, for obvious reasons, far more straightforward.</p>
<p>In addition, corporate treasury is largely perceived to be a ‘black box’ within an organisation – isolated from the rest of the business and, for the most part, impenetrable. Few outside of treasury know which KPIs to assign to them.</p>
<p>But this perception as to the usefulness of KPIs for treasury was to be swept away as events began to unfold in 2008. In the post-crisis setting, treasury tasks which before were considered to be routine, such as cash and risk management, quickly became recognised to be of critical importance to the profitability and even survival of a corporation. Treasury is no longer viewed as a functional unit within a corporation that simply ensured that the basics were competently administrated. It has been transformed into a centre of greater strategic importance, more closely integrated into the core business and this provided much more scope for the integration of sophisticated KPIs reflecting the businesses overall strategic objectives.</p>
<p>“The role of treasury has changed significantly in the past three or four years,” says Jiten Arora, Global Head of Sales, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered. “Now it is seen as a very strategic unit within an organisation. There is a lot more emphasis placed within the treasury on helping the business achieve its overall objectives and helping with the strategic direction that the corporate wishes to take.”</p>
<p>In this context, Arora believes that the measurement of treasury performance has become increasingly vital. An optimally functioning treasury, he says, can be a big advantage to companies as they attempt to navigate through an increasingly testing economic climate. “In this changing environment we absolutely think that organisations should measure treasury performance. Probably the key component for treasury performance is working capital. If you look at how trade is becoming more expensive and banks’ balance sheets are shrinking with Basel III, it is important that corporates look at their long-term aspirations and derive a lot more from their working capital.”</p>
<p>Risk management KPIs are also very important, according to Arora. As companies grow and begin to move into new markets, particularly in emerging markets, they will be taking on more risk than before when operating in more established economies. “New suppliers, new buyers and being in heavily regulated environments in which they are facing issues such as trapped liquidity and heightened FX risk – all these are critical parameters which make it important for treasuries to look at their performance with respect to risk management.”</p>
<p>The most obvious metrics for risk management are hedging effectiveness and funding costs. But Arora says that another important dimension of risk that needs to be considered is found in the supply chain. This is particularly true for companies in the process of expanding and taking on new suppliers and buyers. But how can organisations measure the level of risk that they are taking on from new counterparties? By analysing their cash to conversion ratio across the supply chain, he says. “Corporates ought to be looking at new suppliers and buyers that they have been taking on, and measuring the counterparty risk. Are they making sure that they partner with banks that are able to mitigate some of those risks that come with the new business partners?”</p>
<h3 id=""selecting-the-right-kpis"">Selecting the right KPIs</h3>
<p>In recent years, performance measurement has become increasingly integrated into the treasurer’s day-to-day workflows. However, a consensus on which KPIs are most helpful or indeed relevant is still some way off within the treasury community. Martin Bellin, CEO of BELLIN, a German treasury management system (TMS) provider, believes there are several reasons why measuring treasury performance remains problematic for some organisations. “When you talk about KPIs, you are talking about something that you can achieve, something you can reach,” he says. “When you work within a sales department, for example, you have to perform to a certain level and that is measured by KPIs – so the number of new contracts won and the number of deals signed.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treasury is often hidden in the background, sometimes operating out of view – and that has to change. If it is to change then performance indicators are definitely something which can help to demonstrate to the management the work which treasury is doing, and how the department is contributing their power and knowledge to the company’s bottom line.</p>
<p><cite>Martin Bellin, CEO of Bellin</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“But treasury is different. The treasury department remains a cost centre or, as some see it, a service centre. So the treasury’s performance is very often driven by third-party requirements. Of course, it is important to define targets, but in the context of a cost centre I think that the term ‘KPI’ can be a little misleading.”</p>
<p>Measuring performance is important for treasuries, he acknowledges, as it is for other departments. It is just that the department’s unique role within a corporation demands that performance be measured differently than it is in other areas of the company. And getting this right, he says, can be very difficult – particularly when the setting of targets is undertaken exclusively by senior management without the involvement of treasurers themselves.</p>
<p>“It really depends who defines the performance indicator,” he explains. “They are normally set by senior management, but it is often the case that senior management is not as concerned about the detail of treasury operations as they should be – either they do not understand or are simply not interested.”</p>
<p>“However, when KPIs are set it is critical to have management on board. When you ask a CEO of a large company about their sales division, they will be able to tell you what they expect should be delivered. For KPIs to be effective, management needs to reach that same level of understanding with treasury. But if the treasury department cannot get a clear answer, then what is the point of KPIs?”</p>
<p>But having the right targets in place can certainly be beneficial for treasurers. Beyond providing treasurers with a means to review and benchmark their performance against their industry peers, KPIs are also useful for illustrating the value of the services provided to the rest of the business. In the past, Bellin adds, treasuries have sometimes been under resourced as a result of their failure to effectively demonstrate their value to the organisation. KPIs, Bellin believes, may be just the solution.</p>
<p>“Treasury is often hidden in the background, sometimes operating out of view – and that has to change. If it is to change then performance indicators are definitely something which can help to demonstrate to the management the work which treasury is doing, and how the department is contributing their power and knowledge to the company’s bottom line.”</p></p></div>

<p>Traditionally, providing a choice of currencies to clients has proven to be problematic for retailers. Some of the problems faced are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having numerous currency collection accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deciding on the FX rate to price the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying to buy the currency at that FX rate or better to ensure there are no FX losses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coping with aggregating the FX hedging for high volumes of small value transactions in different currencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing FX risk is often time consuming and resource intensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The traditional Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) model doesn’t allow retailers to price their goods in foreign currency and also doesn’t give them the same level of control over their FX margins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to many of these challenges, Barclays has developed its BARX FXPay proposition, an automated FX solution that can help clients overcome these problems when they expand internationally, without incurring additional operational expense and risk.</p>

<p>“Leveraging Barclays’ leading edge BARX engine to price FX rates, BARX FXPay is perfectly suited for businesses receiving or making high volume, small value payments from a variety of countries and customers including online retailers, travel companies and payment service providers,” says Colin Digby, Director – Foreign Exchange, Barclays Capital.</p>
<p>“The product enables clients to receive competitive FX rates automatically, which they can use to price goods and services in multiple currencies. These FX rates can be fixed for a pre-defined period; typically a given intra day time frame or in some cases multiple business days. The agreed rates can be based on market, benchmarked or published rates and a conversion only takes place when a sale is made. Through BARX FXPay, the client also automates the subsequent settlement of risk throughout the day, without having to intervene manually.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>By using BARX FXPay rather than leaving FX conversions for small value transactions to banks or credit card companies, clients can directly manage their FX pricing and may be able to retain additional FX margin. Today, often the bank or credit card company receives this margin and the retailer does not really benefit. “Online retailers can take control of how they price their products and services through any additional agreed FX margin added to their FX rates. Providing an additional and valuable source of extra income, which directly improves their bottom line,” notes Digby.</p>
<h3 id=""supporting-international-expansion"">Supporting international expansion</h3>
<p>In addition to these risk management and revenue benefits, BARX FXPay can play a broader role in helping businesses to grow. While the UK boasts an increasingly sophisticated online retail and services market, for example, other countries are still building momentum. This means that there are significant opportunities to gain market share by looking to expand internationally. According to Digby, BARX FXPay can help corporates to expand their international business in different ways:</p>
<p>“Take a UK domestic online client. They may be selling their product in sterling and quite often they won’t have seriously considered the possibility of selling in euros, or US dollars, because they would have to physically deliver the product to that market and equally they would also have to work out an efficient foreign currency collection mechanism. But this is not always a major problem. A number of clients are having success introducing extra currencies for domestic purchases. For example, there may be euro or dollar cardholders living or staying in the UK who want to pay in those currencies, as they have those currencies for whatever reason.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Secondly, and on a more truly international scale, Digby is seeing a number of UK clients who have been successful domestically are now looking to expand into mainland Europe and the Nordic area, for example. “So clients need to make sure that they can manage the associated financial flows. If you look at the card services that Barclays offers; the FX business, including BARX FXPay; the corporate banking, payment and trade services and so on, Barclays can help with the whole financial supply chain and ease the client’s international expansion concerns in a holistic way. Alternatively we can simply plug in BARX FXPay where clients are already using a different partner for their card acquiring or corporate banking.”</p>

<br/>
<p class=""introduction"">In this interview we examine the rationale behind BARX FXPay and how it can help corporates to manage risk and improve efficiency in their day-to-day treasury management.</p>
<h5 id=""how-was-barx-fxpay-developed"">How was BARX FXPay developed?</h5>
<p>As a bank, we have a number of business partners internally who require the automated provision of FX rates. Some of them also needed the ability to hold rates open for periods of time, whether that be 24 or 48 hours, or perhaps just 30 minutes. We then needed to provide the ability for them to be able to aggregate their position and offload their risk through an automated process.</p>
<p>It was only a short step and seemed a natural progression to make this available to our corporate clients, some of whom had very similar requirements. As a result BARX FXPay is well suited to those businesses that require FX rates for varying timeframes and have a high volume of small value transactions, who wish to be able to price their products and services in different currencies.</p>
<h5 id=""aside-from-international-expansion-possibilities-can-you-highlight-some-of-the-key-value-adds-that-barx-fxpay-offers-to-clients"">Aside from international expansion possibilities, can you highlight some of the key value-adds that BARX FXPay offers to clients?</h5>
<p>One of the key areas would be the cost and risk management benefits for clients that are provided through automation of the process. Offering a known rate up front means clients do not have to take on FX exposure. Alternatively, the service can be set up to trade FX positions that arise throughout the day at the prevailing rates, which wouldn’t normally be possible without a lot of manual work and as a result the client can achieve near to the average rate of the day. Since the system takes care of all of this, administration costs are reduced and treasury management processes are simplified.</p>
<p>Another key value-add is that clients using the product can capture FX margins that were previously trapped in the payment chain, or perhaps the credit card process. This enables clients to take control of the FX margins and optimise the revenue potential.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>The ability to auto-manage the reversals and refunds process through BARX FXPay can also be a significant benefit.</blockquote>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h5 id=""what-makes-barx-fxpay-unique"">What makes BARX FXPay unique?</h5>
<p>The ability to auto-manage the reversals and refunds process through BARX FXPay can also be a significant benefit. Reapplying the original FX rate for the client on their refund ensures that the customer experience remains positive, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>In essence, BARX FXPay is focused on improving our clients’ experience and their customers’ experience in terms of being able to price their goods and services in multiple currencies, being able to collect revenues efficiently and profitably, whilst maintaining a close eye on the risk associated with those flows.</p>
<h5 id=""why-is-barclays-best-placed-to-offer-this-service"">Why is Barclays best placed to offer this service?</h5>
<p>BARX is Barclays’ award-winning multi-asset class online trading platform and currently holds the award, ‘Best Overall Platform’ from Profit &amp; Loss Digital FX Awards, for the second year running.

<h3 id=""the-technical-set-up"">The technical set-up</h3>
<p>Operating via a host-to-host connection, BARX FXPay clients can feed in a simple CSV text file or an XML file, to suit their business set-up and requirements. “The implementation process is typically smooth and straightforward, as clients with online businesses are often well versed and highly geared towards working with technology and often have in-house IT teams,” says Digby.</p>
<p>“So, from a systems point of view it can be quite a quick and painless implementation process. We worked with a client recently that took less than a fortnight to be up and running. That included reviewing and agreeing the format, understanding the communication protocol and carrying out the testing before going live.”</p>
<h3 id=""more-than-meets-the-eye"">More than meets the eye</h3>
<p>For Digby, one of the most important additional features of BARX FXPay is the reporting functionality. “As a client’s flows come through in various currencies and as we execute the relevant trades throughout the day, we send confirmation files back to the client. This means that every single line item can be reported, together with the exchange rate that was used when the deal was executed.”</p>
<p>“That is quite a powerful tool as that can be fed straight back into the corporate’s ERP systems or accounting systems for reconciliation purposes.” As such, reconciliation is not delayed for days or weeks – shortly after the transaction has been made, the item can be automatically reconciled.</p>
<p>And as Digby concludes, “With BARX FXPay intelligently transacting foreign exchange on your behalf, you can focus on what’s really important – running and expanding your business.”</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Over the last three months we have examined the ways in which foreign exchange risk arises. In this article we show how treasurers can use currency swaps to manage their company’s exposure to foreign exchange risk. We illustrate how a typical currency swap works and identify some of the legal issues surrounding their use. The article concludes with an analysis of the costs and benefits of using currency swaps to manage interest rate risk.</em></p>
<h3 id=""foreign-exchange-risk-management"">Foreign exchange risk management</h3>
<p>In Treasury Today May 2002, we identified the types of foreign exchange risk that a company might be exposed to – transaction, translation and economic risk. The treasurer will have a range of alternative actions available to manage any foreign exchange exposure, but the decision taken must be in keeping with the board’s policy on acceptable risk. This policy should form part of the company’s treasury policy and will include a statement of whether trading in derivatives is allowed.</p>
<p>When faced with a foreign exchange exposure, a company has three broad choices on the course of action it can take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Do nothing.</h5>
<p>If the company is happy with the level of exposure, it may decide to do nothing to actively manage it. For relatively small exposures, this is often prudent as proactive action will impose a cost on the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Hedge naturally.</h5>
<p>For example, an exposure to make repayments on a foreign currency loan might be used to offset future receivables in that currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Take action to manage the exposure.</h5>
<p>There are a number of methods available to hedge a foreign exchange exposure for which no natural hedge is available. The suitability of each method depends on the nature of the exposure (how it arose and the length of the exposure) and the risk appetite of the company.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""what-is-a-currency-swap"">What is a currency swap?</h3>
<p>A currency swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange a series of cash flows denominated in one currency for those denominated in another for a predetermined period of time. This involves the swap of the currency amounts for an agreed period and payments of interest during that period.</p>
<p>Unlike an interest rate swap, a currency swap requires the actual exchange of the two principal currency amounts on which the sets of cash flows are based. An exchange takes place at the beginning of the arrangement and at maturity the amounts are swapped back. This actual exchange of principal is an important feature of a currency swap because, although the two amounts exchanged at the beginning of the agreement may be of equivalent value in the market, it is unlikely (as a result of movements in the exchange rate) that this will be the case at maturity. This means there is a residual counterparty risk that remains after the currency swap has been agreed.</p>
<h3 id=""the-uses-for-a-currency-swap"">The uses for a currency swap</h3>
<p>Currency swaps originated partly as a means for UK companies to avoid exchange controls in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite the abolition of exchange controls, currency swaps are still popular instruments for hedging foreign exchange exposures. They are typically used by companies needing to hedge a long-term liability that is denominated in a currency other than their main operating currency. Because an exchange of principal is part of the currency swap, the transaction will be recorded on both parties’ balance sheets. It is an effective way to hedge a currency exposure but not an effective way to trade speculatively.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking there are three main reasons for entering into a currency swap:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>To hedge a long-term borrowing commitment in a foreign currency.</h5>
<p>In order to expand into foreign markets, companies will often try to hedge any foreign exchange exposures naturally. However, this is not always possible. For example, a company may raise funds to build a production plant in Poland. In order to pay the cost of building the plant in zlotys, it raises the original capital in zlotys. However, the output from that plant is sold all over Europe and only a small proportion of the receipts are denominated in zlotys. The company may decide to swap its borrowing from zlotys into say euros so that it can meet its repayment requirements using the revenue streams provided from the sale of the plant’s output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>To access cheaper capital markets.</h5>
<p>Unlike 1., it may also be cheaper to access a capital market for funds even though the company may not have a requirement for funding in that currency. For example, there are often circumstances in which multinational companies can raise funds most efficiently in the US capital markets, even when the funding requirement has arisen from a project in Europe. There can be a number of reasons for this ranging from lower market rates through to the fact that a US entity may enjoy a better credit rating than its European subsidiary. However this may arise, a company may decide to raise funds in one currency before swapping it into another. The cost of the currency swap and any residual foreign exchange risk should be considered as part of the cost of tapping a foreign capital market. The point is that the overall cost will be lower than if the company raised funds in the swapped currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>To bypass remaining exchange controls.</h5>
<p>Where exchange controls do remain, currency swaps are a useful tool to enable funds to be raised without breaching the currency restrictions that are in place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""types-of-currency-swaps"">Types of currency swaps</h3>
<p>There are three main types of currency swaps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Fixed/fixed.</h5>
<p>A fixed/fixed currency swap involves the exchange of fixed cash flows in one currency for fixed cash flows in another currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Fixed/floating.</h5>
<p>A fixed/floating currency swap, also known as a cross-currency swap, results in the exchange of fixed cash flows in one currency for cash flows based on a floating interest rate in another currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Floating/floating.</h5>
<p>A floating/floating currency swap, referred to as a currency basis swap, exchanges cash flows in two currencies, where both sets of cash flows are determined by variable interest rates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the type of currency swap employed fits with the overall debt management policy of the company.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">An illustration of a currency swap</h2>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>A corporate would usually enter into a currency swap with a bank as its counter-party. Although the type of currency swap can vary, the principle of the transaction is the same for each type. To illustrate how a currency swap works, consider the following example:</p>
<p>A UK company needs to borrow £50m for three years to build a new factory. With market interest rates lower in the US, it finds it cheaper to raise $75m in the US and then swap into sterling. This swap will allow the company to service the interest payments on the loan in sterling, before swapping the principal back so that it can be repaid at the maturity of the loan in three years time.</p>
<p>There are three key stages to the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Initial change of principal.</h5>
<p>Having raised the $75m in the US, the company needs tswap that into sterling. The company will exchange the $75m with a counterparty (usually a bank) at an agreed exchange rate. In our example, the exchange rate is £1=$1.50, such that the bank will provide £50m to the company in return for the $75m raised by the company in the US. The exchange rate will usually be determined from the spot rate between the two currencies, with the mid-point between the two rates being used. In most cases, this initial exchange of principal is on a physical basis, although sometimes it can be on a notional basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Ongoing payments of interest.</h5>
<p>As part of the agreement, the company will pay the counterparty bank regular interest payments in sterling and receive interest payments in USD to meet the interest payments to the original lenders. Whether the interest payments are referenced to a variable rate or whether they are fixed will depend on the conditions of the original loan. The detail of both parties’ responsibilities will be agreed before the initial exchange of the principal. This will include the precise nature of any reference rates as well as when and where both sets of payments must be made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Maturity and re-exchange of principal.</h5>
<p>On maturity, both parties will re-exchange the original principal amounts. In our example, the company will repay £50m to its counterparty in the currency swap and will receive $75m in return. This $75m is the principal that has to be repaid to the original lender(s) in the US.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that the amounts of principal that are re-exchanged at the maturity of the currency swap agreement are the same as those exchanged initially. There is no adjustment for movements in the exchange rate over the course of the agreement. As a result, the company has to recognise the three-year foreign exchange liability and the possibility that it could make a loss on the transaction.</p></div>
</div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""how-do-they-work"">How do they work?</h3>
<p>Currency swaps are available for any period of time between six months and twenty-five years. However, the associated currency risk means that most swaps are under seven years in duration.</p>
<p>Although there is usually an exchange of principal, the company is still legally responsible for making the interest payments to its lenders in the US. Any company entering into a currency swap agreement needs to be aware of the counter-party risk involved (the risk, in this case, that the counter-party will default on the swap agreement). If the counter-party did default, then the company would still have to meet the USD interest payments.</p>
<h3 id=""what-do-they-cost"">What do they cost?</h3>
<p>Except for an initial exchange of principal, there is no initial fee or premium when arranging a currency swap.</p>
<p>The cost of a swap depends on two key variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>The rate at which the principal will be exchanged.</h5>
<p>Where there is an initial exchange of principal, this will determine the exchange at maturity. Where there is no initial exchange of principal, the rate should be fixed when arranging the swap. This rate is usually the prevailing spot rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The interest rates for the swaps will include a profit margin.</h5>
<p>This will include whether the rates will be fixed or floating. If the rate is floating, then this will include the reference rate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although one party is likely to make a loss on the foreign exchange transaction, the agreement should be structured so that both parties can gain from it. In our example above, the company will want to ensure that the sterling repayments as a result of the swap agreement are lower than those repayments would have been if the company borrowed in sterling (rather than USD). The bank will benefit because it will be able to access the sterling funding at a lower rate than the company and will include a profit margin in the interest rate it receives. In addition, the bank will be able to lend out the USD at a higher rate of interest than it has to make the repayments.</p>
<h3 id=""legal-issues"">Legal issues</h3>
<p>Before a company can agree a swap with a counter-party bank for the first time, it will need to sign documentation making the agreement legally binding. Such an agreement will usually be based on the ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) master agreements. These are standardised and are now used by most of the international banks. This makes it easier for companies to negotiate legal agreements with a range of counter-party banks. However, the detail of each agreement needs to be negotiated between the company and every counter-party bank, which can take some time.</p>
<h3 id=""advantages-of-a-currency-swap"">Advantages of a currency swap</h3>
<p>The main advantage of currency swaps is that they open up alternatives to a company needing to raise finance. They can be arranged for any period of time and for a wide range of currencies. Once a legal agreement is in place with a counter-party bank, individual currency swaps can be agreed at very short notice.</p>
<p>Currency swaps mean that companies are not forced to raise initial capital in the currency in which they have a requirement. There are two common benefits that arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, the company can raise funds in their domestic market, where their name recognition may allow them a beneficial rate, and then swap into the currency in which they have a requirement. This is particularly useful when a company is moving into a new market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
		Secondly, it allows a company to take advantage of lower interest rates and to access the more liquid capital markets. European companies have typically used currency swaps to take advantage of the deeper markets in the US.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currency swaps do not have to be arranged with the same bank that provided the original financing. However, for smaller companies, the relationship bank may be the only body prepared to provide the necessary credit lines.</p>
<p>Finally, depending on how they are structured, currency swaps will provide a degree of certainty for the company. As with interest rate swaps, currency swaps allow the company to arrange to make interest payments on either a fixed or floating basis.</p>
<h3 id=""disadvantages-of-a-currency-swap"">Disadvantages of a currency swap</h3>
<p>Despite these advantages, there are a number of points that should be considered prior to arranging a swap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>A legal agreement needs to be in place before the swap is agreed.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The credit of your counterparty bank needs to be considered.</h5>
<p>The risk taken is equal to the replacement cost of the absent interest rate stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Position risk.</h5>
<p>It is important to remember that a currency swap can be used to help manage interest rate exposure as well, usually via a cross-currency swap agreement. You should also consider the interest rate that you agree, particularly if you are fixing the rate. Bear in mind that a fixed interest rate may seem less attractive if the interest rate changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Currency swaps are less liquid than interest rate swaps.</h5>
<p>This is particularly true for less common currency pairs. This makes it more difficult to reverse an agreement if the underlying conditions change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>When a company wants to make a currency swap for a less common currency pair.</h5>
<p>This sometimes has to be arranged as two swaps. The first currency would be swapped into a reference currency (typically USD) and then into the second currency. In these cases, a third party may be required if the original currency pair is particularly unusual. In these circumstances, it is important to note the nature of all the counter-parties involved in the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Used correctly, a currency swap is a useful and flexible tool for the treasurer.</p></div>
