Press release: Fitch Ratings forecasts stability for global MMFs in 2020,"


<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> December 2019</strong> – Fitch Ratings forecasts broad stability for the global money market fund (MMF) sector and ratings in 2020, underpinned by funds' conservative credit, market and liquidity risk profiles.</p>

<p>Fitch-rated money funds tend to have high quality, diversified investments, appropriate liquidity relative to investor composition, proactive risk management by MMF managers and continued adherence to updated regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>“Sustained, severe outflows could pressure ratings, although Fitch believes funds will broadly see continued growth in 2020, notably among funds adopting environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies in response to emerging investor demand,” says Alexandra Kelly, Associate Director, Fitch Ratings.</p>
<p>US money fund assets under management (AUM) is likely to grow, with ESG-focused products capturing an increasing share of assets as investors place greater emphasis on responsible investing. The combination of relatively higher yields versus bank deposits and potential continued market volatility will likely spur steady demand for US MMFs in 2020. While the pace of growth may be slower in 2020, cash will likely continue to flow into the sector despite the Fed’s reversal in monetary policy.</p>
<p>In addition, repurchase agreements (repos) continue to dominate MMF portfolios, representing 32% of all outstanding money market securities as of Oct. 31, 2019. Fitch expects utilization of sponsored repo to continue to increase throughout 2020, especially considering that the number of sponsoring entities is likely to expand. Fitch-rated MMFs maintain limited exposure to any one repo counterparty.</p>
<p>Fitch anticipates European investor and fund attention to liquidity risk management will increase in 2020 when reporting on ESMA’s stress test guidelines takes effect. Weekly liquidity levels among Fitch-rated EMEA MMFs are overall sufficiently high. Based on a sample of 47 Fitch-rated MMFs’ liquidity levels at end-September 2019, 81% had sufficient liquidity to cover the redemption of their top two investor accounts, in line with the spirit of ESMA’s concentration stress test. For the 19% with weekly liquidity levels below the sum of their top two investor accounts, the top two accounts were typically either internal money or omnibus accounts consisting of multiple underlying investors, mitigating redemption risk.</p>
<p>“Fitch views a material disruption to money funds post a disruptive ‘no-deal’ Brexit as unlikely as most funds have been granted approval to temporarily continue operating and marketing in the UK if the passporting regime falls away abruptly,” said Alastair Sewell, Senior Director, Fitch Ratings.</p>
<p>Fitch expects the growth of Chinese MMFs to come under pressure in the short- to medium-term as a result of negative real yields, tight regulatory requirements and competition from certain wealth management products provided by banks. Total assets in Chinese MMFs declined to CNY7.1 trillion (USD1.0 trillion) by September 2019 from a peak of CNY8.9 trillion (USD1.3 trillion) in the second half of 2018.</p>
<p>“Recent stress at small regional banks in China highlights the credit vulnerability of these entities, and by extension, Chinese MMFs that invest in them. Thus far, the Chinese government has taken steps to moderate the effects on the broader financial system, but they may also seek to gradually weaken investors’ assumption of implicit state support and encourage greater differentiation of risk-pricing between financial institutions. These dynamics make it imperative for MMFs to choose their investments/counterparties selectively,” added Sewell.</p>

<p>UK investors are turning to traditional assets as a result of the political uncertainty currently facing the country, new research from <a href=""https://cityroadcomms.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fe1df0a893d2d3696686b888c&amp;id=202b24a4d3&amp;e=0e65298001"" target=""_blank"">Butterfield Mortgages Limited</a> (BML) has found.</p>
<p>The prime property mortgage provider surveyed 1,100 UK-based investors, all of whom have assets in excess of £10,000, excluding pensions, savings, SIPPs and properties they live in.</p>
<p>The research revealed the most common assets investors hold are stocks and shares (53%), property (41%) and bonds (30%). On the other end of the spectrum, classic cars (16%), cryptocurrencies (17%), art and forex (both 19%) ranked as the least popular.</p>
<p>Delving into the factors influencing their investment decisions, 61% believe traditional assets like property are best positioned to deliver stable and secure returns during this current period of political uncertainty. One in five (20%) property investors are planning to invest in more real estate in 2020.</p>
<p>When it comes to non-traditional asset classes, nearly two thirds (64%) of investors surveyed by BML do not think cryptocurrencies are a safe or reliable investment. A tenth (10%) of those who have invested in cryptocurrency plan to reduce their amount of investment in this asset in the new year.</p>
<p>Looking into the factors influencing their financial plans for 2020, 43% of investors said they have become more socially and environmentally conscious and this will influence their financial strategy in 2020.</p>
<p>Brexit is also playing on investors’ minds. Two fifths (42%) are holding off making any major investment decisions until Brexit has been resolved, though half (49%) are confident in the long-term performance of UK-based assets. This compares to 23% of investors who are looking to assets based outside the UK for their investments in 2020 because of Brexit.</p>
<p>Alpa Bhakta, CEO of <a href=""https://cityroadcomms.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fe1df0a893d2d3696686b888c&amp;id=1a3e947581&amp;e=0e65298001"" target=""_blank"">BML</a>, said: “In this era of political uncertainty, investors are rallying towards traditional asset classes like property, which are historically resilient and able to hold their value in times of transition. The fact a significant proportion of investors are planning to increase investment into property in 2020 shows that despite Brexit, demand for real estate remains resoundingly strong.</p>
<p>“Interestingly, the factors influencing financial strategies are also changing–on top of security and stability, investors are also taking into account the environmental and social impact of their investments. This will evidently be an important trend over the coming years, and is something both financial services firms and advisers will need to pay attention to in 2020.”</p>

<p>Commenting on the initiative, Mehmet T. Nane said: “Gender equality is a very important and ongoing issue for us at Pegasus Airlines, demonstrated by the successful initiatives we’ve implemented thus far. By signing IATA’s ‘25by2025’ initiative, we are now pledging to improve gender balance in our workplace. We are proud to be among the first airlines in the world to have taken this pledge.  We are also proud to have women excelling in their fields at every level in Pegasus Airlines, from pilots to senior management. Having made this pledge, and with our continued commitment to gender equality, increasing the number of female employees at Pegasus will now to be one of our primary goals moving forward.”</p>
<p>“We welcome Pegasus’s commitment to the 25by2025 campaign. We need a skilled, diverse and gender balanced workforce to meet the growing needs of our customers. Aviation is the business of freedom. And 25by2025 will help this important global industry be an even better employment opportunity for all people looking to make their career by linking the world,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO</p>

As a member of Turkey’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation Committee for the Development of Social Gender Balance, Pegasus Airlines continues to support awareness-raising programs for women regarding job opportunities in aviation, and to improve the quality and quantity of roles available to women in the sector.

Nane has enlisted his voluntary services as a ‘PWN Equality Ambassador’ with the mission to increase public awareness around the issue. Pegasus also supports the Women in Sales (WiS); a platform co-chaired by Pegasus Airlines Chief Commercial Officer Güliz Öztürk to increase the gender balance between women and men in company sales departments.</p>

<p>In today’s environment, institutions deal with multiple service providers to collect their payments by presenting invoices, collecting funds cross-border and reconciling payments – creating an inefficient and disjointed experience. Additionally, current collection processes are primarily manual and paper-based, creating more operational inefficiency.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, Citi combined its local payment offerings, account structures and FX capabilities with a leading digital invoicing platform from HighRadius Corporation, a Citi Ventures portfolio company. This fully integrated platform connects Citi’s clients to their international payers across key markets in all regions. By automating the entire workflow – including international billing, automated payment, currency selection and reconciliation – multinational clients achieve greater visibility and control over cross-border receipts and their global cash position.</p>
<p>“In today’s digital economy, clients must scale quickly into new markets to remain competitive. At Citi, we are arming our clients with the technology to enable expansion and sustain growth by automating key aspects of their core operations and improving the end-to-end user experience,” said Manish Kohli, Global Head, Payments and Receivables, Citi.</p>

<p>Tom Nicholas, GSL Officer of IBOS (previously VP, Product Manager at JPMorgan Chase) as well as the IBOS Office in London, and the highly experienced team of representatives from each of the member banks, continue to explore new ways to continuously improve the service offered to clients in this often complex and challenging area. More recently this has included strengthening the web-based tools offered to member banks and looking at some of the new technologies which have been developed, particularly by European banks and fintechs, following the introduction of PSD2.</p>
<p>IBOS is also particularly keen to follow the changing geographic demands of its member banks’ clients and expand into new countries at a time when the global banks have seen some retrenchment. As well as new parts of Europe, IBOS has its sights on potential new member banks in Asia, Australasia and South America where it can again develop the strong local expertise which clients are already enjoying in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Tom commented: “This is an especially exciting time for IBOS as we continue to develop the tools we offer our members and build our network around the globe. It is a privilege to work with first class banks in each country knowing they have a real appetite for this business and can deliver well for their clients who are expanding around the world. This strength of local service delivery can, in my view, only be offered when banks co-operate on a personal level in the way which the experts in IBOS do.”</p>
<p>IBOS member banks now provide geographic coverage to clients in 70% of the globe as follows: Bank of Shanghai (China), CIC - Credit Mutuel (France), Intesa Sanpaolo Group (Italy, Slovenia, Croatia), KBC (Belgium, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Czech Rep., Hungary, Slovakia), Nordea Bank (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), PNC Bank (USA), Royal Bank of Canada (Canada), Royal Bank of Scotland (UK), Santander Group (UK, Spain, Portugal, Poland and South America), Silicon Valley Bank (USA), Ulster Bank (Ireland), UniCredit Group (Austria, Germany, Italy, Romania and Russia) and US Bank (USA).</p>

<p>To help smaller businesses access essential business financing more easily, Banking Circle entered the SME lending sector in 2018, launching Banking Circle Lending and Banking Circle Instant Settlement. These revolutionary new solutions were built in response to an SME study involving more than 500 businesses, which revealed the impact of high interest rates, high arrangement fees and inflexible repayment options when accessing funding through traditional lenders.</p>
<p>Cardstream identified that the Banking Circle Lending solutions would provide an important added-value for its Partners as CEO Adam Sharpe explained:</p>
<p>“Cardstream’s Partners enjoy strong and trusted relationships with the merchants to whom they provide our white labelled payment gateway service under their own trusted brand. Now, with this new service developed with Banking Circle, they can offer loans to any of their merchant customer businesses based on their online payments revenue.</p>
<p>“The loans are risk free to the Partner, who is able to retain a share of the revenue generated if this falls within its business model and merchant agreement. We believe it’s a win-win for both sides. The Partner enhances its merchant relationships and the merchants have quick access to valuable funding, whether to fill a cashflow gap or to support business growth.”</p>
<p>Anders la Cour, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Banking Circle added: “Banking Circle is committed to providing market infrastructure as a real alternative to traditional banking solutions, with the aim of increasing financial inclusion. As part of this, we wanted to deliver a more accessible lending solution for businesses in need of a financial boost.</p>
<p>“Now, through our partnership with Cardstream, more than 200 payment providers have access to our unique lending solution, meaning tens of thousands of small businesses can access the cash they need to expand, restock or simply survive a quiet period. In the past, these SMEs would have been unable to borrow the vital funds, which could have meant letting employees go or even business failure.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The hedging decision is often driven by how long the debt is expected to be in place, which is a key factor in formulating any strategy. Alongside this are any hedging requirements within the terms of the debt facility, including covenant tolerance to higher cost of funds.</p>
<p>Last summer there were plenty of discussions around the prospect of negative interest rates in the UK as fears of a no-deal Brexit increased. Negative rates affect any borrower with a Libor floor in a debt facility that is hedged with an interest rate swap. If Libor were to turn negative, the borrower would be required to pay the negative floating rate in the swap but not receive the offsetting cashflow from the loan.</p>
<p>It is possible to add a 0% floor to an interest rate swap, but when swap rates are very low, as they were over the summer, this can be extremely expensive. Now that swap rates have moved higher, the cost of buying a 0% floor has fallen, but so has the perceived risk of negative rates. With this we have seen a drop in the number of borrowers actively looking incorporate floor into their interest rate swaps, despite the potential disruption that could be caused by the General Election.</p>
<h4>Swaptions favoured for longer dated flexibility</h4>
<p>Flexibility continues to be an important factor if there is a chance the debt facility may be refinanced before it has matured. Interest rate caps were previously a popular choice for many of our clients faced with this situation. More recently, though, swaptions have grown in popularity. This is particularly true if hedging for five years or beyond as the premium for a longer dated cap can be relatively expensive. Indeed, the breakeven rate, (the level the average Libor needs to fix below for a cap to be more economic than a swap), can be 20 – 30bps below where Libor is currently fixing.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the current low interest rate environment has encouraged some borrowers to look to hedge longer than the underlying debt facility. With interest rates so low it is tempting to lock in to a longer dated interest rate swap in case the General Election brings an upwards shock to interest rates. But that strategy brings with it the risk of break costs if the debt is not extended. There is also no guarantee the lender will extend the debt even if it provides an interest rate swap for an extended maturity, so again swaptions are considered a suitable alternative.</p>
<p>The change in borrowers’ hedging behaviour since the announcement of the General Election has been subtle. What is clear is that borrowers do not want to introduce any unnecessary risks - but instead neutralise the risks they can control. Swaptions offer flexibility at a fraction of the cost of interest rate caps and have gained in popularity to mitigate both General Election and Brexit related risks.</p>

<p>Tom Nicholas, GSL Officer of IBOS (previously VP, Product Manager at JPMorgan Chase) as well as the IBOS Office in London, and the highly experienced team of representatives from each of the member banks, continue to explore new ways to continuously improve the service offered to clients in this often complex and challenging area. More recently this has included strengthening the web-based tools offered to member banks and looking at some of the new technologies which have been developed, particularly by European banks and fintechs, following the introduction of PSD2.</p>
<p>IBOS is also particularly keen to follow the changing geographic demands of its member banks’ clients and expand into new countries at a time when the global banks have seen some retrenchment. As well as new parts of Europe, IBOS has its sights on potential new member banks in Asia, Australasia and South America where it can again develop the strong local expertise which clients are already enjoying in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Tom commented: “This is an especially exciting time for IBOS as we continue to develop the tools we offer our members and build our network around the globe. It is a privilege to work with first class banks in each country knowing they have a real appetite for this business and can deliver well for their clients who are expanding around the world. This strength of local service delivery can, in my view, only be offered when banks co-operate on a personal level in the way which the experts in IBOS do.”</p>
<p>IBOS member banks now provide geographic coverage to clients in 70% of the globe as follows: Bank of Shanghai (China), CIC - Credit Mutuel (France), Intesa Sanpaolo Group (Italy, Slovenia, Croatia), KBC (Belgium, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Czech Rep., Hungary, Slovakia), Nordea Bank (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), PNC Bank (USA), Royal Bank of Canada (Canada), Royal Bank of Scotland (UK), Santander Group (UK, Spain, Portugal, Poland and South America), Silicon Valley Bank (USA), Ulster Bank (Ireland), UniCredit Group (Austria, Germany, Italy, Romania and Russia) and US Bank (USA).</p>

<p>The Barclays Biometric Reader (BBR), developed in collaboration with Hitachi, uses infra-red technology to identify the user by scanning their unique finger vein patterns. Even more secure than a fingerprint, this innovation removes the need to remember PINs or passwords and eliminates the risk of PIN capture, identity fraud or sharing of account details.</p>
<p>The new device improves on the first version by introducing a ‘Sign What You See’ (SWYS) activity screen which provides a further safeguard against fraud. The screen displays written instructions to the user describing the activity being authorised, offering an additional layer of security in case their computer was compromised and a fraudster had manipulated the details of the activity needing authorisation. Another key development is Bluetooth wireless connectivity. This enhancement makes it easier for users to manage their banking without having to physically connect the scanner to their computer.</p>
<p>Despite the introduction of the activity screen and wireless connectivity, Hitachi have been able to make the new device smaller than its predecessor by adapting the technology used to scan the finger vein. These enhancements have been designed in response to direct feedback from clients around the need for technology that fits with their increasingly mobile working patterns.</p>
<p>The technology behind the finger vein scanner is Hitachi’s VeinID which is recognised globally as one of the most secure biometrics available. There is no public record of the user’s vein pattern and Barclays does not hold the vein pattern on their systems. Barclays’ digital banking system iPortal, which provides a single access point and sign-in for all services, has been designed to fully interact with the BBR, making the account management and payments process seamless for the end user.</p>
<p>The new device will be available to Corporate Banking and Business Banking clients who use the bank’s Barclays.Net and iPortal digital channels from early 2020.</p>
<p>Martin Runow, Head of Digital Banking at Barclays Corporate Banking said: “We’re committed to combating fraud. The new and improved Barclays Biometric Reader is much more portable and even more secure. Our clients are increasingly mobile and the advances we’ve been able to introduce will allow them to securely manage their accounts wherever they are. This device aligns with our aim to redefine Digital Banking by putting client experience at the core of everything we do, making it easier for our corporate clients to run their business.</p>
<p>Ravi Ahluwalia, General Manager, Security Business Group at Hitachi Europe Ltd. said: “This new deployment represents another milestone in our ongoing partnership with Barclays. Both companies have worked together tirelessly to create this new device and we are delighted that our innovative VeinID technology will continue to help Barclays corporate customers conduct their business, using the most secure and easy to use biometric authentication technology available in the market.”</p>

<p>Fusion Treasury Essential is ideally suited for banks that have limited IT resources in-house but are looking to benefit from proven treasury market practice. Moving away from manual processes will also help these banks increase efficiencies to compete more effectively and also demonstrate to regulators that they have a robust overall operating model in place to prevent systemic risk.</p>
<p>“Thousands of smaller banks and challengers that rely on manual processes and spreadsheets to manage their treasury function can now quickly benefit from a solution that automates routine processes, reduces manual errors and maximizes straight-through processing of treasury transactions,” said Pedro Porfirio, Global Head of Capital Markets at Finastra. “Until now many of these organizations have considered specialist treasury solutions to be out of their reach in terms of the expense and the complexity of implementation. But Fusion Treasury Essential changes that.”</p>
<p>Using the tried and tested capabilities of Finastra’s core solutions, Fusion Kondor and Fusion Opics, Fusion Treasury Essential provides automated product workflows in a fixed-cost packaged solution that’s fast to deploy. It offers front-to-back automated processing of bonds, loans and deposits, repos, call accounts, FX and money market transactions. It also supports manual deal capture, data interfaces to Reuters and Bloomberg, position keeping, trade workflows, decision support and updates to the bank general ledger.</p>
<p>Finastra’s global partners will work with banks to roll the solution out over a timescale of around 12 weeks. Sunder Ganesh, Vice President and Client Partner at ITC Infotech, one of Finastra’s global partners who has already successfully deployed the solution on Microsoft Azure said, “We are excited to collaborate with Finastra in delivering a quick to market, straight-through processing, front to back treasury solution by building a golden copy that is pre-configured and certified for deployment. Fusion Treasury Essential offers clients the opportunity to modernize their growing treasury business and with a 90-day schedule, the solution can be up and running in no time, on premise or in the cloud.”</p>
<p>Brad Bailey, Research Director at Celent said, “The demands of running a small bank treasury today are daunting from a business, regulatory, and client demand perspective. Most firms introduce unnecessary complexity, risk, and error because of reliance on manual processes. Ideally, they need a treasury solution that can automate, streamline, and optimize their needs today, but can also scale, as they move along their future growth trajectory.”</p>

Press release: Water risk often ignored by mainstream investors,"


<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> November 2019</strong> – Water risks are often ignored by mainstream investors despite being cited by the World Economic Forum as one the five biggest threats to global economic and political stability. Sectors most at risk include agriculture, food and beverages, energy, oil and gas, chemicals and mining. We believe investors need to integrate water risks systematically into the investment process to be able to assess properly the return potential of companies in these sectors.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Water does not only represent risk but also offers big opportunities for investors given the infrastructure spending required and the need for private capital to play a strong role. The World Bank estimates that delivering the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 6 by 2030 will require over $100bn of additional capex globally every year on infrastructure and further development, circa 40% above current spending.</p>
<p>These are the conclusions of Edison Group’s latest research report into the sector, ‘Water – the real liquidity crisis.’</p>
<h4>Water risks present widely and are multifaceted</h4>
<p>Only a small fraction (2.5%) of the global water supply exists as freshwater. An even smaller proportion (0.025%) is accessible as surface water. This water is unevenly distributed and its availability is neither predictable nor constant over time. Quality is an issue as much as quantity: pollution, either by nitrates, biological material or heavy metals, can further restrict availability.</p>
<p>Demand for water is rising globally (c.2% annually), predominantly driven by regions where the population is growing. The amount needed for drinking is just a fraction of this demand. The WHO estimates the average person requires just 2-3 litres per day for drinking. In contrast, residential consumption in developed countries is 100-300 litres per day. Substantial water resources are needed for cooking, washing, cleaning and sanitation. In addition to this, water is consumed ‘indirectly’, embedded in energy and particularly food production.</p>
<p>Shifting patterns of demand and supply are creating both acute and chronic water issues. The UN estimates that 800 million people (10% of the global population) don’t currently have access to clean water and a further 3.2 billion (40%+) face severe water shortages at least one month a year. It is estimated that by 2030 population growth will see global demand for clean water exceed supply by 40%. Half of this growth is expected to be in Africa, a region with limited surface water resources. Meanwhile, rapid urbanization is leading to acute shortfalls for many cities. China’s industrialization has driven dramatic increases in both demand and water pollution.</p>
<h4>..and yet water risks are rising</h4>
<p>Water risks are acute for certain sectors but are often ignored by investors who may regard them as long-term issues. Agriculture, food and beverages, energy and mining disclose these risks, which include floods and droughts, but they can no longer be discounted as one-off events. Their complexity and location-specific nature makes them difficult to assess and integrate into the investment process. When evaluating the different levels of risk water could bring into a portfolio, investors should keep three key considerations in mind. Ceres, a non-profit organisation focusing on encouraging investors to address sustainability, has created an investors’ water toolkit to help asses water risks. They highlight:</p>
<p>Physical risk - This not only includes potential disasters such as droughts or flooding but also lack of proper infrastructure or a declining supply.</p>
<p>Regulatory risk- In the current uncertain global political environment, policy changes by incoming governments or unexpected increases in tariffs pose a threat that investors should bear in mind.</p>
<p>Social/reputational risk – These revolve around potential sanitation violations, community blocking of current/planned operations and customer/workforce perceptions.</p>
<h4>Integrating water risk into the investment process</h4>
<p>These considerations are not comprehensive but illustrate, in our view, the need for investors to integrate water risks systematically into their decision making. Cares’s toolkit highlights 3 main risks when integrating water into an investor’s portfolio:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessing corporate risk: Investors need to understand fully water’s dependency risk. Analysis of the intensity of production, integrating an academic approach, applying a shadow water price and assessing management’s response to risk are vital before integrating water investments into a portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrating into decision process: As with any investment, due diligence is key. Investors need to carry out a screening process to define the material risk to absolute or relative performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full Portfolio integration: It is vital for investors to carry out a standardized assessment approach and integration across products as well as integrating this into strategic decision making and in marketing to external investors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Water presents an opportunity</h4>
<p>Water issues also present a big opportunity for investors. Closing the projected gap between global demand and supply requires new infrastructure in developing countries while developed countries (notably the U.S.) urgently require upgrades to improve wastewater treatment and cut leakages. At the current stage, circa 40% above current spending is still required.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the Green New Deal, supported by the majority of US Democratic candidates for 2020, promises to tackle this and guarantee “universal access to clean water”. These upward pressures on spending are the reasons many analysts characterize the long-term fundamentals of the water market as “compelling”.</p>
<p>Infrastructure projects are highly suitable for debt financing. It is estimated that annual private sector infrastructure debt financing in the water sector ranges from $17–40bn. However, the vast majority of this is directed to projects in developed countries. The rapid rise in green/climate bonds (over $200bn issued in 2018) combined with tax incentives and explicit environmental goals could prove to be potentially significant. However, as formal ‘use the proceeds’ requirements were only adopted in May 2018, few water-specific green bonds have been issued to date. Environmental Finance estimates just over $3bn sustainable water management green bonds have been issued in the U.S. in 2019 so far.</p>
<h4>How to play the water theme</h4>
<p>For equity investors attracted by the water market a range of vehicles are available. Many fund managers have now launched thematic water products. Some, such as Pictet Water, exclusively focus on capital growth, others incorporate (non-financial) objectives and aim to be “sustainable” (e.g. Fidelity - Water and Waste) whilst others have explicit impact mandates (Impax – Water Strategy). For investors seeking to minimize management fees there are also an increasing range of ETFs available. Assessing the (gross) performance of a sample universe of funds, most have sustained an average growth of over 6% over the last five years with managed funds achieving over 10%. Investors can also, alternatively, take direct stakes in companies targeting the water sector.</p>
<p>Dan Gardiner, Director at Edison Group said: “The water sector presents big opportunities for investors. Huge spending increases are needed over the next decade to both address underserved communities and upgrade existing infrastructure. The sector is particularly attractive to income funds and the growing pool of capital looking at sustainable and impact strategies. More broadly, looking at investments in a range of other sectors, water risks need to be assessed more seriously and systemically integrated into decision-making processes to ensure that investors maximise their potential returns and achieve their investment goals.”</p>

Press release: 64% of Chief Financial Officers will be completely reliant on Big Data,"


<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> November 2019</strong> – Almost two-thirds (64%) of CFOs expect that within the next five years the financial world will no longer be able to operate without big data, however, 13% of CFOs think this is already the case.

<h4>Impact on employment</h4>
<p>More than a third of CFOs (38%) expect big data to have a significant impact within the financial sector, particularly on aspects such as job opportunities, with 36% of CFOs seeing big data as a threat to employment. Trends such as robotisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are also on the radar of financial directors, with 42% of CFOs expecting AI to have a major impact on employment opportunities and 30% of CFOs seeing robotisation as the biggest threat to jobs.</p>
<p>Marieke Saeij, CEO, Onguard: “I’m not surprised that CFOs expect to be completely dependent on big data within such a short timeframe. Big data can help them, as well as finance professionals within their organisations, with the execution of their work. Finance professionals have a great deal of information from both internal and external sources that is of added value for both the performance of the organisation and customer service. The more information that is available about the market and customers, the better finance professionals can advise customers. Thanks to big data, risks can be assessed more accurately and it is also possible to predict in real-time whether and when customers will start paying so as an organisation, you can properly anticipate this. This development will require finance professionals to develop new skills, such as greater analytical capacity, as a necessity.”</p>

<p>The two organisations will work toward a November 2021 completion date to correspond with the deadline for the ISO 20022 migration of the Eurosystem’s TARGET2 platform. The goal is to align specifications and milestones to minimise effort by market participants during the transition and ensure seamless intra-day switching between both euro payment systems.</p>
<p>ISO 20022 creates a new language and structure for payments information, enabling the exchange of more and higher quality data that in turn improves efficiency, compliance and client experiences. Payment systems of all reserve currencies are moving to the standard, and SWIFT has put in place a robust programme to facilitate community-wide adoption.</p>
<p>Alain Raes, Chief Business Development Officer, SWIFT said: “The migration to ISO 20022 is a significant inflection point in the payments industry that promises a new era of possibilities. We are pleased to work with EBA CLEARING to unlock the potential and further a partnership of innovation that spans two decades. EURO1 users can count on us to support them throughout and deliver the same robust security, resilience and reliability that are hallmarks of the SWIFT network.”</p>
<p>SWIFT has provided the messaging layer for EURO1 and served as processing agent for the system operated by EBA CLEARING since its launch in January 1999.</p>
<p>The ISO 20022 migration is part of a larger future positioning programme that the two organisations announced last year after a comprehensive consultation with EURO1 users. The project seeks to evolve EURO1 in line with user expectations while maintaining benefits such as liquidity efficiency, immediate payment finality, cost-effectiveness and added resilience for high-value payments. The first deliverables, including a dashboard to enhance liquidity monitoring capabilities of EURO1 users, will be implemented before the end of 2019.</p>
<p>Erwin Kulk, Head of Service Development and Management, EBA CLEARING, said: “Since its launch in 1999, EURO1 has generated substantial cost savings for its participants and, with the migration to ISO 20022, it will be able to continue to do so in the future. We are striving to keep the EURO1-related efforts to a strict minimum for our users. To this effect, we are pleased that we are ready to move forward with our system developments in time and in maximal alignment with TARGET2, together with our EURO1 users and our long-standing EURO1 technology partner SWIFT.”</p>
<p>EURO1 is the only private sector large-value payment system for single same-day euro transactions at a pan-European level and has been identified as a systemically important payment system (SIPS) by the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>EURO1 processes on average 200,000 payments per day with an average total value of over  EUR 200 billion. The system currently counts 45 participant banks and reaches nearly 20,000  BICs in and beyond Europe.</p>

<p>Banking Circle, the ground-breaking provider of business banking infrastructure, commissioned MagnaCarta Communications to produce a series of research papers investigating how financial institutions of all types can each play a role in increasing SME financial inclusion. This insight paper is the latest in the series, following the initial white paper which launched in May 2019 and a Banking Innovations insight paper published in September 2019.</p>
<p>Anders la Cour, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Banking Circle commented: “Increasing financial inclusion is core to every Banking Circle solution we build. As such, we regularly speak to businesses of all sizes and types, working in all regions and industries, to gain invaluable insights into the current challenges and where we can tackle existing pain points. This Payments-focused insight paper includes input from a range of players in the market, each identifying key challenges and opportunities for payment providers.</p>
<p>“The unique insights we have gained in producing this paper are invaluable for Banking Circle but also for the wider industry and will help us work together to build an ecosystem of efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet the needs of real businesses.

<p>What is a credit facility? This represents the total amount a company can borrow at any given time for their business activities. This amount is generally made up of a range of products including business loans, overdrafts, credit cards and invoice finance facilities.</p>
<p>These larger businesses will be able to secure a credit facility of up to £5m (based on their revenue) and up to £500k as a business loan (flexible term, up to 3 years) from MarketInvoice. These limits will increase steadily over the next 12 months. MarketInvoice has built a track-record with larger businesses over the last 2 years, having provided over £550m to a range of businesses in the telecoms, engineering, consulting, energy and technology sectors. This demand came from businesses who were too big to be served by traditional business banking services but not large enough for corporate banking facilities.</p>
<p>Craig Flyger, Corporate Solutions Director at MarketInvoice, commented: “We’re delighted to be able to serve larger businesses with their finance needs. These are high-growth companies forging new ground by transforming their industry, growing internationally and driving UK GDP. We want to power and propel their growth. Our team has the necessary experience and resources to structure larger facilities tailored to the needs of these businesses very quickly.”</p>
<p>Since 2011, MarketInvoice has provided over £2.6b in business finance to thousands of companies across the UK. These are predominantly businesses waiting on long payment terms who are seeking finance to support their growth. Corporate Solutions will help support larger businesses more comprehensively and get them the finance they need.</p>
<p>Marvin Patel, MD at growing business Infinity Energy, which is expected to double revenue from £11.1m in 2018 to £20m this year, commented: “We chose MarketInvoice as a finance partner to tackle long payment terms. As we’ve grown, we’ve needed larger credit limits. Now that we’re taking on bigger projects with more complex contracts, we needed a larger finance facility. It’s great to continue our relationship with MarketInvoice”.</p>
<p>Craig Flyger added: “We’ve launched Corporate Solutions to serve the needs of the companies who are currently falling into a no-man’s land between business banking and corporate banking. We estimate that the annual lending opportunity to these companies, who are grossly underserved and ignored by traditional business lenders, is worth £13b. Our solid track record in providing greater access to finance and responsible lending decisions is not only testament to our robust platform and credit risk model, but also to the trust business owners have placed in us as their financial partner”.</p>
<p>MarketInvoice’s main strategic ambition is to broaden its reach to be able to support a wide range of businesses looking to scale up. The company aims to help even more businesses get paid faster by financing their invoices, so owners can save time and focus on running successful operations.</p>

<p>The analysis, based on the response of more than 3,000 consumers in the UK between 27th and 30th September 2019, revealed sentiment on job security was three points lower (at -8%) year-on-year. At the same time, confidence around job opportunities and career progression also fell five points to -6% over the same period. This comes at a time when businesses are intensifying cost control, with 70% of CFOs expecting to reduce hiring in the next 12 months, <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/deloitte-cfo-survey-q3-2019.html"" target=""_blank"">according to Deloitte’s latest CFO Survey</a>.</p>
<p>Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, commented: “Up to now we have seen a slowdown everywhere but in the jobs market and in the consumer economy. A decline in consumer confidence this quarter, combined with a fall in official unemployment figures, show that the period of remarkable resilience in jobs and earnings is coming to an end.</p>
<p>“With Brexit cited as the biggest risk businesses face, the last quarter has also seen heightened concern over slowing growth in the UK and Eurozone and CFOs are tightening their purse strings in response. The headwinds from a major global slowdown and uncertainty at home point to weaker growth ahead. As a result, 2020 is likely to see not only lower levels of consumer confidence but also a slowing down of consumer spending growth.”</p>
<h4>Working hard, playing hard</h4>
<p>Consumer spending was most notable in the leisure sector this quarter, with nine out of 11 leisure categories seeing year-on-year uplift, as consumers continue to favour experiences over material goods, such as shoes and clothing. This trend was seen across both small- and big-ticket leisure categories, from gym and sports (up one percentage point, year-on-year) to eating out, in-home leisure, and culture and entertainment (up five percentage points year-on-year, respectively).</p>
<p>Confidence in disposable income was one point higher overall (at -19%) compared to a year ago but the greatest jump was amongst 18- to 34-year-olds, up ten percentage points, boosted by the introduction of April’s National Living Wage.</p>
<p>Simon Oaten, partner for hospitality and leisure at Deloitte, commented: “Spending on short breaks and long holidays has remained flat compared to Q2, despite the seasonality of travel. However, we are seeing uplift across every other leisure category, from regular coffees to attending live sporting events, in a sign that experiences continue to be favoured over goods. <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/social-media-boosts-leisure-spending-as-consumers-seek-new-experiences.html"" target=""_blank"">Over a third of consumers aged between 18 and 34</a> are more likely to treat themselves to experiences rather than material goods. Given the same age group has seen the greatest rise in disposable income confidence this quarter, experiential leisure spending could well see further growth.</p>
<p>“However, consumers enter the fourth quarter in a relatively cautious mood and maybe for good reason. Whilst consumers have been quite resilient since the EU referendum, a deterioration in the jobs market could see some spending contraction.”</p>

<p>To address that client need, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has introduced Accounts Payable Optimization. This new solution analyzes a company’s suppliers and determines the most efficient payment method for each specific entity across BofA Merrill’s Card, Payments, Supply Chain Finance, and FX Payments teams. Normally, this analysis is performed manually, if at all. With the Account Payable Optimization tool, BofA Merrill can help companies enhance their cash flow, improve days’ payable outstanding, more effectively control financing costs, and strengthen supplier relationships.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to launch Accounts Payable Optimization and help take the guesswork out of supplier payment analysis,” said Hubert J.P. Jolly, head of Channels and Global Commercial Banking for Global Transaction Services (GTS) at BofA Merrill. “Besides releasing our clients’ treasury teams from manual tasks, the tool delivers actionable data that helps improve a company’s own cash flow and supplier relationships.”</p>
<p>Bank clients that choose to use Accounts Payable Optimization will experience a simple onboarding process and receive deeper data analytics. They’ll use just one file to manage all treasury payables, including supply chain finance invoices, through BofA Merrill’s CashPro® Connect file payments channel.</p>
<p>“One of our guiding principles is advocating for our clients, and we do that by bringing clients solutions before they even know they need them,” said Fernando Iraola, global co-head of GTS Corporate Banking. “Accounts Payable Optimization is a perfect example of our approach to advocacy.”</p>
<p>Accounts Payable Optimization launched earlier this year to select clients as a pilot. It is now available to all Bank of America Merrill Lynch client companies.</p>
<h4>Benefits of Accounts Payable Optimization</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased days payable outstanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced cash flow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthened supplier relationships (vendor has options to discount receivables)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controlled financing and processing costs</p>
</li>
</ul>

Press release: Less than one in five trust the UK audit system,"


<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> October 2019</strong> – International accounting and advisory firm Mazars has published a study canvassing public opinion on the UK economy and the audit system1. Following a Queen’s Speech which made no mention of reform of the audit market, leading to BEIS Select Committee Chair Rachel Reeves’ concerns over “a missed opportunity”, the research shows a public appetite to maintain focus on the reform agenda. The study, which also gauged public sentiment over the collapse of Carillion, suggests that the general public has a real interest in an audit system that makes our economy stronger through improved transparency and accountability, and is unwilling to accept high profile corporate failures as the status quo.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>Public appetite for audit reform</h4>
<p>The study indicates that the public strongly supports audit reform, with nearly two-thirds (62%) stating that they don’t have trust in the current audit system to provide independent and accurate assessments of a company’s financial position. Mandatory joint auditing, one of the key remedies suggested by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in its comprehensive package of measures proposed to the government, is extremely popular among the public, with nearly three quarters of respondents (72%) supporting the introduction of joint audit as a solution to the string of accounting scandals and corporate failures in recent years.</p>
<h4>The collapse of Carillion</h4>
<p>Ineffective audits have been blamed for a string of business collapses, and high profile failures such as Carillion and Thomas Cook are firmly part of the public consciousness. Respondents had strong feelings about the fallout from these cases. The majority (69%) of the general public were aware of the collapse of construction company Carillion, after it went into liquidation with debts of around £1.5bn early last year. Many of those familiar with the story had grave concern about the impact of the collapse on the various groups involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>81% were concerned about the 30,000 suppliers, many of them small businesses, who were owed about £1bn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>81% were concerned about the 3000 employees being made redundant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>79% were concerned about the third of apprentices who were still without work 3 months after Carillion folded</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When asked what words best described their feeling about the Carillion collapse, the top three were disgust, anger and greed – suggesting deep disapproval of the behaviour of those responsible for the spectacular fall of the company.</p>
<p>David Herbinet, global head of audit and partner at Mazars said: “We have long believed that the public has a real interest in an audit system that makes our economy stronger through improved transparency and accountability, and our research only strengthens this belief. High profile company collapses are becoming all too common, and impact hard-working people who understandably have grave concerns and are now demanding action.</p>
<p>“There is insufficient choice and resilience in the audit market. Substantial reform is now critical to the sustainable success of our largest companies and the wider economy. Nearly 3 out of every 4 members of the public (72%) support the introduction of mandatory joint audit as a remedy, and we see this particular reform as a major opportunity to create an even playing field for challenger firms to compete more fairly in the large corporate market, in which 99% of the audit fees of FTSE 350 companies are currently paid to just four firms. A diverse market is vital for audit quality and for the overall functioning of the economy.</p>
<p>“The CMA has produced a very effective range of measures to create a genuinely competitive audit market that addresses the needs of society. This represents the clearest opportunity in decades for real change. It’s now time to maintain momentum and pursue brave solutions”.</p>

<p>“Critical to becoming a customer-first bank is shedding light on banking processes, empowering the customer in these processes, and doing as much of the work as possible on behalf of the customer. By delivering more transparency and control to end-users, banks will achieve a new level of trust and deepen client relationships,” said Alenka Grealish, senior banking analyst at Celent.</p>
<p>“We greatly appreciate the close dialogue we have with our clients,” said Hubert J.P.

These latest upgrades mean that clients can have the most critical workstation capabilities wherever they are – making their mobile devices even smarter and their lives easier.”</p>
<p>These new enhancements are a result of the robust feedback loop that the bank has built over many years, most notably the CashPro Client Advisory Boards that include members of the bank’s various client segments. Through the advisory boards, the voice-of-the-client surveys, the in-app feedback tool, and the mobile community, the bank is always listening, always refining and always delivering.</p>
<p>In 2019, the bank has continued to introduce enhancements to CashPro Mobile and earlier this year integrated <a href=""https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/corporate-and-investment-banking-sales-and-trading-treasury-services/bank-america-47"" target=""_blank"">Apple Watch capabilities</a> into the CashPro platform.</p>
<p>Bank of America has been named “Best Digital Bank” in North America by Euromoney magazine for two consecutive years, and its leadership in digital banking for businesses is centered on its CashPro platform where users manage their everyday treasury and lending needs. CashPro has approximately 500,000 users among the bank’s corporate, commercial, and business banking clients.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The treasury – and the treasurer – of 2025 will look very different to that of today. Treasury is becoming more relevant as the need to manage liquidity and risk internationally becomes more important and visible at Board level, and more strategic as it becomes more deeply involved in the commercial aspects of the business. As treasurers extend their reach and influence, the skills requirement is changing while the combination of data and available technology is creating valuable new opportunities.</p>
<p>Embracing change can be daunting, and treasurers may often think that other treasuries are ahead of their own. Rather than taking an idealised view of treasury, the Journeys to Treasury report acknowledges the reality that although some treasuries have digitised more fully than others, everyone has organisational, human, technology and budget constraints that shape their priorities and capacity.</p>
<p>In the fourth edition of Journeys to Treasury, BNP Paribas, PwC, SAP and the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT) come together once again to explore some of the priorities that treasurers have identified, and which are shaping the treasury of today and tomorrow:</p>
<h5>Payments and Collections</h5>
<p>As digital business models emerge, new payment methods are proliferating. Treasurers can play a key role in supporting business units by proposing new payment and collection methods to differentiate the experience of customers and suppliers. Bruno Mellado, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, BNP Paribas comments:</p>
<p>“Whether treasurers are leaders or influencers, they have a vital role to play in evaluating, facilitating and managing the effects of different payment and collection methods. By doing so, they can help to drive the company’s success in a changing, increasingly digital, environment.”</p>
<h5>FX Risk Management</h5>
<p>Managing foreign exchange (FX) risk remains one of treasurers’ highest priorities, and FX volatility can make a major difference to earnings. Didier Vandenhaute, Partner, PwC notes:</p>
<p>“Senior executives and company Boards continue to be motivated to understand the potential impact of FX volatility and limit negative effects on the business. Consequently, treasurers are renewing their focus on hedging strategies and optimal execution to manage risk and reduce the impact of volatility. Given limits on resources, automating some of the day-to-day business, including the use of robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, can give treasurers time to spend on more complex and strategic activities.”</p>
<h5>Technology Enablers</h5>
<p>With expanding technology opportunities and lower barriers to adoption, treasurers have an unprecedented ability to automate processes and enhance decision-making. However, the success of these endeavours relies on high quality data. To get the best from new technology, treasurers and their partners across the business need to adopt a data-driven mindset. Christian Mnich, VP and Head of Solution Management, Treasury and Working Capital Management, SAP highlights:</p>
<p>“To gain the full value of new solutions, treasurers need to look at their needs and identify where pain points are occurring. In many cases, problems with underlying data prevent treasurers from fulfilling basic treasury requirements, let alone developing advanced capabilities. Improving the completeness and integrity of data is therefore becoming a significant priority. With treasury data often owned and held in different parts of the organisation, this will often require a company-wide shift towards a data-driven mindset.”</p>
<h5>The Future Treasury</h5>
<p>Treasury is still a relatively new profession, yet has become increasingly important as corporations expand their international reach. In a fast-changing business and digital environment, and with an expanding set of responsibilities, how can treasurers prepare for the future? François Masquelier, Deputy Chair EACT says:</p>
<p>“As treasury structures, processes and controls are increasingly shaped by technology, and the role of treasury continues to evolve, treasury functions need to reinvent themselves to remain relevant and enhance their value to the business. The need to engage and collaborate with internal and external partners will be also be amplified in the coming years.”</p>
<p>This year’s report shares the findings of in-depth workshops attended by experts from the four Journeys to Treasury partners, complemented by practical insights, case studies and interviews with nine leading corporate treasurers.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Almost two-thirds of CFOs (65%) say their business faces high or very high levels of external financial and economic uncertainty, with just 7% saying now is a good time to take risk onto their balance sheets.</p>
<p>The Deloitte CFO Survey gauges sentiment amongst the UK’s largest businesses. A total of 91 CFOs participated in the latest survey, including CFOs of 59 FTSE 350 companies. The combined market value of the listed companies that participated is £468 billion, approximately 19% of the UK quoted equity market. The Q3 2019 CFO survey ran between 17th and 30th September 2019.</p>
<h4>Reining in spending</h4>
<p>Increasing cash flow is a strong priority for 48% of CFOs, up from 42% last quarter, and reducing leverage is a priority for 19%, up from 17%. In addition, 70% of CFOs expect hiring to reduce in the next 12 months and just 3% expect it to rise.</p>
<p>Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: “Perceptions of uncertainty are elevated and corporate risk appetite is vanishingly low. The priority appears to be curbing costs, not expansion. With Brexit cited as the biggest risk businesses face, the last quarter has also seen heightened concern over slowing growth in the UK and Eurozone and CFOs are tightening their purse strings in response.”</p>
<h4>Economic risks rise</h4>
<p>While the effects of Brexit continue to be the largest risk facing businesses – up marginally from 65 to 66 (on a scale of 0 to 100) – domestic economic conditions are weighing heavier on CFOs’ minds.</p>
<p>Weak demand in the UK is the second biggest risk, up from a risk rating of 54 in Q2 to 62 in Q3, the highest in five years. Poor productivity and weak competitiveness in the UK rose from 46 to 53 in the same period.</p>
<p>Concerns over European growth have also risen with the rating for deflation and economic weakness in the euro area, and the possibility of a renewed euro crisis, up from 42 to 51.</p>
<h4>Brexit impact</h4>
<p>There has been a small shift in where CFOs see Brexit having an effect on their business plans. While 28% say that Brexit will curtail M&amp;A; activity, up from 25% in Q2, 45% say capital expenditure will slow (down from 47% in Q2). Six in ten (60%) forecast a decrease in hiring rates, down from 62% in Q2.</p>
<p>Overall though, 76% of CFOs believe that the long term business environment in the UK will be worse as a result of leaving the EU, down from 83% in Q2.</p>
<p>Richard Houston, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte North and South Europe, said: “Corporate risk appetite is being suppressed both by Brexit and macro-economic uncertainty, but there are some positives: unemployment has fallen and earnings are rising at the fastest rate in more than a decade. While it’s unclear whether these trends will be sustainable, I do take confidence from the fact that businesses in the UK have long shown themselves to be adaptable and resilient to change. We now need clarity on what that change looks like.”</p>

<p>HSBC’s GLCM helps corporate customers to maximise control and oversight of their cash flows with its global payables, cards, receivables and clearing services, as well as an array of liquidity and investment solutions.</p>
<p>Mr Koh joins from Standard Chartered, where he most recently led the transaction bank for Greater China and North Asia. He brings over 25 years of experience in transaction banking, having worked across seven geographies including China, Singapore, the UK and Saudi Arabia. Prior to Standard Chartered, Mr Koh headed the Corporate and Transaction Banking teams for Deutsche Bank in Greater China. Mr Koh began his career at HSBC on the bank’s executive trainee development programme.</p>
<p>Mr Koh will report jointly to Alan Turner, Head of Commercial Banking, Singapore, and to Kee Joo Wong, Regional Head of GLCM, Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Commenting on the appointment, Mr Turner said: “Whilst Singapore already enjoys a strong concentration of multinationals basing their regional treasury centres here, Southeast Asia’s rising consumer market means these numbers are ratcheting up even further. When you couple this with the region’s growing digital economy and mobile-first mentality, it becomes clear that businesses require truly innovative solutions to grasp these opportunities. With David’s many years of international experience, he will be instrumental in driving cross-border payment and liquidity solutions in this ever-changing dynamic region.”</p>
<p>Southeast Asia forms a formidable economic powerhouse with a combined GDP larger than that of the UK or India. Its rapidly growing middle class and increasingly high-tech manufacturing capabilities has prompted many of the of the world’s largest companies to base their regional headquarters there. With its established financial ecosystem and proximity to ASEAN, Singapore has grown to become the largest regional treasury hub in Asia Pacific, home to 4,200 regional headquarters.1 Southeast Asia Nearly four million new users are expected to come online every month in Southeast Asia for the next five years, generating a user base of 480 million by 2020.2</p>
<p>The appointment is part of HSBC Singapore’s country strategic plan, announced in March 2018, which seeks to support corporate clients – ranging from SMEs to multinational corporations - take advantage of the opportunities flowing from Southeast Asia’s macro-economic growth.

<p>The solution leverages Citi’s global cash concentration network along with its FX provider platform. It is designed to help treasurers mobilize cash when and where needed, in the right amount and currency, while optimizing investment and working capital strategies. Companies are able to reduce FX exposure and immediately convert available liquidity into a functional currency of their choice.</p>
<p>Mark Smith, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services at Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions commented: “Cross-Currency Sweeps combines the breadth of Citi’s global network with advanced and integrated capabilities of our Foreign Exchange and Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) platforms. This provides a unique solution for our clients looking to optimize their liquidity management through greater automation, visibility and control”.</p>
<p>The solution is uniquely designed for both intraday and multi-bank sweep arrangements, enabling treasurers to automate foreign exchange dealings in hundreds of currency pairs. In doing so, clients can benefit from Citi’s Foreign Exchange platform, which provides global coverage for electronic pricing. There are a variety of sweep features including frequency, amount, and sweep conditions, which will give clients more control of their structures and liquidity globally.</p>
<p>“In today’s volatile market environment, client demand for efficient tools facilitating the aggregation of liquidity across different currencies and the optimization of FX risk management continues to grow”, said Flavio Figueiredo, Global Head of Corporate Sales, Rates &amp; Currencies. “By integrating Citi’s local FX liquidity pools, market expertise, and globally harmonized FX technologies with our industry-leading liquidity solutions and services, Cross-Currency Sweeps offers a unique solution which allows clients to seamlessly transfer cross-currency liquidity in a timely fashion.”</p>
<p>Citi has successfully piloted the Cross-Currency Sweeps solution in Europe with Micron Technology, a large producer of computer memory and computer data storage. The company needed to eliminate manual operational processes around forecasting of their non-dollar accounts as well as convert negative yielding Euro currency to US Dollars, which is the company’s functional currency. Citi’s Cross-Currency Sweeps solution helped the client automate their cash concentration process, enabled a more effective use of their liquidity, and provided a higher investment yield in their functional currency.</p>
<p>“With most customer receipts in US Dollars, as a company we are still required to maintain non-dollar accounts to support ongoing operating expenses. This requires resources from our treasury group to spend time forecasting non-dollar payments and to coordinate funding of individual accounts. In addition, negative yielding currencies such as EUR in London have a carry cost for us. Citi’s Cross Currency Sweeps solution has provided us with cash efficiency and concentration as well as the benefit of reduction in administrative overhead. This innovative sweep solution with integrated FX has significantly improved our overall cash management strategy.” says Robert Lambert, Assistant Treasurer at Micron.</p>

<p>Treasurers consistently cite cash forecasting as their number one priority. However, forecasting is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process and all too often the results fail to accurately forecast cash shortfalls or surpluses.</p>
<p>By drawing upon document level data combined with counterparty risk and network behavior data, Taulia Cash Forecasting takes a data-driven approach, which when coupled with Taulia’s machine learning engine, results in an accurate and reliable view of future cash flows. With near real-time visibility into their future flows, Treasurers can improve their yield on cash, more effectively manage foreign exchange risk and anticipate future financing needs.</p>
<p>“Taulia Cash Forecasting is an exciting step towards Taulia's vision to creating The Working Capital Platform of the future,” said Brady Cale, Taulia’s Chief Technology Officer. “Integrating AI with document level data greatly improves the speed and accuracy of cash forecasting, meaning that treasurers can make faster, better-informed decisions about their cash.”</p>

<p>The partnership will assist in driving innovation in money market fund management, as treasury professionals expect automation and simplicity around their investment decisions.</p>
<p>Mark Smith, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, commented: “The world is moving toward better technology, simpler design, and instant access to data and automated analytics. We have redesigned the end-to-end MMF user experience in our Citibank® Online Investment portal, to ensure that we are providing our clients with more data-rich fund research and analytics tools; new choices for automated sweep rebalancing; a simplified account structure; and enhanced usability with increased customization options.”</p>
<p>The new Online Investments MMF solution will allow treasury professionals to manage their MMF portfolio in a more streamlined manner. For both active and automated investments, clients will be able to leverage automated analytics tools to support their strategic decision-making and risk management processes, through the bank’s mobile banking solution, CitiDirect BE®.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> October 2019</strong> – SWIFT and HSBC announce today they are joining forces to define a common industry standard JSON for APIs, re-using ISO 20022 components, the initiative will see the Hong Kong banking community working together to review and agree on this standard.</p>
<p>In July 2018, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced its Open API Framework, to facilitate the development and broader adoption of APIs by the banking sector. Since its launch, over 500 APIs have been made available by the 20 participating banks.</p>
<p>The new standard allows merchants to setup direct debit authorisation and initiate the collection instruction to bank on behalf of their consumers. This initiative by SWIFT and HSBC aims to avoid fragmentation on common use cases, speed up and ease API integration efforts and incremental investment for industry participants, and ensure interoperability with the Hong Kong Faster Payment System’s (HK FPS) underlying clearing and settlement system by reusing ISO 20022 as a standard. ISO 20022 is already widely adopted by market infrastructures across the world, including HK FPS, and is set to become the new standard for cross-border payments in the years to come, making it a logical choice when adopting a new technology.</p>
<p>Lisa O’Connor, Managing Director, Capital Markets and Standards, APAC said: “In recent years, the financial industry has moved from safe payments to fast payments, and is now embracing richer data payments as the world is moving towards Open Banking. In this context, the adoption of a common set of standards, such as ISO 20022, is a necessity to ensure interoperability between systems and reap the full benefits of Open APIs.”.</p>
<p>Nadya Hijazi, Head of Digital, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC said: “We are delighted to lead with SWIFT to develop the ISO 20022 JSON standards that enables more of our corporate clients and treasurers to reap the benefits of API connectivity. At HSBC we understand that the market is rapidly changing, with customers more technologically sophisticated and digitally oriented in their approach. We are thus committed to meeting the demands for an industry that is faster, more personalised and easily accessible. At HSBC we see immense value in defining an ISO 20022 JSON standard and have adopted these standards in our Treasury APIs for collections in Hong Kong”.</p>
<p>As a cooperative, SWIFT is working to minimise inefficiencies caused by heterogeneous regulatory requirements that could limit opportunities for common API frameworks and lead to fragmentation between regions. It brings its expertise in standards, specifically ISO 20022 – the standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions – to work with HSBC to define the building blocks for standardisation of Hong Kong Open APIs and ensure their further interoperability with other markets.</p>

<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> October 2019</strong> – In today’s fast-paced digital world, users are demanding ever-faster services that are evolving with the advancement of technology. Always customer-oriented and a leader in innovation, Fibank (First Investment Bank) has joined SWIFT gpi: a global solution providing fast and transparent international payments. From September 2019 the bank started offering the so-called ‘instant payments’, which significantly improve the speed and traceability of cross-border transfers. Thus, Fibank became one of the 660 banks worldwide to join the SWIFT gpi and the only one among credit institutions in the country.</p>
<p>Instant payments allow ordering and receiving payments 24 hours a day, 365 days a year<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. Funds are available to the recipient within one business day, with SWIFT data indicating that 36% of gpi transfers are received within 5 minutes of initiation. Apart from speed, a major advantage of instant payments is their traceability through the tracking identifier included in the SWIFT payment message. The importance to consumers, businesses and government institutions is evident from the over USD 300 billion sent daily through the SWIFT gpi.</p>
<p>For years, Fibank has been providing fast and secure international payment services through its extensive correspondence network, in collaboration with leading global banks. First Investment Bank maintains correspondent accounts not only in the major currencies (Euro, US Dollar, Swiss Franc and British Pound), but in various other leading currencies such as Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Russian Ruble, Norwegian Krone, etc. Seeking to meet the needs of an increasingly global business, Fibank also enables customers to make international transfers in more than 120 exotic currencies.</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> October 2019</strong> – Close to half of 580 respondents polled from corporates across five diverse industry sectors believe a subscription-based business model will be widespread in their industries in three years’ time.</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Fueled by the growth of the digital economy and consumer demand, companies in Asia Pacific are increasingly tapping into the potential of a subscription-based business model, a new Citi study shows.</p>
<p>This means companies in the region are increasingly considering and moving towards a recurring fee model where customers subscribe to consistent access to product and services, instead of making one-time purchases of goods and services.</p>
<p>Close to half or 46% of the 580 executives polled in Citi’s latest study believe that subscription-based models will be widespread in their respective industries in three years’ time and nearly a third – 31% – envision that 100% of their organization’s revenues will come from these models in the future.</p>
<p>Commissioned by Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions business in partnership with Longitude, a Financial Times Company, the study titled <a href=""https://www.citibank.com/tts/insights/articles/article81.html"" target=""_blank"">Signing up to the subscription economy: The race for recurring revenue in Asia Pacific</a> polled executives across 14 markets in the region.</p>
<p>The findings were first released at Citi Asia Pacific Treasury and Trade Solutions’ annual flagship Treasury and Finance Conference held in Shanghai in mid-September. Themed ‘Growth Through Disruption’, the conference brought together over 160 senior clients representing 115 multinational and Chinese corporates.</p>
<p>Respondents polled for the study comprised C-suite leaders and executives in digital transformation and technology, and finance and treasury roles across the following sectors - Insurance; Energy and power; Consumer goods and healthcare; Technology, Media and telecommunications (TMT); and Industrial.</p>
<p>The surveyed executives work in businesses that are at various stages of implementing a subscription-based model and over half, or 54%, work in firms earning annual revenue of US$2 billion or more. The remainder represented firms with between US$500 million and US$1.99 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p>Asia Pacific Corporate and Public Sector Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, Ernesto Pittaluga said, “Disruption has given consumers abundant choice, making customer retention a critical priority for companies. As a result, businesses are evolving their models to be direct and customer facing. At Citi, we have seen firms in sectors like Consumer goods and healthcare lead the way in implementing subscription-based models and increasingly we are seeing companies across other sectors consider its potential. Already, three-quarters of the executives surveyed in our study indicated the shift to subscription as a board-level priority and we would expect this shift to intensify over the next few years.”</p>
<p>In the consumer goods and healthcare sector, 50% of respondents believe the subscription-based model will be widespread in three years’ time. In TMT, 55% of respondents indicate that the model will be widespread within that timeframe while 44%, 40% and 42% echoed similar sentiments in the energy and power, industrial and insurance sectors respectively.</p>
<p>Rob Mitchell, CEO of Longitude, commented: “Subscription models have been around for a while but what is surprising is the pace of adoption across a range of industries in Asia Pacific. We see a major shift that is only likely to accelerate in the next few years. In the short term, a barrier to subscription-based models is reduced revenues because there is less reliance on up-front purchases. But, as these models become entrenched, companies are reporting better client retention and increased profitability.”</p>
<p>Drivers of the subscription-based model include expected long-term revenue growth and more advantageously, strong customer retention and loyalty. A vast majority – 82% – of respondents also view the shift to a subscription-based model as an opportunity to be a lead disruptor in their industry.</p>
<p>Of the respondents who are planning to implement subscription-based models, 76% anticipate a positive impact on customer retention and long-term customer relationships. A total 71% also anticipate positive impact on long-term revenue growth.</p>
<p>While respondents polled are at various stages of implementing a subscription-based revenue model, only 4% have in place a clearly defined, enterprise-wide subscription strategy. Barriers to the implementation of a subscription-based model include a lack of understanding and familiarity of the model, concerns over a short-term decline in revenue, the need for new finance and accountability processes and structures, and the need for alignment across the whole organization.</p>
<p>“Over two-thirds or 67% of respondents indicate that stronger alignment between business and finance is needed to ensure success. Our corporate clients’ end-customers increasingly expect instant fulfillment and 24 by 7 accessibility so our clients’ business models are naturally evolving. To enable and support these transitions and business models, we continue to make strategic investments and build out our capabilities to be the preferred ecosystem for corporate clients in the digital economy,” added Ernesto.</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> October 2019</strong> – Analyste has signed an agreement with Kommuninvest, for providing Analyste CashForecast for Kommuninvest’s customers. Kommuninvest provides financing services and related applications to nearly 300 organizations through their client portal KI Finans.

The application consolidates financial data from KI Finans with future operative cash flow data originating from the municipalities’ ledger systems, as well as bank statements from the end users’ banks.</p>
<p>“For us it was decisive that we can seamlessly incorporate CashForecast to our own systems and branding, without a long go‐to‐market time,” says Björn Söderlundh, Head of lending at Kommuninvest, and continues: “The feedback from our pilot customer group is promising and we expect a successful launch to contribute to increased customer satisfaction.”</p>
<p>International growth is one of the cornerstones in Analyste’s strategy. “In the beginning of the year, we set out to focus especially on growth in the Swedish market. Kommuninvest is the dominant service provider for Swedish municipalities, and this cooperation puts us straight onto the leaderboard for the Swedish public sector. It validates our strategy splendidly,” says Analyste CEO Mikko Soirola. Sanna Outa‐Ollila, Director, International Business adds: “We are excited about the opportunity to serve such a large group of organizations in different sizes and learn more about the Swedish market. The Kommuninvest team is great to work with and their active end users provide relevant feedback, making it easy for Analyste to commit to a successful launch.”</p>

<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – Ahead of its <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/finastra-universe/community-markets"" target=""_blank"">Finastra Universe Community Markets event</a> in Chicago, US, this week, Finastra has announced the launch of two new applications built on its <a href=""http://www.fusionfabric.cloud/"" target=""_blank"">FusionFabric.cloud</a> open development platform.

<p>“This is a significant milestone for our FusionFabric.cloud platform, which sees financial institutions starting to consume new applications. It also marks a revolution in how APIs can be harnessed to quickly build and deploy innovative new financial services solutions,” said Eli Rosner, Chief Product and Technology Officer, Finastra. “Financial institutions can simply visit the Fusion Store, see which apps are integrated with their core system APIs, and rapidly onboard these technologies to better serve their customers with innovative offerings in record time. Fintechs, like Allied Payment Network and Monotto, benefit from the Fusion Store ability to market their solutions to a huge customer base through this marketplace and also from Fusion Creator, our open development environment with sandbox, for rapid application creation.”</p>
<p>The Allied Payment Network real-time bill pay solution is designed to help financial institutions retain and grow their customer base. Called <a href=""https://store.fusionfabric.cloud/details/allied-bill-payment/"" target=""_blank"">Allied Bill Payment</a>, the application has come to fruition having been built in conjunction with Certified Federal Credit Union. It immediately moves funds from the user’s bank account, limiting risk to the credit union, and will soon allow an instant funds push to the biller for immediate confirmation that the bill has been paid.</p>
<p>“Consumers today have so much choice in financial providers, which is driving financial institutions to find new ways to engage their clients and remain relevant. Allied Bill Payment puts the financial institution right at the center of a consumer’s finances, allowing them to receive, store and pay their bills all in one place,” said Ralph Marcuccilli, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Allied Payment Network.</p>
<p>“FusionFabric.cloud is a game-changer – it cut our development and integration time from 10 weeks to two days, bringing Allied Bill Payment to Certified Federal Credit Union. We are so excited to work with Finastra to bring Allied Bill Payment to their vast client base.”</p>
<p>""At Certified Federal Credit Union, we are committed to delivering a world-class level of service to our members that not only keeps pace with the big banks, but surpasses them in many ways"" said James Tomasso, Vice President and CIO at Certified Federal Credit Union. ""While we may lack the size and resources of the national providers, FusionFabric.cloud is allowing us to collaborate with other fintechs to exceed our members’ expectations with access to leading-edge innovation, and the ability to quickly adapt to future needs in this rapidly evolving technology landscape. Today, Finastra's platform model has allowed us to work with Allied Payment Network to quickly implement Allied Bill Payment, Allied’s real-time bill payment solution, exceeding the functionality that other institutions are able to provide.""</p>
<p>Separately, Atlanta-based fintech, Monotto and its automated savings tool, <a href=""https://store.fusionfabric.cloud/details/robosave/"" target=""_blank"">RoboSave</a>, looks at the way users spend money, calculating how much they would need in their safety net to take on life’s emergencies. Using artificial intelligence, RoboSave determines how much consumers can save without affecting spending habits and automatically draws it into a personalized savings pot.</p>
<p>Christian Ruppe, Co-Founder and CEO at Monotto said, “While old personal finance apps rely on users taking action, RoboSave uses AI to calculate what each consumer needs as a ‘safety net’; looks at how much each consumer can comfortably save; and then automatically moves funds into a savings pot. Integrating RoboSave to FusionFabric.cloud has significantly raised demand for our app and we have contracts out with several Finastra clients. The speed at which Finastra’s clients can onboard RoboSave is quicker than one week – pre-API revolution, this was just a dream.”</p>
<p>Sang Lee, Co-founder and Managing Partner at Aite Group said, “The move to platform is prevalent but hinges on buy-in from all industry players, with fintechs, banks and credit unions collaborating and consuming to create critical mass. These latest applications demonstrate this model in play and are reflective of a wider industry trend which sees platforms gaining pace.”</p>
<p>Based on Microsoft Azure, the <a href=""https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2019/Jun/25/bobsguide-awards-2019-winners-announced/"" target=""_blank"">award-winning</a> FusionFabric.cloud was recently named ‘best cloud platform’ by industry experts and is gaining significant traction in the market.

<p>The Neptune network provides a venue for investors to consume the highest-quality data, including bond axes/inventory, from their most trusted bank counterparts. This enables institutional investors to be more effective and targeted when looking to execute large sized orders in products such as corporate and emerging market bonds.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven bond dealers are already live on the network, providing axe information in real-time for over 30,000 different securities, with over $210 billion in gross notional, across 20 different denominations, including $100 billion in US sourced liquidity.

Press release: Food and drink: an outperforming sector navigating troubled waters,"


<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – Food &amp; Drink has consistently outperformed over the past decade, helped by strong sales in overseas markets. However, latest NatWest PMI data provide an early warning that a growth slowdown has taken hold in the second half of 2019.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It is against this backdrop that we have compiled new Purchasing Managers’ Index® (PMI®) data to examine the production trends, export sales and business expectations signalled by UK Food &amp; Drink manufacturers.</p>
<p>At 49.9 in August, down from 50.2 in July, the headline seasonally adjusted NatWest UK Food &amp; Drink PMI® - a single figure measure of developments in manufacturing conditions - registered below the crucial 50.0 'no-change' value for the first time since March 2009. The latest reading is also much weaker than the average seen since the index began in 1998 (53.9).</p>
<p>The slowdown in Food &amp; Drink business conditions during August broadly mirrors the trend seen across the manufacturing sector as a whole. The equivalent IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI® reading was 47.4 during August, its lowest for seven years.</p>
<p>August data from the Food &amp; Drink PMI reveals that new business volumes were close to stagnation, with the rate of expansion the weakest for more than ten years. Softer demand conditions, especially in export markets, held back production volumes in August. The latest rise in manufacturing output across the Food &amp; Drink category was much slower than in the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>The inventory cycle appears to have amplified some of the slowdown from the peaks seen towards the beginning of the year. Before the original Brexit deadline of 31st March, stocks of raw materials were accumulated at the fastest pace since the start of the index in 1998. Post-production inventories also increased sharply as manufacturers boosted output in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are signs that risk aversion has increased among Food &amp; Drink manufacturers. Reflecting this, the latest survey data points to the largest decline in staffing numbers across the sector since June 2009.</p>
<p>Some firms have started to cast a more cautious eye towards the near-term outlook, with Brexit uncertainty and an intensification of global trade tensions taking their toll on business optimism across the Food &amp; Drink sector. While still expecting growth in the coming 12 months, the latest survey data reveals that business confidence among Food &amp; Drink producers is the lowest since this index began in 2012.</p>
<p>A key reason to be optimistic that UK food and drink producers can decouple from the recent economic slowdown is the sector's impressive record for product innovation, productivity gains, and export success in new overseas markets.</p>
<p>The export success of Scotch whisky is a perhaps case in point, which has tapped into the opportunities provided by fast-growing consumer demand in emerging markets. Whisky exports to India and Japan have doubled since 2013, while sales to China and the United Arab Emirates have risen by around 50% over the same period.</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Ian Burrow, Head of Agriculture &amp; Renewable Energy, NatWest, commented: “Following a decade of consistent outperformance, the data from the first half of this year suggests that a growth slowdown has taken hold across the Food and Drink sector in the UK. Demand has slowed – particularly in export markets – and with stocks of raw materials depleting slightly over the summer, there is no doubt that the sector is facing challenging conditions.</p>
<p>“As we look into the immediate uncertainties that we face as a consequence of Brexit, NatWest remains committed to supporting our customers through whatever changes and adjustments need to be made over the longer term. Our team of qualified experts is ready to collaborate with food and drink producers right across the UK, and to provide the advice and support necessary to help businesses navigate the challenges ahead.”</p>
<p>Sebastian Burnside, NatWest Chief Economist, commented: “In a world where growth has become harder to find the Food &amp; Drink sector makes a refreshing change and stands out as one of the UK’s top performing industries. Being so outward looking, the recent slowdown of the world economy is clearly taking its toll, but that shouldn’t detract from the remarkable growth achieved over the last decade.</p>
<p>“Focusing on the last year, output from the Food &amp; Drink industry was 2.6% higher than the previous 12 months. Solid growth against any normal benchmark, but particularly strong compared to the 1.6% managed by the broader UK economy and slight contraction of manufacturing overall.”</p>

<p>The research shows that the UK is expected to experience a major decline in trade levels of renewable and sustainable technologies – including photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and biomass over the coming years. This continues a recent trend that has seen the sector decline by 65% between 2012 and 2017. If this trend continues, projections suggest a fall of a further 75% by 2023, meaning the UK will be increasingly reliant on importing the necessary green infrastructure required to meet these ambitious targets – so where from?</p>
<p>China far outweighs all other countries in current levels of trade in renewable energy technologies, producing over two and a half times the trade volumes of the next highest country, another emerging market – Malaysia. In fact, the top seven markets are all Asian. It would, however, appear that several other emerging markets may be set for a key role. Vietnam, Chile and Thailand are all expected to post a double-digit compound annual growth rate in renewable energy technology trade for the years 2018 to 2023.</p>
<p>Mark Twigg, Executive Director, Cicero Group commented: “With the trading relationships the UK achieves with the EU and US at the forefront of the Brexit debate, our research suggests that these relationships will do little in helping us achieve our 2050 climate targets. If the UK Government really wishes to ensure that these targets represent a serious ambition, the UK will have to nurture its relationships with these emerging economies, as well as invest and champion their development.</p>
<p>Scale of the challenge: Highlighting the scale of the challenge, the UK has only managed to cut the levels of CO2 emissions by a third in the years 1990-2016. Over that same period, while the amount of electricity the UK generates through renewable sources has increased, albeit from a very low starting point, it still falls well short of what will be required in the future.</p>
<p>Andrew Roberts, Head of Research, Cicero Group commented: “Achieving the 2050 goal relies upon a fundamental shift in how we heat our homes, travel to our places of work and operate within these businesses. Any solution will not come through marginal adjustments, but from a wholesale change in our energy, transport, business and residential infrastructure. With less legacy energy infrastructure to hold them back, emerging markets are championing the technology domestically as well as well as internationally. The UK successfully achieving their 2050 goal will rely on strong post-Brexit trading relationships beyond those we hold with the EU and US.”</p>

Press release: IPO backlog grows as global IPO market slows further in third quarter,"


<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – The backlog of high-quality IPOs continues to grow as issuers await more favorable market conditions, pushing IPO activity down across many markets in Q3 2019 compared with Q3 2018. Overall, 256 IPOs came to the market in Q3 2019 with total proceeds of US$40.2b, a decrease of 24% by volume and 22% by proceeds compared with Q3 2018.The first nine months of 2019 (YTD 2019) saw a decline of 26% by deal volume (768 IPOs) and a 25% drop in funds raised (US$114.1b) versus YTD 2018. While deal numbers were down, average first-day returns on the main markets were 27% and average current post-IPO performance was 32%.</p>

<p>Technology, health care and industrials saw the largest share of IPOs in YTD 2019, together accounting for 407 IPOs (53% of global IPOs by deal volume) and raising a combined US$69.4b (61% of global proceeds). Technology continued to be the strongest sector by deal numbers and proceeds in YTD 2019, representing 23% of global deal volume (179 IPOs) and 36% of proceeds (US$41.5b). In Q3 2019, technology was also the strongest sector by deal numbers and proceeds and saw 59 IPOs (23% of global IPOs by deal volume) which raised US$11.4b (28% of global proceeds). These and other findings were published today in the EY quarterly report, Global IPO trends: Q3 2019.</p>
<p>Paul Go, EY Global IPO Leader, says: “A quiet Q3, combined with persistent geopolitical uncertainties, has led to tepid third-quarter results across global IPO markets. Although Q3 2019 IPO activity is down both in deal numbers and proceeds compared with this time last year, Shanghai’s STAR Market was launched in July 2019 to much fanfare, raising investor sentiment in that region. Elsewhere around the world, the backlog of some larger IPO issuers waiting for the winds to change continues to grow. As we enter into the traditional peak IPO season, we expect global IPO activity to pick up in the last quarter and into 2020 when there is more clarity to US-China trade tensions and developments around Brexit.”</p>
<p>Muted Asia-Pacific IPO activity lifted by Shanghai’s STAR Market; SGX among top 10 global exchanges by proceeds</p>
<p>In Asia-Pacific, YTD 2019 IPO volume was down 9% (436 IPOs) and proceeds decreased by 27% (US$46.1b) compared to the same period in 2018. The launch of Shanghai’s STAR Market offset more muted activities in Hong Kong, Japan and Australia in Q3 2019, with Asia-Pacific exchanges seeing a decline of 2% by deal volumes (173 IPOs) and 29% by proceeds (US$23.7b) in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018. Ongoing trade tensions between China and the US continue to impact IPO activity across parts of the region.</p>
<p>However, Asia-Pacific continued to dominate global IPO activity in Q3 2019, representing seven of the top 10 exchanges by volumes and five of the top 10 exchanges by proceeds. Average first day returns for IPOs on Asia-Pacific’s main markets rose to 51%, while average current returns soared to 71%, predominantly because of Shanghai’s STAR Market activity.</p>
<p>Japan saw a quiet quarter for IPO activity, with deal volume declining 57% (12 IPOs) and proceeds dropping 74% (US$488m in total) versus Q3 2018.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, performance rebounded considerably as the region saw 40 IPOs come to market with proceeds of US$2.9b. Southeast Asian exchanges saw 48% higher deal numbers and 555% higher proceeds during Q3 2019 compared with Q3 2018 (27 IPOs and US$440m in proceeds).</p>
<p>Indonesia (IDX) and Malaysia (Bursa Malaysia, ACE Market and LEAP Market) exchanges, with 21 deals and 9 deals respectively in Q3 2019, came up among the top 10 exchanges globally by number of deals. The Singapore Exchange (SGX), driven by listings of two sizeable REITS that raised US$1.37b in the quarter, came up among the top 10 exchanges by proceeds.</p>
<p>Max Loh (羅錦偉), EY Asean IPO Leader, says: “Despite ongoing market challenges, the rebound in activity on Southeast Asia exchanges during Q3 2019 reflects the backlog of IPO aspirants waiting for the right time to come to market. Southeast Asian exchanges will continue to benefit from IPOs of entrepreneur-led companies and privatization of state-owned companies and, in the case of Singapore, REITS and business trust, given its leading position in that space.”</p>
<h4>Americas IPO markets impacted by quiet third quarter and equity market volatility</h4>
<p>On a quarterly basis, the Americas saw 47 IPOs that raised US$11.9b in Q3 2019, a drop of 30% by deal volume and 10% by proceeds from Q3 2018. Both YTD 2019 IPO deal volume and proceeds also fell behind compared with the same period in 2018, with 160 IPOs in the first nine months of 2019 (a decline of 22%) and US$46.9b in proceeds (a decline of 9%).</p>
<p>However, US exchanges accounted for the majority of IPOs in the Americas region, 79% by number of deals and 95% by proceeds YTD in 2019. This was driven by several high-profile technology unicorns that have gone public so far this year. The NASDAQ and NYSE ranked first and second respectively by proceeds globally in YTD 2019.</p>
<p>Jackie Kelley, EY Americas IPO Leader, says: “Historically, Q3 has always been a quiet quarter. Yet, while IPO activity slowed in Q3 2019, the momentum we saw in Q2 2019 endures. Geopolitical uncertainty continues to play a role. However, we anticipate any increases in volatility to be temporary, with an expectation that activity will pick up in Q4 2019.”</p>
<h4>EMEIA continues to face geopolitical headwinds</h4>
<p>In EMEIA, deal volumes and proceeds were down from YTD 2018 with EMEIA exchanges posting 172 IPOs (a decline of 52%) and raising a total of US$21.1b (also a decline of 41%). Ongoing US-EU-China trade tensions have dampened both market sentiment and the economic outlook in EMEIA. At the same time, with no deal in sight, Europe and UK are bracing for the risk of a hard Brexit in Q4 2019.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, EMEIA accounted for three of the top ten exchanges globally by proceeds in Q3 2019 (Deutsche Börse with US$1.7b from 1 IPO, NASDAQ OMX with US$1.3b from 3 IPOs and India’s National and Bombay Exchanges with US$858m from 9 IPOs). Cross-border IPO activity increased slightly to 10% in YTD 2019 from 9% in 2018. Additionally, investor sentiment and appetite for IPOs could improve in Q4 2019 due to a longer than expected low interest rate environment and supportive monetary policy.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin Steinbach, EY EMEIA IPO Leader, says: “EMEIA is caught in the eye of a perfect storm. In Q3 2019, the region continued to face headwinds in the form of ongoing US-China-EU trade issues and Brexit uncertainty. IPO activity is expected to pick up after a quiet Q3 as we are heading into the most active IPO season of the year. The region is riding the tailwind from a longer-than-expected low interest rate environment, especially in Europe which is pushing investors to look for high-return assets. Moreover, investors are more selective, with an appetite for larger and higher-quality equity stories and growth investments especially in technology sectors. As we move into the final quarter of 2019, we will likely see EMEIA IPO issuers accelerate their IPO plans to get ahead of potential slower economic growth.”</p>

<p><strong>19<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.swift.com/resource/brave-new-world-be-ready-europes-new-payments-architecture"" target=""_blank"">SWIFT has today published a new paper</a> on the evolution of the European payments landscape and the preparations that need to be made by the region’s financial institutions. The paper, Brave new world: be ready for Europe’s new payments architecture, looks at the changes underway in Europe, the global context in which these are taking place and the challenging implementation timeline. It also sets out how SWIFT is supporting the industry through these changes.</p>
<p>Europe’s payments market infrastructures are being redesigned and renewed, allowing for greater operational and collateral/liquidity efficiency, and supporting innovation. The migration of Europe’s high value payment systems to ISO 20022 lays the foundations for richer, structured data end-to-end across the value chain and supports better compliance. The move to instant payments is also well underway, with many domestic initiatives either live or in the process of implementation, and two pan-European services already live.</p>
<p>Planning successfully for the go-live in 2021 of the Eurosystem’s TARGET Consolidation and the evolution of EBA CLEARING’s EURO1 demands careful consideration of the wider changes affecting the global payments landscape and the interdependencies and opportunities that will result. Understanding the pathways to future interoperability – and what will be required to fully participate in the future payments eco-systems – will be critical for financial institutions.</p>
<p>Once all the building blocks are in place, interconnected, global digital ecosystems will quickly emerge. In the near future, it will be possible to channel instant payments across borders and through domestic systems to beneficiaries’ accounts anytime, anywhere – with complete certainty and rich information.</p>
<p>Alain Raes, Chief Executive EMEA and Asia Pacific at SWIFT, said: “The financial industry is undergoing profound change. Migration to Europe’s new payments architecture will be a significant market event demanding careful planning and implementation. Financial institutions are getting ready for this huge change with an eye to the wider impacts for their business models and their customers in an interconnected, fast-changing global landscape. We are committed to supporting our community through this transformation as a trusted partner, and helping them to capitalise on the opportunities.”</p>
<h4>What’s changing in Europe</h4>
<p>The Eurosystem is modernising and consolidating its market infrastructures. Its high value payments system, TARGET2, and TARGET2 for Securities will be consolidated, and TARGET2 will be replaced with a new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system using the ISO 20022 messaging standard. The new consolidated platform will be launched in November 2021.</p>
<p>In parallel, EBA CLEARING, the privately owned provider of pan-European payment infrastructure, is evolving its EURO1 and STEP1 platforms.</p>
<p>For financial institutions, these changes will be felt in three areas: format, connectivity and processes. In turn, each of these has an impact on the end-to-end chain of applications at financial institutions, which will need to cater for the additional information that is required and carried in the new ISO 20022 messages.</p>
<p>Since the ECB’s appointment of two network service providers (NSPs) in July 2019, banks have been able to select their NSP; the final deadline for selection is July 2020. All developments must be completed by October 2020. User testing with the Eurosystem will begin in March 2021, with migration set for 22 November 2021.</p>
<p>Reusing existing SWIFT technology for ESMIG connectivity safeguards users from the risks of a complex new implementation and allows futureproofing against other infrastructure changes. With a single window, financial institutions can connect to ESMIG for all TARGET Services and to EURO1, RT1 and other infrastructures of choice.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> September 2019</strong> – Dubai has risen up the ranks of the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) to number eight position, representing its highest ever ranking.</p>
<p>The city is the only financial centre within MEASA to appear within the top 10 rankings, placing it alongside other pivotal financial hubs such as London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore. Dubai was most recently placed number 12 within the Index in March 2019 and has consistently risen within the rankings, since the Index was launched 12 years ago. Dubai has moved up 17 places since first appearing in 25th place in the inaugural report in 2007, and the latest placement represents an increase of seven GFCI rating points compared to March 2019.</p>
<p>HH Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai and President of DIFC said: “The city’s steady ascent in rankings has been driven by DIFC’s remarkable success in building an ecosystem that fosters financial industry growth. DIFC is one of the key initiatives at the forefront of Dubai’s new phase of growth and its efforts to create a business and investment environment that rivals the world’s best. In line with the vision of Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai will further increase its commitment to supporting the financial industry and making the city a leading player in shaping the future of the global financial landscape. Our sights are set firmly on the goal of becoming the No. 1 ranked global financial centre. We will also continue to work closely with the industry to help them deliver value and find new opportunities for growth.”</p>
<p>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC said: “The DIFC has been a pioneer within the financial services industry since its inception in 2004 and continues to gain global recognition as an economic powerhouse and pivotal business hub. The financial sector is a cornerstone of the UAE’s economy and the DIFC is a magnet for global investment, and the central hub for international trade. Accelerating the growth of Dubai’s financial sector is a key priority, aligned with the Fifty-Year Charter set out by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai in January 2019 to drive forward the economy.”</p>
<p>He continued: “The recognition of Dubai as a top ten global financial centre is testament to the commitment we have made to our community, our valued stakeholders and global partners. The DIFC’s continued pursuit of excellence and our focus on innovation is delivering on our blueprint for sustainable growth as we continue our journey towards transforming the future of finance. This ranking further underscores the economic potential of the region and the strong promise of Dubai as the destination of choice for international organisations, emerging companies and the financial technology leaders of the future to collaborate to deliver exponential growth.”</p>
<p>Established in 2007, the GFCI is released twice a year by London-based Z/Yen and the China Development Institute and provides evaluations of competitiveness and rankings for the major global financial centres. More than 114 centres were evaluated as part of the 26th GFCI ranking, using more than 133 instrumental factors.</p>
<p>Dubai’s ranking has been spurred by the exceptional development of the Dubai International Financial Centre, the leading financial hub in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) and home to the largest and most developed financial ecosystem in the region. The new ranking recognizes DIFC’s strengths within all five major areas of the Index including Business Environment, Human Capital, Infrastructure, Financial Sector Development and Reputation, reflecting its emergence as a broad, deep, dynamic and stable financial centre.</p>
<h4>A robust business environment</h4>
<p>The Centre has been at the forefront of developing its business environment, the number one factor influencing global competitiveness for financial centres, and enhancing its legal and regulatory framework to fuel growth opportunities within the MEASA region. DIFC has demonstrated an understanding of the need, as the leading financial hub operating in the region, to provide even greater stability for organisations conducting operations from the Centre.</p>
<p>The Centre’s robust legal and regulatory framework remains the most sophisticated and business-friendly Common Law jurisdiction in the region, aligned with international best practice. In May 2019, the DIFC’s independent regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), in collaboration with the other financial regulators across the Emirates, announced the UAE passporting regime. The regime is a regulatory mechanism for the promotion and supervision of investment funds that encourages foreign licensed firms in financial free zones based in other countries to enter the local market.</p>
<p>DIFC unveiled the new Insolvency Law in June 2019, enacted by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to facilitate a more efficient and effective bankruptcy restructuring regime for stakeholders operating in the Centre. Following this, a new unified, simplified and more expansive Prescribed Companies regime was announced by the DIFC, making structuring and financing in the Centre faster, flexible and more cost-effective, while contributing significantly to a robust pipeline from the aviation financing sector and generating substantial interest from family offices looking to utilise these structures in their succession planning.</p>
<p>In the same month, DIFC unveiled its new Employment Law in June 2019 to address key issues such as paternity leave, sick pay, and end-of-service settlements to support the workforce based in the Centre, whilst protecting and balancing the needs and interests of both employers and employees. In line with global retirement savings trends, the DIFC also launched the Employee Workplace Savings (DEWS) scheme, which will see the evolution of end-of-service benefits from a defined benefit scheme to a defined contribution scheme, while offering a voluntary savings component for employees.</p>
<h4>Human capital and talent development</h4>
<p>With more than 24,000 professionals working across over 2,200 active registered companies, the DIFC comprises the largest and most diverse pool of industry talent in the region. Investment into developing regional talent development continues to be an important factor impacting growth. As part of the Centre’s efforts to support continued professional development, the DIFC Academy offers world class financial and legal education through strategic partnerships with 26 leading educational institutions and government entities. To date, the DIFC has seen more than 5,500 graduates successfully undertake executive education courses and programmes in finance, business and law, as well as two dedicated Masters of Laws (LLM) programmes.</p>
<h4>Infrastructure to fuel sustainable growth</h4>
<p>Accessibility, transport and infrastructure have proven to be a great strength of DIFC and Dubai generally, allowing the Centre to expand and diversify. Dubai’s connectivity to the MEASA region is another significant factor enabling organisations to seamlessly service business opportunities in the wider region from the Centre.</p>
<p>The Centre experienced sustained growth in the first half of 2019, welcoming more than 250 new companies, and bringing the total number of active registered firms to 2,289, demonstrating a 14 percent increase year-on-year. The DIFC now boasts more than 671 financial related firms, an 11 percent increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p>In January 2019, the DIFC reaffirmed Dubai's mission to become a major economic force in the Middle East by unveiling the latest phase of an ambitious expansion project that will see the Centre triple in size.</p>
<h4>Financial sector development</h4>
<p>As the leading global financial centre in the MEASA, DIFC is at the forefront of financial sector advancement. The index highlights the strong presence of international institutions, government backing and diversity of financial sector offerings. DIFC’s Wealth and Asset Management market which was reported to be $424 billion in 2018 is equivalent to approximately 30% of the GCC’s combined GDP, demonstrating the financial weight of the DIFC. Key factors supporting the Centre’s competitiveness include the DIFC’s focus on boosting financial sector development, investing in innovation, strengthening the already robust FinTech ecosystem and developing partnerships with key international accelerators.</p>
<p>DIFC is home to the largest, most developed financial technology ecosystem in the region and is home to over 100 international and regional FinTech firms which have chosen the DIFC as their preferred jurisdiction from which to scale their business in the region.</p>
<p>The Centre has also witnessed a significant increase in the number of FinTechs applying to participate in the DIFC’s dedicated accelerator programmes, which has become a first step towards testing the regional market for many global start-ups. The third cohort of the DIFC FinTech Hive accelerator programme received 425 applications from start-ups operating in the RegTech, Islamic FinTech, InsurTech and broader FinTech sectors, a 42 percent increase from the 2018 programme.</p>
<p>Subsidised licensing options and access to a dedicated USD100 million FinTech Fund managed by Middle East Venture Partners (MEVP) and Wamda Capital, alongside access to partners and mentorship have created a formidable environment for FinTech to grow, expand and thrive, firmly positioning Dubai to be the FinTech hub for the region and accelerating the future of finance.</p>
<h4>Reputational advantage</h4>
<p>Dubai was recognised for reputational advantage as the top global financial centre in the region and is seen as a well-established and widely recognised leader, driving finance within the region. Innovative and global competitiveness were seen as key factors driving the ranking.</p>
<p>Dubai was ranked as the seventh FinTech location globally for Economic Potential, by fDi Markets – The Financial Times and as a top 10 FinTech hub by Financial Times Group’s The Banker, whilst DIFC FinTech Hive was been recognised as a Top 25 Financial Innovation Lab by Global Finance, confirming DIFC’s status on the worldwide stage.</p>
<p>DIFC continues to be recognised as an appealing destination to conduct business with a comprehensive lifestyle offering of more than 400 restaurants and retail offerings, three five-star hotels, seven elite art galleries and more than 100 days of unique arts, culture and wellness activations, making it the destination where business meets lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.openbankingeurope.eu/"" target=""_blank"">Open Banking Europe</a> formalizes today the creation of a PSD2 QTSP Engagement group started 9 months ago, with the objective to meet monthly to discuss and advise on practical topics related to using eIDAS for PSD2 Access to Account services.</p>
<p>The QTSPs are the Digital certificate issuers used for PSD2 identification, and they are regulated under the eIDAS directive. There is a strong need to raise awareness among the financial community, about qualified certificates, qualified certificate issuing and qualified certificate usage and who is actually issuing these certificates, and so the initiative gives the relevant QTSPs visibility.</p>
<p>Through the QTSPs group, OBE aims to help the QTSPs address common issues, to provide key information and to find practical solutions to topics related to eIDAS certificate in order to help the financial world meet electronic security requirements.</p>
<p>“I very much welcome OBE formalising a group to work with QTSPs on PSD2. The expected use of certificates in the financial regulatory world is as bewildering to the QTSP community as the digital certificate issuing world is to the payments professionals. OBE is doing an excellent job at bridging the gap.” said Nick Pope – vice chair ETSI technical committee on electronic signatures and infrastructures.</p>
<p>“We have always organised regular meetings with QTSPs but the launch of the QTSPs engagement group comes from a request of our stakeholders to find practical solutions to different topics related to eIDAS certificate that still creates a lot of confusion. I am confident that this will encourage the exchange and a mutual support to clarify some common issues related to PSD2 XS2A identification of parties.” said John Broxis, Managing Director of PRETA/Open Banking Europe.</p>
<p>Being always attentive to the QTSPs ecosystem, OBE has collaborated with ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards lnstitute since the beginning for the development of the eIDAS standards and agreed on a MOU to promote the awareness of relevant standards, practices and legislations for their different stakeholder communities.</p>
<p>The full list of Qualified Trust Service Providers members that have joined the initiative so far is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aruba PEC S.p.A – Actalis S.p.A</p>

<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – In an industry-first, HSBC today launched a new trade finance API that gives Financial Institutions (FIs) the ability to build applications for their clients, leveraging HSBCs network and capabilities. For example, FI clients will be able to give clients full visibility of their Guarantees on their own platform even when they are  delivered by HSBC to the beneficiary.</p>
<p>An API – or Application Programming Interface – enables systems to interact seamlessly and securely to exchange data and allow developers to plug-in new products and applications. HSBC is currently building multiple APIs that will provide unprecedented access and transparency to clients.</p>
<p>Surath Sengupta, Global Head of Financial Institutions, Portfolio Management and Distribution, GTRF at HSBC said: “APIs are fundamental to the digitisation of trade finance. Through the introduction of APIs we are improving the customer experience in cross-border trade by providing clients with access to the products and services they need from their platform of choice.</p>
<p>“HSBC handles half a million Bank Guarantees a year. The Bank Guarantee API is the first of several API we’re developing. We’re looking forward to working with our network partners to realise the full benefits of open banking and improve the customer experience.”</p>
<p>A Bank Guarantee assures a supplier that if the buyer doesn’t pay what it owes, the FI will step in on their behalf to make the payment. If a partner bank doesn’t have a presence in the supplier’s country and HSBC does, they can ask HSBC to reissue their Guarantee to the supplier.</p>
<p>The development of Trade Finance APIs is a key component of HSBC’s wider API strategy. In the coming months the Bank Guarantee API and further Trade Finance APIs will be added to the HSBC Developer Portal, which provides access to HSBC’s Live and Sandbox APIs.</p>
<p>ING Bank and Standard Bank are already working with HSBC to integrate the Bank Guarantee API into their banking platforms.</p>
<p>Mark Buitenhek, Global Head of Transaction Services at ING said: “Trade is an important domain for ING to innovate and create new enhanced experiences for our corporate clients. This pioneering API connection with HSBC fits perfectly in our ambitious open banking strategy, to be a bank of the future based on openness, co-petition and co-creation. More APIs will enable new open business models that we work on at ING.”</p>
<p>Kevin Holmes, Head of Trade Product management, Standard Bank Group said: “Standard Bank is partnering with HSBC in developing an API designed to provide digital status updates throughout the Guarantee life cycle. We are very pleased to be working with our strategic banking partner, further evidencing Standard Bank’s commitment to our digital client journey in trade finance.”</p>

<p><strong>19<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – Real-time payments are at the heart of the innovation agenda for the majority of banks worldwide. 96 percent of banks globally state that they will develop new and innovative services on top of their investment in real-time payments in 2019 and 2020, according to the <a href=""https://www.aciworldwide.com/lp/payments-insight-2019"" target=""_blank"">Culture of Innovation Index</a> by <a href=""https://www.aciworldwide.com/"" target=""_blank"">ACI Worldwide</a> (NASDAQ: ACIW) and leading research consultancy <a href=""https://ovum.informa.com/"" target=""_blank"">Ovum</a>.</p>
<p>The research also reveals that 92 percent of banks globally expect to grow revenue from real-time payments, reflecting the degree to which real-time has come to underpin a new wave of product innovation and revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that real-time payments infrastructure is either a direct enabler or closely linked with most of the new services and propositions banks are developing globally,” said Craig Ramsey, head of real-time payments, ACI Worldwide. “The majority of banks globally are beginning to understand that real-time payments, especially when combined with Open Banking, have a huge potential to help banks grow revenue and attract new customers.”</p>
<h4>Other key findings:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Almost half of banks (47 percent) report that real-time payments overlay services are a top three product investment priority, and one in three (27 percent) rank this as their biggest single priority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other leading areas of investment are Open Banking (33 percent), leveraging transaction data to improve services (43 percent) and removing friction from the payment authentication process (48 percent)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>95 percent of banks globally report that Open Banking has helped change the way they approach delivering new products and services; however, 75 percent still view Open Banking/APIs largely as a compliance issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>74 percent of banks plan to move mission-critical workloads into public cloud infrastructure either this or next year and 89 percent either have already made significant use of cloud or are planning to make further investments in 2019/20</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“The most innovative banks recognize that investment in real-time payments infrastructure is a strong foundation for sustainable innovation,” continued Ramsey. “Real-time payments are a key building block for delivering continuous improvements in products and services for their customers.”</p>

<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.fnality.org/"" target=""_blank"">Fnality</a> and <a href=""https://finteum.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finteum</a> today announced they are working together to deliver interoperability between the Finteum application, built on <a href=""https://www.r3.com/"" target=""_blank"">R3</a>’s Corda platform, and Fnality’s Utility Settlement Coin (USC) solution, which is based on Ethereum.</p>
<p>The interoperability focuses on intraday foreign exchange (FX) swaps between large institutions and will enable FX trading, mitigating settlement risk.</p>
<p>FX is the world’s largest and most liquid market but is traded over disparate and often outdated systems and technology, leading to duplicative processes and high pre and post trade processing times.</p>
<p>Finteum is leveraging R3’s Corda platform to create a global financial market for intraday liquidity.</p>
<p>Using Finteum, market participants now have a shared data record of their orders and trades, which means settlement will not fail and it will be easier to share market information with third parties, such as regulators.</p>
<p>Fnality is leading the USC initiative and provides a digital cash system that uses blockchain technology to settle financial transactions.</p>
<p>The collaboration will also allow for instant settlement, in effect creating a new trade settlement business model. Using Finteum, USC funds are reserved before an order is placed in the Central Limit Order Book, and the order can be subsequently cancelled, freeing up the USC.</p>
<p>Banks use the USC to transfer legal ownership of the two currencies using money held at central banks. Finteum’s platform means that this happens atomically, with either both transfers occurring together, or none at all. This version of settlement can occur 24/7, meaning less counterparty risk and fewer intermediaries.</p>
<p>Brian Nolan, co-founder of Finteum, said: “Any attempt for a bank treasurer to execute an intraday FX swap involves settlement risk and timing uncertainty in the current market.</p>
<p>“Intraday FX swaps are therefore an untapped source of value for bank treasurers.  Large banks could each save tens of millions by creating efficiencies in their intraday liquidity. Instant gross settlement doesn’t work for every use case, but is important for the initial payments in intraday FX. Using R3’s Corda platform, we are able to work with organisations at the forefront of industry change – such as Fnality – to deliver crucial responses to market needs. We want to work with three or four banks to support integration and provide feedback while we test and improve the solution and bring it closer to production.”</p>
<p>Olaf Ransome, Chief Commercial Officer at Fnality said: “In addition to cost savings, the availability of USC as a payment asset offers new revenue potential to FX trading desks, brokers, and trading platforms. They will be able to earn returns by lending out cash that they are not using, or by bringing more market liquidity to the future markets in intraday FX swaps”.</p>
<p>David E. Rutter, CEO at R3, said: “The FX settlement process needs increased transparency and traceability. Corda is fit to deliver on both counts. It was built to be fully interoperable from day one, and Fnality’s USC is a perfect example of how our platform can be used in conjunction with other systems to answer crucial industry needs.</p>
<p>“We look forward to seeing Finteum continue to create industry-leading initiatives for the financial services sector, supported by cutting-edge technology”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – A successful experiment by the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), bringing together Sainsbury's, BNP Paribas, Unilever, Barclays, Standard Chartered and Rabobank, has shown how a new model of blockchain and other data sharing technologies can enhance the sustainability of global supply chains without increasing production costs.</p>
<p>Trado: New technologies to fund fairer, more transparent supply chains shows how shared data from smallholders can increase supply chain transparency and lead to earlier, pre-shipment financing with the potential for long-term benefits for suppliers, with net zero impact on production costs.</p>
<p>The Trado model was piloted with smallholder tea farmers in Malawi who were offered a financial incentive in return for feeding social or ecological data into the blockchain. An innovative blockchain structure, enabling traceability, has been developed into a blueprint for replication, development and experimentation in other contexts. The Trado model could potentially pay for some of the investment needed to establish traceability across supply chains, although further investigation is needed to scope the model’s ability to do this while benefitting smallholders.</p>
<p>Thomas Verhagen, Senior Programme Manager, CISL, said: “This is a significant step towards the further development and understanding of how technology-driven innovation can support delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>“Collaboration between multi-nationals, financial institutions and fintech firms can harness new ways to ensure financial flows support fair and just policies and practices ready for a new financial system. The Trado model has potential for replication across a wide range of topics and we hope the blueprint will encourage others to deliver its potential for social and environmental improvement.”</p>
<p>It is estimated there are around 500 million smallholder farmers producing 80 percent of the food consumed in developing countries, with the majority likely to be found in Least Developed Countries where the cost of borrowing is high. Many large companies recognise the importance of these producers to their supply chains.</p>
<p>The Trado model enables a sustainability ‘data-for-benefits’ swap between a buyer and a seller in the supply chain using banks’ traditional supply chain financing. This swap provides parties in the supply chain with reliable data about its sustainability properties, helping to reward first mile producers such as smallholder farmers for information on their production practices.</p>
<p>The Trado model could allow for access to data by many parties in a supply chain or across many supply chains, and the data could relate to any number of topics, for example deforestation, land management, biodiversity, socioeconomic development, or verified distribution of Trado-generated benefits.</p>
<p>In exchange for the data, the buyer enables the provision of benefits by allowing a (lower) financing rate to be applied to working capital financing of the supplier. This can make a difference since suppliers often borrow money to cover their working capital needs at a higher cost than that of the buyer.  The transaction takes place using a bank’s regular supply chain financing process. The Trado model acts as an add-on, causing minimal disturbance to the bank’s business.</p>
<p>Jacques Levet, EMEA Head of Transaction Banking, BNP Paribas, said: “BNP Paribas is extremely proud to have collaborated on this project from its onset and conducted the pilot together with Unilever and the University of Cambridge. We are fully committed to supporting initiatives that promote sustainability: this is of strategic importance to our clients and for BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>“This initiative is testament to the fact that true collaboration between all stakeholders in a supply chain ecosystem, helped by the development of new technologies, can lead to more transparency and ultimately foster sustainable production. We trust and hope that this experience can be replicated in many other supply chain ecosystems and therefore contribute to meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals.”</p>
<p>For banking, the new technology has potential to offer better data, and therefore better oversight of transactions. A future application might be to enable compliance with domestic regulations such as the Climate Change Act, Modern Slavery Act and Bribery Act in the UK. Improved access to sustainability data could also help to attract clients wishing to demonstrate social and environmental leadership.</p>
<p>Michiel Teunissen, Head Innovation TCF, Rabobank, said: ""Trado shows how to translate traceability and sustainability data into real impact at smallholder level, motivating them to produce more sustainably. In our view that is the key to make supply chains more sustainable in a scalable way.</p>
<p>“Open innovation has proven once more to be a successful formula for innovating effectively. Technical expertise and agility is brought by the start-ups and large institutions provide market expertise and network.""</p>
<p>Michael Vrontamitis, Head of Trade, Europe and Americas, Standard Chartered, said: “Not enough has been done to embrace the necessity of responsible supply chains. By working closely with both established and emerging companies, Trado has been a milestone for companies in delivering increased transparency for customers, shareholders and other stakeholders to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals through their supply chains. This is part of our core principles at Standard Chartered and should be a moral imperative for all.”</p>
<p>Judith Batchelar, Director of Sainsbury’s Brand, said: “We know our customers want to know how and where the products they buy are sourced. We also want them to be confident that producers are paid a fair price and be confident that what they’re buying has been sourced ethically and sustainably. We believe blockchain and other technologies have real potential for those industries that have global, complex and fragmented value chains where absolute transparency has been traditionally difficult to achieve. The results from this pilot really showcase just how the technology can be applied, clearly illustrating who and how multiple stakeholders can benefit.”</p>
<p>Erwin Vroom, Procurement Operations Tea, Unilever said: “Access to affordable working capital is a key problem for smallholder farmers. Making more affordable working capital available to smallholders will enable them to increase investments in their farms to enhance their productivity. This is a critical step to building transparent sustainable supply chains.”</p>
<p>Tea is Malawi’s second biggest export and the sector provides livelihoods for more than 18,000 smallholder farmers. While efforts are being made to raise the national standard of living, with a living wage benchmark set in 2014, the World Bank states that the country’s national poverty rate increased slightly from 50.7% in 2010 to 51.5% in 2016. The UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) provided financing for this project.</p>
<p>Daisy Kambalame, Country Coordinator Malawi for IDH, The Sustainable Trade Initiative, said: “Through technology we can generate savings that can be further invested into improvement of tea production systems. What this means to IDH is that resources generated will be invested to enhance livelihoods and improve tea quality from Malawi and can provide solutions for low income countries.” The innovative technology for the project is used by a collective of start-ups including blockchain-based supply chain services firms Halotrade and Provenance. Consortium member Meridia provided on-the-ground data collection services in Malawi.</p>
<p>Jessi Baker, Founder and CEO, Provenance, said: “The Trado model can help businesses pay farmers more without impacting consumer prices. A brilliant proof of what can happen when a group of like-minded businesses and innovative start-ups come together, convened by a practical academic partner like the University of Cambridge, to create solutions to global problems. Our ultimate goal is for positive impact to be ‘business as usual’ which is why we created an open blueprint. We’re excited to help more businesses adopt the model and prove the impact they are having to shoppers that want to buy from purposeful brands.”</p>
<p>Shona Tatchell, CEO and Founder, Halotrade, said: “Through Halotrade’s system we were able to generate financial savings in real terms. These were returned to smallholder farmers to improve their livelihoods and help them to be</p>
<p>more sustainable, with no extra cost to the end consumer. The fact that the origin producers received the benefit was incredibly well received by consumers. The project shows how to realise new and more responsible forms of finance from which the entire supply chain can benefit. We’re excited for the next step.”</p>
<p>Kurt Kim, VP Supply Chain and Procurement, Sappi Europe, said: “In a world with increasing concern about the environmental impact of non-recyclable and non-biodegradable packaging, paper products are a great alternative. To deliver sustainable paper packaging solutions, it is of utmost importance to ensure that the wood supply originates from sustainably managed forests. This requires forest certification and a high level of transparency and incorruptible tracking systems in order to give consumers the confidence they require to make their purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>“Project Trado has offered a great opportunity to explore whether the use of Blockchain technology could add value to forest certification systems by offering a new and real-time way to trace our wood from the forest. Looking forward we will now assess possibilities for scaling up the solution together with other stakeholders including certification systems and industry partners.”</p>
<p>The Trado project was led and convened by the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL). Members of the consortium include: Barclays, BNP Paribas, CISL, the UK Government’s Department for International Development (DFID), Halotrade, IDH the Sustainable Trade Initiative, Meridia, Provenance, Rabobank, Sainsbury’s, Sappi, Standard Chartered and Unilever.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.bolero.net/"" target=""_blank"">Bolero International</a> is partnering with <a href=""http://www.traydstream.com/"" target=""_blank"">Traydstream</a>, the leader in Trade document scrutiny using artificial intelligence (AI), to provide a powerful automatic document checking service for both its corporate and bank customers saving them time and resources as well as mitigating trade finance risks.</p>
<p>Users of the Bolero digitisation platform will have the option to select Traydstream’s powerful data analytics and integrated AI tools to validate transaction documentation against the underlying trade transaction as well as a vast, evolving library of ICC trade rules. Exporters will be able to pre-check their documents prior to submission to their banks, substantially reducing the likelihood of rejection and fee-incurring delays. In the same manner banks will be able to run automatic discrepancy checks on the millions of trade documents they process making substantial savings in both time and money.</p>
<p>Shishir Vyas, Head of Partner Solutions at Traydstream, said: “Entering into partnership with Bolero is an exciting move for us, as we share a belief in the transformational capacity of digitisation. We have been growing rapidly, working with major banks and corporates and look forward to extending our highly advanced, and scalable technology to deliver cost and efficiency gains to Bolero customers.”</p>
<p>Traydstream’s modular technology extracts data intelligently, using AI and optical character recognition. It slashes the time to complete checks on the dozens of documents generated by a single shipment, using a machine learning-based engine to check against the underlying trade transaction with over a quarter million rules permutations. This is a huge advantage for all exporters and banks when trade operations expertise is in short supply and billions of trade documents are in circulation at any time. Mistakes or delays can be very costly.</p>
<p>Anchal Tiwari, VP Product Management and Strategy at Bolero, said: “This landmark partnership with Traydstream is another significant development for Bolero and is in line with Bolero’s strategic ambition to enable third parties to provide value added services to the global Bolero client base. No other platform has this level of functionality. Integrating Traydstream’s document checking service will be a great advantage for all our corporate and bank customers helping them to save time and mitigate risk exposure while reducing costs. It’s a great set of tools to offer.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.aciworldwide.com/"" target=""_blank"">ACI Worldwide</a>, a leading global provider of real-time <a href=""https://www.aciworldwide.com/about-aci"" target=""_blank"">electronic payment and banking solutions</a>, and leading global research firm <a href=""https://ovum.informa.com/about/about-us"" target=""_blank"">Ovum</a> today launched the <a href=""https://aciworldwide.outgrow.us/Innovation-Index"" target=""_blank"">Culture of Innovation Index</a>, a global cross value chain view of the factors that drive success across the banking, intermediary, merchant and corporate sectors<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. The Index identifies five types of organizations, as defined by their approach to innovation and business transformation – Laggards, Emerging, Tech-led, Advanced and Trailblazers – and provides an <a href=""https://www.aciworldwide.com/lp/payments-insight-2019"" target=""_blank"">interactive self-assessment tool</a> to benchmark organizations against peers and competitors.</p>
<p>The research, based on a global survey of almost 1,200 enterprises, reveals that retail banking and fintechs are the leading sectors when it comes to payments innovation, with regulation playing a key part in forcing industry change. The merchants and corporates that are their customers are less successful in balancing cultural, organizational and technology drivers to achieve digital transformation.</p>
<p>According to the Index, real-time payments are a significant driver of innovation among financial institutions, while merchants and corporates are focused on new payment options (especially mobile), with payment security a continuing concern. In addition, trailblazers across the sectors plan to move mission-critical workloads into public cloud infrastructure either this year or into 2020.</p>
<h4>Key APAC Insights:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>55 percent of Asian respondents rated themselves as being ahead of the industry in terms of using technology to improve internal/back-office processes, compared to only 38 percent in the US and 41 percent in Europe. 51 percent in Asia said they were ahead in bringing innovative payment services to customers, ahead of the 37 percent in the US and the 43 percent proportion within Europe. 47 percent in Asia said that they were outpacing their competition in exploiting the value of data across the business, contrasted against just 36 percent in Europe and 30 percent amongst US respondents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Asia, 52 percent of respondents said that their organisations had a clearly articulated cloud strategy, compared to 39 percent stating the same in the US, and 40 percent in Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merchants in Asia are highly focused on investing in technology; 32 percent fall into the Tech-led group, with 26 percent in the Advanced category, and only 19 percent are Laggards; in contrast, 35 percent of all merchants in Europe are classified as Laggards, while the proportion of Laggards in the US is at 34 percent (see below for more details).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“The pace of change in the payments ecosystem continues to be relentless,” said Mike Braatz, chief product and marketing officer, ACI Worldwide. “More than ever before, innovation will be a significant driver of business success. While technology is – and will remain – an important part of the answer, it is people who truly change organizations. Businesses that align cultural change with technology leadership place themselves in the best position to thrive in the future.”</p>
<p>“The aim of the Index is to identify not only the factors that separate the most innovative businesses from the laggards, but also what this means in terms of product innovation,” commented Kieran Hines, head of industries, Ovum. “Digital transformation is not a single project – it is an ethos, an approach, focused on continuously translating business challenges into a series of initiatives and projects to drive the organization forward.”</p>
<h4>Key global findings:</h4>
<h5>Banks and Intermediaries</h5>
<p><strong>Real-time is a key driver of and enabler for innovation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>96 percent of retail banks, 94 percent of corporate banks and 92 percent of intermediaries globally report that they will develop new and innovative services on top of their investment in RTP in 2019/20</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mission-critical workloads, including payments, can and should move to the cloud</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>82 percent of corporate banks, 74 percent of retail banks and 79 percent of intermediaries (84% of fintechs) globally plan to move mission-critical workloads into public cloud infrastructure in 2019/20</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capitalizing on potential of open payments is the biggest competitive differentiator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>91 percent state that the move to open banking has helped change the way they approach delivering new products and services, with 89 percent actively exploring a platform strategy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Merchants</h5>
<p>The merchant segments (telecoms, retail, digital goods and hospitality) featured in the Culture of Innovation Index are spread across the Laggard, Emerging and Tech-led categories, placing them behind fintech, retail and corporate banking in the overall ranking.</p>
<p><strong>There are significant regional differences in terms of innovation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Europe, 35 percent of all merchants are classified as Laggards, compared to 30 percent globally. European retailers particularly fall behind their global peers, with 43 percent in the Laggard category, reflecting the challenges that many have faced as a result of the rapid shift in customer habits toward eCommerce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, merchants in Asia are highly focused on investing in technology; 32 percent fall into the Tech-led group, with 26 percent in the Advanced category; only 19 percent are Laggards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merchants in the US are polarized, with 34 percent falling into the Laggards and 16 percent into the Trailblazers category, reflecting the growing gap between more traditional merchants and many of the more digital native businesses</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Customer experience is key</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Innovation in payments is focused on areas that enhance customer experience – new payment options, a focus on mobile (especially in-store), and a stronger, more seamless cross-channel payment experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security initiatives like PSD2 and SCA are driving the need for technology innovation in order to balance fraud prevention with maximizing conversion rates; regulatory requirements may drive merchants to close the innovation gap relative to banks</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> the Culture of Innovation Index, based on interviews with senior executives in close to 1,200 enterprises, scores each organization based on its plans and behaviors across a range of cultural, organizational and technology-centric factors. Interviews covered a range of topics relating to two broad themes: Inputs to the innovation process (cultural and organizational drivers of innovation, particularly the way that the organization is structured with respect to identifying changing customer needs, competitive challenges and new market opportunities) and Outputs from the innovation process (outcomes from the process, in terms of factors such as the adoption and investment in emerging technologies as well as specific product innovation relating to the business area in question). Across the study, the responses to more than 100 individual questions were scored and weighted to produce combined scores for each of the Input and Output categories. <a href=""#fnref:1"" rev=""footnote"">↩</a></p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.greshamtech.com/"" target=""_blank"">Gresham Technologies plc</a>, the leading software and services company that specialises in providing real-time solutions for data integrity and control, banking integration, payments and cash management, today announced Clareti Integration Studio (CIS) is available with new features designed to accelerate digital transformation projects.</p>
<p>Clareti Integration Studio simplifies the implementation, testing and maintenance of integrations using a model-driven architecture, a rich set of graphical tools and pre-built standards libraries for on-premise or cloud deployment. Clareti Integration Studio provides access to a library or over 40 industry messaging standards including SWIFT, SEPA, FpML, FIX as well as the ability to develop, and manage the deployment of, custom integrations across an enterprise.</p>
<p>The technology has been deployed by many of the world largest financial institutions, market infrastructures and solution providers due to its rich functionality and trusted processing performance. Organisations can benefit from reduced time to market and lower maintenance costs of building new financial products, messaging data services and application integrations.</p>
<p>The latest release provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full support for SWIFT Standards MT Release 2019 changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certification to run within Spring Cloud Data Flow – the de-facto open source integration engine to provide a full service integration engine for the Clareti platform</p>

<p>Certification by Mulesoft against Mule 4, the latest release of the most extensive commercially available integration platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New graphical capabilities for managing message schema evolution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ian Manocha, Gresham CEO, commented: “Gresham understand the challenges faced by customers who need trusted integration capabilities to support their digital programmes, new product or regulatory initiatives, and business connectivity needs. Initiatives such as PSD2 are driving new payments and digital services and for organisations to be competitive they need to be able to move fast without creating a technical debt and maintenance burden. Clareti Integration Studio enables organisations to accelerate their integration projects, from the simplest to the most complex, and to be in control.”</p>
<p>Neil Vernon, Gresham CTO, commented: “The ability to capture, manipulate and push data in multiple formats, in real-time when needed, can be a real headache for project leaders. Clareti provides access to reusable, trusted messaging that is fully maintained and readily available for fast, efficient and reliable data modelling and integration requirements. As an example, it was recently licensed by  one of the world’s largest clearing houses for the transformation of FpML and FIXML messages. Clareti Integration Studio enables organisations to put the power of the platform to work for virtually any type of custom integration with complete confidence.”</p>
<p>Gresham (Stand F107) is an exhibitor at the SWIFT Sibos 2019 event in London, 23 to 26 September.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>16<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – TreasurySpring, the London-based financial technology company today announced the closing of its latest capital raise, securing £2m of investment in a round that was led by ETFS Capital, with participation from MMC Ventures and existing investors. The round was more than three times oversubscribed and the company has now raised more than £3.5m since its first external capital injection in November 2017.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring was voted one of the top 3 fintech startups in Europe at the prestigious Money 20/20 conference in June 2019, before publicly launching its digital Fixed-Term Fund (FTF) portal in July, following a year of rigorous beta testing. It has already issued more than $600m of FTFs to clients from multiple sectors.</p>
<p>The firm was co-founded in 2016 by long-term business partners Kevin Cook (CEO), Matthew Longhurst</p>
<p>(COO) and James Skillen (CTO) to unlock the multi-trillion dollar wholesale money markets by providing new digital pipelines to connect cash-rich firms to institutional borrowers from the sovereign, bank and corporate sectors.</p>
<p>FTFs enable all holders of large cash balances, from corporates to charities, private funds to insurance companies, family offices to private banks and beyond, to reduce and diversify risk on those balances, whilst simultaneously increasing returns. For investment-grade firms seeking financing, TreasurySpring’s FTF platform provides flexible, low-cost access to a diverse universe of new short-term funding sources.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the financing round will be invested in the development of the platform’s core technology and the expansion of TreasurySpring’s sales, technology and operations teams to meet the growing demand for FTFs.</p>
<p>Graham Tuckwell, Chairman, ETFS Capital said: “We see many analogies between what TreasurySpring is building in the cash management space and the very successful business that we built over the last 15 years in the exchange-traded products market. They have developed a simple, unique and powerful way to offer access to a huge, desirable segment of the market that is currently unavailable to most institutions. We are delighted to have this opportunity to invest, as well as to increase our use of the platform. The ETFS Capital team is looking forward to supporting the team with more than just capital as they continue to grow their business.”</p>
<p>Kevin Cook, Co-founder and CEO, TreasurySpring, said: “We are delighted to welcome our new investors ETFS Capital and MMC Ventures. Their capital injections, together with the funds that we have raised from more than 40 senior financial markets professionals over the last two years, put us in a really strong position to accelerate our growth by further building our team, our public presence and our product offering. We are grateful for the financial and non-financial support from all of our investors and we are excited about what we can achieve with the proceeds of this funding over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p>Alex Schmid, Managing Partner, ESO Capital, added: “We were the first external investor in TreasurySpring because we saw the huge opportunity that Kevin and the team had identified and strongly believed in their ability to deliver on their vision. Over the last two years they have achieved everything that they set out to do and more, so we were very comfortable following on from our initial investment for a second time. As a client of the platform, we have seen first-hand the value that it can bring in reducing the risk and simultaneously increasing the returns that we earn on our surplus cash.”</p>

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – PRETA announced today that SOCIETE GENERALE has joined the growing community of over 300 financial institutions relying on PRETA Open Banking Europe (OBE) Directory to support on the PSD2 access-to-account compliance processes.</p>
<p>The OBE Directory is a pan-European, single, standardised, machine-readable repository for active regulated entities that can perform access-to-account (XS2A) services across Europe. PRETA OBE Directory will provide SOCIETE GENERALE with a key service to identify authorised Third Party Providers (TPPs), which will support the financial institution in ensuring compliance with the access-to-account security requirements of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and regulatory technical standard that will become effective on 14 September 2019.</p>
<p>Apart from pooling the information provided by the different national TPP registers, the OBE Directory also contains additional operational information to help provide some transparency to TPPs and account-servicing payment service providers (AS-PSPs), especially regarding cases where brand name differ from the legal name of the entities with access to the account.</p>
<p>The partnership with PRETA supports SOCIETE GENERALE’s vision to pool operational, technical and compliance efforts in the context of the implementation of the required Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) under the PSD2 regulatory requirements, so that the Group can focus on the development of its core business and on the relationship with its customers.</p>
<p>Nicolas Cailly, Head of Payment and Liquidity Management Solutions at SOCIETE GENERALE group stated: “The effort required to understand 31 national registries, each holding multiple types of payment service provider information, is huge, but the PRETA OBE Directory initiative will make our task much easier as SOCIETE GENERALE group is deploying the BERLIN GROUP API for its European cash management activities as well as the STET API for its French retail and SME market.”</p>
<p>John Broxis, Managing Director of PRETA/Open Banking Europe commented: “We are very pleased to see a major pan-European banking group such as SOCIETE GENERALE joining the PRETA OBE initiative. SOCIETE GENERALE, together with other pioneer banks in Europe, has been actively participating in the design of our directory from the start. The road to PSD2 access-to-account has proven to be complex and our centralised directory is there to make the journey easier and facilitate interoperability between the various market participants.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – SWIFT today publishes a new API standard for the Pre-authorisation of funds, paving the way for further innovation in financial services enabled by open banking.</p>
<p>The new standard allows a payer’s bank to earmark funds for a purchase in advance, guaranteeing that the future payment will be honoured. It is the second of SWIFT’s Open Banking Extensions API standards, and is the latest addition to a global library of APIs that SWIFT is building in collaboration with banks, merchants and fintechs. SWIFT published a Pay Later API standard earlier this year.</p>
<p>API standards play an important role in open banking because they help speed the rollout of new services while reducing incremental investment. If each bank offers a distinct API, merchants and fintechs have to adapt to different data structures, workflows and security considerations for each one – adding complexity, cost and time for implementation. SWIFT has long been at the forefront of banking standardisation and is well suited to lend its expertise and experience to this work in APIs.</p>
<p>The new Pre-authorisation standard is now available for developers of APIs to adopt and use.</p>
<p>Stephen Lindsay, Head of Standards at SWIFT, said: “SWIFT is uniquely positioned to tackle the problem of fragmentation in standards globally and we are pleased to expand our current role to include the global standardisation of open banking APIs. Our work on the pre-authorisation of funds API is another example of the central part we are playing in ensuring the industry can make the most of the new open banking landscape.”</p>
<p>Kirstine Nilsson, Head of Business Infrastructure, Consumer Payments &amp; Cash Management, Swedbank said: ""In the Nordics we know the benefits of collaboration in the standards space. We have built the world leading BankID service and the Swish payment method. We are now collaborating on the P27 pan-Nordic clearing system. The banking industry must come together for the benefit of the digital economy to standardise retail and wholesale banking APIs. Developers these days don’t want to do host connections or SFTP connections – APIs are the way forward and SWIFT is the perfect body to deliver global consistency.""</p>
<p>Hiroshi Kawagoe, General Manager, Transaction Business Planning Department, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation said: “Every country is following the developments of ‘Open Banking’ with great interest, beginning with a regulatory regime designed to catalyse developments. We can already see that each country is developing their own formats and that sometimes individual banks are developing their own formats. This kind of fragmentation may not be ideal as the banking industry progressively opens up more advanced services through API. Therefore, there is a need to discuss standards, just as we have achieved with the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and in many other areas.”</p>
<p>Tony McLaughlin, Managing Director, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi said: “The SWIFT Pre-Authorization API is further validation that banks, Fintechs and merchants can collaborate to build Open Banking APIs that go beyond the regulatory minimums to support vitally important use-cases. The global banking community must come together to provide the full suite of retail and wholesale banking APIs so that we can provide the financial layer of the digital economy. The world of platforms provides unlimited new opportunities for banks if they adopt an ‘API first’ mindset.”</p>

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – Ahead of Sibos 2019, <a href=""http://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> commissioned IDC to survey 400 corporate treasurers around the world to reveal key treasury priorities. The findings* show that access to funding, risk management and improving usability are top of mind for treasurers today. Looking three years ahead, these challenges are expected to diversify to include demand for real-time capabilities and liquidity optimization, meaning new business models, which will drive a greater focus on open platforms for banks to deliver enhanced services at scale.</p>
<p>Today’s top three key priorities for corporate treasurers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>84% Improve access to funding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>57% Predict and manage risk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>53% Improve usability and staff productivity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By 2022, treasurers expect their priorities to change and diversify:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>59% Get real-time data and payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>54% Improve access to funding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>52% Predict and manage risk</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>47% of corporate treasurers see opportunities for banks to improve their product offerings to provide more innovative solutions – beyond traditional services. This presents opportunities for banks to partner with ecosystem players and deliver value-added services.</p>
<p>“APIs and cloud-based solutions will be critical if banks are to deliver on the changing requirements outlined by corporate treasurers,” said Torsten Pull, Senior Vice President &amp; General Manager for Corporate Banking at Finastra. “Open Banking and evolving treasury technologies are transforming the corporate sector, forcing financial service providers to evaluate the role they want to play in the digital ecosystem. We’re also seeing changes in both bank and corporate treasury business models, with greater importance placed on collaboration and choice, particularly through the creation of digital treasury platforms. Platforms like Finastra’s FusionFabric.cloud will allow banks and their corporate clients to co-innovate and co-develop new solutions.”</p>
<p>The new IDC Infobrief, Treasury Ecosystems- Opening Today for Tomorrow, reinforces this fundamental change to transactional business and operating models. Most notably, they expect that the increasing impact of intelligence, automation and the ecosystem will result in the emerging role of the Platform Player. Organizations that take this route will re-engineer their business models, becoming end-to-end service providers to the customer. The combination of cloud, hyper-automation and data analytics will allow banks to use their data, operations, license and technology to deliver Business Process as a Service propositions. Other models include Product Providers, focused on incremental improvement of services, and Relationship Banks which will re-invent customer relationships and act as a trusted advisor.</p>
<p>Thomas Zink, Research Director at IDC writes in the research, “The finance function is transforming at pace, led in large part by the growing importance of the role of the corporate treasurer, and treasury more broadly – now recognized as an essential change agent for the business. With this role change, we are witnessing the transformation of the treasury department into a data-driven, highly automated arbiter, equipped to optimize liquidity and enable future investments, and able to predict and hedge against volatilities in the market better than ever before.”</p>

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – FXD Capital is pleased to announce the appointment of Justin Meadows as Non-Executive Director with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Justin Meadows, founder and former CEO of NEX Treasury (formerly MyTreasury), an award-winning platform that connects a global community of Treasurers, Banks and Money Market Funds. NEX Treasury was a division of NEX Group, formerly ICAP’s electronic FX and fixed income business which in 2018 was acquired by CME Group for £3.9bn.</p>
<p>Chris Huddleston, Co-Founder and CEO of FXD Capital, said: “Justin is a great addition to our board and signifies the next phase of our ambitious growth plans”.</p>
<p>FXD Capital was founded in 2018 by Chris Huddleston and Bobby Jackson, having spent almost a decade working at one of the UK’s leading specialist banks. FXD works with corporates, institutions, government agencies and not-for-profit organisations by helping clients to reduce counterparty risk, enhance liquidity and achieve better returns on their cash deposits. Bridging the gap between depositor and bank, FXD offer term deposits, notice accounts and money market funds from a diverse range of banks and asset managers.</p>
<p>Justin Meadows, said: “FXD Capital meets my investment and involvement criteria in that what it offers is simple but powerful and truly unique. Their high-quality relationships are being used to help treasuries proactively improve their capital efficiencies without corresponding increase in risk. What they do for each and every client is bespoke and builds on their years of experience to achieve outcomes that simply aren’t accessible to cash managers who don’t have the same breadth and depth of knowledge of the market and its participants. What’s refreshing to see is the interest of FXD Capital in really understanding their client’s needs as well as the banks funding requirements leading to optimum solutions on all sides. They represent the logical next step in the evolution of traditional voice broking to deliver a powerful ecosystem of voice and electronic trading for cash managers of all sizes, types and levels of sophistication.</p>
<p>Bobby Jackson, Co-Founder and MD of FXD Capital, said: “Justin founded MyTreasury signifying a behavioural change nearly a decade ago. Back then a real emphasis was diversification and a more efficient route to market. The cycle we find ourselves in again is a very similar place to where Justin once was, and we are looking forward to his involvement in the business to continue to challenge the status-quo”.</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> September 2019</strong> – Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy is nothing more than a high-risk gamble for the UK economy, warns the CEO of one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory organisations.</p>
<p>The stark warning from Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, comes as it is revealed that several billion pounds have been pulled out of UK equity funds since Mr Johnson became Prime Minister amid growing fears of a no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p>Mr Green says: “There’s an ongoing and growing shift out of the UK and into the EU by international fund managers as Boris Johnson’s political manoeuvres continue to increase the likelihood of Britain leaving the EU with no-deal.</p>
<p>“Tens of billions have already outflowed from UK equities since the referendum - and the haemorrhaging in this area doesn’t show any sign of stopping.</p>
<p>“In addition, Brexit has already cost the UK economy more than £66bn in under three years, according to S&amp;P; Global Ratings.”</p>
<p>He continues: “Britain’s global reputation as a pro-business, stable, secure jurisdiction to invest in and do business has taken a hit since the referendum in 2016. It’s now fading fast as the Prime Minister ramps up his ‘do or die’ approach to Brexit as parliament returns.</p>
<p>“On Monday Mr Johnson threatened to sack Conservative MPs who fail to support his government in the battle over planned legislation designed to block a no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p>“Also this week, the first adverts will be released as part of Boris Johnson’s new £100million campaign to get ready for Brexit.</p>
<p>“The biggest public information campaign since World War Two will run across TV, social media and billboards for the next two months.”</p>
<p>Mr Green goes on to say: “All these measures are, of course, tactics; they’re a very public display of defiance to the EU to pressurise them to reopen negotiations and/or give concessions to the UK.</p>
<p>“But this so-called ‘strategy’ is nothing more than a high-risk gamble. Of course, it might work at the eleventh hour. But if it fails, the consequences for the UK economy will be serious and far-reaching.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that any political leader should be playing poker with their nation’s economy at stake.”</p>
<p>The deVere CEO concludes: “Now parliament has returned from summer recess, it must put in as much work into getting a deal as preparing for no-deal.”</p>

<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> September 2019</strong> – With the UK parliament plunged into a historic crisis, it is essential to take steps to safeguard your wealth, warns the boss of the one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory organisations.</p>
<p>The warning from Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost the first round of a 48-hour Brexit battle in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Mr Green says: “People might be bored by Brexit – but this is one of the biggest weeks in UK politics in decades and it will affect domestic and global investors.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister lost his tiny working majority on Monday afternoon in an explosive session in the House of Commons, and now he's lost his first Parliamentary Brexit battle.  In fact, Boris Johnson is the first prime minister in history to lose his first Commons vote.</p>
<p>“MPs have, in effect, seized control of Parliament and will try and force through legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p>“This now means that Boris Johnson will likely call a general election to be held next month in order to take control of parliament to go back to the EU with a convincing mandate.</p>
<p>“And this all comes after the PM controversially threatened to sack his own MPs who failed to support him in this vote.”</p>
<p>He affirms: “So many major question marks loom over the chain of events playing out in Westminster – not least because a general election needs the support of Labour.</p>
<p>“Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, after months of calling for an election is now demanding no-deal is off the table before he agrees to go to the polls.</p>
<p>“In truth, all major parties are being tested like perhaps never before, there are major divisions in all camps, plus there is likely to be serious tactical voting in a general election.”</p>
<p>The deVere CEO goes on to say: “Should MPs prevent a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month, we can expect the pound to get a boost. But at the same time, political upheaval and a general election will likely push sterling down. As such, the UK’s currency remains volatile and vulnerable.”</p>
<p>He adds: “With the UK parliament plunged into a historic crisis, it is essential for domestic UK investors and international investors with exposure to UK assets to take steps to safeguard their assets.</p>
<p>“The investors best weapon to do this? Ensure their portfolios are properly diversified across asset class, sector and regions, and to remain invested to take advantage of the upsides.”</p>
<p>Mr Green concludes: “A good fund manager will help you seek out the opportunities that turbulence creates and mitigate potential risks as and when they are presented.”</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> September 2019</strong> – The Chief Executive of the Chartered Institute of Credit Management Philip King has given a cautious welcome to the Government’s call for evidence in tackling late payment but warned against actions that may ‘throw the baby out with the bathwater.’</p>
<p>He says that while the possibility of increased powers for the Small Business Commissioner (SBC) is logical, the suggestions of fines and sanctions for transgressors will need further consultation and thought, especially as regards to how any ‘punishments’ will be enforced.</p>
<p>He also says that proposals to encourage SMEs to better utilise payment technology lack any detail as regards what type of technology is being proposed and how such technology will be funded.</p>
<p>“Much of what is included in the document from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is aspirational, and while those aspirations should be welcomed, it will be the detail that is now important,” Philip says.</p>
<p>He similarly highlights the proposal to review the role of Supply Chain Finance: “David Cameron encouraged Supply Chain Finance when he was in power, but the problem is that current Payment Practices Reporting (PPR) can potentially penalise businesses for offering it, so this will need further consideration. It will need to be very clear what the benefits are and how they can be maximised whilst mitigating the risks.”</p>
<p>The call for evidence references the Prompt Payment Code, and says the government will consult on how the Code could be further strengthened. It also proposes a tougher approach to PPR: “The <a href=""http://www.cicm.com/"" target=""_blank"">CICM</a> is already working closely with the Small Business Commissioner and has long advocated the concept of transferring responsibility for the Code to the SBC in a phased approach.</p>
<p>“Since our remit changed to publish the names of those suspended from the Code, businesses, politicians and the media have at last been able to see how the Code is both a carrot and a stick in driving positive payment behaviours. If the Code has struggled in the past, that has been principally down to lack of funding and a failure to understands its true purpose and its powers.”</p>
<p>In terms of PPR, Philip says it is already a criminal offence for businesses not to meet their statutory reporting obligations, so again this will come down to enforcement: “Obliging larger firms to appoint a member of the Board with specific responsibility for late payment will support this and help late payment and the treatment of suppliers to move further up the Boardroom agenda.”</p>
<p>The CICM, Philip says, welcomes the measures and proposals overall: “If adopted in the right way they can help drive the change in culture that has been the objective of so much of our work in this area for many years. We need government to turn words into the right actions, and we need to continue to highlight that good credit management sits at the centre of so much of what is required to change that culture.”</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – As the pound nosedives and the UK faces a looming recession, those with UK financial assets – including UK pensions, bonds and sizeable holdings of sterling – should consider international options to protect their wealth.</p>
<p>This is the message from the chief executive and founder of deVere Group, Nigel Green, after the Queen accepted UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government request to suspend parliament from mid-September. The move now reduces the time available to MPs to block a no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p>Mr Green affirms: “The already Brexit-battered pound has taken yet another hammering thanks to Boris Johnson’s highly controversial suspension of parliament.</p>
<p>“Sterling is down more than 0.5% against both the euro and U.S. dollar as a result of the political manoeuvring.</p>
<p>“The pressure will remain on for the pound for the foreseeable future as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit increases. Should the UK leave with no-deal, the pound is likely to remain weak for several years until the country and the bloc readjusts.</p>
<p>“In addition, the likelihood of a general election is weighing on the currency.</p>
<p>“And should a Corbyn-led Labour party win such an election, there will be even more longer-term bad news for the pound. His anti-business rhetoric, and high tax and low-profit policies would lead to a considerable and sustained selling of the pound.</p>
<p>“There’s also now the serious possibility of a general strike, mass protests and civil disobedience as political uncertainty intensifies.”</p>
<p>He adds: “This critical period for Brexit negotiations is also happening as the UK economy is potentially on the brink of a harmful recession which will deliver another bloody nose to investment, trade and confidence in the UK.”</p>
<p>Mr Green continues: “Looking at the nose-diving pound and a looming UK recession, the outlook is somewhat bleak in Britain. Those with UK financial assets – including UK pensions, bonds and sizeable holdings of sterling – should now perhaps consider the available international options to protect their wealth.”</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, the deVere CEO noted: “Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament will have far-reaching economic effects, many of which will not be known for years to come.”</p>
<p>He concludes: “Those who are serious about building and safeguarding their assets should explore legitimate overseas options as the UK moves into an unprecedented crisis.”</p>

<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – According to almost two-thirds of CFOs (65%), digital transformation will result in fewer jobs, despite the fact that 32% of organisations aren’t currently undergoing this change, with 23% not planning to look at digital transformation for at least a year or more, as discovered in the <a href=""https://www.onguard.com/media/whitepaper/real-time-and-non-stop-traditional-finance-cycles/"" target=""_blank"">FinTech Barometer 2019</a>, the annual survey by fintech company <a href=""https://www.onguard.com/"" target=""_blank"">Onguard</a>.</p>
<p>For CFOs, there are significant reasons to start digital transformation, with improving the customer experience cited as the ultimate goal (45%), shortly followed by increasing efficiency in businesses processes (43%). Almost half of CFOs (46%) report that their own department has progressed furthest with digital transformation. However, with many organisations still yet to begin their digital transformation journey, there’s a missed opportunity to improve customer experience and reap the rewards.</p>
<p>Bert van der Zwan, CEO at Onguard, said: “It is notable that digital transformation isn’t going to be on the agenda for 23% of CFOs for a year or more. However, this does explain why many companies have not yet got to the point of improving the customer experience through digital transformation.”</p>
<h4>Use of fintech for digital transformation</h4>
<p>The financial world has been given a wake-up call by the arrival of a host of disruptive fintech companies that live and breathe digital transformation. The majority of CFOs (83%) report that they are already working with an innovative fintech or are developing financial software themselves. For CFOs, the principal reason for working with a fintech company is to make credit management easier (70%). Just 17% of CFOs are carrying on as they always have and are not working with a fintech.</p>
<p>“In order to be successful outside, you have to start inside the organisation. When all the processes are sorted out internally, it’s time for an organisation to look outward and raise customers’ experiences to a higher level,” added van der Zwan. “Thanks to digital transformation it is easy for organisations to collect all sorts of data about customers. This data is processed in real-time and provides insight, so that an organisation can respond even better to the customer’s behaviour and can even predict whether a customer is going to pay their invoice. Ultimately, this will lead to a better customer experience.”</p>

<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.identitii.com/"" target=""_blank"">Identitii Limited</a>, the FinTech reducing last mile payment hold ups for banks and corporates, announces it has signed a new licence agreement (Agreement) to provide its Overlay+ platform to HSBC Bank Australia Limited (HSBC Australia).</p>
<p>This represents the second licence agreement for Identitii’s technology under its existing Global Framework Agreement (Global Framework Agreement) with HSBC Global Services UK Limited. It is consistent with the Company’s growth strategy to build on the relationship with its existing customer, as well as signing up new customers. The expanded Agreement is for an initial five-year term, with a minimum contract value of $511,600 with scope to be extended. Termination clauses are consistent with the current HSBC Global Framework Agreement with Identitii.</p>
<p>The new licence will generate material revenue for Identitii through a combination of professional service fees for upfront technology implementation work and an ongoing monthly licence fee. The implementation work is expected to be completed in Q2 2020 and Overlay+ is expected to go live with HSBC Australia thereafter.</p>
<p>The Overlay+ platform enables peer-to-peer communication of any type of data or documents between parties and to regulators. It facilitates the secure sharing of structured or unstructured settlement data along with clearing, remittance and regulatory reporting information, creating a permissioned audit trail of activity for each transaction.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new agreement, Identitii CEO, Nick Armstrong said: “We are very happy to announce that we have signed a new licence agreement for Overlay+. This is our second technology license with HSBC and it delivers on a key part of our growth strategy, which is deepening relationships with existing customers. It also represents the commercialisation of a new use case for Overlay+, which seamlessly integrates with existing systems to ensure compliance with regulatory reporting requirements”.</p>

<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – Brexit will be Great Britain’s second Suez crisis according to Dr Mamdouh G Salameh, visiting Professor of Energy Economics at ESCP Europe and international oil economist.</p>
<p>The Suez crisis in 1956 was not only a blow to British prestige, it also led to a shrinking of the British economy, a devaluation of the pound Sterling and ejection of Britain as a major player on international stage.</p>
<p>As with the Suez debacle, Brexit has already had a similar adverse impact on the British economy, gross domestic product (GDP) investment and the value of the pound even before the UK actually left the European Union (EU), says Dr Salameh.</p>
<p>Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman, estimates that Brexit could cost around 2% of GDP. Other studies suggest that Britain’s GDP could shrink by 2.0%-4.5% and per capita income by 1%–10%. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reduced its 2020 economic growth forecast for the UK to zero with the British economy in fact shrinking. By the beginning of April 2019, banks had transferred more than $1 trillion out of Britain and asset management and insurance companies transferred US$130 billion out of Britain.</p>
<p>Since the referendum, the pound sterling has lost more than 23% of its value against the dollar and 8% against the euro. Furthermore, a weak pound raises British import bill adding to domestic inflation and budget deficit.</p>
<p>Dr Salameh says “because of the self-inflicted damage on the British economy by Brexit, there is a growing tide among the British public for a second referendum that could reverse the outcome of the first referendum thus enabling Britain to bury Brexit forever. He added “that a second referendum is the only solution to the political and economic crisis debilitating the UK and also threatening to dismember the Union”.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>14<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – LBBW and Commerzbank have once again executed a trade transaction between Voith and KSB SE, via the Marco Polo trade finance network, built on R3’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, Corda. This time, besides the two companies involved, logistics provider Logwin AG was incorporated into the digital process chain – directly, and in real time. This represents a milestone in the expansion of the digital trade finance ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the transaction, order and delivery data were agreed upon between the companies via the international Marco Polo trade finance network. Payment terms were secured by an irrevocable payment commitment, triggered through automated matching of trade data. For the first time, automatic matching of trade data was achieved with involvement of the executing logistic provider, in this case Logwin, which entered the relevant transport details directly into the network.</p>
<p>An important objective of the Marco Polo network is to obtain all trade data necessary for a transaction as directly as possible, from the original data source. This also includes external third parties such as logistic providers. The data transfer for this transaction was executed via the DLT platform simultaneously to the settlement of the real trade transaction.</p>
<p>Gerald Böhm, Head of Guarantees and Trade Finance at Voith, said: “For the first time, we have processed the purchase and delivery of special hydraulic couplings from Germany to Taiwan using blockchain technology. We executed this transaction with KSB, the leading pump and valve manufacturer, via the Marco Polo network. We are delighted that this pilot transaction marks a further important milestone in the development of Distributed Ledger Technology for more efficient trade finance processes.”</p>
<p>“Now, an independent third party – in our case the logistics provider – is able to trigger a payment obligation in favour of the supplier This significantly enhances the value of the payment commitment”, explained Matthias Heuser, Head of International Trade and Payment Solutions at LBBW.</p>
<p>“As a buyer, together with our bank we can ensure that the payment commitment becomes effective only if the goods are actually in the hands of the logistics provider, and on their way to the delivery destination”, explained Ralf van Velzen, Head of Export Financing at KSB SE &amp; Co. KGaA.</p>
<p>“For Logwin, participation in the real-time transaction with parallel data transfer has shown just how much potential there is in the DLT technology – how it helps to significantly simplify and accelerate the processes – on the part of the logistics partners as well as their customers”, confirmed Managing Director Lars-Erik Poths and Key Account Manager Konstantin Wunsch at Logwin Air + Ocean Deutschland GmbH.</p>
<p>“The goal for future development is to expand the Marco Polo network, bringing additional relevant parties for trade transactions on board – such as insurance companies, inspection authorities, local chambers of commerce, etc. In this way, the entire supply chain can swiftly and digitally be mapped”, added Enno-Burghard Weitzel, Commerzbank’s Global Head of Trade Finance Products.</p>

<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – Westpac has delivered an Australian first in e-procurement, by partnering with Coupa, a leader in Business Spend Management (BSM), to help businesses more efficiently manage their spending within a comprehensive cloud platform. The partnership enables customers to reduce risk, improve compliance, automate manual and inefficient tasks, and ultimately, deliver cost savings to the business.</p>
<p>Westpac is the first bank in Australia to transform payables and purchasing through cloudbased procurement solutions for its customers. Coupa’s industry-leading Business Spend Management platform has been deployed by over 750 organisations, including MGM Resorts International, Salesforce, and Unilever.</p>
<p>“Corporates have invested heavily in improving the way they receive payments from customers; however, we haven’t seen the same advancements in how payments are made to suppliers. In many cases, the payables process remains inefficient, paper-based, and prone to errors. Our partnership with Coupa is the first major step towards frictionless supplier payments and delivering end-to-end automation across the working capital cycle.” said Di Challenor, Westpac Institutional Bank’s General Manager, Global Transaction Services.</p>
<p>“By combining the Coupa BSM Platform with Westpac’s eInvoicing, payments and reconciliation solutions, CFOs have real-time oversight into their organisations’ spending behaviour, allowing them to proactively identify and address small problems before they turn into big issues,” Ms Challenor said.</p>
<p>Organisations with large procurement spend or complex supplier relationships will get realtime visibility on budgets, increased purchasing power, and more efficient processes.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to partner with one of Australia’s leading institutional banks. This partnership means we’re in a strong position to help CFOs and finance teams get full visibility and control to drive real value across the business and the bottom line. This will result in some exciting procurement innovations for our mutual customers,” said Roger Goulart, senior vice president of Business Development and Alliances at Coupa.</p>
<p>In addition, with more than $1.2 trillion of cumulative spend under management, Coupa is leveraging the wisdom of the BSM community along with the latest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver real-time prescriptive insights and benchmarks to customers. As a result, smarter spend decisions can be made, including the potential to enhance the use of working capital through increased Days Payable Outstanding, real-time payments, and eInvoicing when the Australian and New Zealand Government’s <a href=""https://treasury.gov.au/consultation/e-invoicing"" target=""_blank"">electronic invoicing standards</a> are adopted.</p>
<p>According to Di Challenor, the Coupa platform also offer benefits for small to medium size businesses supplying to large organisations.</p>
<p>“Unlike some other e-procurement platforms, suppliers get access to the Coupa Supplier Portal for free,” Ms Challenor said.</p>
<p>“The digitisation of purchase orders, invoicing and payments can’t come fast enough for many smaller suppliers who have no visibility over when they will get paid and struggle to manage cashflow due to today’s inefficient paper-based processes,” she said.</p>
<p>Westpac’s moves also anticipate the Government’s increased focus on digitising procurement and adoption of the Australian Supplier Payment Code helping corporates remain at the forefront of compliance and regulatory change.</p>

<p><strong>13<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.castsoftware.com/"" target=""_blank"">CAST</a>, a leader in Software Intelligence, today released its <a href=""https://content.castsoftware.com/cloud-migration-2point0-shifting-priorities-for-application-modernization-in-2019"" target=""_blank"">annual global cloud migration report</a>. The report analyzes application modernization priorities in financial and telecommunications firms.</p>
<p>Findings show critical missteps mean cloud migrations are falling short of expectations in mature institutions, just 40% meeting targets for cost, resiliency and planned user benefits. Lack of pre-migration intelligence and fear of modernizing legacy mainframe applications are the main drivers for these shortcomings. Adoption of microservices as a modernization technique is also faltering from lack of financing.</p>
<p>While these legacy process institutions realise only third of their target benefits for cloud migration, cloud-native approaches are enabling FinTech firms to outperform traditional banks, achieving more than half their target benefits.</p>
<p>Fewer than 35% of technology leaders use freely-available analysis tools. There is a systematic failure to assess the underlying application readiness for cloud migration with Software Intelligence, a deep analysis of software architecture. IT leaders must ensure the right architectural model and compliance is in place to avoid increasing technical debt. Unchecked, this leads to more IT meltdowns such as <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/tsb-it-failure-cost-compensation-customers-switch-current-account-a8757821.html"" target=""_blank"">TSB’s £330m re-platforming crisis</a> in 2018, with customers paying the expensive price for these mistakes.</p>
<p>More than 50% of banks and telcos are effectively taking leaps of faith, not undertaking essential analysis-led evaluations to support and facilitate cloud migrations. Instead, half the CTOs surveyed use gut instinct and ad-hoc surveys with application owners as the primary basis of their decision to move applications to the cloud. IT leaders need to adopt an analysis-led approach over gut instinct to implement the right cloud migration strategy and realise all potential benefits of migrating to the cloud.</p>
<p>Greg Rivera, VP CAST Highlight at CAST, commented on the findings, “Pilots going into storms turn to their instruments. If you run headfirst into a cloud migration without objectively assessing your applications, you’re flying in the dark.</p>
<p>Even one small change to an application has a ‘butterfly effect’ on the rest of the code set, so a disruption as big as cloud migration has detrimental effects including IT outages and loss of business. Migration to the cloud is vital when digitally transforming a business. But, it needs to be done right if organizations want success instead of suffering.”</p>
<p>More than 40% of software leaders are yet to define a class based approach to application modernization. Heavily legacy process firms tend to rehost apps, while rehosting, or so-called ‘lift-and-shift’, benefits apps with up to three years before end of life. However, existing and continuously evolving apps should be re-platformed and restructured during cloud migration. To successfully complete migration first gather intelligence and actively assess applications objectively.</p>
<p>Armed with battle scars software leaders at banks and insurance firms are revisiting their initial ‘lift-and-shift’ approach to cloud migration plans. While FinTech firms outperform mature institutions on cloud-native apps, banks lead the way on cloud-ready applications with just fewer than 50% rewriting applications. A European Chief Digital Architect said, “Cloud migration is only really a problem if you’re moving workloads without changing the way they are shaped.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – UK plc borrowing rose for the eighth consecutive year in 2018/19, according to the latest Link Group UK plc Debt Monitor. Net debt (total borrowings less cash), jumped 5.8% to a new record of £443.2bn, even allowing for higher cash balances. Net debt has now risen by three quarters since the low point reached in 2010/11, when companies were still adjusting to the disruption caused by the financial crisis and subsequent recession. The £24.2bn increase in 2018/19 comes at a time when UK plc profitability is under pressure: operating profits were flat year-on-year after growing strongly over the previous two years.</p>
<p>Total debts, which do not take into account any cash or liquid investments companies hold, rose 6.7% to a record £638.3bn. Cash balances, meanwhile, grew rapidly, up 8.9% to a comfortable record of £195.1bn. This is bigger than an entire year’s operating profits from UK plc, and enough to pay two years’ dividends from the companies in the study.</p>
<p>Top 100 companies saw their borrowings rise faster than mid- and small-caps, though the increase in net debt was mitigated by rising cash balances, which jumped by one eighth. Outside the top 100, total debts were almost unchanged. This group saw operating profits fall year-on-year. As a result, they ran through 6.8% of their cash, so their net debts rose too.</p>
<p>Healthcare and utilities made the biggest contribution to the annual increase in debts, though for very different reasons. Oil, telecoms and mining were the only sectors to see lower debts year-on-year. Two fifths of companies increased their borrowing, with those outside the top 100 more likely to do so as they faced slowing demand.</p>
<p>Despite the value of UK plc’s debts reaching new records, the measures of debt burden and debt sustainability are not showing signs of strain. The core debt/equity, liabilities/assets, and short-term/long-term debt ratios all improved slightly year-on-year. Meanwhile, though interest payments rose slightly as a percentage of operating profits (mainly owing to the lack of profit growth), they remained below the average for the last decade, thanks to the very low cost of finance at present. The value of debt compared to operating profit rose to 2.6x, however, the third highest reading since 2008/9. This is nevertheless well below 4x, where a rule of thumb suggests companies would likely face difficulty repaying debts if they were called. The figures further show that there were no big outliers that distorted the picture – in other words the majority of companies followed the trend for each of these measures.</p>
<p>Even though borrowing rose to record levels in 2018/19, the increase was in truth relatively modest, especially if we adjust for the impact of big transactions like GlaxoSmithKline debt-financed buyout of a joint venture with Novartis. What’s more, mid-cap and smaller companies are clearly showing greater caution than their larger counterparts as they are more reliant on the slowing and uncertain UK economy.</p>
<p>Michael Kempe, Chief Operating Officer of Link Market Services commented: “Borrowing will always rise over the long term because debt is almost always a cheaper means of raising capital for investment than equity. As companies grow, their capacity to take on new loans to finance their expansion increases. So, only considering UK plc’s debt pile in isolation doesn’t tell the whole story. It’s really important to consider the burden of debt, and how sustainable it is as well. This is why the increase in borrowing in 2018/19 isn’t a cause for concern. It’s well backed by assets, and easily serviced at present by the profits companies are making. There are of course companies and sectors under strain, but the overall picture is reasonably comfortable.</p>
<p>“Over the next year we expect companies to maintain a cautious stance as long as uncertainties abound in the UK, and while the risks to the global economy rise. The trajectory of interest rates should provide some comfort, however, as central banks have sounded increasingly dovish of late.”</p>
<p>Damian Watkin, Director at D.F. King, part of Link Group added: “As companies have moved away from short-term debt, we have seen the type of debt they are taking on change, too. Bonds have risen in popularity, at the expense of shorter-term loans. In particular, the issuance of high-yield bonds – those issued by lower rated companies – has exploded in the last decade. This is not limited to the UK, but is a Europe-wide phenomenon.</p>
<p>“This position may be manageable in the current low interest-rate environment, in which investors are still searching for yield and issuers are able to roll over maturities financed with new issues. Should rising interest rates close the high-yield market to lower quality borrowers, however, a significant rise in debt restructurings and defaults would be on the cards among highly indebted companies.</p>
<p>“Historically, refinancing has been easier with a small number of lending banks, rather than large number of often unknown bondholders. Companies can take action ahead of time, and ahead of any interest rate rises, on upcoming maturities through liability management exercises, for example, repaying bonds early with cash, or with money raised via a new bond.”</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/a0000s062U0h001VJQst5fx"" target=""_blank"">GTreasury</a> announced today that it has entered into a connectivity agreement with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC (GS&amp;Co.;) and Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) to connect the Goldman Sachs Liquidity Solutions Portal with GTreasury’s <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/r50K0V0t0Q2shsU6f0020x0"" target=""_blank"">treasury management system</a> (TMS). The new arrangement will create an end-to-end workflow for investing in money market funds, introducing on-demand connectivity to third-party banking and fintech services.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with GS&amp;Co.; and GSAM speaks volumes about the increasing role of the <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/r50K0V0t0Q2shsU6f0020x0"" target=""_blank"">TMS</a> as a digital backbone for corporate financial services,” says Terry Beadle, Global Head of Corporate Development at GTreasury. “Connecting treasury’s ecosystem of third-party bank and fintech vendor processes into a seamless workflow will be essential for corporates that want the easiest route to scale and efficiency.”</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs Liquidity Solutions Portal will be connected with GTreasury’s workflow, creating a highly-automated process that populates common client data for powerful decision making. With a single sign-on to GTreasury, clients will be able to view the big picture of their <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/G6Q0Vt00h35LU0xs0000fs2"" target=""_blank"">cash positions</a> and investments in dashboards, perform a tighter sweeping of bank accounts automatically, and enter the Goldman Sachs Liquidity Solutions Portal. Clients can then choose a money market fund from across the broad market of U.S. and international funds and execute their trades. At client instruction, data will flow automatically back into GTreasury, informing cash, investment and accounting activities.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to work with the GTreasury team to connect this exciting tool with our own liquidity solutions,” says Kathleen Hughes, Global Head of Liquidity Solutions Client Business. “Greater automation and integrated information will not only save time by simplifying the process but will also give corporate treasury teams the information they need to make the best investment decisions for their needs.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – HSBC today expanded its pan-European commercial card proposition to nine currencies to help companies more effectively manage their travel, entertainment and supplier payments across the region.</p>
<p>HSBC Commercial Cards are now available in six more currencies – Czech koruna, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, Swedish krona and Swiss francs – in addition to the existing currencies of euros, pound sterling and US Dollars.</p>
<p>The expansion provides clients with a simpler, more flexible payment option: companies with operations and subsidiaries in Switzerland, Poland, Czech Republic and the Nordics can now use a local currency card for staff travel and supplier payments, thereby avoiding a foreign exchange mark-up on local currency transactions. It also provides an opportunity for companies to consolidate their European card spending rather than have multiple local card providers.</p>
<p>Brian Tomkins, European Head of Commercial Cards, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC said: “We aim to support our clients by providing the products that they need in the locations where they need them. We now offer a full range of commercial card products to clients across 26 countries in Europe and 43 countries globally, with the same core capabilities in each market. This will help clients achieve greater visibility and control over spending and to effectively manage working capital.”</p>
<p>Companies doing business across Europe can access HSBC Commercial Card payment solutions in these currencies through a single contract with HSBC. Their employees receive a convenient, secure and widely-accepted way to pay for purchases on the Mastercard®i network. The company gains visibility of employee spending and supplier payments. The card spending data delivered back to HSBC clients can help them improve process efficiencies and negotiate better supplier rates with accurate and real-time spend information.</p>
<p>Philip Fellowes, European Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC added: “Commercial cards are increasingly popular among clients wanting an efficient and secure way to manage their day-to-day expenditure. Cards remove the need for petty cash and cheques while providing an alternative way to pay suppliers without impacting precious cash flow. In addition, the automated reporting of card transactions means business travellers don’t have to manually upload expense claims, while purchasing and treasury teams can use the same data to monitor spending, policy compliance and drive more effective sourcing from suppliers.”</p>
<p>HSBC Commercial Cards include business-to-business solutions, such as a Purchasing Card and Virtual Card for payables, and travel solutions for employees such as a Corporate Cards, Lodge Card, Fuel Card and a Virtual Card for travel.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> August 2019</strong> – American Express and Singapore Airlines are extending their 20-year partnership with the launch of the American Express Singapore Airlines Business Credit Card. This new Card will help SMEs better manage their businesses, fund their expansion efforts, all while enjoying a number of premium travel benefits.</p>
<p>According to a survey by American Express and Singapore Airlines, most SME owners are bullish – with more than 74% expecting to grow their businesses in the next 12 months. That said, more than half of the respondents say that increasing competition and cash flow management keep them up at night, and one in three feels challenged taking their business overseas.</p>
<p>“Our survey shows that Singapore SMEs are optimistic about growth, but cash flow and overseas expansion are ever-present concerns,” said Mr. Geoff Begg, Senior Vice President, Global Commercial Services for Asia Pacific, American Express. “American Express and Singapore Airlines are bringing the first SME business travel card to give them access to credit terms, more savings, and a suite of travel benefits – to support their ambitions and help them overcome these challenges.”</p>
<p>“Singapore Airlines’ HighFlyer Programme was launched two years ago to reward and support SMEs, including in their endeavours to expand overseas,” said Mr. Campbell Wilson, Senior Vice President Sales and Marketing, Singapore Airlines. “We are excited to now partner American Express to take the programme further with the new American Express Singapore Airlines Business Credit Card. This new product enables SMEs to maximise their HighFlyer privileges by earning more rewards faster, which can be redeemed for a range of benefits that improve their bottom line even as employees themselves continue to earn KrisFlyer miles for their own personal benefit.”</p>
<h4>Savvy, frequent travelers prioritising value, flexibility and peace of mind</h4>
<p>According to the SMEs Go Places Survey, SME owners travel at least once every six weeks for business, while 70% of SMEs have employees travelling two or more times per month. These frequent travellers prioritise value, convenience and flexibility, with 47% citing the importance of having complimentary travel insurance when it comes to corporate airline programmes.</p>
<p>Nine in 10 SMEs surveyed have dealings overseas, with one in three of them citing lack of access to capital and cash flow as key inhibitors to international expansion.</p>
<p>“SMEs have different needs and they don’t always get the same level of support as larger companies. Our survey reaffirms this as 59% of SMEs said partnering established companies for guidance and support would have made their expansion overseas easier. This is precisely why American Express and Singapore Airlines are bringing the first business travel card for Singapore SMEs to support them by turning their business expenses into rewards,” said Ms. Celine Chua, Vice President, Global Commercial Services for Singapore, American Express.</p>
<p>To support SMEs, the American Express Singapore Airlines Business Credit Card offers a suite of benefits:</p>
<h4>Rewards</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Earn up to 8.5 HighFlyer points for every S$1 spent on all eligible Singapore Airlines Group flights and 1.8 HighFlyer points per S$1 for other eligible spending.</p>

<p>Easily use HighFlyer points to offset future travel with no caps, no blackout periods and no restrictions through a simple, one-stop portal.</p>
</li>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – HSBC and Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) will accelerate the creation of an investible market in trade finance to meet rising demand for ‘real economy’ assets and help increase the availability of funding for trading companies.</p>
<p>Although banks collectively provide almost USD10trn<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> of trade finance to companies annually, the small secondary market for these assets – estimated at about USD300bn – mainly comprises bilateral trading between banks. Trade finance contracts are typically short-term and self-liquidating, with default rates as low as 0.03%<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>, but they aren’t standardised and so can be hard for investors to price.</p>
<p>Now HSBC, the world’s largest trade finance bank, and AllianzGI, which manages more than EUR535bn in assets, have pioneered a solution to make trade finance easily accessible to institutional investors such as insurers, pension funds and family offices. This solution allows HSBC to wrap a range of customers’ trade finance assets – from traditional products such as trade loans to structured solutions like supply chain and receivables finance – into notes that the newly-created Allianz Working Capital Fund (ALWOCA) will buy and offer to AllianzGI clients later this year.</p>
<p>Surath Sengupta, Global Head of Trade Portfolio Management and Distribution at HSBC, said: “We’re aiming for nothing less than a major reform of the trade finance market that will benefit exporters, importers and investors keen to buy into real economy transactions. We at HSBC provide over USD750bn of trade finance each year, and by distributing more trade assets we can support more businesses. Given that global demand for trade finance already outstrips supply by about USD1.5trn a year, we see huge potential for a thriving secondary market to stimulate trade in goods and services – the lifeblood of the global economy.”</p>
<p>Deborah Zurkow, Global Head of Alternatives at Allianz Global Investors, said: “Trade finance is a rapidly evolving opportunity for institutional investors. ALWOCA’s launch helps unlock a whole new asset class for our institutional clients, providing unique, short-dated, uncorrelated cash flows. Having pioneered infrastructure debt as an asset class, we are now putting that same entrepreneurial spirit to work to open up another new market, one that’s of significant interest to our clients and one that helps keep the wheels of commerce turning.”</p>
<p>Notes structured by the Global Banking &amp; Markets team at HSBC, work by pooling a selection of trade finance assets originated by HSBC’s Global Trade and Receivables Finance business (GTRF) and selling them to a special purpose vehicle. These assets have different risk profiles and typically short tenors, such as 60-day Fixed Term Corporate Payables.</p>
<p>AllianzGI acts as Portfolio Manager for the special purpose vehicle selecting the transactions purchased. The SPV’s assets are then wrapped into notes that ALWOCA will buy, enabling the fund to take exposure to trade assets through a securities format. This model can flex to fit the supply of suitable assets and buyer demand, with AllianzGI aiming to invest a large portion of its ALWOCA fund into them. ALWOCA is seeking to have a duration of below one year and generate returns significantly in excess of those available in public markets for the same duration.</p>
<p>Recognising the need to increase access to liquidity for trade finance assets, HSBC’s GTRF business has built Trade Asset Distribution hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, London and New York over the past three years. By working with alternative investors as well as banks, the team increased distribution volumes of HSBC trade finance assets from USD2bn in 2016 to USD32bn in 2018.</p>
<p>HSBC and AllianzGI will initially use European corporate trade finance assets for their notes before expanding to include other markets as demand increases.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – UK businesses trade all year round yet more than a quarter (27.4% or £548b) of their revenue is driven by seasonal peaks. The latest <a href=""https://www.marketinvoice.com/"" target=""_blank"">MarketInvoice</a> Business Insights1 survey explores their preparedness and challenges in dealing with seasonal demand.</p>
<p>What is seasonal demand? This refers to peaks in business activity that correspond to various factors depending on the nature of the business. These factors can include seasons of the year and their weather-related changes, events like the summer school holidays and religious or cultural calendar events.</p>
<p>In fulfilling seasonal demand, businesses plan and prepare almost 15 weeks in advance to meet customer orders. They face several pressures in meeting this demand, chiefly having the staff to fulfil orders (23%) closely followed by paying their suppliers (22%). The survey also found that businesses are more likely to be selling to large corporate or blue-chip companies (72.5%) compared to other SMEs (27.5%). Additionally2, the typical invoice value of goods and services supplied in peak times is £47,203, for which they will be waiting, on average, 80 days to be paid.</p>
<p>Jonathan Allan, CMO at MarketInvoice, commented: “In meeting seasonal demands, businesses are preparing 3 months in advance and then waiting almost a further 3 months to get paid. It’s worrying to see them so stretched. Regular and significant peaks or troughs in revenue are tough to manage, but it’s possible to smooth the impact. Being prepared and using all the finance tools available is the key to managing seasonal demand.”</p>
<p>Despite feeling a cash flow squeeze, the majority of business owners (54%) are not checking their cash flow forecast on a regular basis, typically just monthly or quarterly. As a means of managing seasonal demand, almost half (48%) of business owners reported increasing their bank overdraft facilities and one in six (16%) used invoice finance to tackle the cash flow constraint.</p>
<p>Jennifer Thompson, Head of Finance at small business Crate Brewery commented: “Dealing with seasonal demand is a reality of our business and waiting on long payment terms hinders our cashflow. Using invoice finance helps but we are under a lot of pressure as a young and growing business”.</p>
<p>In fulfilling seasonal demands, 87% of businesses reported they were prevented from taking on more orders because of the cashflow constraint. Yet, two-thirds (67%) of business owners aren’t seeking any advice about seasonal spikes in trading. Of the businesses that are taking counsel, the majority (14%) are turning to their business bank manager for help.</p>
<p>Rashesh Joshi, Managing Director at Chartered Accountants, Alexander Rosse, commented: “At times of heightened activity, business owners must work hard to get their products and services to customers. However, it’s imperative they call upon their business advisers as early as possible for support and timely guidance in order to ensure the right financing solution can be found and they can prepare for long payment terms, dealing with cash flows and managing expectations. “</p>
<p>Canvassed on their views on the anticipated (deal or no deal) Brexit in October 2019, business owners felt that the economic environment would contract. More than half (51%) are anticipating a decrease in revenue over the next 12 months. Equally, more than half (53%) also believe finance options and credit terms will inevitably tighten around Brexit.</p>
<p>Jonathan Allan added: “Businesses are clearly nervous about the onset and impact of Brexit. It’s unchartered territory for many business owners. There will be an immediate adjustment across the economy, no doubt, as we prepare for the new trading environment. Ahead of this, business owners should be seeking advice from their accountants, lenders and bank managers to ensure they are best prepared for all scenarios. Meanwhile, it is essential that the new government reassures and encourages these small businesses who are the heartland of the UK economy, that the economic environment will be one they will prosper in”.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://C2FO.com/en-uk"">C2FO</a>, the world’s largest market for working capital, today announced the completion of a $200 MM funding round led by the SoftBank Vision Fund with additional participation from existing investors Temasek and Union Square Ventures. Following the investment, Nahoko Hoshino will join the C2FO board of directors on behalf of SoftBank Investment Advisers.</p>
<p>The investment is designed to accelerate C2FO’s development of new markets to further improve access to working capital for companies globally not just large multinational corporations, but also small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>“We are very fortunate to have a team who, for years, has delivered industry-leading unit economics, extraordinary customer satisfaction, and strong global growth,” said Sandy Kemper, C2FO Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Due to their work, we have now grown to match over $1.2 trillion of accounts receivable and accounts payable.”</p>
<p>C2FO’s online marketplace has quickly emerged as one of the most convenient and lowest-cost sources of working capital in the world. Utilising proprietary algorithms, the company creates a seamless match between accounts receivable and accounts payable to dynamically price the value for early payment in real time. More than 300,000 businesses across 173 countries utilise C2FO to take control of their cash flow and receive more than $1 billion in funding every week.</p>
<p>“We invested in C2FO because we think their disruptive innovation offers a solution to an industry that has traditionally lacked cost-efficient alternatives for businesses of all sizes looking to free up cash quickly,” said Akshay Naheta, Managing Partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers. “We believe the company’s platform provides maximum value for buyers and suppliers and are excited by the company’s vision to become the global exchange for working capital.”</p>
<p>“This infusion of capital from the Vision Fund and existing investors will be used to further our expansion as we strive to build a new world wherein the increased liquidity provided by the C2FO platform helps companies and in turn, entire economies, grow more rapidly,” added Kemper.</p>

<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Refinitiv has integrated Ultimate Beneficial Ownership data (UBO) and Vessel data into its leading Risk Intelligence platform World-Check One, creating a formidable resource to help unravel complicated ownership structures and screen entities in line with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and financial crime regulations across the globe.</p>
<p>By combining UBO data from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Vessel data from IHS Markit Maritime and Trade, and World-Check One’s comprehensive Risk Intelligence data, Refinitiv is helping to simplify in-house compliance workflows for organizations around the world.</p>
<p>While complex legal entities often facilitate legitimate business, their opaque ownership structures make it a challenge to unwrap ownership hierarchies and screen associated entities for potential risks, including those relating to financial crime. As a result, they are frequently linked to large-scale criminal activity including tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing and sanctions violations.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency of beneficial ownership information around the world has been highlighted by several key organizations, including the FATF, the G20, and the UK’s Anti-Corruption Summit.</p>
<p>“Unwrapping complex ownership structures is an important part of knowing who you are dealing with when it comes to onboarding new customers, suppliers and partners,” said Phil Cotter, Managing Director of the Risk business at Refinitiv. “The addition of UBO data and vessel information within World-Check One is a significant step in simplifying this process, helping organisations establish a more robust and effective due diligence process and ultimately creating a more hostile environment for criminals to operate.”</p>
<p>“Dun &amp; Bradstreet is pleased to be working with Refinitiv to deliver UBO data and analytics globally to our joint customers,” said Brian Alster, General Manager of Third-Party Risk &amp; Compliance, Dun &amp; Bradstreet. “The combination of UBO data with World-Check One supports a more systematic and deeper understanding of the companies you are doing business with, which can help organisations adhere to beneficial ownership laws and regulations around the world, while helping to counteract money laundering and other financial crimes.”</p>
<p>World-Check One's ‘UBO Check’ and ‘Vessel Check’ are integrated opt-in features within World-Check One that deliver UBO data across more than 200 countries, unlocking more than 100 million connections and providing insights into corporate entities and beneficial owners across the globe, plus the unrivalled breadth and depth of IHS Markit Maritime and Trade data, the largest maritime database in the world, which currently lists more than 190,000 vessels, seven levels of ownership and 11 years of vessel history.</p>
<p>World-Check One is an award-winning screening platform from Refinitiv that simplifies and accelerates the due diligence process and makes know-your-customer (KYC) remediation quicker and more intelligent. World-Check One combines purpose-built screening software with proprietary and trusted World-Check Risk Intelligence data in order to help organisations across the world meet their regulatory obligations.

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading international financial hub in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) region, reinforced its contribution to the UAE’s economy and its commitment to driving the future of finance, following strong performance during the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>The Centre saw sustained growth in the first half of 2019, welcoming more than 250 new companies, and bringing the total number of active registered firms to 2,289, demonstrating a 14 percent increase year-on-year. This has fuelled the creation of over 660 jobs, boosting the Centre’s combined workforce to more than 24,000 individuals, and has resulted in the occupancy of 99 percent of DIFC-owned buildings.</p>
<p>The DIFC now boasts more than 671 financial related firms, an 11 percent increase from the same period last year. The financial services firms that joined in 2019 include Maybank Islamic Berhad from Malaysia, Cantor Fitzgerald from the United States of America, Atlas Wealth Management from Australia and Mauritius Commercial Bank. In addition, leading non-financial firms including Guidepoint MEA, Medtronic Finance Hungary Kft. and Network International, have also joined the Centre in the first six months of 2019.</p>
<p>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai and President of the DIFC, said: “Dubai continues to gain recognition on the global stage as the destination where business meets innovation, and the DIFC has been a significant driver of this. The strong performance that the Centre has delivered during the first half of 2019 highlights the confidence and trust that international financial institutions have in Dubai. Aligning with the 50-year charter announced by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the planned expansion of the DIFC will solidify Dubai’s role as a pivotal hub for companies from around the world to access regional opportunities.”</p>
<p>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC, commented: “The DIFC has been a pioneer in the financial services sector since its inception in 2004, as the first purpose-built financial centre in the MEASA region. 15 years on, we continue to demonstrate our forward-thinking approach with the enhancement of our legal and regulatory framework, as well as the development of a comprehensive ecosystem. The Centre remains a fundamental driver in leading financial sector transformation, supporting the advancement of the UAE economy, and developing the next generation of financial professionals.”</p>
<h4>Driving the Future of Financial Services in MEASA</h4>
<p>In response to the strong demand the DIFC continues to witness from financial institutions across the globe, the Centre embarked upon 2019 with the announcement of new expansion plans, supporting the economic future of Dubai and the UAE. The phased growth plan will triple the scale of the leading financial hub and enable the DIFC to help deliver on Dubai’s ambitious growth agenda, whilst diversifying and transforming the financial services sector within the wider region.</p>
<p>The new development will provide an international focal point for FinTech and innovation, enhancing the Centre’s reputation as one of the world’s most advanced financial centres and reinforcing Dubai’s position as one of the world’s top ten FinTech hubs, as listed by FT’s The Banker.</p>
<p>The Centre has already seen a marked increase in the number of firms that make up its dynamic FinTech ecosystem, which more than doubled in size from over 80 to 200 companies in the last six months. Similarly, the number of licensed FinTech firms operating in the DIFC increased from 35 to more than 80 in the first half of 2019. Key international FinTech firms that have made the Centre their MEASA base include Dublin-based software company Fenergo, InsurTech leaders Charles Taylor and Swedish crowdfunding platform, FundedByMe.</p>
<p>Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority, commented: ‘We are continuing to cement our global position as a pivotal business and finance hub, while making significant headway towards meeting our 2024 targets. Our focus on innovation and technology is delivering a blueprint for sustainable growth as we continue our journey towards driving the future of finance. DIFC’s emphasis on transforming its lifestyle offering, alongside strategic investments within technology and FinTech means we are confident about reinforcing our position as a leading global financial centre – a great place to live, work, play and do business.”</p>
<p>The Centre received 425 applications from start-ups operating in the RegTech, Islamic FinTech, InsurTech and broader FinTech sectors, for the third cohort of its DIFC FinTech Hive accelerator programme, a 42 percent increase from the 2018 programme. This also marked a three-fold increase from its inaugural cycle in 2017, exemplifying the pace of evolution of this fast-growing industry, as well as the preference of Dubai and the DIFC as the home for FinTech firms looking to scale their business across the region. Approximately half of the applications received for the 2019 programme originated from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.</p>
<p>33 start-ups have been selected following a series of interviews, conducted in consultation with DIFC FinTech Hive’s network of 21 participating partners, including Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB), Emirates Islamic, Emirates NBD, Finablr, HSBC, National Bank of Fujairah, Noor Bank, Riyad Bank, Standard Chartered, and Visa, as well as the associate financial institution partners Arab Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB).</p>
<p>InsurTech start-ups will work closely with leading insurance players, AXA Gulf, Noor Takaful (Ethical Insurance), Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (DIFC), AIG, Insurance House, Cigna Insurance Middle East S.A.L. and MetLife, to help them develop game-changing solutions that address the growing requirements of the industry. In addition, this year’s finalists will be supported by strategic partner Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC) and digital transformation partner Etisalat.</p>
<p>Furthering the Centre’s commitment to supporting FinTech in the region, DIFC hosted the first Demo Day for the inaugural cycle of the Startupbootcamp programme in April 2019, alongside HSBC and Mashreq. The event showcased innovative concepts from ten graduates of the programme, consisting of entrepreneurs from the UAE, Singapore, United Kingdom, Greece, France, Thailand, Ghana, Morocco, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The Centre’s thriving FinTech community benefits from the strong relationships the DIFC has continued to build with key international accelerators through ongoing delegations and partnership agreements. The DIFC signed four MoUs during the first half of 2019, one with Dubai SME to help foster entrepreneurship in the UAE and further the National Innovation Agenda, as well as three additional agreements with FinTech Saudi, Milan’s FinTech District and FinTech Istanbul, expanding the Centre’s network of international FinTech hubs to 14.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DIFC has worked to increase access to funding by engaging and building its Venture Capital ecosystem, as well as investing directly into promising FinTech start-ups. In March 2019, the Centre announced the appointment of Middle East Venture Partners and Wamda Capital to manage USD 10 million of its dedicated USD 100 million FinTech fund. To date, DIFC has received more than 50 applications from a variety of financial technologies, including payments, roboadvisory, blockchain and KYC platforms. The applications received have been in equal parts from early and growth stage firms, signifying interest from firms across the start-up business cycle.</p>
<h4>Supporting Human Capital Development and Delivering Sustainable Impact</h4>
<p>As part of the DIFC’s efforts to support continued professional development and strengthen the regional talent pool, the DIFC Academy offers world class financial and legal education through strategic partnerships with 26 leading educational institutions and government entities. To date, the DIFC has seen more than 5,500 graduates successfully undertake executive education courses and programmes in finance, business and law, as well as two dedicated Masters of Laws (LLM) programmes.</p>
<p>Knowledge sharing and thought leadership remained a core focus for the financial centre in 2019. The third edition of the Dubai World Insurance Congress (DWIC) and the second edition of the Global Financial Forum (GFF) welcomed more than 700 industry leaders to each flagship event. Key speakers at DWIC included James Vickers, Chairman of Willis Re International and David Watson, Chief Executive Officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa and International Casualty at AXA XL, who shared global perspectives on reinsurance growth strategies. Meanwhile, the GFF, which brought together more than double the number of business leaders compared to the inaugural event in 2018, attracted the likes of Sir Gerry Grimstone, Former Chairman of Barclays Bank PLC and emerging markets guru, Mark Mobius.</p>
<p>In recognition of DIFC’s efforts towards building one of the world’s leading financial centres over the last 15 years, the Centre was the only free zone in the UAE to receive the Dubai Quality Award in April 2019. The award is a reflection of the DIFC’s hard work and dedication in building a sustainable and progressive business environment.</p>
<p>In May 2019, another milestone for sustainable business growth was achieved as Majid Al Futtaim launched the world’s first benchmark corporate Green Sukuk at Nasdaq Dubai, supporting Dubai’s growth as the global capital of Islamic economy. The Green Sukuk investment will be used to finance and refinance Majid Al Futtaim’s existing and future green projects, including green buildings, renewable energy, sustainable water management, and energy efficiency.</p>
<h4>Enhancing the Legal &amp; Regulatory Framework to Fuel Growth</h4>
<p>The Centre has been at the forefront of enhancing its legislative infrastructure to provide the DIFC community with access to opportunities within the MEASA region, whilst providing greater stability and certainty when doing business in the DIFC. The Centre’s robust legal and regulatory framework remains the most sophisticated and business-friendly Common Law jurisdiction in the region, aligned with international best practice.</p>
<p>DIFC continues to support the development of the financial services sector and foster the UAE’s economic growth by encouraging the development of the domestic funds market. In May 2019, the DIFC’s independent regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), announced the a new regime to facilitate the passporting of funds, in collaboration with the UAE’s other financial regulators. The UAE passporting regime is a regulatory mechanism for the promotion and supervision of investment funds that encourages foreign licensed firms in financial free zones based in other countries to enter the local market.</p>
<p>With the aim of ensuring businesses and investors can operate across the region with confidence, the DIFC also unveiled the new Insolvency Law in June 2019, enacted by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The new law facilitates a more efficient and effective bankruptcy restructuring regime for stakeholders operating in the DIFC.</p>
<p>In addition, the DIFC has continued to create an attractive environment for the 24,000 strong workforce based in the Centre to thrive, whilst protecting and balancing the needs and interests of both employers and employees. To support its vision, the DIFC unveiled its new Employment Law in June 2019 to address key issues such as paternity leave, sick pay, end-of-service settlements and more.</p>
<p>As part of the Centre’s blueprint for the transformation of the financial centre and in line with global retirement savings trends the DIFC launched the Employee Workplace Savings (DEWS) scheme, which will see the evolution of end-of-service benefits from a defined benefit scheme to a defined contribution scheme, while offering a voluntary savings component for employees.</p>
<p>The Centre also unveiled a new unified, simplified and more expansive Prescribed Companies regime that makes structuring and financing in the DIFC faster, flexible and more cost-effective. The new regime encompasses structures previously offered by the Centre, including Intermediate Special Purpose Vehicles (ISPVs) and Special Purpose Companies (SPCs). This has contributed significantly to a robust pipeline of prospective business from the aviation financing sector, as well as generating substantial interest from family offices looking to utilise these structures in their succession planning.</p>
<h4>Creating a Vibrant Retail &amp; Lifestyle Experience</h4>
<p>Today, 91 percent of DIFC’s prime retail space is occupied by 432 leading lifestyle, art, fashion and food &amp; beverage brands, an offering that will be significantly boosted once Gate Avenue is fully open. Upon officially opening its doors to the public, the new development will provide seamless connectivity to the Centre’s comprehensive lifestyle offering, from The Gate building through to Central Park Towers. The new retail experience will feature over 100 days of unique arts, culture and wellness activations, making DIFC the destination where business meets lifestyle.</p>
<p>During the first half of 2019, Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts announced the opening of Waldorf Astoria, Dubai International Financial Centre. The 275-key hotel occupies the 18th to 55th floors of the Burj Daman complex, including 46 suites and 28 residential suites offering unobstructed views of the Downtown Dubai skyline. Combined with the two other world-class hotels based in the Centre, Four Seasons and the Ritz-Carlton DIFC, this brings the total number of hotel rooms available to those visiting the DIFC to 722.</p>
<p>In addition, the Centre welcomed a number of new culinary concepts to the DIFC’s gourmet scene including ‘Marea’, the New York fine dining experience led by multi-Michelin starred chef, Michael White as well as Grecian inspired ‘Avli by Tasha’. In March 2019, it was announced that renowned chef Nusret Gökçe is set to launch casual dining concept ‘Saltbae’ at the Centre this year.</p>
<p>DIFC is also home to one of the UAE’s largest collections of public art with sculptures from internationally renowned artists including Manolo Valdés and is the foundation for initiatives such as the One Mile Gallery in partnership with Brand Dubai which showcases the best of local, regional and international design and promotes art, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The Centre also welcomed its seventh elite art gallery, Sconci Gallery to the DIFC in the first half of 2019. Established in Rome during 1977, the gallery has collaborated with leading artists and international auction houses to showcase collections from masters of modern and contemporary art, as well as emerging artists.</p>
<p>During March 2019, the DIFC hosted the most successful edition of the hugely popular Art Nights in the last five years. The event, which marks the beginning of Dubai’s coveted art season, Art Dubai 2019, saw participation from international and local art galleries and artists, as well as installations accompanied by electric musical performances and light installations from interdisciplinary artists.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – The securities servicing industry may be near a tipping point in adopting Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, as firms pursue improved efficiency and new business models.</p>
<p>A new report published today by SWIFT and the Boston Consulting Group found that API interest is rapidly growing in the post-trade area. Over the course of 2018 alone, awareness of APIs among asset managers increased 26 percentage points to 72%, according to a BCG survey. The growing commercial interest is driving more pilot schemes and use cases, particularly between asset managers and their custodians.</p>
<p>APIs are well suited to help the securities servicing industry which has to contend with numerous and diverse asset types, complex information exchanges and increasing fee pressure. The report lays out four areas in which APIs can benefit the industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficiency and cost savings through automated data exchange</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real-time visibility of information such as settlement status and intraday risk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value-added services such as enriched data and analytics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational benchmarks to help servicers compare performance with their peers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adoption of APIs in the security servicing industry has been slower than in other areas of financial services in part because it has lacked a regulatory catalyst, the report says. Additionally, there is little consistency in players’ readiness to adopt APIs. Asset managers vary widely in their technical sophistication and openness to engaging with providers via API solutions. Some 56% of respondents in the BCG survey perceive maturity of post-trade APIs to be “experimental” while just 21% say it is “high” or “medium”.</p>
<p>“APIs have the potential to be a powerful enabler of innovation in the post trade industry, just as they have been in payments and other areas of banking,” said Juliette Kennel, Head of Securities and FX for SWIFT. “Interest in the technology is rising and the green shoots of experimentation are promising. But to really stimulate and accelerate broader API adoption, we need to eliminate uncertainty on standards and improve understanding about the technology’s maturity.”</p>
<p>The report sets out four calls to action for the industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mutualise common API infrastructure. Foundational pieces of API solutions, such as identity management, authentication, security, and network connectivity management should be agreed at an industry level between firms, rather than by individual firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curate API standards to support interoperability. Proliferation of multiple standards threatens to diminish the efficiency gains that APIs can deliver. The industry needs a single API standard that works across providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support networked APIs rather than point-to-point solutions. Firms stand to benefit from networked APIs. For example, a single call to check the status of settlement from a broker-dealer can be routed to multiple custodians simultaneously. A networked solution will also support convergence both of data definitions and of other API characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet strict security and resiliency standards. To gain traction, any API solution will need to meet a high bar in data protection and have high levels of resiliency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Wholesale banking is becoming more digital, and APIs have been one of the key technologies underpinning that transformation,” said Sumitra Karthikeyan, Global Head of Securities Servicing for BCG. “APIs are now starting to break into the securities servicing industry, emerging as a leading technology executives turn to as they seek to transition to digital-first firms. While familiar challenges from the past such as interoperability and security are headwinds to adoption, we believe they will be overcome and expect increasing adoption going forward.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> July 2019</strong> – EDF signed two €300 million sustainability-indexed revolving credit facilities (RCF) which incorporate a pricing adjustment based on EDF’s sustainability performance linked to CO2 emissions and energy efficiency. One facility was signed with the Group Crédit Agricole led by Crédit Agricole CIB including LCL and Crédit Agricole d’Ile-de-France, another one with Societe Generale CIB.</p>
<p>Both RCF incorporate an adjustment mechanism that links the cost of the facilities to three of EDF’s sustainability KPIs: direct CO2 emissions, customers’ use of online consumption monitoring tools (as a proxy of EDF’s success in getting French residential customers actively engaged on their consumption) and electrification of its light vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>With these agreements following on from three previous sustainability-linked loans signed in 2017, 2018 and 2019, EDF confirms that responsible finance instruments play a central role in its financing strategy. RCFs with an ESG indexation now represent a total of over €5 billion, i.e. around 45% of EDF Group credit lines.</p>
<p>Xavier Girre, Senior Executive Vice-President, CFO of EDF, said: “These two new facilities demonstrate EDF’s strong commitments in terms of corporate social responsibility by strengthening the link between its sustainability performance and financing strategy. With over €5 billion of sustainability-linked credit facilities and €4.5 billion in outstanding Green Bonds, sustainable finance instruments have become ever more core to EDF’s financing.”</p>
<p>Laurent Capès, Senior banker at Crédit Agricole CIB, said: “Credit Agricole group is very proud of supporting EDF in its sustainability finance strategy by providing this sustainability-indexed revolving credit facility of €300 million. This transaction, involving Crédit Agricole CIB, LCL and Credit Agricole d’Ile-de-France, demonstrates the willingness of both groups to actively participate to a more sustainable environment.”</p>
<p>Carl Bassili, Senior Banker at Societe Generale CIB, commented: “Societe Generale is delighted to support EDF in its strategy of developing sustainable finance in the context of the energy transition. Societe Generale is strongly committed to meet its clients' rising needs in the field of Sustainable and Positive Impact Finance. The Bank aims at contributing EUR 100 billion to energy transition between 2016 and 2020.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Whilst the export of goods from the UK fell in Q2 2019, larger UK manufacturers remain focused on export growth with the highest proportion of companies exporting in nearly four years, according to the latest Lloyds Bank International Trade Index, compiled in partnership with IHS Markit.</p>
<p>UK manufacturing exports fell for the first time in three years in the second quarter of 2019 as global trade volumes softened to the greatest extent in seven years.</p>
<p>This fall during Q2 was caused by an end to stockpiling across the EU in the first quarter of the year, while trade tension between the US and China and softer global economic growth also contributed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 (85 per cent) large UK firms surveyed reported exporting activity between April and June, the highest proportion since Q3 2015.</p>
<p>The findings show the resilience of the UK’s largest exporters amid trade tensions that have led to two thirds of the 29 countries surveyed by IHS Markit recording a decline in export sales.</p>
<p>The Manufacturing Export Orders Index posted a reading of 46.8 for new manufacturing export orders between April and June, down from a revised 50 in the first quarter. A reading of above 50 indicates growth, while one below 50 signifies contraction.</p>
<p>Despite this, eight out of the UK’s 10 key trading partners posted economic growth between April and June, suggesting significant opportunities for growth exist for businesses willing to diversify into new markets.</p>
<p>Gwynne Master, managing director and global head of trade for Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking, said: “There’s no doubting that there are challenges for exporters in the current climate, but our largest international businesses are showing exporting resilience.</p>
<p>“With most of the UK’s key trading partners’ economies growing, there are clearly opportunities to be had and this highlights the importance of a diverse exporting strategy. It’s also encouraging to see the highest proportion of large firms trading internationally for almost four years.</p>
<h4>Transport gives UK services sector a boost</h4>
<p>New overseas services sales fell for the third consecutive quarter in Q2, although at a slower rate than in Q1 2019. The index posted a reading of 48.6, up 1.8 points on Q1 but still below the 50 mark that signals growth.</p>
<p>The uptick was driven by the transport services sub-sector, which rebounded by 5.1 points in Q2 to 50.1. This sector includes UK logistics and storage businesses which likely benefitted from the stockpiling by EU firms in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Gwynne Master, managing director and global head of trade for Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking, continued: “Our International Trade Portal can help both current and prospective exporters understand the best market for their products or services, the trading requirements and conditions they face and the buyers they may wish to work with. We’ve also committed to lending up to £18 billion to UK businesses this year to help them achieve their growth ambitions, both at home and overseas.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – SWIFT today announces the results of a global trial to integrate SWIFT gpi Instant, the co-operative’s cross-border instant payments service, into Singapore’s domestic instant payment service, <a href=""https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/fast"" target=""_blank"">Fast And Secure Transfers</a> (FAST).</p>
<p>The successful trial which involved 17 banks across seven countries – Australia, China, Canada, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Singapore and Thailand – saw payments between all continents settle within 25 seconds; the fastest in just 13 seconds. This major advance extends the speed and transparency of SWIFT gpi deeper into domestic markets, reaching a wider set of ultimate beneficiary accounts around the world.</p>
<p>Building upon SWIFT’s proven track record of excellence, global reach and resilience, SWIFT gpi Instant reuses existing cross-border and domestic payments infrastructure, thereby minimising implementation costs and avoiding the complexities of adopting new cross-border infrastructure.</p>
<p>In this case, SWIFT gpi Instant capitalises on the 24x7 availability of instant payment systems such as FAST to enable payment settlement in the destination market, even outside normal business hours.</p>
<p>Results show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The fastest payment in the trial, from Australia into Singapore and processed onward via FAST, took only 13 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fastest payment into Asia Pacific from Europe took only 15 seconds and from North America in 20 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All payments were processed end-to-end within 25 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11 banks initiated cross-border payments into Singapore, and six banks in Singapore processed the payments domestically via the FAST system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The successful global trial comes on the back of a  2018 <a href=""https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-sees-success-with-gpi-instant-cross-border-payments-trial"" target=""_blank"">test</a> with a group of banks and Australia’s New Payments Platform (NPP) in which payments between Australia and China took just 18 seconds, and ahead of an upcoming test with banks and the <a href=""https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-trials-instant-cross-border-gpi-payments-through-tips"" target=""_blank"">TARGET Instant Payments Settlement</a> (TIPS) in Europe. Together, the TIPS, FAST and NPP instant payment systems are the first of many domestic real-time infrastructures, connected via the banks and using gpi, that will enable a globally-scalable instant cross-border payments service. Additional tests are planned in other markets with instant payment systems, ahead of the planned global launch of gpi Instant later this year.</p>
<p>Harry Newman, Head of Banking, SWIFT, said: “Across the world, through gpi, banks and Instant Payment systems are using our existing rails for international payments to meet today’s need for speed, traceability and transparency. SWIFT envisages that cross-border payments will become as convenient as domestic transactions, and the successful testing across multiple corridors between Europe and North America to Asia Pacific confirms the important role that gpi Instant will play in making that bold vision a reality.”</p>
<p>Peng Hua, Deputy General Manager, Operations Management Department of ICBC, said: “The trial represents a significant milestone for SWIFT and we are proud to be part of this ongoing progress. ICBC is prepared for and very much looking forward to the live application of gpi Instant. We are also eager to work with other financial institutions on other gpi Instant trials to develop what we believe is a service that will offer tremendous value to the payments industry.”</p>
<p>Serge Munten, Head of Agile Operations, Banque Internationale à Luxembourg, said: “As an innovative bank striving to offer our correspondent banking and corporate clients cutting-edge services, it was only natural for BIL to participate in this gpi Instant payment trial. We were very pleased that it only took 15 seconds to carry out the test payments between Europe and Asia. These pilot tests with SWIFT are part of our efforts to offer our clients the same high level of services for worldwide payments they have come to appreciate for domestic payments.”</p>

<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> announced today that revverbank, a Manchester-based new bank for regional businesses and savers in the UK, has selected Fusion Essence in the cloud to power its end-to-end core banking capabilities. The solution will support revverbank as it launches its services to SMEs and retail savers in the UK, giving it maximum scalability and flexibility to grow its business.</p>
<p>Arpan Gautam, Founder &amp; CEO of revverbank said, “We’re trying, in our own small way, to address one of the largest issues facing our economy by ensuring access to capital and resources for businesses to grow, invest and develop in the regions. SME businesses in the UK regions have historically struggled to find a lender amongst the traditional banks that can meet all their needs in terms of agility, speed of decision making and product relevance. Similarly, savers have often found it hard to place their funds in a bank which promotes regional economic development and provides competitive rates. Finastra’s Fusion Essence in the cloud solution will give us the ability to serve customers personally and efficiently, allowing us to focus on regional lending relationships and great saving rates. Our proposition will be underpinned by Microsoft’s Azure platform, which gives us comfort that our content is in secure hands.”</p>
<p>revverbank values the modern, open and digital end-to-end capabilities and scalability of the Finastra solution, and the benefits of the Microsoft Azure trusted and secure cloud platform. Finastra’s approach means the solution is highly scalable, allowing the bank to benefit from a low cost of entry, ease and speed of deployment, and the ability to increase business volumes and diversify its product set cost-effectively, while also benefiting from ongoing software updates. In time, revverbank will also be able to benefit from further innovation via FusionFabric.cloud, Finastra’s platform for open innovation.</p>
<p>Anand Subbaraman, General Manager, Retail Banking at Finastra said, “As a new entrant in the UK business banking sector, revverbank has spotted an opportunity to harness digital technologies and a lower-cost operating model. This helps set it apart from more traditional banks by offering the type of services and speed of response that SMEs really want. Fusion Essence in the cloud is ideally suited to the needs of this market, which means revverbank can achieve a speedy return on investment and will be continuously supported by highly experienced teams at both Finastra and Microsoft. This is a breakthrough deal in the UK market for Finastra’s Retail Banking Cloud offering and we look forward to working closely with the revverbank team as they prepare for launch.”</p>
<p>Richard Peers, Senior Director Worldwide Financial Services at Microsoft said, “For “neobanks”, the core business model is centered around their customers. By choosing Fusion Essence, powered by Microsoft Azure, revverbank demonstrates that they are focused on offering a first-class customer experience, delivering new services at speed and handling data in a secure and compliant way. We’re delighted to be joining Finastra in welcoming this first “neobank” on Fusion Essence core banking platform and look forward to many more.”</p>

<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> July 2019</strong> – Almost a third (30%) of European businesses admit they are still not compliant with GDPR, according to a survey conducted by the European Business Awards on behalf of RSM, one of the largest audit, tax and consulting organisations of advisers with a focus specifically on the middle market. Despite it being over a year since GDPR came into effect, and a raft of fines from regulators only 57% of businesses are confident that their business follows the rules, with a further 13% unsure either way.</p>

<p>The compliance gap is not down to any single issue, with middle market businesses struggling to understand and implement a whole range of areas covered by the regulation. More than a third (38%) of non-compliant businesses do not understand when consent is required to hold and process data, 35% are unsure how they should monitor their employees’ use of personal data and 34% don’t understand what procedures are required to ensure third party supplier contracts are compliant.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of compliance, GDPR is starting to have a positive impact on cyber security within the EU. Almost three quarters (73%) of European businesses say GDPR has encouraged them to improve the way they manage customer data and 62% say it has seen them increase their investment in cyber security. There remains much more to do, however, with 21% of businesses admitting that they still have no cyber security strategy in place.</p>
<p>Steven Snaith, Technology Risk Assurance Partner at RSM UK, commented: “With so much pressure on organisations to meet complex requirements, we saw GDPR fatigue setting in last year. Middle market businesses were overwhelmed by information from the press, industry bodies and stakeholders. Many organisations simply gave up and reverted back to the old way of doing things.</p>
<p>“But there are signs that this fatigue is about to fade. High-profile fines across Europe have demonstrated that regulators across the EU are serious about enforcement. Businesses are scrambling to catch up once again.”</p>
<p>“One important aspect to note is that GDPR compliance is far wider than just policies, procedures and training. Underlying technology controls need to be robust to safeguard the leakage and unauthorised access of personal data”</p>
<p>Jean Stephens, CEO of RSM International, commented: “GDPR is complex and challenging, but it is also an opportunity for businesses to differentiate themselves with their ability to respond and demonstrate their organisational agility. By letting go of legacy systems and rethinking the way they interact with data, these more entrepreneurial businesses can become more appealing partners and more innovative competitors on the global stage.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Investors are increasingly looking for cash solutions that meaningfully consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.</p>
<p>Following BlackRock’s successful US launch of the Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund (“LEAF”), the firm has now taken this concept global with the launch of the <a href=""https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-gb/emea-sustainable-investing"" target=""_blank"">BlackRock Institutional Cash Series</a> (ICS) LEAF series earlier this month. The ICS LEAF series are UCITS money market funds (MMFs) across three currencies – Euro, Sterling and US Dollar.</p>
<p>While BlackRock already has a fully integrated proprietary sustainable cash ratings model across all existing MMFs, the ICS LEAF series is the first UCITS fund range of its kind. The funds provide investors with same-day access to liquidity in Sterling, Euro and US Dollar through investment in securities issued or guaranteed by entities that meet the funds’ explicit Environmental and other characteristics, including Social and Governance factors (ESG).</p>
<p>As with US LEAF, BlackRock will commit 5% of the net revenue from management fees collected from the ICS LEAF series to purchase and subsequently retire carbon offsets.</p>
<p>Peter Loehnert, Head of International Cash Management at BlackRock says, “Sustainable investing is about smart investing and recognising that companies seeking to solve the world’s biggest challenges may be best positioned to grow. This launch provides greater choice to investors wishing to align their financial and ESG goals, and complements our ongoing efforts to integrate sustainability-related insights and data into our investment platform.”</p>
<p>Additional information about the fund series:</p>
<p>The ICS LEAF series considers ESG through its credit process and exclusionary screens, creating three important distinctions from BlackRock’s existing range of MMFs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Investments are made in a range of money market instruments whose issuer or guarantor has better-than-average performance in environmental practices (as determined by MSCI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of purchase, issuers must not have been involved in violations of the <a href=""https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc"" target=""_blank"">UN Global Compact</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The funds exclude investments in companies that earn a specified percentage (0-15%) of revenue from fossil fuels, thermal coal, nuclear energy, controversial weapons, tar/oil sands, civilian firearms and tobacco.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>16<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Ongoing market volatility stemming from Brexit, trade wars, and other supply chain disruptions resulted in $23.39 billion in foreign exchange (FX) losses for publicly traded North American companies during the first quarter of 2019, according to the new Kyriba Currency Impact Report (CIR), a comprehensive report that details the impact of foreign exchange (FX) exposures among 1,200 companies in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>This is the third consecutive quarter of increasing losses for North American and European companies, <a href=""https://info.kyriba.com/sm/kyriba-currency-impact-report-july-19"" target=""_blank"">according to the report</a>. In addition, the average negative currency impact per company in North America jumped 12 percent to $88 million in Q1 of 2019, equal to nearly $1 million per day.</p>
<p>“With today’s tools and technology, CFOs no longer need to accept these FX losses as a ‘cost of doing business,’” said Wolfgang Koester, Chief Evangelist for Kyriba. “Given today’s market conditions, currency volatility will only continue. CFOs and CEOs need to be pro-actively empowering their teams to monitor and manage their currency exposures accurately and in real-time to adjust as necessary, consequently avoiding further negative impacts on financial performance.”</p>
<p>The CIR is the most comprehensive report of its kind in detailing the impact of foreign exchange (FX) exposures among publicly traded companies, with median revenue of $1.027 billion in the first quarter. In addition, all companies in the report are doing business in more than one currency, with at least 15 percent of their revenue coming from other nations.</p>
<p>For the 10th consecutive quarter, North American companies indicated the euro as the most impactful currency, with nearly one-half of companies mentioning it during their first quarter earnings calls, according to the report. Business services and the medical equipment industries experienced the greatest impact from currencies, as those industries continue to be impacted by Brexit and other volatile geopolitical events around the globe.</p>
<h4>European Companies See Increasing Currency Impacts</h4>
<p>Publicly traded European companies monitored in the Q1 2019 report indicated a collective currency loss of $3.31 billion, up from $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. This translates into an average of $276 million per company during the first quarter, equal to more than $3 million per day. While the sample size of European companies is smaller than North American, the report shows increasing impacts in both regions for the last three quarters.</p>
<p>The euro also topped the list as the currency most mentioned as impactful by European companies during Q1 2019 earnings calls, with the US dollar identified as the second most mentioned currency. The chemical manufacturing along with the biotechnology and drug industries experienced the worst impact from negative currency adjustments across European sectors.</p>
<p>“Global volatility is now impacting North American and European corporates who are not applying best practices in currency risk management with greater force,” Koester continued. “This is a new trend as we typically see a binary relationship in FX impacts. Taking an initial look into Q2 2019, we don’t see these trends reversing anytime soon.”</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – A third (33 per cent) of UK businesses who were paid late in the last year did not chase outstanding payments, according to new research from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.</p>
<p>Fear of damaging valuable customer relationships was the biggest rationale by some margin, cited by two thirds (62 per cent) of businesses. This was followed by capacity and time constraints (27 per cent).</p>
<p>The Lloyds Bank Business Barometer research, which gathered the views of more than 1,200 UK companies, revealed that more than half (52 per cent) have been paid late in the last year, and almost four in 10 (38 per cent) have suffered overdue invoice payments on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>The UK’s small businesses* are owed an average of £79,500 in outstanding invoices with a tenth (nine per cent) owed more than £200,000.</p>
<p>When looking at the business community as a whole, seven per cent are owed more than £200,000 in unpaid invoices. For businesses with a turnover of more than £25m the average amount of outstanding invoices is £160,000.</p>
<p>Businesses in London are owed an average of £98,000 in outstanding invoices, the highest of any UK region, followed by the West Midlands (£66,000) and the South West (£64,000).</p>
<p>Ben Stephenson, Managing Director for Invoice Finance and Asset-Based Lending, Global Transaction Banking at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: “Late – as opposed to just slow – payments are doubly difficult for businesses to manage.</p>
<p>“Not only does having cash tied up in outstanding invoices damage productivity and put pressure on cash flow, limiting firms’ ability to fund growth; it also robs firms of the certainty they need to plan ahead.”</p>
<p>Tools exist for businesses to deal with late payments more effectively</p>
<p>Among businesses that were paid late in the last year and took proactive steps to recover payment, the most popular approach to chasing was email and phone reminders (74 per cent and 64 per cent respectively).</p>
<p>A quarter (24 per cent) took legal action while more than a fifth (22 per cent) applied interest or charges on an overdue invoice.</p>
<p>Only five per cent of firms that chased late payments in the last year complained to a government agency while almost half (49 per cent) reported that they were unaware of government measures to support them in tackling late payments.</p>
<p>Ben Stephenson added: “With a lack of awareness about the options available to mitigate the impact of late payments leaving some businesses under more pressure than they need to be, it’s absolutely imperative that firms are better clued up on options. These include government support and invoice financing.</p>
<p>“Indeed, funding options like invoice financing can enable businesses to access the money they are owed, typically within 24 hours, accelerating growth and productivity improvements.</p>
<p>“Financial flexibility has arguably never been more important given the backdrop of ongoing uncertainty. It’s for this reason that Lloyds Bank has committed to lend up to £18 billion to UK businesses in 2019, which includes the provision of bespoke solutions that help businesses boost cash flow.”</p>

<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – ICD, the leading independent trading and investment risk management platform, today released its 2019 <a href=""https://go.icdportal.info/e/478072/2019-Client-Survey-Results/2rx8nl/424252299?h=qh0ewTSyy2qTp62ldN1PUvXP7dMyDVFKezpHzqdTztw"" target=""_blank"">ICD Client Survey Results</a>. Survey invitations were sent to all ICD clients globally, with 141 participants offering valuable insights into the global corporate outlook for 2019 on trading, investment trends and technology preferences.</p>
<p>According to survey findings, 88% of investors plan on increasing or maintaining their current level of investment in Money Market Funds (MMFs), indicating minimal impact on MMF investment post US and EU money fund reform. Additionally, clients provided insights on other short-term investments, 23% indicated they are invested in or plan on investing in Short Duration Bond Funds, 56% in Time Deposits and 11% in ETFs. In the United States, 64% of respondents are investing in or plan on investing in Prime Funds in 2019, an increase of 4% over 2018 ICD Client Survey findings.</p>
<p>On the technology front, the trend toward “digital transformations” continues through 2019. While the majority of ICD client respondents have a Treasury Management System (TMS) in place, 23% of all respondents plan on implementing or changing their TMS in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>An additional trend realised through the ICD Client Survey is in regards to ICD’s Customer Service. In-line with last year’s results, 99% of clients scored ICD’s customer service as excellent or above average and the vast majority graded ICD Portal’s functionality as excellent.</p>
<p>“While European MMF Reform posed technological and operational challenges behind the scenes, it appears to have had little effect on ICD clients and their portfolio composition,” says Tory Hazard, CEO of ICD. “We invested heavily this past year in people and technology to deliver the highest level of support for our clients, so I am thrilled to see the positive feedback from clients. Exceptional service is a core focus for ICD.”</p>
<p>Additional Key Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>64% of global clients have a TMS in place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero European respondents indicated a decrease in USD &amp; GBP MMFs investment due to European MMF Reform, and only 2% said they would decrease EUR MMF investment</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Following the government’s draft legislation for digital service tax released today, Chris Denning, Corporate and International Tax Partner at MHA MacIntyre Hudson, says the UK ought to have waited for a comprehensive international agreement.</p>
<p>“The draft legislation published today confirms the UK Government’s intention to go it alone with a digital services tax (DST), in the absence of international agreement. DST will commence from 1 April 2020 at 2% of relevant UK derived digital services revenues.</p>
<p>“Going it alone is not quite the case though, as by some coincidence the French Government has also confirmed in the last 24 hours that it too is pushing ahead with its version of DST. The French are therefore slightly ahead in attracting international and particularly US ire, given DST is clearly focused on a small number of US Technology giants. This is likely to lead to retaliatory measures, most probably tariffs on French exporters to US markets.</p>
<p>“From a UK perspective the impact assessment note predicts a return to the exchequer of £370m in 20/21, rising to £440m by 22/23. While these are not small amounts, as a percentage of the UK’s total tax they are all but immaterial. As a result it would be best for the UK to simply wait until an international consensus is reached before introducing such measures, in particular given Brexit uncertainty and the need to portray the UK as an attractive place to locate and do business.</p>
<p>“Another issue is that although the de minimus limits appear a relatively high bar, £500m of digital services revenue and more than £25m derived from the UK before DST needs to be calculated, in practice this will catch a lot “smaller” groups, some of which may be wholly UK based, potentially losing 2% of their top line.”</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – RSM, the leading global network of audit, tax and consulting firms, has announced that its Chinese member firm Huapu Tianjian Certified Public Accountants (Huapu Tianjian) is finalising a merger with a significant part of a leading firm in China. The new combined organisation will rename to RSM China [容诚], strengthening the RSM brand and further increasing RSM’s client service expertise and scale in this critical economy.</p>
<p>With a combined workforce comprising 3,200 partners and employees across 15 offices, the new organisation will represent 40% growth on the current firm and cements RSM’s presence as a leading audit, tax and consulting provider in the Chinese market. The new team brings not only a strong client base and solid expertise in the Chinese IPO, M&amp;A; and securities markets, but also in tax, consulting and risk advisory services, complementing RSM China and consolidating its position as a competitive accounting firm in China with comprehensive service capabilities.</p>
<p>The merger will represent the second stage of a wider and targeted growth strategy for RSM in China, which began with Huapu Tianjian joining the RSM network in December 2018 and is designed to further expand RSM’s extensive footprint and service offering across mainland China. New offices will be opened in Xiamen, Wuxi, Fuzhou, Nanning and Nanjing and international client service hubs will be based in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Jean Stephens, CEO of RSM International said: “China is a crucial market for our clients who are increasingly looking for coordinated cross-border expertise that spans the globe. When Huapu Tianjian joined the RSM network, we were excited by their ambition and their client service approach. This merger is the next step in an ongoing growth strategy which will see RSM China achieve top ten status and prominence as a key player in the Chinese market”.</p>
<p>Houfa Xiao, Managing Partner of Huapu Tianjian commented: “Joining RSM has provided a platform for rapid growth. We have already climbed the rankings significantly and our short-term target is to join the top ten in China. With our new merger, as RSM China we will be even better placed to serve our national and international clients, and those of the wider RSM network looking to operate in the Chinese market. The new team brings strong expertise coupled with exceptional client service capabilities and we are excited to evolve our offering as a result.”</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in corporate finance creates substantial risk of abuses – but the solutions exist to ensure processes remain ethical and trustworthy, according to a world-first <a href=""https://drooms.com/en/whitepaper/ai-in-corporate-advisory?whitepaper=5350"" target=""_blank"">report</a> from <a href=""http://www.drooms.com/en"" target=""_blank"">Drooms</a>, Europe’s leading provider of secure cloud solutions, and ICAEW – the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales.</p>
<p>The report, entitled AI in Corporate Advisory, reveals that decision-making may soon be taken away from humans and guided instead by the application of AI in many stages of deal processes, including those in industries such as real estate, law and private equity. It examines the opportunities and risks of using AI for those involved in corporate finance transactions and how AI technologies will augment the existing business models of advisory firms.</p>
<p>While the report says that new regulatory measures for AI in corporate advisory are unnecessary because these already exist in sufficient quantity, it recommends that professional bodies should include the potential adaptation and/or extension of professional principles to include AI and big data.</p>
<p>Alexandre Grellier, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Drooms, commented: “The development of ethical principles and codes of practice is an important recommendation in the report. AI should be lawful, ethical and robust.</p>
<p>“AI is still at an early stage of development and the importance of the partnerships between industry and technology firms in ensuring it is developed properly cannot be underlined enough, especially in ensuring people and commercial related data is not mis-used.</p>
<p>“Such information must be handled in a transparent and understandable way. The good news is that we are developing algorithms to such a point that they match professional ethical values.”</p>
<p>Drooms aims to fulfil the key requirements for trustworthy and ethical AI by considering privacy and data governance, and human oversight. For example, it always keeps a human in the loop to confirm suggestions generated by AI to ensure quality of results and accountability, and it builds tools to help people be more efficient and effective, not to replace them by building fully automated systems. Drooms also takes into account guiding principles for designing intelligent solutions i.e. aiming at responsibility, explainability, accuracy, auditability and fairness.</p>
<p>Alexandre Grellier added: “The role of Virtual Data Rooms has already expanded immeasurably from two decades ago, when they were just an online replica of the physical spaces used by professionals carrying out due diligence, to having now become very secure online platforms for many aspects of the deal process and automated workflows e.g. findings, translations and auto-allocation in terms of AI.”</p>
<p>The AI in Corporate Advisory report says that AI-based technologies will have a marked impact on the global M&amp;A; market over the next decade. Experts interviewed for the report rated, on average, the likely significance of AI for corporate transactions as 9/10 – but their own organisations’ current level of AI adoption in corporate advisory as only 4/10, while they rated their clients’ levels of adoption for corporate transactions as just 3/10.</p>
<p>However, given that comprehensive, multi-layered analysis can produce complex results that require careful interpretation, the report concluded that professional judgement would become even more, rather than less, important in the age of AI.</p>
<p>David Petrie, Head of Corporate Finance, ICAEW, said: “For professional bodies, such as ICAEW, our role is to ensure that members remain at the cutting edge of the application of these new technologies and that they have the expertise, training and qualifications to make the commercial and ethical judgements vital in the brave new world of AI assisted deal-doing and corporate finance.”</p>

<p><strong>9<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Membership agreement enhances Standard Chartered’s benchmarking and modelling capabilities and strengthens Global Credit Data’s international coverage.</p>
<p>Global Credit Data (GCD) has welcomed its newest member, Standard Chartered, bringing its total number of member banks to 55 and expanding its international data coverage.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered – a leading international investment bank and financial services company – is present in over 60 markets and serves clients in a further 85. The addition of the bank’s data will provide valuable depth to GCD’s data pool, further strengthening the organisation’s international and regional coverage and cementing its reputation as the gold standard for credit risk data pooling.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to welcome Standard Chartered to our growing membership base,” says Richard Crecel, Executive Director at GCD. “Increasing the geographical scope of our data is a primary objective of ours and banks such as Standard Chartered represent important buildings block in our international coverage.”</p>
<p>Standard Chartered stands to gain significant benefits from its membership.</p>
<p>“Becoming a GCD member bank will help us enhance our benchmarking and modelling capabilities,” says Dr Julian Phillips, Global Head of Enterprise Risk Analytics at Standard Chartered. “We continuously work to upgrade our internal risk projection models and related analytics, and GCD provides us with valuable support and rich data coverage to help us fulfil our requirements.”</p>
<p>Fully onboarded, Standard Chartered is able to share its own data and leverage that of other member banks, allowing for instant comparisons across a range of model estimates, including probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD).</p>
<p>GCD’s databases operate on a “give-to-get” basis, meaning members must supply high-quality data to receive pooled data and analysis in return. Through the active participation of its member banks, GCD provides an international forum for exploring the intricacies of credit risk management and the sharing of best practice.</p>
<p>“The next step in expanding our databases,” Crecel adds, “will be deepening our coverage on a regional basis – through specialist banks operating on a smaller, regional and asset-specific scale.”</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – More than eight in ten CFOs (83%) say they expect the long-term business environment to deteriorate as a result of the UK leaving the EU, according to <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.deloitte.co.uk_cfosurvey&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&amp;r=p1k-f8Kazau7xl4nWaSjF63epS0tOwnr5P-LNMdWObYONb3s_dCgIxink3wu3viU&amp;m=y-1j0Ro7BHLN400KhcYo68PKT6-8QuCGqmPGri7Qc0k&amp;s=BfPIidHhR0YAzuuu4Bp3dANxTIcJHc633csyJvv27L0&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">Deloitte’s latest Q2 CFO Survey</a>. This is the highest reading since the referendum in June 2016.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the percentage of CFOs who think that now is a good time to take a greater risk onto their balance sheets has fallen to 4%, the lowest since the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p>
<p>Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, explains: “Events in the last three years, and recent news suggesting the economy shrank in the second quarter, have added to worries about the impact of Brexit. This is not solely a question of the long-term outlook. Brexit has not happened, but it is acting as a drag on corporate sentiment and spending. Almost two thirds (62%) of CFOs expect to reduce hiring in the next three years as a result of Brexit and almost half (47%) expect to reduce capital spending, suggesting a cautious approach from businesses.</p>
<p>“Ironically, risk appetite in the corporate sector has slumped just as it has taken off in the equity market. Measures of financial market volatility have declined, even though a majority of CFOs rate uncertainty as being at high or very high levels.”</p>
<p>The Deloitte CFO Survey gauges sentiment amongst the UK’s largest businesses. 79 CFOs participated, including CFOs of 48 FTSE 350 companies. The total market value of the listed companies that participated is £345 billion, approximately 15% of the UK quoted equity market. The Q2 2019 CFO survey ran between 12th and 28th June 2019.</p>
<h4 id=""investor-versus-corporate-sentiment"">Investor versus corporate sentiment</h4>
<p>While CFOs are battening down the hatches, investor confidence has surged, with the FTSE breaching 7,600 in July.</p>
<p>Ian Stewart said: “Equity valuations imply that investors believe central banks will save the day but the downbeat mood of UK CFOs suggests corporates are less sanguine.”</p>
<h4 id=""slump-in-confidence-and-concerns-over-hiring-prospects"">Slump in confidence and concerns over hiring prospects</h4>
<p>The survey shows that pessimism about the short-term effects of Brexit remains elevated, with 62% of CFOs expected to reduce hiring – the highest level in three years – and 25% cutting M&amp;A; as a consequence of Brexit.</p>
<p>There has also been a drop in confidence among CFOs. Of those surveyed, 9% say they are more optimistic about the prospects for their company than they were three months ago, compared to 13% in Q1 2019.</p>
<h4 id=""geopolitical-risks-heighten"">Geopolitical risks heighten</h4>
<p>Brexit remains the largest risk business face, rated at 65 (on a scale of 0 to 100) compared to 62 in the previous quarter. However, rising geopolitical risks are now the second largest concern for business, increasing to 60 from 55 last quarter.</p>
<p>The risk of greater protectionism in the US is also rated at 60, up from 49 in Q1.</p>
<p>Concerns about weakness in emerging markets and the euro area feature at the bottom of the CFO risk list.</p>
<h4 id=""corporates-remain-wary"">Corporates remain wary</h4>
<p>Corporates remain focused on defensive strategies with 52% citing cost control as a strong priority, down percentage point from Q1. This is followed by increasing cash flow, a strong priority for 43% of CFOs, down from 52%.</p>
<p>Richard Houston, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte North and South Europe, concludes: “The continued challenging and uncertain macro-economic environment is weighing on the corporate sector and its job creation and investment plans. Companies are looking for more certainty around our country’s economic future, as they prepare themselves for a post-Brexit environment.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2019</strong> – With the rapid development of Bitcoin and its bottom core blockchain technology, people have fancied the application of blockchain digital currency, and many Internet giants around the world have been on the road of cryptocurrency entrepreneurship. Since 2019, the MYPAY created by the famous American engineer Mett Rayan has attracted wide attention from the global media.</p>
<p>On June 26, 2019, US time, a huge promotional photo of MYPAY was unveiled in Times Square in New York. The loud slogan “Do not seek to change the world, only create more convenient applications for life” lit up the NASDAQ screen.</p>
<p>The Times Square in New York is known as the “crossroads of the world.” Tens of millions of business elites gather here every year. It is a veritable business core and a famous wealth landmark in the world. Among them, the Nasdaq semi-cylindrical large screen is one of the most striking landmarks. It is known as the “No.1 world screen” and has always been the showcase of the world’s top outstanding companies.</p>
<p>MYPAY is positioned to support multi-chain fully decentralized wallets and is dedicated to building decentralized blockchain banks as a tool for users to store digital assets, manage digital assets and pay. Landing on the Nasdaq’s big screen, it is seen as a symbol of wealth and development potential, and has voiced the world, showing MYPAY’s determination to forge ahead in the field of digital cash payments and lead the global payment market reform.</p>
<p>Mett Rayan is a famous American engineer and founder of MYPAY. MettRayan has a strong background in stack development, UI/UX and marketing. Mett Rayan has established several financial applications for Fortune 50 financial companies, global non-profit organizations’ distributed systems and e-commerce markets. Mett Rayan is involved in ethical hacking and has conducted in-depth research on the use of cryptographic techniques and blockchain techniques in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Mett Rayan believes that although future payments have been the direction of digital currency since its inception, due to the decentralization of the decentralized distributed confirmation mechanism of the blockchain, the delay time of the data synchronization network is too long, which makes it difficult for future payment. The damage suffered has hindered the development of future payments. Therefore, in the future digital cash payment application, whether real-time transaction can be realized is the key to whether users can accept it on a large scale. In the blockchain digital cash space, the DAPP wallet is a trend and the only window for mobile customers to pay.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mett Rayan officially entered the blockchain industry and established MYPAY to develop a double-chain payment system for the difficulties of digital cash payment.</p>
<p>MYPAY focuses on six systems (wallet system, payment system, settlement system, financial management system, incubation system, credit system) and Equity Token (MPC) to achieve multi-currency secure storage, fast cross-border consumption, and fast cross-border settlement, stable continuous income, STO + index trading, big data credit promotion. It customizes payment and marketing solutions for food, apparel, gaming, e-commerce, healthcare, accommodation, travel, financial management and other industries. MYPAY wallet is rich in assets and insists on expanding the types of digital currency. In addition to basic services, customers who use MYPAY wallets can also enjoy quantitative wealth management value-added services.</p>
<p>Mett Rayan said that MYPAY, as a mobile application payment window, is committed to completely solving the problem of blockchain network delay, achieving international off-site peer-to-peer exchange, point-to-point fast exchange, currency transaction diversion, and international merchants’ fast payment. The landing of this concept will promote the development of the entire blockchain industry and even the payment market.</p>
<p>The person in charge said that MYPAY has deposited more than 800 tokens and successfully launched the MYPAY wallet and online alpha quantified transaction. Next, MYPAY will continue to develop along the wallet ecosystem, such as blockchain mall, quality third-party DAPP access, blockchain application finance, etc. It is expected that MYPAY Equity Token will be launched in 2020 with double-chain payment. The system will also be launched in 2020.</p>
<p>In the future development of the Internet, the value of the Internet based on blockchain technology will replace the existing information Internet, and the important position of digital currency in the value Internet will gradually emerge. The appearance on the big screen of the NASDAQ is a showcase of MYPAY’s past achievements and the starting point for a new journey. It may lead us into a new era of paying for life.</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – HSBC today announced the launch of Next Generation Virtual Accounts to help wholesale clients increase their cash management efficiency by consolidating bank accounts and centralising transactions.</p>
<p>As an innovative multi-currency solution, available in more than 20 currencies, Next Generation Virtual Accounts build on the reconciliation benefits of traditional virtual accounts by enabling treasurers to centralise payments and receivables across multiple and single entity structures.</p>
<p>Clients can consolidate hundreds of bank accounts into a handful, or as few as one account for each currency that they use. Transactions flow through the underlying physical accounts, with the virtual accounts acting as ledger records. This saves treasury teams the operational cost of managing cash across multiple accounts and reduces the need for complex cash sweeps and pools.</p>
<p>HSBC’s solution provides even greater efficiency and flexibility as clients can simply go online to manage their own virtual account structures, tailored to their business needs. For example, smaller companies operating as a single entity may wish to assign virtual accounts by product line. Larger firms running an in-house bank may want to group virtual accounts by entity.</p>
<p>Thomas Halpin, Global Head of Payment Product, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC said: “Next Generation Virtual Accounts are a powerful tool for treasurers who want to simplify their cash management. Our solution allows treasurers to create an account structure that works for them. It is innovative, intuitive and it has been well-received by clients around the world.”</p>
<p>Suraj Kalati, Global Head of Liquidity and Investments, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC said: “Virtual accounts are a natural intercompany solution that enables everyone to focus on what they do best. Entities can focus on buying and selling, without having to manage physical bank accounts, while the corporate treasury gains greater visibility of the overall cash position and more control over their use of funds.”</p>
<p>HSBC Next Generation Virtual Accounts have gone live in the UK, USA, Hong Kong and Singapore. It will be available in Ireland, the Netherlands and the UAE later this year.</p>
<p>In addition to the self-management of virtual accounts, clients can receive near-real-time reporting on transactions, through HSBCnet. HSBC Next Generation Virtual Accounts also integrates with treasury management systems or Enterprise Risk Systems using industry standard electronic formats.</p>
<p>HSBC’s virtual account management platform offers additional benefits for businesses that use HSBC Client Money Manager (in the UK). This will enable a better user experience for businesses such as law firms or property developers, which need to hold client funds in designated accounts.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2019</strong> – In the latest SME financing research conducted by Linkflow Capital, more SMEs in 2018 experienced improved access to financing.</p>
<p>According to Linkflow Capital, up to 34% of SMEs gained access to financing in 2018, a marked improvement from 2017’s survey data which suggested that only 19% of SMEs were qualified for business financing.</p>
<p>Research data and statistics are derived from Linkflow Capital’s SME loan comparison portal launched in 2017. For this latest survey, data was generated from over 2771 users for the period January to December 2018.</p>
<p>“In 2018, our dataset suggests a significant improvement for SMEs attempting to secure business financing, with up to 34% of our portal users eligible indicatively for financing. This is almost double that of our 2017 survey which indicated only a 19% eligibility rate.” said Ben Teo, a spokesperson for Linkflow Capital.</p>
<p>“In our opinion, some of the reasons for this improvement in financing eligibility could be due to factors such as the government’s continued support to SMEs in financing schemes such as the SME Working Capital Loan and healthy domestic economic growth in 2018 that exceeded expectations. More alternative lending options for SMEs such as P2P crowdfunding platforms introduced in recent years could also lead to an increase in business lending.”</p>
<p>Some of the headline figures that resulted in the improvement in financing access culled from this survey includes an improvement in profitability. Data from 2017’s survey indicated that 55% of users were loss-making. For 2018’s research findings, only 19% of users reported financial losses.</p>
<p>For both years’ research, a common reason for financing ineligibility due to smallish revenue and poor cash flow stayed consistent. 51% of users reported both annual revenue of below S$300,000 and low operating cash flow. This does not differ much from 2017’s figures with 52% of users who declared the same.</p>
<p>It is also noted that more new startups are trying to access financing. In 2018’s data, 26% of users are businesses incorporated for less than a year, compared to 21% in 2017.</p>
<p>For more figures and data on Linkflow Capital’s research for 2018, kindly visit their webpage at <a href=""https://smeloan.sg/blog/2018-sme-finance-accessibility-survey"" target=""_blank"">https://smeloan.sg/blog/2018-sme-finance-accessibility-survey</a></p>
<p>As we cross the halfway mark in 2019, recent released economic data suggests that the overall macro view of Singapore’s trade-reliant economy does not seem optimistic against the backdrop of the US-China trade war.</p>
<p>Economists have revised downwards on our economic growth prospects for 2019 if global trade continues to face headwinds. This might lead to an adverse impact on overall financing liquidity for SMEs. Businesses should well pay heed to be watchful and plan ahead for their short to mid-term financing needs.</p>

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> July 2019</strong> – Following a rigorous and successful Beta testing phase during which more than $400M of FTFs were issued.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring, the London-based financial technology company today announced the launch of its Fixed-Term Fund (FTF) platform.</p>
<p>A Fixed-Term Fund is a completely new financial instrument, conceived, designed and built by TreasurySpring, to unlock the multi-trillion dollar wholesale money markets by providing new digital pipelines to connect cash-rich firms to institutional borrowers from the sovereign, bank and corporate sectors.</p>
<p>FTFs enable all holders of large cash balances, from corporates to charities, private funds to insurance companies, family offices to private banks and beyond, to reduce and diversify risk on those balances, whilst simultaneously increasing returns. For investment-grade firms seeking financing, TreasurySpring’s FTF platform provides flexible, low-cost access to a diverse universe of new short-term funding sources.</p>
<p>An FTF shares many of the characteristics of a term deposit, in that it is a term product that can be acquired without the need for any infrastructure. However, instead of providing exposure to unsecured bank risk, as with a deposit, an FTF can offer exposure to any short-dated, investment grade fixed-income obligation, such as a single government bill, a single secured bank loan or a single investment-grade corporate loan, for example.</p>
<p>The FTF platform can be accessed directly via TreasurySpring’s cloud-based web-portal and has been designed to integrate easily into other platforms via secure APIs, making it straightforward to interact with cash investors, issuers, portals and treasury management systems. Since issuing the world's first FTF in June 2018 in Beta phase, clients from multiple sectors have purchased more than $400M of FTFs across a broad range of new products, with more than $300M of issuance in 2019 already.</p>
<p>Kevin Cook, co-founder and CEO, TreasurySpring, said: “The public launch of our online platform is the culmination of three years work to build the financial, operational and technological infrastructure necessary to deliver truly digital pipelines that connect cash rich investors to institutional borrowers. Through these pipelines, we are democratising access to the wholesale money markets, enabling every holder of large cash balances to invest them in the same way as the most sophisticated financial institutions. We designed our FTF platform in response to clear and repeated demand for cash investment alternatives - alternatives that allow investors to risk less but earn more – and we are delighted to now be able to deliver simple standardised, regulated products to meet that demand.”</p>
<p>Tim Howell, former CEO of Euroclear and investor in TreasurySpring added: “I have known the TreasurySpring executive team for a number of years now and firmly believe that FTFs bring true innovation to our industry; indeed, I believe we are looking at the first material innovation in this space since the creation of money market funds in the 1970s.”</p>
<p>Justin Meadows, founder and former CEO of NEX Treasury and investor in TreasurySpring commented: “When Kevin and his partners first explained the concept behind Fixed-Term Funds to me back in 2016, I knew that they were onto something special. FTFs are a simple but powerful tool that can add value to treasury teams of all shapes and sizes; and with the ease of onboarding and execution through their new online portal, I expect to see the speed of adoption continue to grow rapidly over the coming months and years.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> July 2019</strong> – TreasuryXpress, the global leader of on-demand <a href=""https://treasuryxpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">treasury management solutions</a> (TMS) today announced a year over year, global sales increase of 83% across the Americas, EMEA, and MENA regions for their on-demand TMS during the first half of 2019. The firm expects to be on target for another triple digit growth of the year. Supporting this accelerated growth, the firm also announced they experienced a 60% hiring increase in their product innovation and client experience teams during this time period.</p>
<p>The firm attributes their continued growth to the scalability and flexibility of their on-demand TMS model as well as their leading, in-house client experience model for both implementation and support. Global companies such as ASGC Group and Orange Lake Resorts are among just a few of the firm’s latest client announcements. With these additions and the company’s expansion into further key markets in Latin America and Europe, TreasuryXpress now supports clients in over 55 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>“Today’s generation of treasury professionals expect for technology to be easy,” says Anis Rahal, CEO and founder of TreasuryXpress. “They understand that it is possible to have economical and frictionless accessibility to the technology that is going to help them gain visibility and control over their global treasury operations.”</p>
<p>As treasury teams and banks globally continue to widely seek and adapt on demand solutions, the company has realized double and triple year over year growth since it introduced the industry’s first on demand TMS solution in 2015.</p>
<p>“TMS providers can no longer force inflexible, commoditized solutions on treasury,” continues Rahal. “At TreasuryXpress, we are realizing tremendous growth because we are helping to move the industry into a new era of leveraging digital tools that offer a simpler way of working; tools that provide an economized and scalable way of integrating financial data and systems for treasury teams everywhere.”</p>
<p>Built for speed and efficiency, TreasuryXpress’ on-demand TMS model significantly eliminates manual processes throughout all stages of the technology lifecycle for treasury teams and fosters platform interactivity.

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>1<sup>st</sup> July 2019</strong> – The majority of CFOs (65%) expect digital transformation to significantly reduce the number of jobs in the financial services industry, according to the results of the 2019 FinTech Barometer, an annual survey conducted by order-to-cash specialist <a href=""https://www.onguard.com/"" target=""_blank"">Onguard</a>. CFOs are also concerned about their own job security. In fact, 38% of them believe their job will no longer exist in its current form ten years from now. This is a substantial increase from last year, when only 6% of the respondents reported job loss fears. Those below director level are more pessimistic. Over half (57%) of financial managers anticipate the disappearance of financial jobs in general. This includes their own jobs, since almost a quarter (23%) of them believe their current job will no longer exist ten years from now.</p>
<h4>Finance professional skills</h4>
<p>The belief that finance professional jobs are at risk is down to the rapid development of new technologies. Jobs are changing and the financial industry requires different skills. 65% of the finance professionals who responded to the survey anticipate having to develop analytical skills. In the near future, they will need these skills to interpret and analyse data as part of the digital transformation. Skills seen as less important in the short term are communication skills (54%), leadership qualities (36%) and programming skills (13%).</p>
<p>Bert van der Zwan, CEO at Onguard: “Each new era changes the way things are done and jobs evolve accordingly. We see the same thing happening in this era of digital transformation. Companies have been automating routine administrative tasks for some time which is reducing the amount of back office work done by people. So, back office jobs will be the first to disappear. People will still be needed, but not to do what robots can do perfectly 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Jobs that can be done by robots have no future. To change and evolve with the industry, finance professionals will find that developing new skills is a must.”</p>

<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.kyriba.com/"" target=""_blank"">Kyriba</a>, the global leader in cloud treasury and finance solutions, today announced that one of its clients, Naval Group, is now live with SWIFT gpi for Corporates, a new cross-border payments feature from SWIFT, the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services. The new payments feature, coupled with Kyriba’s secure payments solutions, empowers joint clients with greater transparency, and faster confirmation of sent and received payments. Naval Group, an international high-tech company and leader in naval defense systems, was among the first to complete a payment through the SWIFT gpi early adopter program. SWIFT gpi offers yet another option for Kyriba clients to optimize their payments experience world-wide.</p>
<p>“Naval Group is committed to maintaining the highest standards in compliance, and the new Kyriba SWIFT gpi offering helps our team to strengthen payments transparency and traceability so we can expand our position as the European leader in naval defense,” said David Livi, vice president of treasury and financing at Naval Group.</p>
<p>According to Livi, the new service will also help protect payments for Naval Group’s clients and suppliers in the 18 countries where the company operates.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be the first high-tech company in naval defense to use the new SWIFT gpi feature powered by our Kyriba platform,” Livi said. “The first payment was successfully made with Société Générale.”</p>
<p>Kyriba delivers superior payments options and bank connectivity for more than 2,000 clients worldwide. Through its secure, highly scalable SaaS platform, Kyriba processes more than 83 million bank transactions, 30 million payments and 530 million ERP transactions on behalf of its clients each month.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of cross-border payments, totaling over $300bn, are sent every day using the new gpi standard.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – The trend of unicorn IPOs coming to market and pushing their proceeds to historic levels continued in Q2 2019 despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions, resulting in 507 IPOs in H1 2019, raising total proceeds of US$71.9b. While deal numbers were down 28% from H1 2018, first-day returns on the main markets were up 15.4% on average and post-IPO performance increased 28.4%.</p>
<p>Technology, health care and industrials saw the largest share of IPOs in H1 2019, together accounting for 266 IPOs (52% of global IPOs by deal numbers) and raising US$47.8b altogether (66% of global proceeds). By proceeds, technology was the strongest sector with US$29.3b raised (41% of global proceeds). These and other findings were published today in the EY quarterly report, Global IPO trends: Q2 2019.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin Steinbach, EY Global and EY EMEIA IPO Leader, says: “Following the trend of increased unicorn IPO activity, Q2 2019 welcomed a number of much-anticipated, high-profile unicorns. The global IPO activity slowdown continued following an unusually quiet Q1 2019 as ongoing geopolitical tensions, trade issues among the US, China and the EU, Brexit and the outcome of European elections dampened IPO sentiment. The main way for issuers to navigate the shift from old to new realities in unpredictable markets is to remain flexible. So well-prepared companies, with the right equity story, will find their windows of opportunity. We expect higher IPO activity in the second half of 2019.”</p>
<h4>Asia Pacific IPO plans accelerated to get ahead of economic headwinds</h4>
<p>Ongoing trade tensions between China and the US continued to impact IPO activity in YTD 2019, inhibiting a return to 2018 levels. IPO activity across the Asia-Pacific region in YTD 2019 was down 12% by volume (266 IPOs) and 27% by proceeds (US$22.3b), compared with YTD 2018.</p>
<p>However, Asia-Pacific continued to dominate global IPO activity YTD 2019, by volumes, representing six of the top ten exchanges. By proceeds, the region accounted for three of the top ten exchanges. Asia-Pacific’s main markets experienced average first-day returns of around 19% and average current returns of 34%, illustrating that IPO performance continues to elevate IPO investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Mainland China exchanges saw 27% more IPOs (33 IPOs) in Q2 2019 compared with Q2 2018, but a 38% decline in funds raised (US$5.1b) due to a lack of mega IPOs. However, Mainland China IPO activity is expected to improve during H2 2019 following the launch of the Sci-Tech innovation board (STAR Market) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Japan’s IPO markets remained stable in YTD 2019, posting a slight increase in deal numbers compared with YTD 2018. There were 41 IPOs in YTD 2019 versus 39 IPOs in YTD 2018 while proceeds (US$1.3b) were notably lower than YTD 2018 (US$2.8b).</p>
<p>Asean exchanges saw a total of 48 IPOs, raising US$2.0b in proceeds in YTD 2019, posting a slight decline (8%) in deal volume, with proceeds notably lower (a 55% decline), compared to H1 2018. During the period, Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) saw the highest deal numbers, accounting for 35% of deal volume and 10% by proceeds in the region, while the Singapore Exchange (SGX) led by proceeds; its main and junior markets together accounted for 61% of Asean proceeds and 17% by deal number.</p>
<p>In Q2 2019, Asean saw a notable increase in deal numbers (29 IPOs, a 53% rise) over Q1 2019 and a significant boost in proceeds (US$1.7b, a 447% rise), suggesting some signs of market recovery. The SGX ranked 10th among global exchanges by proceeds for Q2 2019 due to two sizeable real estate investment trust IPOs.</p>
<p>Max Loh, EY Asean and Singapore Managing Partner, Ernst &amp; Young LLP says:</p>
<p>“Economic uncertainty and ongoing trade issues continued to cast a shadow over IPO markets across the Asean region. Entrepreneurial companies accounted for the majority of IPOs that launched in the first half of 2019. The notable increase in small-cap listings consolidates the view that there is still a general propensity for entrepreneurial companies to go public. As geopolitical volatility subsides and as average post-IPO performance stabilizes, we expect Asean IPO sentiment to commensurately improve.”</p>
<h4>Americas IPO markets rebound</h4>
<p>On a quarterly basis the Americas saw 87 IPOs that raised $28.1b in Q2 2019, representing an increase of 5% by deal numbers and rise of 50% by proceeds from Q2 2018. However, YTD 2019 activity was down 14% with 118 deals, and proceeds fell by 12% to US$33.6b, compared with YTD 2018.</p>
<p>Despite this, the NYSE and NASDAQ ranked first and second respectively by proceeds globally in H1 2019. US exchanges accounted for 75% of Americas IPOs by number of deals (88 IPOs) and 96% by proceeds (US$32.2b) in H1 2019, driven by several high-profile technology unicorns that went public during Q2 2019.</p>
<p>Jackie Kelley, EY Americas IPO Leader, says: “Finally, a wave of much-anticipated, household name unicorns entered the US IPO market, reigniting IPO activity and sparking an increase in constructive investor sentiment. The majority of IPOs delivered positive post-IPO returns in the quarter, especially high-growth companies, which sets the stage for continued momentum in IPO activity.”</p>
<h4>EMEIA continue to proceed cautiously within persistent geopolitical uncertainties</h4>
<p>In EMEIA, deal volumes and proceeds were down from YTD 2018 with EMEIA exchanges posting 123 IPOs (a decline of 53%) and raising a total of US$16.0b (also a decline of 48%). Despite these challenges, EMEIA accounted for five of the top ten exchanges globally by proceeds and two by deal numbers. Overall, due to strong first-day returns and YTD IPO performance and investor confidence, EMEIA IPO markets are expected to gain momentum in the second half of 2019.</p>
<p>Europe experienced a notable increase in IPO activity in Q2 2019, with volumes up 100% (48 deals) and proceeds up a significant 3,338% (US$12.5b) from Q1 2019.</p>
<p>Both domestic and cross-border activity also gathered steam in the UK in Q2 2019 as 11 companies went public, representing proceeds of US$4.5b.</p>
<p>Steinbach says: “EMEIA is a region that is more dependent than others on global trade, and therefore, more sensitive to persistent geopolitical uncertainties. Given that the largest trades flows in the world are between the US as well as China with the European Union, EMEIA serves as a bellwether in determining global economic health. If the US and China can resolve their trade and tariff issues, and if the UK and the EU can agree on terms for an orderly Brexit, we can expect IPO activity to rebound in the second half of 2019. In the meantime, EMEIA IPO candidates continue to prepare so that they are ready to leap when the timing is right.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> July 2019</strong> – The J.P. Morgan Working Capital Index report estimates $460 billion in liquidity trapped across the supply chains of the S&amp;P; 1500 companies.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan today announced the launch of the J.P. Morgan Working Capital Index, which enables companies to benchmark their working capital performance against industry peers. By capturing and consolidating the working capital metrics from the companies listed on the S&amp;P; Composite 1500 index, it provides valuable insights for firms into the working capital performance of some the world’s largest and most influential companies. In addition to the launch of the new index, J.P. Morgan also published a report on working capital trends from 2011 to 2018.</p>
<p>“Industry benchmarking is typically the first step for many companies looking to optimize their working capital, but there are limited tools available to do this effectively, primarily because of the lack of access to reliable industry data. We developed the Index to help our clients identify inefficient use of liquidity within their organizations and explore opportunities to improve their internal sources of funding,” said Gourang Shah, head of Treasury Services Solutions for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>The analysis of the Index found substantial liquidity trapped within the supply chains of the S&amp;P; 1500 companies, with the potential to release an estimated $460 billion through working capital optimization programs. The industries that have shown the most improvement in optimizing working capital between 2011 and 2018 are utilities, consumer staples and logistics. Sectors that have been challenged over the same period include aerospace and defense, semiconductors and media, according to the report.</p>
<p>“The differences in working capital performances both across and within industries are driven by a myriad of internal and external factors and it’s important for companies to understand the drivers to formulate the best strategy to optimize internal liquidity. We view the J.P. Morgan Working Capital Index as a starting point to benchmark performance, guide action plans and monitor progress,” Shah added.</p>
<p>“In conversations with our clients, it is clear CFOs and treasurers are increasingly committed to improving internal sources of liquidity, given the rapidly evolving environment in which they operate. The J.P. Morgan Working Capital Index is designed to provide a credible benchmark for them to set specific and quantitative goals in their working capital strategy and execute accordingly,” said Sridhar Kanthadai, head of Wholesale Payments, Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan.</p>

<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> announced today that it has partnered with Xceptor, an intelligent automation software company, to offer new reconciliation functionality to its securities market customers.

<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – In light of reports that 206,000 cases have been reported within the first nine months of GDPR reporting, <a href=""https://www.engagetech.com/"" target=""_blank"">Engage Technology Partners</a> has urged employers to review their contractor and employee compliance and management processes.</p>
<p>Although it has now been one year since GDPR was enforced, it is clear that more must be done to educate businesses on being compliant. <a href=""http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/LIBE/DV/2019/02-25/9_EDPB_report_EN.pdf"" target=""_blank"">The data</a>, which was provided by the European Data Protection board, reveals that out of the hundreds of thousands of cases reported, 95,000 were complaints and 65,000 were data security breach notifications. It was also exposed that fines totalling €56 million were handed out by national data protection agencies across 11 countries.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new data, Alex Fraser, Director of Engage Technology Partners, said:</p>
<p>“As we’re one year on since the introduction of GDPR, companies may be tempted to relax about the regulations, however, the data clearly shows that being negligent can have severe consequences on reputation and bottom line. With procedures getting more complex by the day, to really protect your company against GDPR claims, businesses must invest in an automated system that will keep their firm safe and in check. Dated systems, like the manual collection of sensitive information, are exposed to risks such as exploitation or mishandling. An electronic system, however, which manages all information in one place and ensures GDPR compliance will keep all worries away.”</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.axiomsl.com/"" target=""_blank"">AxiomSL</a>, the leading provider of regulatory reporting and risk management solutions, today announces that it has entered into a partnership with Refinitiv, one of the world’s largest providers of financial markets data and infrastructure. Combining AxiomSL’s robust Global Shareholding Disclosures (GSD) solution with Refinitiv’s reference data enables Financial Institutions (FIs) to automatically enrich their clients’ positions while managing regulatory obligations across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>As financial markets become increasingly more complex and global in nature, FIs face three main challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keeping up with regulatory rules and reporting template requirements across 100 countries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessing reliable market data to ensure that position percentage calculations are accurate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automating the process for GSD reporting to meet daily monitoring requirements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of Refinitiv's comprehensive reference data, including issuer and class level shares, voting rights, and takeover panel data, and AxiomSL’s ControllerView® platform that provides monitoring, automation and transparency enables market participants to understand data and reporting issues to successfully comply with shareholding disclosure requirements, globally.</p>
<p>Refinitiv’s GSD data comes pre-configured for compatibility on the AxiomSL platform to deliver full traceability throughout the monitoring process. This collaborative approach reduces the burden on clients to source and integrate market data while enhancing the automation of the entire end-to-end monitoring process.</p>
<p>John Mason, Head of Pricing and Reference Data, Refinitiv, commented: “Asset managers face a significant challenge in understanding local rules around shareholder disclosures and calculating their own holdings given the complexities around voting rights and share classes. This partnership provides a simple solution by combining AxiomSL’s state of the art technology with Refinitiv’s comprehensive global data, enabling asset managers to quickly and easily assess their positions in different instruments.”</p>
<p>Ed Royan, General Manager, AxiomSL EMEA, commented: “We are pleased to partner with Refinitiv, one of the world’s largest providers of financial markets data and infrastructure, in addressing the challenges of data transparency requirements set out by regulatory authorities across the globe when rules differs from country to country. These challenges range from sourcing high quality market data to addressing jurisdictional nuances to remain aligned with disclosure rules. This partnership unlocks many benefits from streamlining and automating complex rules to seamlessly ingesting and aggregating disparate data resulting in a rapid go-live process.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – Eighty-two percent of companies plan to reduce their legal function costs over the next two years, with 42% of respondents planning on doing so by more than 10%, according to a new report released today by EY. <a href=""https://www.ey.com/en_gl/tax/why-the-legal-function-must-be-reimagined-for-the-digital-age"" target=""_blank"">Reimagining the Legal Function Report 2019</a> surveyed more than 1,000 senior legal practitioners across 25 jurisdictions and found that, on average, companies plan to reduce their legal function costs by 11%, with the current average legal spend equating to US$172m for internal and US$169m for external.</p>
<p>Across regions, the anticipated reduction in spend is greatest in North America, where reductions of 13% are planned, with Europe and Asia-Pacific expecting the least impactful reductions at an average of 9%.</p>
<p>Cornelius Grossmann, EY Global Law Leader, says: “In the face of heightened demand from the business for legal support in a rapidly changing regulatory environment, the findings support the generally acknowledged position that legal functions are increasingly being challenged to do more with less. New operating models will need to evolve to address these challenges. Courageous innovation will enable legal functions to drive true value in company-wide transformation initiatives.”</p>
<h4 id=""challenges-in-talent-and-innovation"">Challenges in talent and innovation</h4>
<p>The survey highlights difficulty in attracting and deploying talent. Nearly three out of five businesses (59%) reported challenges in attracting and retaining the appropriate talent needed for today’s legal function. Deployment is also a challenge; legal functions find they exhaust considerable time and effort on routine tasks, with 67% of respondents spending 20% of their time on routine compliance and “low value” tasks.</p>
<p>The survey also highlights that legal functions are in danger of falling behind when it comes to innovation. Sixty-four percent of respondents felt that the legal function has not benefitted from innovation as much as other functions, such as HR, IT and finance. Respondents cite “ongoing business-as-usual pressures” as the greatest barrier to innovation over the next 12 months at 36%, followed by “budget constraints” at 32% and “lack of management skill/interest” at 28%.</p>
<h4 id=""a-need-to-re-evaluate-operating-models"">A need to re-evaluate operating models</h4>
<p>Looking to the future, key trends identified include the increased adoption of outsourcing: 74% of organizations are either outsourcing already or would consider doing so for functions including contract management, document retention, due diligence, employment law, and entity and document management.</p>
<p>Procurement models are also shifting, with increased consideration now being given to alternative legal service providers (ALSPs) in order to drive value. Although the trend is visible across businesses of all sizes, it is particularly prevalent among smaller legal functions, with 60% of those with a headcount lower than 1,000 considering ALSPs and legal process outsourcers, a rise of 17% compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>Grossmann says: “Many legal functions have been resilient in dealing with changes over time, but we see momentum for change. Finding the right balance of technical expertise, work allocation and efficient technology utilization will remain the paramount challenges of this critical transformation process.”</p>

<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – BELLIN, a global leader in providing treasury software and services, has successfully integrated SWIFT gpi for Corporates (g4C) in its tm5 treasury management system and completed the pilot and Early Adopter phase. With the BELLIN SWIFT product offering extended, all BELLIN clients can now benefit from fast cross-border payments as well as tracking directly in the tm5 system.</p>
<p>tm5, BELLIN’s treasury management system, has supported SWIFT g4C technology since as early as April, making BELLIN the first of the TMS provider Early Adopters with a customer live on g4C. SWIFT has now officially launched gpi for Corporates, enabling all users of the BELLIN SWIFT Service to consider benefiting from transparency and traceability for cross-border payments. Corporates need their own SWIFT BIC to make use of the SWIFT g4C technology. They register their BIC with gpi for Corporates and connect financial institutions that offer g4C. Starting Monday, June 24, 2019, the entire SWIFT community can register their BICs for the new SWIFT g4C technology.</p>
<p>“All of us, our clients, BELLIN and SWIFT, are bound by the desire to advance corporate payments. This is why we have worked hard in a concerted effort to implement SWIFT g4C technology,” explains Karsten Kiefer, Product Manager SOLUTION MANAGEMENT at BELLIN. “With SWIFT g4C, corporates will benefit enormously from speed, transparency and comprehensive information with cross-border payment processing. The obvious advantages will make for an immediate success story.”</p>
<p>The BELLIN SWIFT Service enables BELLIN clients to receive their own BIC and to gain access to the SWIFT Network as a member of the Standard Corporate Environment (SCORE). BELLIN takes care of the BIC application, connects the company to the SWIFT Network and guides the client through onboarding and configuration. The BELLIN SWIFT Service has been part of BELLIN’s portfolio since 2013, making BELLIN the very first treasury management system provider with a service of this kind. Today, over 160 customers use the BELLIN SWIFT Service.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – SWIFT has today released a landmark paper, “Payments: looking to the future”, in which the global co-operative articulates the future of cross-border payments. With the increase in cross-border flows, new technology enabling dramatic improvements and end-customers demanding a better customer experience, SWIFT is setting out its views on the future of cross-border payments in order to support the community.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s view of the future is deceptively simple: to make cross-border payments real-time, 24/7 and as seamless, convenient, cost-efficient and accessible as domestic payments.</p>
<p>The paper lays out the elements and dynamics supporting the revolution in international payments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A core infrastructure, that responds to the challenge of bridging the ‘closed loops’ of individual payments systems and securely unlocks value across borders, supporting trade and economic growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The widespread adoption of SWIFT gpi, which will be the universal standard by 2020, making every cross-border payment fast, transparent, traceable and truly global – unlocking value from every account, to every account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hyper-connected future, in which gpi-enabled banks are the bridges between real-time domestic payments infrastructures, enabling instant cross-border payments to move seamlessly and safely across borders via SWIFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smarter payments which utilise superior data and the power of AI and machine learning for effective and efficient financial crime compliance and to eliminate the hold-ups and bottlenecks caused by missing or incorrect information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modern, open, globally adopted standards, which allow smaller markets to internationalise faster and larger markets to fluidly transfer value through the entire payments chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further embracing new technologies that serve a real purpose to resolve industry problems through the deployment of cutting edge technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vibrant and innovative ecosystem, with API technologies supporting open, agile architectures that allow fintechs to offer value-add services and banks to differentiate themselves by layering services and products.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments are not an end in themselves – they exist to enable investment, trade and commerce. By laying out this industry roadmap, SWIFT aims to galvanise the global payments community – market infrastructures, banks and fintechs – to collaborate and help drive progress, ensuring cross-border payments better serve market needs.</p>

<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – The leading global financial institution J.P. Morgan today announced the launch of E-Customs Payment Solution, making it the first foreign bank in China to offer a solution that fully digitizes and automates cross-border payments of goods. The solution solves common pain points associated with the manual nature of such transactions.</p>
<p>Importers in China are required to provide supporting documents to their banks prior to making payments to overseas suppliers, a process that is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. With the E-Customs Payment Solution, J.P. Morgan’s clients in China will only be required to send the payment instructions with linked customs declaration number. Using Application Programming Interface (API) technology, J.P. Morgan’s E-Customs Payment Solution will then retrieve the relevant customs declaration status in detail from the local authorities via the Shanghai International Trade Single Window in real time and process the payments automatically. Clients will be able to keep track of their payments through J.P. Morgan Access® at all times.</p>
<p>“J.P. Morgan’s E-Customs Payment Solution has significantly improved our operational efficiency with time and resource savings and reduced manual inaccuracies while keeping our business fully compliant. We have been able to make comprehensive business decisions from a treasury perspective as a result,” said Jason Tan, head of Treasury &amp; Credit Management, Asia, Continental AG. The technology company is currently implementing E-Customs Payment Solution as it looks to fully digitize its cross-border payment processes.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to roll out an innovative solution that enables the full digitization of cross-border payments, which we view as a milestone and one that addresses our clients’ specific needs amid a rapidly-evolving treasury landscape. As a global leader in cash management, J.P. Morgan has been investing heavily in this space to better serve our clients and we continue to invest and set a new benchmark for innovation in the banking industry,” said Rani Gu, head of Treasury Services, China and head of Treasury Services Product, Greater China, Wholesale Payments, J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan has been actively exploring how emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, and an enhanced digital experience can be deployed in its payments business to better serve its clients’ ever changing needs. The bank spends more than $11.5 billion in technology firmwide annually, a significant portion of which is invested in new technologies. J.P. Morgan’s Treasury Services business processes up to $6 trillion in payments a day in over 100 currencies across 60+ countries.</p>

La Fosse Pro Bono will operate with charities throughout the UK.</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href=""http://email.precise.uk/c/eJwtjstuxCAMRb8m7EC8EsiCRTsPabbtFxBwGtR0GAFRlH59PdVI1rH8uPaNDnSAMJPkJBcjH5BaGamZYPpirL2eTudecy7ludP8USCkCmz7JoubbB-4HXprhIqTGEYjtI0wjHKKo_GevPsWls_0C05wzsnqltYetVNvnbxi7PvOwuJLakdMX6n59Q57ZSHjeRw__WDi4gmFmPNW6EtAwzFBoRXC9l-2AvdY6ZwLfelIcRBTyyX5FZ3jgq9bOVqO_sAfP6S5D1ixCbeIlnphrfoDwtFTlA"" target=""_blank"">one in five UK charities</a> fell victim to a cyber-attack and the number is expected to continue in line with the size of the sector itself. Indeed, latest figures show there are <a href=""http://email.precise.uk/c/eJwdjstuwyAURL_G7ECYR0wWLNqkkbptvwDDJUZxbetyvaBfX1RpNNKczZzkwUSImRWv5HiVl95GT8qIUZiPybnH7Xa3Rkql7oORB0IsFcT5YouHGNKc8tUG6ZJ2c7D6orKddZ7jaCfH3gPF5bv8gh-llGz1C9FRB_02qEfPlo_aNsBnExtQBxkBOMKx4_8KkSoPW-K5PE-Eys8Xj0vAQo1XiLQj77aOoYdU-iph7YqEEOqJjfYUmoj7DyP_BWuH8Jn6tx2d038Az07I"" target=""_blank"">200,000 registered charities</a> in the UK who between them employ almost 900,000 people and generate a combined income of £48 billion.</p>
<p>This makes the charity sector one of the largest in the UK economy and the reason why 40,000 charities experienced a cyber-attack over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>But with tightening budgets, many charities lack the resources available to prevent these crimes from taking place. That is where La Fosse’s Pro Bono practice comes into play, as James Parker, CEO, explains:</p>
<p>“Care is a founding principle of La Fosse that extends beyond our own people, the clients we work with and candidates we help. It is the driving force behind the rapid growth we have experienced over the last 10 years, and the reason why we are now perfectly positioned to support those organisations who need it most.</p>
<p>“With a team of over 200 people operating across the UK and the United States, we have built a national and international network of skilled cyber professionals who are among the best in the industry.</p>
<p>“Our charity partners can tap into this network to source the cyber expertise they need to protect their organisations at no cost to themselves. It is the very definition of tech for good.”</p>

</ul>
<p>The company, which is headquartered in London and has offices in New York and Santa Monica, has featured in The Sunday Times’ Top 100 companies To Work for each of the last seven years.</p>
<p>A significant reason for this is La Fosse’s commitment to living the core value of ‘caring’ that is central to the company’s culture. This has made it an ideal partner of choice for those charities who have already partnered with the newly-formed Pro Bono practice, including Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Mike Robinson, Head of Technology, at Amnesty International said: “As a Human Rights Charity we are exposed to the same threats as any other commercial organisation – more so at times, given the work we carry out.</p>
<p>“We can’t operate with integrity without knowing we are doing everything we can to keep our donors and activists’ personal data safe and secure.</p>
<p>“La Fosse’s pro bono advisor practice has provided us with invaluable access to advice and mentorship from an industry-leader in the security space, allowing us to continue to campaign for our causes safely and effectively.”</p>
<p>Steve Wright, a Pro Bono Advisor placed by La Fosse with Amnesty International and Data Protection Officer at the Bank of England, added: “La Fosse’s creation of a platform for pro bono work in cybersecurity is an innovative solution to solve the real problems these organisations face.</p>
<p>“[It] will allow me to give back to a cause more than I ever would be able to in donations. I believe it’s important that we help not-for-profits such as Amnesty as much as we can to enable them to carry out the crucial work they do.”</p>
<p>La Fosse is in the process of expanding the practice and drive the number of diverse candidates assuming key advisory roles.

<p><strong>19<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – Trade Ledger, the world’s first open banking business lending platform has launched a new turn-key <a href=""https://tradeledger.io/platform/"" target=""_blank"">Automated Invoice Finance Platform</a> for banks and alternative finance providers looking to deliver faster and more flexible working capital solutions to their business customers. Launched to coincide with the commercial finance sector’s key event, the NACFB Expo, the solution is designed to help financial institutions adopt state-of-the-art technology without having to make major infrastructure changes or commit significant IT investment.</p>
<p>The new cloud-based platform, which can be delivered in as little as eight weeks, is the first in a range of preconfigured lending solutions delivered ‘as-a-Service’ as part of Trade Ledger’s global enterprise technology, focused on driving digital transformation for incumbent commercial banks and specialist business lenders. Trade Ledger already has agreements in place for the platform to transform the lending operations of commercial finance providers in Australia, Europe and Asia, and it expects further growth in these regions throughout 2019.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new solution, Martin McCann, CEO at Trade Ledger said: “Lenders in the invoice finance sector must start paying more attention to the advancements in the provision of cheaper, faster and more intelligent business finance solutions. New tech-driven entrants like Market Invoice, Iwoca and OakNorth are challenging the incumbents’ stranglehold on this market. As a specialist B2B technology company, Trade Ledger can provide the same capabilities ‘as-a-Service’ to lenders looking to transform their credit operations and super-charge their ability to compete.”</p>
<p>Trade Ledger provides the most modern API-based LaaS (Lending-as-a-Service) platform and the only one built specifically for the new world of Open Banking. The technology reduces origination costs by as much as 60%, increases return on customer acquisition campaigns by over 100%, and enables lenders to access new market segments that current clunky products prevent access to. Unlike many platforms aimed solely at ‘auto-decisioning’ for micro businesses, Trade Ledger specialises in what it calls ‘auto-assisted decisioning’ which augments the traditional relationship-based credit process with new digital data, advanced workflow approvals, centralised messaging, role-based task management &amp; integrated document management.</p>
<p>The platform is highly secure having attained ISO27001 cloud security compliance, and critically is the only option in the market globally that supports every type of secured and unsecured lending product. Lending products supported include commercial loans, unsecured loans, receivables finance, supply chain finance, asset finance, import/export finance, inventory finance, supply chain finance, reverse factoring and trade finance. It is fully interoperable with any other modern third-party service providers and comes pre-integrated with a range of other API enabled platforms like accounting packages (Xero, Sage, Intuit), Microsoft Dynamics365, DocuSign &amp; Equifax. <a href=""https://tradeledger.io/2019/04/02/trade-ledger-and-nimbla-partner-on-the-launch-of-first-ever-marketplace-as-a-service-for-business-finance-providers/"" target=""_blank"">Most recently, the platform has also integrated with transactional trade credit insurer, Nimbla</a>.</p>
<p>Trade Ledger uses open APIs, machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation to enhance or replace old and costly legacy systems, to provide new cutting-edge working capital solutions to business customers. The new <a href=""https://tradeledger.io/platform/"" target=""_blank"">Automated Invoice Finance Platform</a> offers end-to-end loan origination capabilities and is fully white-labelled to provide the infrastructure and automation capabilities for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lead Generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due Diligence &amp; Onboarding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit Risk Decisioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Settlement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loan Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconciliation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to EY’s most recent report – ‘The Future of SME Banking’[1], demand for UK SME credit reached £59 billion in 2018 and businesses can spend more 30 hours of work and lenders take over 90 days to onboard 1 new customer for 1 credit product. Leveraging its new platform, Trade Ledger can cut the application time down to as little as 4-minutes, removing lengthy and manual paper-based underwriting processes; bridging the gap in customer and staff digital experience; and improving the suitability of lending products and pricing.</p>
<p>Martin McCann, CEO at Trade Ledger added: “We approach the automation of traditional products like invoice finance by applying our inherent understanding of the supply-chain. The team has taken our decades of experience in the global enterprise technology sector and focused on creating the world’s most advance data-driven lending platform.”</p>

<p><strong>19<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – Landmark Group and HSBC have completed a first-of-its-kind transaction that connected two independently-built blockchain platforms, proving their interoperability and showing how collaborative technologies can further accelerate international trade in the future. It also marks a major step forward in the Middle East’s retail industry adopting blockchain.</p>
<p>The transaction involved a shipment from Bee Dee Industries in Hong Kong to Babyshop, Landmark Group’s family retail brand in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A Letter of Credit was issued by HSBC using the Voltron platform and Landmark Group’s initiated ReChainME platform enabled seamless connectivity with its logistics partners at both ends of a key trading corridor.</p>
<p>This meant that all the key participants along the logistical supply chain could view documents and track progress of the shipment in real-time, thereby reducing the overall time to complete the transaction by up to 12 days, a 40% reduction. It also helped reduce the need for paper, as retail supply chains typically involve large numbers of paper documents that are screened and updated at multiple touch-points.</p>
<p>Rajesh Garg, Group Chief Financial Officer, Landmark Group, said: “We saw the promise of blockchain technology and embarked on the journey. This is a huge milestone for us at Landmark Group. Embracing new and emerging technologies like blockchain in our physical and financial supply chain not only aids in improving speed to market efficiency but also reflects our commitment to driving transformation in the retail sector and ultimately creating value for our customers. As a leading retail organisation in the Middle East, we’re proud to have taken the lead in this area.”</p>
<p>Sunil Veetil, Regional Head of Trade at HSBC Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, said: “We have seen several advancements in digitising trade, each with their own specialist network for secure communication, resulting in disparate ‘digital islands’. The challenge lies in connecting these digital islands to create a cohesive network, and this is where blockchain comes in. Being able to connect two complementary blockchain platforms is a significant milestone in the development of this technology. It also speaks to the dynamism and interoperability of Voltron.”</p>
<p>“In a world where businesses are increasingly positioning their supply chains across several markets, blockchain platforms will undoubtedly give them a competitive advantage by increasing the velocity of trade without compromising on privacy and security,” Sunil added.</p>
<p>Voltron is a distributed ledger trade finance platform which digitises the Letter of Credit (LC) process from application through to document presentation. HSBC has previously facilitated four major LC transactions with this technology across its global network, but this is the first time Voltron has been connected to a complementary blockchain platform, and the first time Voltron has been used to issue a LC between the UAE and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>ReChainME is a permissioned blockchain platform initiated by Landmark Group. It ensures seamless connection amongst key participants involved in the transaction, resulting in greater transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>A blockchain is a system in which an immutable record of transactions is maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. Through decentralised, secure networks, blockchain technology can be the conduit that connects trade partners globally to share data in a scalable way that makes the trade process faster, safer and simpler. It is a one-step process that helps to remove pain points in trade by acting as a catalyst - making trade more attractive and accessible than ever before.</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – The Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) today issued a final report that provides an overview of three internationally recognized cyber standards and frameworks used by IOSCO members.</p>
<p>It also identifies potential gaps in the application of these standards and seeks to promote sound cyber practices across the IOSCO membership.</p>
<p>The IOSCO Cyber Task Force (CTF), chaired by J. Christopher Giancarlo, Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, prepared this report for the IOSCO Board. It is intended to serve as a resource for financial market regulators and firms, raise awareness of existing international cyber standards and frameworks and encourage the adoption of good practices to protect against cyber risk – an important threat to financial markets today.</p>
<p>Chairman Giancarlo said: “As Chairman of the IOSCO Cyber Task Force, I am pleased to announce the publication of the IOSCO Cyber Task Force’s Final Report. This international effort was led by regulators with significant input from the private sector. The report offers a path, based on existing cyber frameworks, for jurisdictions around the world who are interested in developing a new cyber security and resilience regime or improving an already existing regime.”</p>
<p>The report examines how IOSCO member jurisdictions apply three internationally recognized cyber standards which are termed the Core Standards in the report. These standards consist of the CPMI-IOSCO Guidance on cyber Resilience for Financial Market Infrastructures; the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity; and the International Organization for Standardization 27000 series standards. The report does not propose new cyber standards or guidance.</p>
<p>By highlighting the application of the Core Standards by some IOSCO members, the CTF hopes more members will review their own cyber standards against the practices of the Core Standards and, where relevant, use the Core Standards as a model to further enhance their cyber regimes.</p>
<p>Finally, the report sets out a series of questions that firms and regulators may use to promote awareness of cyber good practices or to guide them as they review their own practices.</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – The Structured Lending team at specialist lender Paragon has passed its £100 million milestone, 18 months after being launched.</p>
<p>It comes as Paragon’s latest deal supports specialist car lender Go Car Credit with £12.5 million.</p>
<p><a href=""https://gocarcredit.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Go Car Credit</a>, which launched in 2017, will use the money to support its strategy to increase new motor finance loans in the UK to the underserved and non-prime customer base and raise its presence online.</p>
<p>Every year, there are around 8.2 million used-vehicle transactions in the UK, of which 1.3 million are purchased using finance. An estimated 500,000 of these finance transactions, or 38%, are using some form of non-prime credit, according to Finance and Leasing Association and Experian data.</p>
<p>Lewis Fitzsimons, Senior Director in Structured Lending, said of the Go Car Credit deal: “We are delighted to have signed our seventh deal with UK specialist car lender Go Car Credit, which is another example of how Paragon is using its expertise to support British businesses to grow and achieve their ambitions.”</p>
<p>Mark Giles, Chief Executive of Go Car Credit, said: “Securing the new funding facility is an exciting development for Go Car Credit and reflects our commitment to implementing a sustainable customer and dealer centric model that embraces innovation in the industry.</p>
<p>“This is a testament to the hard work and determination of our team and business as a whole.”</p>
<p>Go Car Credit is the latest UK company that Paragon’s structured lending business area has supported. Committing over £110 million clients to date, this includes a fintech SME lender, a debt purchaser, property bridge financier and retail point of sale lenders.</p>
<p>Adam Daniels, Managing Director of Structured Lending, said: “Committing our first £100 million to clients is an important landmark for the team and is a testament to the quality of my Structured Lending colleagues and the broader Paragon team. The strong client relationships we have developed are also key.</p>
<p>“We have supported a variety of sectors over the past 18 months and we will be adding some new sectors in the coming months. We are on track to meet our five-year plan and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities.”</p>
<p>Structured lending provides senior secured funding to help other UK-based, non-bank finance providers grow their lending activities. This helps consumers and SMEs gain access to funding from sources other than the traditional high street banks and, in turn, gets finance into the UK’s ‘real economy’.</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.identitii.com/"" target=""_blank"">Identitii Limited</a> (Identitii, Company) (ASX:ID8), an Australian FinTech enabling the secure overlay of transaction level detail on top of financial messages using a private blockchain, advises that its customer, HSBC has announced the launch of its Digital Accounts Receivable Tool (HSBC DART) using Identitii’s innovative tokenisation technology, to its corporate clients in India.</p>
<p>HSBC DART’s tokenisation technology was developed by Identitii for the Global Liquidity and Cash Management (GLCM) business of global tier one banking group, HSBC, under phase one of the Company’s existing 2017 Global Framework Agreement. HSBC also plans to launch HSBC DART in new markets in Asia to support its corporate clients by delivering a secured digital information exchange channel and ecosystem connecting sellers and buyers. Under phase two of the project, Identitii is delivering new functionality supporting the roll out of HSBC DART into new geographies, generating additional revenue for Identitii under this phase.</p>
<p>HSBC DART uses Identitii’s innovative approach to tokenisation and integrates with HSBC’s existing receivables technology infrastructure. It uses a unique information layer to securely communicate information associated with an invoice or payment. This streamlines the client experience and automates the accounts receivable process for HSBC’s corporate clients and their network of buyers, by reducing their dependence on manual processes and in turn enhancing working capital efficiency.</p>
<p>Commenting on HSBC DART, Nicholas Soo, Head of Payment Products, Asia-Pacific, HSBC said: “HSBC has a commitment to innovation and to finding the best ways to constantly enhance the service we provide to our clients. Developing HSBC DART with Identitii has helped us solve a key pain point in receivables by digitising the client experience and creating an ecosystem where our clients and their customers connect to improve efficiency through the secure exchange of information.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the development of DART, Nick Armstrong, CEO, Identitii said: “HSBC’s DART is an industry first. It is the culmination of innovative work undertaken by both Identitii and HSBC to solve a particular challenge in how corporates and banks communicate and reconcile financial messages.”</p>
<p>“HSBC DART improves the entire accounts receivables process for corporate clients by boosting working capital efficiency and providing increased data integrity and security.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to providing updates as this product is expanded into new markets,” said Mr Armstrong.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em><strong>19<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – European CEOs and tax leaders are transforming their tax departments through technology to support broader organisational goals, according to KPMG’s latest Global Tax Department Benchmarking Survey.</em></p>
<p>Launched at this week’s 2019 KPMG EMA Region Tax Summit in London, the report on the changing roles and responsibilities of tax departments holds some interesting parallels with the findings of KPMG’s CEO Outlook, released by the firm last week. Together, the two reports show the opportunity for tax leaders to leave behind their operational roots and become a more strategic partner to the CEO.</p>
<h4 id=""barriers-to-growth"">Barriers to growth</h4>
<p>According to the KPMG CEO Survey less than 1% of CEOs in Europe identified tax risk as a barrier to growth. Mindful of this potential ‘blind spot’ among chief execs, tax leaders have a responsibility to remind them that while they may be relaxed about the impact of tax risk on their growth plans, the most commonly identified barriers to growth will all have tax implications: the return to territorialism (18% of CEOs), emerging and disruptive technologies (18%) and environmental and climate change (17%).</p>
<p>“It is vital that tax leaders are informing their CEOs about the risks relating to tax in these areas and across the business” said Jane McCormick, Global Head of Tax &amp; Legal, KPMG International. “Today’s tax leaders need to be able to speak to their CEOs about tax in a compelling way that goes well beyond providing technical expertise and compliance oversight. Organisations need their tax leaders to step up as overall strategic thinkers for the business and its reputational goals, going beyond their traditional responsibilities.”</p>
<h4 id=""transforming-the-tax-department"">Transforming the tax department</h4>
<p>CEOs are showing a healthy appetite for innovation, and KPMG’s tax research suggests that tax leaders in Europe and around the world are primed to support their plans by driving transformational change. Using technology to improve processes, exploring outsourcing and co-sourcing opportunities to gain efficiencies, and investing in new skills for their workforce are three areas of particular focus for tax departments.</p>
<p>About half of respondents expect a moderate increase in their use of co-source resources from tax providers (49 percent) and finance Shared Services Centers (52 percent). Almost as many respondents (43 percent) plan to increase their use of centers of excellence for key functions such as transfer pricing and transaction support.</p>
<p>While these kinds of operational changes are in line with the types of innovation CEOs are seeking, there may still be a disparity between what tax leaders are seeing and their CEOs’ awareness of the complexities, risks and opportunities relating to today’s tax environment and the tax function itself.</p>
<h4 id=""tax-leaders-of-the-future"">Tax leaders of the future</h4>
<p>The tax benchmarking survey also shows some emerging shifts in how tax leaders in Europe see themselves and their ability to add value within their organisations. In addition to helping their leadership teams and boards navigate the demands of today’s tax environment, the survey suggests tax leaders recognise the need to develop new skillsets within their departments in order to help deliver more value in ways that reflect their evolving roles as business leaders and the changing needs of their organisations. Alongside this call to expand the capabilities within their functions, tax departments in the region continue to operate in a challenging environment, rife with uncertainty. Adding to the challenges facing tax leaders is the rapid growth in the development of digital strategies employed by tax authorities.</p>
<p>“European tax authorities are leading the way in areas such as real-time reporting and e-invoicing,” said Chris Scott, Head of Tax for the EMA Region, KPMG in the UK. “This is going to require Heads of Tax—and their organisations more generally—to reconsider the importance of technology to tax, to tackle data challenges and to adapt and develop their tax practices and processes for today’s realities. They also have to rethink what good performance means in this new world. If you’re traditionally judged by the timeliness of your tax return, this means little in relation to where the true risk might lie when data is sent in real time. Instead, the measures will become more about factors such as data integrity, coherence and completeness.”</p>
<p>This observation seems to align with what CEOs indicated as the top performance measure for tax departments, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tax risks are managed appropriately in line with organisational values and objectives (13%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accuracy of returns and avoidance of penalties (10%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax compliance deadlines are met on schedule (12%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax function is aligned to support the corporate strategy (14%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results of tax jurisdiction audits are as expected (13%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business units are satisfied with tax services provided (12%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax function effectively manages its department’s resources (13%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax function generates cash savings for organisation (13%)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings suggest that CEOs are expecting strategic, broadly focused tax leadership, going beyond the traditional realm of compliance activities. In contrast, when tax leaders were asked to rank the same criteria above in terms of how they expect leadership would prioritise the tax department’s performance measures, the clear frontrunners were around the effective management of tax risks (54% ranked this as highly important), and the accuracy of returns and avoidance of penalties (43% ranked this as highly important).</p>
<h4 id=""using-data-driven-insights"">Using data driven insights</h4>
<p>Document management systems are currently the most commonly used type of tax software. Almost a fifth (19%) of companies that now use it plan to change or enhance their current software, while a similar number (21%) of other companies plan to acquire document management software in the next 5 years. Compliance software, off-the-shelf provision systems and workflow tools are the next most commonly used software. However, there appears to be little enthusiasm to change tools or increase usage among current users of these technologies.</p>
<p>“Many tax leaders in the region today are better equipped to deliver more data-driven insights to their organisations than they ever have been in the past, but there is still more that can be done,” said Melissa Geiger, Partner and Head of International Tax for KPMG in the UK. “They can go further by bringing their experience in evolving the tax function for real-time data collection to help other areas of the business do the same. This is one way tax professionals can take more of a leadership role in helping their organisations overcome the broader business challenges they face.”</p>
<p>In the short term, tax leaders in Europe may continue to struggle to balance compliance imperatives with broader business priorities, including enhanced data analysis, effective reputational management and better risk mitigation. However, emerging trends suggest the transformational work that tax leaders are beginning to take on today, investing in technology and improved processes, fostering new skillsets and continuing to pursue a place for tax at the leadership table, could yield meaningful opportunities in the longer term. The result will be a more efficient, more engaged tax function—creating a richer experience for the modern tax professional and eliciting further trust from the organisations and broader societies that they serve.</p>

<p><strong>19<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – The debate between the five men vying to be the UK's next Prime Minister underscores that the pound and UK assets can be expected to fall further, affirms the boss of the world’s largest independent financial advisory organisations.</p>
<p>The comments from Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, which has $12bn under advisement, comes following former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab being eliminated in the second round of voting, ahead of a live televised debate between the remaining five: Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Brexit dominated Tuesday evening’s debate.</p>
<p>Mr Green notes: “The debate between the five men vying to be the UK's next prime minister underscores that the pound can be expected to fall further.</p>
<p>“The chaos and uncertainty triggered by Brexit – which has recently intensified by the race to become the new Prime Minister – has put the pound on a considerable downward trajectory.</p>
<p>“An already battered pound has lost almost 5 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of May. Similarly, it continues six straight weeks of falls against the euro.”</p>
<p>He continues: “The debate on Tuesday night – the first one in which Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, has taken part – underscores in the most dramatic way that there is still no single realistic way forward out of the Brexit quagmire.</p>
<p>“None of them could answer how they would get their version of Brexit over the line.</p>
<p>“As it stands, the facts remain that parliament will not back the deal as agreed with the EU; it will not back a no-deal scenario; and it will not back a second referendum.</p>
<p>“As such, there is still no path through this – and it has already been going on for three years.”</p>
<p>Mr Green goes on to add: “Against this backdrop of growing uncertainty and a looming deadline, the pound and UK assets will likely have further to fall.</p>
<p>“It is hardly surprising then that UK and international investors are responding to the Brexit-fuelled uncertainties by considering removing their wealth from the UK.”</p>
<p>The deVere CEO concludes: “The lack of real answers from the candidates on the most pressing issue for a generation will inevitably impact the pound and UK assets.</p>
<p>“Nothing has already been priced-in as there is, currently, nothing to price-in.”</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – SWIFT is leading industry efforts to increase automation levels in the global FX market through better standards to help remove barriers that hinder the exchange of information and to enable straight through processing.</p>
<p>The global FX market which trades in 180 currencies and in large volumes, cannot operate without high levels of automation, but obstacles remain that prevent it operating in the most efficient manner. With millions of confirmation messages exchanged every trading day between counterparties, discrepancies can lead to thousands of potential settlement failures.</p>
<p>As the global leader in financial messaging, SWIFT is calling on the industry to collaborate further to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies and manual processes that can be eradicated through a common approach and higher levels of automation. A new report published today, “The value of standards in the FX markets”, urges the FX industry to seize the opportunities presented by greater harmonisation through standards.</p>
<p>Working with the FX industry SWIFT is determined to drive through improved standards to iron out the areas that still create unnecessary costs, delays and risk that hamper the market. To meet the evolving demands of new instruments, products and regulatory requirements SWIFT continuously adapts its messaging standards to ensure the most efficient operation of the FX market.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s 2019 Standards Release will herald new changes to facilitate the automation of the matching process that enables an FX trade to be confirmed, saving counterparties time and money repairing data.</p>
<p>Further standards evolution will be required to keep pace with the commercial, operational and regulatory changes affecting the global FX market to ensure continued efficient operation.</p>
<p>Juliette Kennel, Head of Securities and FX Markets, SWIFT, said: “While there is a high level of automation in FX markets already, the industry cannot be complacent and must work together to remove the remaining barriers to efficient exchange. Increased levels of automation through more use of and better use of standards will unlock higher operational, commercial and financial performance for all participants in the global FX market.</p>
<p>“SWIFT is adapting standards used in FX, in conjunction with industry, to lower the cost of doing business, increase returns on investment and reduce the levels of risk involved, but there is more to do. Industry must collaborate further to enhance standards by identifying the operational bottlenecks and barriers to great efficiency for all.”</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – In 2018, global trade reached a new peak of US$18.5 trillion, underpinning a trade finance revenue pool of US$48 billion. ICC Trade Register data confirms default rates from 2008-2018 are low across all products and regions surveyed. For the first time, payables finance and non-OECD Export Credit Agency-backed export finance products are included in the Trade Register.</p>
<p>The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Banking Commission has released its 2018 Trade Register report – again highlighting the low risk nature of trade finance in comparison to other asset classes.</p>
<p>This year’s report captures a full decade of trade finance-related data – containing over US$12 trillion of exposures from 24 million transactions across six products and 25 banks worldwide.</p>
<p>Results indicate that default rates from 2008-2018 are low across all products and regions, averaging 0.37% for Import Letters of Credit (L/Cs), 0.05% for Export L/Cs, 0.76% for Loans for Import/Export, and 0.47% for Performance Guarantees (when weighted by obligors). The results extend the decline in risk seen in 2016 into 2017, likely driven by strong GDP growth and the general de-risking approach taken by banks with regards to their balance sheets.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the report was conducted with the support from both Global Credit Data (GCD) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). BCG, for its part, contributed a strategic perspective to the paper, including insights from their 2019 Trade Finance Model.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ICC worked alongside GCD to advance the Trade Register’s scope and methodology. Leveraging GCD’s experience, the project now uses automatic data validation at point-of-entry – adding to the reliability of data and simplifying the data collection process for member banks.</p>
<p>This year’s data set also includes non-OECD Export Credit Agency-backed export finance and, given its growing and now longstanding significance across all markets, supply chain finance (SCF).</p>
<p>In its inaugural year, the SCF data set, while relatively small, provides initial indications that the probability of default for SCF is similar to other short-term trade finance products.</p>
<p>“This year’s report reinforces the findings of previous years’ studies: trade finance products present banks with low levels of credit risk,” says Daniel Schmand, Chair of the ICC Banking Commission. “This further supports the favourable treatment of trade finance as an asset class by the Basel Accords and increases the attractiveness of trade finance to banks, benefiting global trade and widening market access.”</p>
<p>Going forward, the ICC Trade Register will continue to build bank participation, data quality, product scope and the types of risk examined, to best serve the trade finance community, and – importantly – its member banks who invest significant time and resources to support the project.</p>
<p>Krishnan Ramadurai, Chair of the ICC Trade Register Project, adds: “The ability to act as a uniform source of data for Banks will help the Trade Register to further strengthen its fundamental role in putting advocacy messages to the Basel Committee and other regulatory bodies.”</p>

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – UniCredit has today announced a collaboration with FinDynamic, an Italian fintech company offering dynamic discounting programs, as it seeks to enhance its working capital offering for corporate clients.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, UniCredit has also taken a minority equity stake in the business – highlighting the bank’s willingness to partner with the right fintechs in order to drive innovation.</p>
<p>Corporates large and small are increasingly searching for effective, tailored working capital solutions to address their individual needs. Dynamic discounting is a solution that allows clients to offer their suppliers early payment of their invoices in exchange for a discount. The discount is directly applied to the total amount of the invoice and its value changes dynamically in relation to the number of days discounted from the original invoice’s due date. This facilitates the use of the buyer’s strong cash position while providing liquidity to their suppliers.</p>
<p>FinDynamic’s solution, leveraging on its proprietary technology, allows both the buyer and its suppliers to automatically view invoices through a web-based or mobile platform and easily select approved invoices for early payment.</p>
<p>UniCredit is one of the first banks to join the dynamic discounting platform and the solution is currently in the roll-out phase to corporate customers in Italy.</p>
<p>Francesco Giordano, UniCredit’s Co-CEO of Commercial Banking for Western Europe, said: “UniCredit is strongly committed to developing innovative and efficient solutions for its clients. As part of this, we are collaborating with selected fintechs in order to improve our corporate client offering and meet changing client needs. Today’s announcement is a clear example of this strategy in motion. We believe that the service offered by FinDynamic is the right fit for our clients’ and their suppliers’ working capital needs in the current market environment, providing a true value-add for all parties.”</p>
<p>Enrico Viganò, FinDynamic’s Founder and CEO, said: “This is a very important partnership for us. It consolidates our image and gives further authority to our Platform, which is the most innovative in the field of Supply Chain Finance, helping to guarantee the strong growth and development of FinDynamic. UniCredit’s investment in us confirms the Bank’s leadership in Italy in identifying and developing innovative services for corporate customers.”</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – Rob Mander, International Tax Leader, RSM: “The OECD’s digital tax roadmap was a welcome step in the right direction and it is encouraging that the G20 Finance Ministers have accepted their recommendations. Digital Tax proposals have already been announced or implemented in many countries, so the pressure has been on the OECD to deliver a global outcome that is better than the “go it alone” approach. There also seems to be a recognition from the OECD that the new rules need to apply to all businesses. This is a positive approach. In today’s world, digital is part of most businesses not only those whose primary offering is digital in nature.</p>
<p>“The digital tax measures introduced by countries such as the UK and France have turned up the volume. The G20 has accepted that single country solutions are not the end game that they are after, so ironically by going it alone those countries (and others) have likely accelerated the process. Both countries have stated that their digital taxes will be repealed when a OECD/G20 global solution is found.</p>
<p>“While the roadmap contains some sensible proposals, the road to implementation will not be an easy one. While 129 countries have agreed to the plan in principle, and the G20 have added their approval, it’s one thing to agree to the work plan and another to agree to the results that are produced. Strong political support is going to be needed for the challenging negotiations ahead, as the revenue requirements and economic drivers differ significantly between countries. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will likely be the most publicised sticking point, as it has been in the past, as it will disproportionately impact those countries that have relied on tax driven investment incentives. However, the alternative is “a race to the bottom”, to lower tax rates to attract investment. Economic growth is going to be critical if countries are going to meet their increasing expenditure requirements and it is encouraging to see this fact recognised in the OECD’s remarks.</p>
<p>“Whilst their timeline is ambitious, it is driven by necessity, in an effort to stop any additional countries implementing their own digital tax strategies. We have long asked for a unified approach, that offers businesses clarity and minimises reporting requirements across different markets, and look forward to seeing the end result.”</p>

<p><strong>6<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – J.P. Morgan’s focus and investment in global e-commerce payments is paying off with top rankings from The Nilson Report, the independent payments industry source:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>#1 e-commerce provider in Europe (by web transaction volume)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>#4 merchant acquirer in Europe (by overall transaction volume)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to The Nilson Report, J.P. Morgan processes almost 30% of all web transactions in Europe, ranging from multinationals headquartered in Europe and the US to local European businesses with global ambitions. E-commerce in Europe is large and growing and is expected to exceed</p>
<p>€851.03 billion in spend by 2021, according to Edgar, Dunn &amp; Company.</p>
<p>“E-commerce has created a seismic shift in the way consumers shop and pay for their purchases and this trend is evidenced by our growth from the sixth to the fourth largest merchant acquirer in Europe,” said Catherine Moore, President of Europe for J.P. Morgan Merchant Services. “As a pure-play e-commerce acquirer in Europe, we help merchants optimise their overall cost of payments and maximise business profitability.”</p>
<p>E-commerce merchants are not only benefitting from significant growth in Europe, but also dealing with complexities of compliance with the European Union’s Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) coming into force this September.</p>
<p>“The key is finding the right balance between protecting the consumer and providing a seamless payments experience that helps merchants drive down fraud levels,” Moore said. “We are PSD2-ready and collaborating closely with all industry stakeholders to help make this game-changing directive a success both for the industry and consumers.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan was also recently named the #1 merchant acquirer in the US (by purchase volume) by The Nilson Report and #1 merchant acquirer in the US by The Strawhecker Group in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – The Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT) is pleased to announce that the Diploma in Treasury Management and the Certificate in International Cash Management are now part of the National Apprenticeships Scheme; specifically, these are included on the Financial Services Professional Standard (ST0472) with immediate effect.</p>
<p>With its chartered status and internationally recognised qualifications mapped against a competency framework developed in conjunction with both practicing professionals and academics, the ACT is uniquely placed to support financial services organisations and their employees through its treasury and cash management qualifications pathway.</p>
<p>Our in-house team provides full support for every aspect of apprentices’ engagement with ACT qualifications including programme management, progress and results reports, tuition and revision workshops.</p>
<p>The ACT’s Diploma in Treasury Management and Certificate in International Cash Management (both Level 6 qualifications) are offered through a comprehensive online learning programme, fully supported by the ACT’s expert academic and support teams. As our qualifications follow a learning pathway for the Diploma in Treasury Management, students will be required to complete all the qualifications up to this level unless exemptions apply. All our qualification learning costs are covered by the levy, however membership and assessment fees are excluded. Successful students are eligible to become ACT members and use the appropriate designatory letters.</p>
<p>Financial services employers in England can use their Apprenticeship Levy to fund the training costs of their new and, in some cases, existing finance and treasury trainees.</p>
<p>ACT Chief Executive Caroline Stockmann said: “Treasury knowledge and expertise opens up a wide career path and a host of new possibilities to those who engage, whatever their sector. Careers are becoming more and more strategic, and those who want to service corporate treasurers are best-placed to do so if they speak the same language, and are fully qualified to hold a sensible treasury conversation. A third of our members work for financial institutions, many of them in relationship management. We are delighted to be part of the National Apprenticeships Scheme, and to welcome students taking the ACT qualifications via this route.”</p>

<p><em><strong>4<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – Study uncovers that 74% of businesses took action on diversity in the last 2-5 years in an effort to create a more appealing and inclusive workplace across age, gender and ethnicity.</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.isc2.org/"" target=""_blank"">(ISC)²</a> – the world’s largest nonprofit association of certified cybersecurity professionals – today released headline findings from its forthcoming study into workplace and hiring diversity in IT/ICT and cybersecurity roles. The independent blind study of employees in 1,000 organizations in the UK and 250 in the Netherlands reveals that workplace diversity in IT and security has become a key operational concern, as organizations broaden their efforts to encourage diversity and inclusivity amid the impact of the sector’s skills shortage on IT and cybersecurity recruitment and staff retention.</p>
<p>Talent acquisition and retention is the leading operational reason that companies have been ramping up their diversity initiatives, according to (32%) of respondents. Meanwhile, nearly one in three (29%) added that diversity is important to their organization because the workforce should represent the demographics in society.</p>
<p>The study, which looked at the diversity of age, gender, ethnicity and origin, revealed that nearly three quarters of organizations surveyed (74%) instituted a stated diversity value or program in the last 2-5 years. On top of this, a further 16% have followed suit in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>“Workplace diversity encompasses multiple factors including gender, ethnicity, age, origin and much more. While it is important to spotlight changes and improvements in individual areas such as gender diversity, the wider diversity make-up of the IT department, cybersecurity teams and the organization as a whole can speak volumes about the realities of inclusiveness, forward-thinking and openness to new ideas and approaches in the workplace,” said Deshini Newman, Managing Director EMEA at (ISC)².</p>
<p>“The cybersecurity challenge of combating threats with the right people and the right skills is a relentless one. It is just one reason why organizations must maximize their ability to entice and keep talented and qualified individuals from all corners of society. Bringing new ideas, experience, alternative thinking and approaches to the table, as part of a broad selection of skills, experience and backgrounds can inspire, motivate and help organizations to find innovative solutions to today’s IT and security concerns.”</p>
<h4>Diversity Being Driven by HR, Not the Board</h4>
<p>Overall, 40% of survey respondents stated that the HR department is the primary driver of diversity and inclusivity efforts, including measuring employee diversity goals. This compares to just under one quarter (23%) who said it was the senior management team and just 10% that said it was the C-suite driving diversity initiatives.</p>
<p>Amid the demand for skilled and qualified cybersecurity personnel, the study confirmed that efforts to improve the hiring prospects for these roles are helping overall efforts to recruit While diversity in hiring is prevalent across the organizations surveyed, IT and cybersecurity constitute a major part of the overall diversity hiring push.</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds (60%) of respondents said that up to 20% of the current vacancies in their organizations are IT and/or cybersecurity-based. A further quarter (26%) said these roles constituted between 21-50% of their workforce.</p>
<h4>Hiring Cyber Roles</h4>
<p>Over three quarters (77%) of respondents said that cybersecurity roles were recruited for in their organizations in the last 12 months. The number of roles filled ranged from 1 to 31 across the responses, although nearly 55% of the respondents said that up to 10 cybersecurity personnel were hired by their organization over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, 18% said that between 11 and 30 roles were hired in the last year.</p>
<p>Over a third of respondents (37%) say just 6-20% of their IT department employees are aged 18-21, while an additional third (35%) say none of their IT department employees are aged 18-21. This indicates a struggle to bring enough new talent into the department that can learn from their experienced peers. This is critical when considering that the IT department has an age diversity profile weighted towards older employees. One quarter (24%) said that up to half the IT department staff in their organization were aged 31-40, with 20% of respondents suggesting that up to 35% were aged 41-50.</p>
<p>(ISC)² will release its full IT and Cybersecurity Diversity whitepaper in July. For more research on the Cybersecurity workforce, please visit <a href=""http://www.isc2.org/research"" target=""_blank"">www.isc2.org/research</a></p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – Hong Kong is the fourth easiest place to do business in Asia according to a new independent report by TMF Group, a leading provider of international administrative services.</p>
<p>In the Global Business Complexity Index, Hong Kong was ranked considerably higher than a number of attractive markets in the region like Taiwan, Singapore, India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Mainland China and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The benchmark report, which was based on a combination of statistically weighted data and qualitative research among local market experts globally, focuses on three areas: rules, regulations and penalties; accounting and tax; and hiring, firing and paying employees.</p>
<p>For accounting and tax, Hong Kong scores well for its adherence to International Financial Reporting Standards, compared with much of Asia which continues to use a local GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) framework, which is more difficult for some international firms to apply.</p>
<p>Hong Kong also scores well for being flexible in extending tax filing deadlines, one of only 32% of jurisdictions to do so globally. Hong Kong, however, is among 30% of jurisdictions reporting that the responsibilities of company secretaries and legal officers have increased over the last three years. Moreover, the report expects such responsibilities will continue to increase in the next five years.</p>
<p>“Compliance requirements are making it more intricate to do business than before in Hong Kong, similar to other comparable jurisdictions in the region,” said Margaret Fung, TMF Group Managing Director for Hong Kong. “The relative maturity of the market, the foresight of regulatory policy makers and a substantial ecosystem of service providers underpin our position as one of the region’s and world’s most straightforward places to do business in accounting, tax and regulatory terms.”</p>
<p>Differences in tax, regulatory and HR-related complexity between Mainland China and Hong Kong mean the territory will continue to be an important commercial gateway for the country at large. For businesses entering APAC, Hong Kong offers the perceived benefits of its common-law system, while its Government works towards converging business regulations with those in the mainland, with the aim to decrease compliance complexity and costs for all.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a number of policies and schemes designed to help companies looking to expand to Mainland China. Its “China Attesting Services” validate and certify documents emanating from Hong Kong for use on the Mainland, while companies from other countries can only secure such certification through the embassies of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Highly-skilled PRC individuals find it easy to travel and work in Hong Kong via the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals.</p>
<h4>Business complexity in Mainland China</h4>
<p>By contrast, the Global Business Complexity Index ranks Mainland China as one of the region’s more complex markets. Key factors include discrepancies between PRC regions and municipalities and disparities between domestic companies and foreign enterprises.</p>
<p>However, the report suggests good reasons for optimism for Mainland China over the long term, given measures to develop and implement more consistent tax and regulatory compliance standards. It’s position on the index is a marked improvement on the 2018 compliance complexity list produced by TMF Group.</p>
<p>For Mainland businesses expanding overseas, Hong Kong remains a natural jumping-off point. Close cultural ties are complemented by dual language company registration and filing capabilities. China expertise is plentiful, with professional services firms and a workforce which understands PRC and overseas markets.</p>
<p>“China’s ongoing growth and modernisation makes Hong Kong a natural gateway for Mainland markets. This used to be very much one-way ‘inbound’ traffic but today we play an increasingly important role in helping Chinese companies expand overseas,” continued Margaret Fung. “With Hong Kong’s international expertise and close relationships with domestic business, Hong Kong has never been in a better position to help Mainland China’s businesses develop overseas.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> June 2019</strong> – A survey of treasurers and strategic stakeholders with regional and global treasuries based in Singapore revealed the reasons behind the city-state’s position as a preferred regional treasury location in Asia. The EY report Singapore: a strategic regional treasury location examines the primary and secondary factors that influence multinational corporates in their decision on where to locate their regional treasury.</p>
<p>Over the last decades, multinational corporates have been centralizing their treasury functions across various legal entities and geographical jurisdictions. This allows the organization to effectively meet the needs of business, optimize working capital, improve visibility on borrowing positions, reduce external borrowings and hedge currency and interest rate risks. The global and regional treasury centers are typically based in locations where they can meet the needs of business operations in a cost-efficient and time-critical manner.</p>
<p>According to the report, with the growing treasury demands and as global economies become increasingly influenced by the “Asian Century”, multinational corporates have become more focused on expanding their global or regional treasury footprint within Asia, with Singapore and Hong Kong being the two leading preferred locations.</p>
<p>While the Finance and Treasury Centre (FTC) tax incentive in Singapore had played a key role in attracting treasuries to set up their regional centers in the city-state, the interviewees mentioned that this is a secondary factor. In addition, a similar incentive introduced by Hong Kong in 2015-2016 had leveled the playing field.</p>
<p>Ms. Tan Bin Eng, EY Asean Business Incentives Advisory Leader, Partner, Ernst &amp; Young Solutions LLP says: “Many assume that tax incentives play a key role in motivating centralized treasury location. However, we may be overplaying the importance of tax incentives, which is insufficient to replace the need for a strong commercial and operating environment that are conducive to treasury activities. For example, the US and Europe continue to be attractive global treasury locations, even though they may not all provide attractive tax incentives.”</p>
<h4>Primary criteria: proximity to regional business headquarters and breadth and depth of financial ecosystem</h4>
<p>Being close to the regional business headquarters and having access to a well-developed, well-regulated and open financial ecosystem were key consideration and factors that drive decisions on regional treasury locations.</p>
<p>Proximity to the regional headquarters allows for better engagement with the management, particularly in running the long-term treasury plans and investment requirements more effectively. Treasurers can also better work with the business to balance intercompany lending and borrowings across different markets, achieve shorter response time on critical funding decisions, and manage central and in-country banking relationships more effectively.</p>
<p>Ms. Seah Li Yun, Partner, Financial Services, Ernst &amp; Young LLP says: “Singapore is home to the largest number of regional headquarters in Asia-Pacific, followed by Hong Kong. Generally, Hong Kong is a preferred regional business headquarter location for companies that have a heavy focus on China and North Asia, while Singapore is preferred by those looking to serve the wider Asia-Pacific region. The regional business headquarters are usually established much earlier, and the treasury operations naturally followed them.”</p>
<p>The depth and breadth of the financial ecosystem in the treasury location is also critical as regional treasuries seek to tap on solutions for funding and hedging needs, and advisory for managing investments and cross-border flows. Survey respondents highlighted that the integration and interaction with the wider finance ecosystem is important and valuable, as it promotes the conduct of more sophisticated treasury activities in hedging, risk management and foreign exchange transactions.</p>
<p>Ms. Seah adds: “The abundance of financial and professional services organizations in Singapore provides treasuries ample support in financial advice and consultancy solutions. Additionally, incentives and initiatives to drive FinTech adoption in Singapore and Hong Kong have spurred the establishment of innovation labs by financial institutions. These innovation and digitalization efforts reshape businesses and treasury functions. The financial ecosystems in these countries are more sophisticated and robust, which allow for transformation and optimization of treasury processes to better serve the evolving needs of treasury centers.”</p>
<p>The report also shared the secondary drivers that steer decisions on treasury locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal and regulatory system:</strong> a strong legal system is necessary to ease management of business contracts and relationships, given the cross-border treasury activities of multiple group legal entities and external service providers across jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Political stability:</strong> political stability allows for greater consistency and predictability of long-term economic policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax system and availability of incentives:</strong> a simple and efficient tax system as well as strong tax treaty network to mitigate the impact of double taxation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diverse workforce and talent:</strong> the availability of relevant skilled resources and quality of the workforce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Livability:</strong> the ease of relocation, lifestyle and ability for families of talents to adjust easily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ms. Seah concludes: “As multinational corporates continue to focus on innovation and FinTech initiatives, the digital ecosystem in Singapore will provide opportunities for them to transform their treasury processes and achieve optimization. With its various attributes and strengths, Singapore remains an attractive and strategic regional location for corporate treasuries in Asia-Pacific.”</p>

<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> June 2019</strong> – SWIFT announces today that it has been awarded a license to provide ESMIG connectivity services from November 2021, as a Network Service Provider for the Eurosystem’s TARGET Services.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s appointment through the Eurosystem’s public tender process evidences both trust and confidence in SWIFT’s services as well as SWIFT’s own commitment to supporting Market Infrastructures and in driving modernisation. SWIFT supports 254 domestic and pan-regional payment systems across the world.</p>
<p>Alain Raes, Chief Executive EMEA and Asia Pacific, SWIFT, said: “We are delighted to become a Network Service Provider for all TARGET Services. We take our role in this major infrastructure project very seriously and are already working with both the Eurosystem and our customers to raise market awareness about the tight timeline and to ensure a smooth and successful community migration.”</p>
<p>As one of two providers selected by the Eurosystem, SWIFT is committed to supporting its customers through their TARGET consolidation projects and the migration to ESMIG. SWIFT will provide high quality and competitively priced access to TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) for instant payments, TARGET2 (T2) for high value payments, TARGET2-Securities (T2S) for securities settlement, and the future Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS).</p>
<p>Combining SWIFT’s ESMIG connectivity offering with its existing connectivity to EBA CLEARING’s EURO1/STEP1, RT1 and STEP2 services, means banks can use SWIFT to process all of their euro payments – high-value, SEPA, instant and cross-border – in a secure, reliable and cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p>By using SWIFT to connect to all TARGET Services, users will future-proof and maximise their investment, gaining a single-window for connectivity. SWIFT will be offering customers a range of products and services designed to help them be fully prepared for the big bang migration of TARGET2 RTGS traffic to ISO 20022 in November 2021. These will include standards (ISO20022) validation services, standards translation and testing capabilities. To provide more information on its offering around the TARGET consolidation project and ISO 20022 migration, SWIFT will be reaching out to the TARGET community through a series of events and meetings.</p>
<p>SWIFT encourages the industry to look at and plan this migration in conjunction with other ISO 20022 migrations happening in the same timeframe, both in the Market Infrastructure space (EBA CLEARING’s EURO1, The Bank of England’s CHAPS, the US Federal Reserve’s Fedwire, The Clearing House (TCH) and others) as well as in the cross-border payments area, where the migration to ISO 20022 is scheduled to start in November 2021.</p>

<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> June 2019</strong> – Ground-breaking financial utility, Banking Circle, is on a mission to improve access to global financial services for businesses of all sizes. Underlining this commitment, the firm has commissioned new research to provide a fresh perspective on existing failings and opportunities. The findings of the research, undertaken by MagnaCarta Communications, will be published in a new white paper launched today at Money20/20 Europe.</p>
<p>MagnaCarta Communications carried out in-depth independent research to deliver the unique insight into what is causing financial exclusion for SMEs – and the opportunities that exist for the financial services sector to improve financial inclusion. Featuring insight from lenders, banks, payment service providers and SMEs throughout Europe, the aim is for the report to inspire the industry to come together and help close the loop.</p>
<p>Anders la Cour, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Banking Circle explained: “In our fast-changing world there are many reasons SMEs have to fight for survival. We found in a survey last year that without access to finance, a quarter of SMEs would have to make staff redundant, and four out of ten would be unable to afford the equipment they need to stay competitive. For small companies, access to flexible and fairly priced banking services still means the difference between increased sales and selling up, demonstrating the importance of financial inclusion.</p>
<p>“At Banking Circle we’re committed to making sure that access to essential financial services – from lending to bank accounts, cross border payments and transactions – is not a barrier.”</p>
<p>The report, Financial Inclusion for Europe’s SMEs: Building a Circle of Trust, reveals key findings including: One size can’t fit all; inaccessible services create self-reinforcing vicious circles; and digital innovation and regional regulation are encouraging greater collaboration between providers. The report also throws a spotlight on the unique position SMEs find themselves in, where they are not well served by corporate or retail banking offerings, perpetuating the sense that they are not valued nor valuable customers.</p>
<p>“The barriers identified by our latest research are making life more and more difficult for SMEs”, added Anders la Cour. “But there’s also light at the end of the tunnel – with industry collaboration and creativity the vicious circles can be transformed into virtuous circles of provision, availability and use. And the financial services sector is in the ideal position to play its part, working with financial utilities like Banking Circle.</p>
<p>“Together we can create a mutually supportive ecosystem in which SMEs can thrive and improve their contribution to global economies.”</p>

<p><em><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> June 2019</strong> – Seven in ten (70%) businesses that have attempted to raise capital have failed at least once, according to the new Dream Bigger: Funding ambition report from Smith &amp; Williamson, the financial and professional services firm.</em></p>
<p>Securing funding is often critical to helping businesses scale quickly and maximise their potential. However, it’s often not plain sailing. Two in five (39%) businesses seeking investment have failed to secure funding more than three times and 9% have made five or more unsuccessful attempts.</p>
<p>The reasons behind this are varied. The most common explanation given by founders is that their management team wasn’t strong enough (45%), exceeding the number of firms which said their business model wasn’t good enough (27%). Nearly three in ten (28%) founders said their business didn’t meet the criteria for investment and 22% admitted to not having a good enough handle on their finances.</p>
<p>Scale-up firms, defined as those undergoing rapid growth – tend to enjoy more success securing investment, according to the newly published data. Nearly half gained funding on their first attempt compared to 16% of non-scale-ups. Indeed, the very nature of these businesses makes them more attractive to investors and lenders but scale-ups are also more likely to have had a concise business plan in place (52% vs 29%). They are also more likely to know exactly how much money they need to raise from the outset (39% vs 24%) as well as the route they want to pursue (39% vs 23%).</p>
<p>For scale-ups that have failed to raise capital, some 55%, the barriers mirror those faced by others. Well over two fifths (43%) of scale-up founders stated the reason they were unable to secure external finance was the lack of strength in the management team, followed by their business failing to meet the criteria for investment (29%).</p>
<p>John Morris, Partner at Smith &amp; Williamson, said: “Securing investment into a business shouldn’t be a blind leap of faith. Preparation is key. To be investor-ready, businesses must ask themselves difficult questions and demonstrate they have a strong management team in place, something that is crucial for investors. Equally important is the level of ambition displayed and a degree of certainty on future plans and objectives.</p>
<p>“Even with these measures in place, securing investment is never easy. Getting high-quality and relevant advice right from the outset can significantly improve the chances of businesses securing funding. This mind-set will see the number of firms successfully raise external finance increase and, importantly, reduce the number of those experiencing funding regret.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> June 2019</strong> – A review by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) has shown that a number of law firms are not doing enough to prevent money laundering – and the ramifications look set to be felt far and wide as the regulator steps up efforts to stamp out the problem.</p>
<p>Almost half of those under scrutiny due to concerns over potential breaches could face disciplinary proceedings after alleged failures were exposed, with this being just the tip of the iceberg as more work of a similar ilk is to follow.</p>
<p>During the review process, which is the first of three of its kind, 59 firms that provide trust and company services – seen as a particular area of risk – were used as a sample and put under the spotlight, with 26 of those now having their practices further examined.</p>
<p>While it is important to note that the review did not find evidence of actual money laundering or that the organisations included had any intention of becoming involved in criminal activities, breaches of the 2017 Money Laundering Regulations, concerning a number of areas, were flagged, as well as poor training and processes.</p>
<h4>Areas of concern</h4>
<p>One of the biggest causes of concern was firms’ risk assessments and how these are carried out. An integral part of a robust and effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance programme, a risk assessment is required in legislation and should be key to tackling money laundering and ensuring the issue is given the attention it requires.</p>
<p>Despite repeated warnings over the need to comply, the SRA found that more than a third of firms reviewed did not meet the standards expected when it came to their risk assessment procedures, while, likely to cause even more concern, four had no risk assessment at all.</p>
<p>There were also found to be issues around appropriate customer due diligence, including inadequate processes in the way that many of those assessed and managed risks around Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs). In addition to this, it has also been discovered that 15 firms had turned down work following due diligence.</p>
<h4>Further SRA action</h4>
<p>The importance of compliance when it comes to fighting money laundering is something that the SRA has tried to convey throughout the last few years. The fact that sweeping hardline action is now a very real possibility, involving dozens of firms, shows just how seriously the body is taking its responsibility, and that of every firm it represents.</p>
<p>In terms of what this means for the future, the net is set to be cast wider in the coming months, with the regulator beginning a further compliance review of 400 firms, showing this is not an issue that will not go away.</p>
<p>With SRA chief executive Paul Philip warning of the need for substantial improvement and adding that “strong action” will be taken if there are considerable concerns that a firm could be enabling money laundering, the time for action is now.</p>
<h4>The encompass view</h4>
<p>Analysing the situation, and likely developments, compliance consultant and legal industry advisor to encompass Amy Bell said that the stance taken by the SRA at this early stage shows that this review – and what will come next – is not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>She commented: “It is important to remember that this is only the first piece of work, with more to come. The fact that the SRA have issued the warning notice in relation to risk assessments based on a small selection of firms shows the level of inadequacy that is evident and that this is a situation that requires urgent attention.</p>
<p>“The importance of risk assessments cannot be underestimated – they simply must be accurate from the very beginning if firms are to tackle any issues successfully. In order for this to be achieved, those designing assessments have to go back to basics, down to the granular detail and really understand how the firm operates, who the clients are, and the risks from the services they deliver.</p>
<p>“When it comes to AML, what firms have to realise going forward is that regulatory risk for non-compliance is high and meeting expected levels of AML compliance is entirely separate to the risk of committing a money laundering offence. You can fall down by not doing enough due diligence and this review itself is further evidence of regulators being prepared to take disciplinary action connected to risk as opposed to actual offending.”</p>
<p>Reiterating that firms should be viewing these first stage findings as a serious milestone and an opportunity to get things right in future, Amy said: “There will be more to digest in the months to come and this is a major warning to those in the sector to make sure they do what is needed to fall in line. A vital part of that is establishing a tight risk profile and being comfortable with turning work away if it falls outside of that, but the establishment is what really matters.</p>
<p>“This review was focused on Trust and Company Service Providers, a high risk area identified by the Government’s National Risk Assessment in October 2017. This review highlights a potential weakness is focusing too much on the instant instruction rather than the purpose of the business relationship.</p>
<p>“A main concern at the moment is that firms don’t complete thorough enough due diligence. They are too often focused on the creation of the vehicle rather than questioning why and how facts line up and this is something that must change if complicit compliance is to be achieved,” Amy explained, adding that the consequences of not heeding this review and taking what the SRA say seriously will undoubtedly be felt for a long time to come.</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> June 2019</strong> – Stan Group, the leading conglomerate devoted to drive innovative business blueprints across technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, announced that GEAR Financial is collaborating with Liquefy from The STILE Initiative, Asia’s first investment-backed residential incubation programme founded by Stan Group.</p>
<p>GEAR Financial Group, Stan Group’s strategic partner providing financial investment and asset management service, and Liquefy, an end-to-end security token issuance platform with blockchain technology, signed a MoU to jointly explore the business opportunities of real estate tokenization.</p>
<p>The project, titled “STAN by Hong Kong”, aims to build the digital real estate ecosystem 2.0 with the power of the emerging blockchain technology. Stan Group and GEAR Financial Group are to explore the collaboration with Liquefy in bringing real estate tokenization in Hong Kong. The mutual goal is to develop a real estate exchange that allows Hong Kong individuals gain access to a diverse range of tokenized properties owned by Stan Group and external parties, ushering Hong Kong in a new era of digitized real estate.</p>
<p>“The STILE Initiative is designed to support entrepreneurial development and innovation in Asia Pacific, serving as the catalyst for the flourishing of commercial ecosystem development.” Mr. Stan Tang, Chairman of Stan Group and Founder of The STILE Initiative, said, “In taking this bold first step towards the future of the real estate sector in Hong Kong, we envision far better access and greater liquidity in the real estate market due to the fractional ownership that will be attained with tokenization and our real estate exchange under development.”</p>
<p>Liquefy is a Hong Kong based, security token issuance platform based on blockchain technology, that works with issuers to tokenize a variety of asset classes, with real estate being a key focus, to realize the value of tokenization.</p>
<p>“We see our partnership with Stan Group as an incredible opportunity to drive Hong Kong as a whole towards being a smart city with security token ownership and paperless ownership systems.” Mr. Adrian Lai, CEO of Liquefy, said, “Real estate is seen as a key sector where tokenization can drive investment. We are confident that we can initiate a paradigm shift in the Hong Kong real estate sector through STAN by Hong Kong.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Banking Commission has today released a whitepaper urging the trade finance industry to work together to ensure that regulation does not hinder the availability of trade finance and remains relevant in a digital landscape.</p>
<p>The milestone report, titled Banking regulation and the campaign to mitigate the unintended consequences for trade finance, takes a close look at the regulation and compliance requirements that have come into force since the 2007 financial crisis and the industry’s subsequent efforts in promoting their fair treatment of trade finance instruments.</p>
<p>While well-meaning, these requirements have unintentionally led to the exacerbation of the US$1.5 trillion gap between the demand and supply of trade finance, which has especially impacted those most in need of financing, particularly in emerging markets.</p>
<p>“Clarification and harmonisation of regulation are fundamental to mitigating the serious threat that de-risking poses to the financial system,” says Olivier Paul, Director, Finance for Development, ICC. “ICC, for its part, is proactively working with regulatory bodies worldwide to promote the fair treatment of the industry and increase access to the market.”</p>
<p>The report examines a number of areas where successful lobbying has led to improved treatment of trade finance instruments, notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amendment of Article 55 of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), allowing banks to apply for a waiver with the Single Resolution Board if they consider there to be obvious explanations that justify not applying the rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reduction in Net Stable Funding Ratios (NSFR), allowing for more competitive rates in comparison to other jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exoneration of the leverage ratio for some export credits extended by commercial banks and covered by official export credit agencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul adds: “Despite the progress achieved to date, significant work remains to be done. With regulatory adoption and implementation processes taking up to a decade, it is essential that discussions take place from the earliest of stages if we are to effect efficient and meaningful change.”</p>
<p>The report also outlines how digitalisation could help to increase cost and time-efficiency, aiding the fulfilment of compliance and regulation requirements. Distributed ledger technology, for example, could help make transactions more secure, by giving more power to banks and regulators to trace and evaluate financing, in turn alleviating some risk.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today a Thematic Review on Implementation of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).</p>
<p>The LEI is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code that was introduced following the financial crisis to be adopted globally, to uniquely identify legally distinct entities that engage in financial transactions.</p>
<p>Since its endorsement by the G20 in 2012, the Global LEI System has been successfully brought into operation, with over 1.4 million entities uniquely identified by an LEI in more than 200 countries. Most FSB jurisdictions have implemented rules mandating LEI use in at least one area. Adoption has been most successful when the LEI has been mandated by regulators as part of an international standard-setting effort or across multiple market segments. Widespread coverage has already been achieved in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities markets. In these areas, the LEI has come the closest to meeting the G20’s objective to “encourage global adoption of the LEI to support authorities and market participants in identifying and managing financial risks”.</p>
<p>The regulatory uses of the LEI are multiple and the benefits can be substantial. The LEI standardises identification of legal entities at the global level, to support the management and analysis of large datasets. Implementation of the LEI enhances regulators’ surveillance by tracking market abuse across institutions, products and jurisdictions. The LEI can also assist regulators’ and market participants’ aggregation and more flexible retrieval of granular data on entities from multiple sources, as well as the analysis of counterparty risks, interconnectedness and complex group structures. Many in the financial industry are supportive of the LEI, citing substantial existing and potential benefits stemming from its use.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this progress, the LEI has far to go to meet the G20’s objective. Coverage is too low outside securities and derivatives markets to effectively support new industry or regulatory uses, or to reach a tipping point where voluntary take-up by market participants would suffice to propel further adoption. LEI adoption also remains uneven across jurisdictions, with coverage concentrated in Canada, the EU and the United States. More efforts should be made both at national and international levels to promote LEI adoption and enhance the benefits to authorities and market participants from its use by addressing identified obstacles. These obstacles include the current business model, which does not clearly align the current benefits and costs of LEI use for participants; a lack of LEI coverage for so-called ‘Level 2’ (relationship) data; and insufficient links with other (in particular, business registry) identifiers.</p>
<p>The report sets out four sets of recommendations to address the issues identified in the peer review and promote broader LEI adoption. The recommendations are addressed to FSB member jurisdictions, the FSB, relevant standard-setting bodies and international organisations, the LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee and the Global LEI Foundation.</p>
<p>Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank and Chair of the FSB’s Standing Committee on Standards Implementation (SCSI) that oversaw the preparation of the peer review, said “The LEI has a valuable role to play in helping with the effective assessment of risks in the global financial system. The peer review reaffirms the FSB’s commitment to a broader use of LEIs globally in order to meet the G20’s objective.”</p>
<p>Amir Zaidi, Director of the Division of Market Oversight at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Chair of the peer review team, said “Implementation of the peer review recommendations will provide a firm basis to expand LEI adoption and realise fully the benefits from its use for both authorities and market participants.”</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – UOB and Mastercard today announced the launch of the UOB Regal Business Metal Card, Asia Pacific’s first World Elite Mastercard Business metal card designed for smalland medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p>In creating the card, Mastercard and UOB conducted face-to-face interviews and surveys with senior executives in SMEs to have a deeper understanding of how commercial cards can enable them to do more with their business spend.</p>
<p>The research1 found that travel and entertainment top the list of business spend for close to 70 per cent of the respondents. Three in four SME senior executives surveyed said that they travel up to twice every quarter, spending an average of $4,800 a month on business-related travel. Respondents also said they spent an average of $2,300 a month on business entertainment, such as golf sessions and meals with clients.</p>
<p>Given these insights, the UOB Regal Business Metal Card was designed to offer a comprehensive suite of travel privileges typically not available with commercial credit cards. For example, the card offers business executives unlimited access to airport lounges so that they can work in comfort or rest and refresh while on the go. To help reduce their business entertainment expenses, the UOB Regal Business Metal Card also offers complimentary access to 60 golf clubs around the world2.</p>
<p>Ms Jacquelyn Tan, Head of Personal Financial Services Singapore, UOB, said, “The number of SMEs using UOB commercial credit cards has increased by more than 65 per cent over the last five years. Of these, most use their commercial credit cards in the region for travel and business entertainment. To support these SMEs, we have designed the UOB Regal Business Metal Card, with its comprehensive suite of benefits and privileges to help them enjoy greater value and cost-savings in the areas they spend the most.”</p>
<p>Ms Deborah Heng, Country Manager, Singapore, Mastercard, said, “Mastercard’s insights offer a deep understanding of the key expectations of different consumer segments. With SMEs making up the majority of registered businesses in Singapore, Mastercard is committed to supporting them with tailored solutions that benefit both the business owners and their businesses. The UOB Regal Business Metal Card provides SMEs access to a range of attractive and complimentary offerings at their fingertips, from personalised services to curated experiences.”</p>
<p>Key features of the UOB Regal Business Metal Card Upon signing up for the card, cardmembers will receive a one-year ‘Accor Plus’ Membership, Accor Hotels’ Asia-Pacific loyalty programme at more than 800 hotels and 1100 restaurants. Cardmembers will enjoy dining discounts of up to 50 per cent and can access an exclusive ‘Stay 4, Pay 3’ accommodation privilege at any of the participating hotels. The UOB Regal Business Metal Card also includes complimentary membership with other prestigious loyalty programmes such as Voyager by Langham Group and Discovery Black by Global Hotel Alliance.</p>
<p>SME senior executives who host clients and partners at business lunches will enjoy up to 50 per cent off on weekday lunches at the Grand Hyatt Singapore as well as complimentary champagne with Mastercard Epicurean Experiences at renowned restaurants, including Fukudaya in Japan and Balthazar in Australia. Furthermore, the rebates earned on dining spend locally and overseas will help them derive greater value from their entertainment budget, enabling them to enjoy more cash savings as they spend. Senior executives will also receive 12 complimentary drive-home valet services, a market-first privilege tied to a commercial credit card in Singapore.</p>
<p>This is the third collaboration between UOB and Mastercard in Singapore this year. The two partners recently worked together to launch the KrisFlyer UOB co-branded credit card and the newly-revamped UOB Lady’s Card.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Banking Commission has today released a whitepaper urging the trade finance industry to work together to ensure that regulation does not hinder the availability of trade finance and remains relevant in a digital landscape.</p>
<p>The milestone report, titled Banking regulation and the campaign to mitigate the unintended consequences for trade finance, takes a close look at the regulation and compliance requirements that have come into force since the 2007 financial crisis and the industry’s subsequent efforts in promoting their fair treatment of trade finance instruments.</p>
<p>While well-meaning, these requirements have unintentionally led to the exacerbation of the US$1.5 trillion gap between the demand and supply of trade finance, which has especially impacted those most in need of financing, particularly in emerging markets.</p>
<p>“Clarification and harmonisation of regulation are fundamental to mitigating the serious threat that de-risking poses to the financial system,” says Olivier Paul, Director, Finance for Development, ICC. “ICC, for its part, is proactively working with regulatory bodies worldwide to promote the fair treatment of the industry and increase access to the market.”</p>
<p>The report examines a number of areas where successful lobbying has led to improved treatment of trade finance instruments, notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amendment of Article 55 of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), allowing banks to apply for a waiver with the Single Resolution Board if they consider there to be obvious explanations that justify not applying the rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reduction in Net Stable Funding Ratios (NSFR), allowing for more competitive rates in comparison to other jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exoneration of the leverage ratio for some export credits extended by commercial banks and covered by official export credit agencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul adds: “Despite the progress achieved to date, significant work remains to be done. With regulatory adoption and implementation processes taking up to a decade, it is essential that discussions take place from the earliest of stages if we are to effect efficient and meaningful change.”</p>
<p>The report also outlines how digitalisation could help to increase cost and time-efficiency, aiding the fulfilment of compliance and regulation requirements. Distributed ledger technology, for example, could help make transactions more secure, by giving more power to banks and regulators to trace and evaluate financing, in turn alleviating some risk.</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – Leading technology firm Altron Bytes Managed Solutions (Altron Bytes MS) and payments specialist Renovite Technologies have announced a new strategic partnership which will revolutionise the ATM channel. The agreement will see the two businesses help financial institutions bring innovative new services to market, echoing the level of modernisation seen elsewhere across global financial services.</p>
<p>Altron Bytes MS and Renovite will help financial organisations, whose ATM infrastructure has been trapped in 20th-century legacy architecture and outdated operating models for over 30-years, transform their offering using an effective, flexible cloud-native ATM technology in the form of the Reno-ATM.</p>
<p>Reno-ATM empowers deployers to deliver the next generation of consumer service innovation, breaking the shackles frustrating modernisation and the delivery of new 21st-century ATM services. It facilitates the introduction of new capabilities and enables financial institutions to satisfy modern consumer demands and deliver an enriched customer experience.</p>
<p>“In a world of ever-emerging digital technologies and business models, the only way to win at the game of digital disruption is to challenge the rules; to be deliberate and confident in your actions; to embrace the now and the new; to focus on your offerings and use them to help create a future that your customers can benefit from – because then you will benefit too” said Chad Baker, managing director at Altron Bytes MS.</p>
<h4>Breathing new life into the ATM channel</h4>
<p>In contrast to the financial services currently offered by ATMs, consumer expectations have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. Today’s existing ATM channel is bogged down by the maintenance of legacy systems predicated on 20th-century architecture, which was only fit for purpose when they were laid down in a pre-internet, pre-mobile, pre-online banking era.</p>
<p>Altron Bytes MS and Renovite Technologies will leverage the latest cloud-native architecture to transform consumers’ experience and ATMs’ services. The partnership will give consumers a seamless banking experience, delivering new account and payment services alongside the cash-centric services available today.</p>
<p>Chad Baker said: “Innovation is key to ensure the sustainability of our business. Partnerships of this nature help keep our business at the forefront of technology and remain competitive in the ATM space by enhancing the customer’s banking experience.”</p>
<p>Jim Tomaney, chief operating officer at Renovite Technologies said: “The cost, inflexibility and woes of vendor lock-in since the 1980s and 1990s have stifled innovation in ATMs, reducing its relevance as a financial services channel in today’s fast-paced and competitive environment. Until now, the ATM channel has been a predominantly card-centric, cash access device which has become isolated from digital banking strategies. Our partnership with Altron Bytes MS is going to change that.”</p>
<h4>Enabling transformation</h4>
<p>Renovite’s Reno-ATM integrates into existing infrastructures with ease and allows financial organisations to implement new feature-rich transactions and quickly change existing transactions without modifying any code. Businesses will benefit from being able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extend the lifecycle of existing self-service devices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control the migration of legacy ATMs to help eliminate any business disruption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have an unrestricted choice in self-service hardware;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create unique, innovative and tailored services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimise branch services using advanced assisted self-service and extended hours;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver intelligently personalised customer value and features;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the latest interoperability standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easily manage compliance, security and legislative changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – BuildERS is a newly funded H2020 project aiming to strengthen societal resilience, including the most vulnerable groups, against natural and man-made hazards. Technology, trust networks, institutional and community capabilities are in the focus of the research. “By helping the weak we are all stronger.”</p>
<h4>Call for resilience</h4>
<p>Globally, the amount and the frequency of geophysical and climate disasters are raising rapidly and posing challenges on communities and individuals. Beyond these, other factors such as population growth, urbanization processes, inadequate land use, lack of prevention measures and inappropriate governance systems for post-disaster emergency, and new types of threats such as terrorism and cyber security, seriously increase the risk of human exposure to hazards. According to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED)’s 20-year disasters’ review (1994-2013), such occurrences affected 218 million individuals and killed 68,000 people every year in average[1].</p>
<p>Supporting local communities to prevent, withstand and heal from any disaster is fundamental in minimizing potential crises and losses. Indeed, the resilience of societies heavily depends on how their citizens behave individually and collectively, and how governments and civil society organisations design and implement policies for mitigating risks, preparing for, reacting to, overcoming, and learning from disasters.</p>
<p>The pursuit of resilience shall not just seek technical and administrative solutions, but it should begin by empowering local communities and the people. Understanding new risks and vulnerability, preventing and reducing the likelihood of hazards, prioritizing capacity buildings and awareness raising are the cornerstones of societal resilience. Above all, there is urgency to focus more on the most vulnerable segments of the society such as the elderly, the impaired or the poorest.</p>
<p>“We’ve discovered that European resilience research has been focusing mainly on critical infrastructures. While this is important, of course, we must also think about the people – as individuals and as local communities. Their resilience is depending on for example their resources, skills and social networks, which partly build their social capital and support in crisis situations” states Principal Scientist Pekka Leviäkangas, who coordinates the project. “Also the trust between individuals and the authorities is crucial – if we don’t trust each other and the institutions, it is hard to build resilience and untrusting communities are in fact vulnerable to crises.”</p>
<h4>Conceive an innovative framework for European resilience</h4>
<p>To respond to this need, the European Union has recently funded a new Horizon 2020 research and innovation project entitled “Building European Communities’ Resilience and Social Capital (BuildERS)”. Coordinated by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, a consortium of 17 institutions from Europe, United States and Indonesia will implement BuildERS with the ambition to improve the overall resilience of people, communities and the entire society to natural and man-made disasters starting from the most vulnerable groups. A network of organisations is involved in a co-creation and co-innovation process facilitated by the researchers. These organisations include e.g. cities, civil society groups, rescue and crisis management organisations, safety professionals, and administrations at different levels of the society.</p>
<h4>Emphasize co-creation and inclusivity</h4>
<p>BuildERS project will look into institutional, community and individual resilience, and through strong engagement of citizens, first-responder organisations and tool developers, it will co-design new ways to increase resilience against known and unknown hazards. The project will incorporate an inclusive and interactive research and analysis process, where the results will not be derived ‘top-down’, but through a ‘bottom-up’ dynamic interaction.</p>
<p>“The most vulnerable groups in Europe need support to enhance their resilience. The homeless, the addicted, refugees an some ethnic minorities have little, if any resources, and we must find ways and tools how to include them better to the society and local community while respecting their individual sovereignty” underlines Major Mike Stannett from the International Salvation Army. “We work together with some of the most vulnerable people every day, who when faced with a crisis on top of their daily struggle find themselves excluded from normal recovery processes. These people have so little to start with and even less hope to recover after a disaster. It is a basic human right to live a life of dignity”</p>
<h4>Harness resilience tools and technologies – devise policies – build trust</h4>
<p>BuildERS will also develop and identify tools and processes through which local communities can improve trustworthy information sharing between citizens and authorities. New information technology and social media play an important role, and the project team will probe, evaluate and demonstrate technologies that have the potential to serve resilience building. BuildERS will also address policies that enhance communities’ resilience and build up social capital.</p>
<p>“VTT has a long-standing experience on technological development and innovation. Now, together with our partners, we try to make best use of different technologies, also social media, so that resilience and trust are enhanced. This is a natural role for us and we are excited about this project. The European Commission is putting a lot of trust on the BuildERS consortium and we highly appreciate it.” says Leviäkangas.</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – TMF Group, a leading provider of high value business services to clients operating and investing globally, has launched a paper today based on interviews and contributions from senior executives of TMF Group and Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB). This paper – China Outbound Investment: Accessing the ASEAN opportunity through Singapore, highlights the importance of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for Chinese companies and outlines how to tap into its vast potential via Singapore.</p>
<p>For Chinese companies seeking to build their presence in ASEAN and develop regional expansion strategies, Singapore will play a pivotal role as a regional gateway and base from which to transact and trade with trust and confidence, particularly in high value-added sectors such as advanced manufacturing, technology and healthcare/pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Goh Pei Sheng, Regional Vice President in EDB, said, “Singapore’s pro-business policies, connectivity within Southeast Asia, combined with a highly skilled workforce and cutting-edge infrastructure, give it a strong competitive advantage. Being one of Asia’s financial hubs, it is easy to access credit while start-up costs and taxes are low. According to World Bank rankings in 2018, Singapore is the second easiest place to do business.”</p>
<p>Thun Lee, Head of China in TMF Group, said, “A regional strategy is essential for long-term success in the region, given the varying levels of development and infrastructure, and vastly disparate and complex regulatory regimes among ASEAN member nations. Therefore, support from a local partner with in-depth knowledge of and an on-the-ground presence across the region is critical to navigate sensitive cultural issues and rapidly evolving business environments.”</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – New York Digital USD DUSD exclusively named FINWISE Summit, which opened in Hong Kong on May 28. Johnson Zhao, founder of DUSD, delivered an important speech revealing that the “The Infernal Battlefield” of the block chain is on Wall Street. The next ten years will be the golden decade for the stablecoin.</p>
<p>New York Digital USD DUSD exclusively named the 2019 FINWISE Summit, which opened on May 28 at Hong Kong Intercontinental Hotel.The theme of this Summit is “Global Science and Technology Finance Summit Forum”, which focuses on exploring the way of integration of Finance and science and technology.</p>
<p>DUSD endeavors to create a new Digital USD stablecoin ecosystem, following the 2009 Global Block Chain (Hangzhou) Summit as an exclusive strategic cooperation unit, and it has enjoyed the exclusively naming of the FINWISE Summit in Hong Kong in 2019.</p>
<h5>DUSD Total Name FINWISE Summit Opened &amp; Opening Speech of FINWISE Summit by DUSD Founder Johnson Zhao &amp; Johnson Zhao, founder of DUSD, told about the “Odyssey Tour” of the block chain</h5>
<p><strong>Johnson Zhao, founder of DUSD, delivered his opening speech on the block chain’s Infernal Battlefield:</strong></p>
<p>After the opening of the 28 th Summit, Johnson Zhao, founder of Digital USD (DUSD), took the lead in delivering the FINWISE Named Business Speech Infernal Battlefield of Block Chain – From Bitcoin to Facebook Coin”. The keynote of the speech was: The “Infernal Battlefield” of the block chain is on Wall Street. The next ten years will be the golden decade for the stablecoin.</p>
<p>Johnson Zhao, currently resident on Wall Street, has started his own block chain journey as early as 2014. The investment field focuses on block chain technology, artificial intelligence and biotechnology. He is passinate on stablecoin as the core fuel and infrastructure of block chain 2.0. Mr. Johnson Zhao also launched the first non-profit Global Block Chain Media Alliance and Global Block Chain Award in 2018.</p>
<h4>“Odyssey Tour” of Block Chain</h4>
<p>Johnson Zhao talked about the past and the present in his speech, which not only depicted the long journey of mankind towards the block chain, but also expressed his firm confidence in the reconstruction of the world by the block chain. He quoted Mark Anderson, a venture capitalist, as saying: “Twenty years from now, we will be talking about block chains as we are talking about today’s Internet.” Block chains are trust machines, consensus and win-win. If AI is a productivity revolution, then the block chain is likely to be a production relationship revolution. The birth of the block chain has undergone a long “odyssey journey”: From the ancient times to the agricultural times, to the industrial times and to the digital times, the cornerstone of trust has shifted from blood, religion, institution and machine. The block chain is destined to reshape the trust model of mankind.</p>
<p>In his speech, Johnson Zhao comprehensively interpreted the innovative value dimension of block chain:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clear value record (behavioral data, data capitalization);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More efficient value interconnection (asset monetization, cross-temporal circulation);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More equitable value allocation (monetary capitalism-total factor capitalism);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More credible performance mechanism (intelligent contract, machine trust);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More flexible organizational collaboration (distributed collaboration, community collaboration).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He believed that the block chain was another major subversion of the business logic and organizational model since the Dutch invented company system 400 years ago and the steam engine of industrial revolution in 1784. It was a new cooperative win-win model of decentralization.Block chains, as the updating of the bottom layer protocols of the Internet, can solve the problem of inequity in the highly efficient Internet, and may eventually create the largest digital migration in human history with the help of a network effect 100 times greater than that of the Internet. Block chains are engulfing and reshaping the whole world in the tens of millions of dollars market.</p>
<h4>Wall Street is the “Inferno Battlefield” of block chains</h4>
<p>Artificial intelligence “Inferno Battlefield” in Silicon Valley;The Gene Editor’s “Inferno Battlefield” was in Boston.Block Chain’s “Inferno Battlefield” was on Wall Street. Based on this judgment, Johnson Zhao focused his investment on ABC (AI, Blockchain, CRISPR) three frontier areas of science and technology.</p>
<p>As Don Tapscott, the father of the digital economy, said: The black technology that will have the greatest impact on human beings in the next ten years is not robots, big data or even artificial intelligence, but block chains. The process of rebuilding society through block chains means significant strategic investment opportunities. The Bay Area and Silicon Valley are the headquarters of high-tech venture capital, but Johnson Zhao recognized the “Inferno Battlefield” of the Wall Street block chain. He firmly believed that block chains, as trust machines in the digital age, will reshape the value foundation with perfect mathematical solutions and technical means. The financial wave set off by block chain on Wall Street will surely spread to the world and reshape the global digital financial value system. As the heart of global finance, Wall Street will bear the brunt.</p>
<h4>Stablecoin Occupies Digital Finance Track in the Next Decade</h4>
<p>In his speech, Johnson Zhao originally put forward five tracks of digital finance: Wallets, exchanges, stablecoins, Digital Banking and payment were perfect for real-world dollars, NYSE, credit cards, banks and VISA/SWIFT. Other tracks include insurance, funds, securities and other financial products.Johnson Zhao, based on his deep insight into the financial technology industry, judged that the stablecoins were the first among the five major tracks.</p>
<p>In recent years, Johnson Zhao has traveled through the United States, Japan and Europe, witnessing the rapid development of the blockchain industry since 2008.Since the second half of 2018, JP Morgan Chase has launched JP Mcoin, technology giants Facebook, IBM and Google were also laying out in the block chain industry. Japan’s four big banks are also contrary to the norm, announcing the joint issuance of J-coin. In the war between financial and technological giants, the trend of stablecoin in the block chain battlefield has become increasingly clear.</p>
<p>The giant’s new entry into the layout block chain is all in the stablecoin. From Bitcoin to Facebook Coin, the boom in stablecoin heralds the future of block chains as stable value media.Wall Street calls for stablecoins. Financial markets need stablecoins. Stablecoins were becoming an indispensable infrastructure for the blockchains. The new eco-stablecoin represented by Facebook Coin was the real era of block chain 2.0, which represented the industry technology and market trend of block chain in the next 10 years.</p>
<h4>The fourth generation stablecoin DUSD has five advantages and six Ecologies</h4>
<p>Following Johnson Zhao strategic vision in the area chain industry, hundreds of industry media, investment institutions and project leaders shared and witnessed DUSD’s five unique advantages and six ecologies as the exclusive naming merchant strength of the Summit, both inside and outside the Summit venue, online and offline.</p>
<p>Tether of Bitfinex was the first-generation stablecoin, GUSD of Gemini and PAX of Paco were the second-generation compliance stablecoin, Facebook Coin will be the third-generation single ecological stablecoin, and the fourth-generation stablecoin represented by DUSD with Turing complete stablecoin system will support the future of cross-ecological application of stablecoin. DUSD is the fourth generation stablecoin with original consensus mechanism and exclusive algorithm. It was officially launched on Wall Street in November 2018.</p>
<p>DUSD is a master of turnip removal compared with three kinds of stable currencies: physical mortgage, virtual currency mortgage and algorithmic currency. Johnson Zhao, the founder of DUSD, interpreted the five unique advantages of DUSD on the spot.(1) (1:1) anchoring US dollars at high altitude;(2) Compliant operation;(3) Third-party trusteeship;(4) full monthly public audit;(5) Intelligent contracts are fully mortgaged.The DUSD ecological scenes cover six major industries:Acceptance ecology, wallet ecology, community ecology, payment ecology, trade ecology and exchange ecology.DUSD has made innovations in both the regulatory governance framework and price stabilization algorithm, trying to solve the problems of trust, efficiency and stability that have troubled stable currencies.In the future, DUSD will also land on EOS, wave field, everiToken and other mainstream public chain platforms.</p>
<p>The world’s top 500 companies have their own stable monetary payment ecology. Block chain industries also need a set of ecologically stable currencies, such as DUSD, to stabilize value, expand influence in many fields, and to serve and support the blockchain world’s leading enterprises.</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – The number of correspondent banking relationships has shrunk by 20% over the past seven years, according to analysis of new data, published today by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), the global standard setter for payment, clearing and settlement services.</p>
<p>The new data, which track the size and scope of the network of relationships, show a broad-based and global reduction in their number as their geographical focus narrows.</p>
<p>Correspondent bank networks underpin cross-border payments – vital for global trade and for migrants who send remittances home. Yet these payments are slower, more expensive and more opaque than domestic payments.</p>
<p>“Many families and small businesses rely on remittances to make ends meet but often face a choice between tolerating high costs or risking uncertain delivery of payments. The shrinking correspondent banking network is adding to these concerns. It may push people to use ‘shadow’ payment services such as cryptocurrencies that put the most disadvantaged at risk,” said Benoît Cœuré, Chair of the CPMI, on the sidelines of the High-level Meeting on Financial Inclusion hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<p>“Collectively, our efforts can enhance financial inclusion by making payments more efficient and by lowering their costs,” he added.</p>
<p>To improve access to payments, it is necessary to understand their associated trends and drivers. This requires detailed analysis, which the CPMI is undertaking. The current analysis builds on the 2016 CPMI report on correspondent banking, and is based on payment message data from over 200 jurisdictions provided by SWIFT.</p>
<p>The CPMI and SWIFT plan to update the analysis annually for the next five years.</p>

<p><em><strong>21<sup>st</sup> May 2019</strong> – One of the world’s leading and largest banking and financial services firms to use “smart sourcing” to save costs, improve results, increase collaboration, and accelerate decision-making.</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.globality.com/en-us/"" target=""_blank"">Globality</a>, Inc. announced today that it has entered into an agreement with HSBC, one of the world’s leading banking and financial services companies, in which HSBC is adopting Globality’s innovative AI-based platform for sourcing and procurement of services.</p>
<p>HSBC is at the forefront of revolutionising sourcing by enabling its business stakeholders to do self-serve procurement utilising Globality’s artificial intelligence, real-time collaboration and intuitive user experience. With Globality’s AI-based platform, HSBC users will be able to scope projects in hours rather than days, and intelligently match their unique requirements to the best suppliers around the world.</p>
<p>Finding the best service provider at the right price for every project is impossible to achieve with legacy systems that are mostly analogue and are not continuously learning, capturing knowledge, or digitally sharing results and feedback. As a result, companies do not get maximum value from third-party suppliers. Nor do they get the unprecedented access to a worldwide network of highly qualified, carefully vetted firms that are members of Globality’s Service Provider Network.</p>
<p>“We are very grateful for the opportunity to work with HSBC’s procurement team to advance their vision of a fully automated procurement process that enables their internal stakeholders to source higher quality, lower cost services. HSBC is a leader in creating a vision for the future of procurement, understanding that the legacy systems of paper-intensive RFPs, and sole source negotiations that do not result in strategic value. Utilising AI technology and Globality’s “smart sourcing” process will ensure that all HSBC service providers, large or small, win projects in a transparent digital platform where decisions are based solely on the merits of quality, results, costs and performance,” said Globality Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO, Joel Hyatt.</p>
<p>Globality’s marketplace provides companies with a highly secure digital way to fully scope projects, engage qualified suppliers, assure pricing and quality competition, effectively evaluate proposals, and make informed sourcing decisions. In addition, using Globality’s Platform significantly accelerates the entire procurement process, enabling far faster speed-to- market.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> May 2019</strong> – SWIFT today announces that a group of banks are to trial instant gpi cross-border payments in Europe using the TARGET Instant Payments Settlement (TIPS) platform.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) and SWIFT have launched this initiative to extend the reach of instant cross-border payments deeper into the European market by enabling gpi in the TIPS system. Banks will carry the cross-border legs of the payments, which they will then settle through TIPS, allowing for instant crediting of accounts at ultimate beneficiary banks across Europe.</p>
<p>The ability to process gpi cross-border payments instantly, even when the final legs of the payments have to be cleared on arrival within the destination country, is key to ensuring ubiquitous availability of real-time cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2017, SWIFT gpi has dramatically transformed cross-border payments, ensuring that, on average, 40% of SWIFT gpi payments are credited to end beneficiaries within five minutes.</p>
<p>However, when the final legs need to be cleared within the recipient country, payments are sometimes delayed owing to the limited operating hours of local clearing systems. With the advent of real-time, 24/7 payment systems and longer ‘credit windows’ enabled by the continuous availability of central bank money settlement, such as that offered by TIPS, these frictions can be removed, ensuring that payments can be credited in seconds.</p>
<p>Mehdi Manaa, Deputy Director General – Market Infrastructures and Payments at the European Central Bank, said: “The support of the ECB to this initiative is in line with our strategic objective of ensuring that our TARGET Services keep pace with the evolving needs and requests of banks in the payment landscape. By facilitating gpi, TIPS proves its flexibility to cater for additional use cases. This shows how the 24/7 availability of central bank money provided by TIPS can open new possibilities for the market.”</p>
<p>A similar arrangement was successfully trialed by SWIFT in 2018 with Australia’s domestic instant payment system, the New Payments Platform (NPP), and a group of banks from Australia, China, Singapore and Thailand. The trial successfully demonstrated that by enabling gpi in real-time domestic systems, cross-border payments can be effected almost instantly, even when they involve domestic settlement and non-gpi banks.</p>
<p>SWIFT is now working with its community to extend the scope of this initiative to other real-time systems around the world.</p>
<p>Alain Raes, Chief Executive EMEA and Asia Pacific at SWIFT, said: “This trial is another critical step in extending the reach and utility of our cross-border instant payments service. By linking SWIFT gpi and TIPS, our customers will be able to leverage their existing investments to deliver a superior service to their clients. The support we have from major European banks demonstrates their commitment to partnering with SWIFT to deliver a fast, secure and seamless cross-border real-time payment service that scales globally. We look forward to sharing the results of the pilot at Sibos in London in September.”</p>
<p>The institutions participating in the European pilot include Banque Internationale à Luxembourg, BBVA, Deutsche Bank, Natixis, Santander, Sberbank and UniCredit.</p>

<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – Today ahead of its <a href=""http://www.fusionone.cloud/"" target=""_blank"">FusionONE</a> developer conference, co-hosted with Microsoft, <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> unveiled the latest developments to its <a href=""http://www.fusionfabric.cloud/"" target=""_blank"">FusionFabric.cloud</a> open platform for innovation. As half of financial institutions in the UK and US look to implement cloud collaboration<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>, adoption of Finastra’s open platform is gathering pace, with over 300 Fintechs now registered.</p>
<p>Further to its <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/news-events/press-releases/finastra-and-microsoft-form-strategic-alliance-shape-future-financial"" target=""_blank"">strategic alliance</a> with Microsoft, which sees Microsoft Azure underpin FusionFabric.cloud, Finastra has now built select solutions on top of Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft PowerApps and Microsoft Dynamics 365, via the platform. The move is part of the company’s shared vision to drive innovation through collaboration.</p>
<p>Separately, nbkc bank is collaborating with Finastra to build a conversational banking app on FusionFabric.cloud. This is all made possible by APIs, of which Finastra revealed 61 new additions to its developer catalog.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing today is an unprecedented shift in the way financial services businesses from across the globe collaborate, innovate and compete, with half of UK and US financial institutions looking to collaborate in the cloud,” said Simon Paris, CEO at Finastra. “FusionFabric.cloud brings together banks, Fintechs and SMEs onto a single open platform, allowing advanced technologies such as facial recognition, AI, machine learning and voice interaction apps to be created, deployed and monetized in the same ecosystem. The updates we are unveiling here are very much part of our goal to encourage collaboration in the financial services ecosystem and unlock limitless potential for innovation.”</p>
<p>The 61 new open APIs (and more than 200 Endpoints) span many of Finastra’s solutions, including retail and corporate banking (both enterprise and North American community markets), consumer lending and mortgage, payments and treasury and capital markets. These are now available in the FusionFabric.cloud <a href=""https://developer.fusionfabric.cloud/browse?workspace=FusionCreator%20Developer%20Portal&amp;board=API%20Catalog"" target=""_blank"">API catalog</a> for developers to harness in building financial services applications. Some of these powerful APIs are already enabling:</p>
<h4>Finastra software built on Microsoft technology</h4>
<p>Finastra has built its Fusion Mortgagebot solution on top of Power BI and PowerApps, via FusionFabric.cloud. Using innovative artificial intelligence and data visualizations, this functionality adds powerful analytics and dashboards to help users uncover trends and spot new business opportunities.</p>
<p>Moreover, the companies are doing the same with Finastra’s Fusion CreditQuest loan origination tool, now built on Dynamics 365. The module, LenderInsights, will empower banks and credit unions with a comprehensive end-to-end lending solution, connecting front office relationship managers with their back-office underwriting team, through Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p>Richard Peers, Senior Director WW FSI Industry Strategy team, Microsoft Corp. said, “Our strategic alliance with Finastra continues to go from strength to strength and our work together is proof that collaborating within the financial services ecosystem is not only fruitful, but signals the next wave of the future of open finance whilst empowering people.”</p>
<h4>nbkc bank (nbkc) co-innovation</h4>
<p>nbkc shares its vision of encouraging Fintech collaboration with Finastra. In that spirit, the bank (which uses the Phoenix core banking solution) and Finastra are working together to build a conversational banking app on FusionFabric.cloud.</p>
<p>Eric Garretson, CFO and Fintech Strategy Leader at nbkc said, “Voice services pose an untapped opportunity for the financial services industry. Consumer adoption of voice devices is growing rapidly due to the inherent on-demand access and convenience they provide. That’s not to say other channels will fade away, but more chatbot functionality and ability to bank via Siri, Cortana and Alexa will be increasingly important. For a community bank like us at nbkc, we want to be at the forefront of new and changing communication channels and ensure we can meet customers wherever they are; together with Finastra we’re building the foundation with the FusionFabric.cloud platform to do so. And, now that we’re connected to these APIs, we can innovate in other areas as well.”</p>
<h4>Open Banking at scale</h4>
<p>Open Banking and PSD2 encourages European banks to open their systems and share data and APIs with third party providers (TPPs). This marks a whole new market for banks, BigTechs and Fintechs to consume other banks’ APIs and provide cheaper and faster service to the users. To support this move, Finastra is building Fusion Open Access with TPP APIs to help ease access for banks. This will enable them to consume APIs from other banks in Europe via one integration point, rather than multiple points across banks.</p>
<p>Richard Lumb, Group Chief Executive – Financial Services at Accenture – an <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/news-events/press-releases/finastras-fusionfabriccloud-platform-changes-way-software-developed"" target=""_blank"">early adopter</a> of the <a href=""http://fusionfabric.cloud/"" target=""_blank"">FusionFabric.cloud</a> platform said, “The era of Open Banking is in full swing now, creating threats and opportunities for incumbents. Our ongoing work with Finastra and Microsoft shows the power of ecosystem-players collaborating to establish viable platforms for the next era in banking. With more and more of the global developer community taking advantage of platforms like this, our clients who lean forward can go from strength to strength in Open Banking well into the future.”</p>

<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> May 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.kyriba.com/"" target=""_blank"">Kyriba</a>, the global leader in cloud treasury and finance solutions, today announced the launch of a new service through J.P. Morgan’s API (application programming interface) that allows Kyriba clients that are also J.P. Morgan clients to send real-time payments in the U.S. through The Clearing House’s RTP® network. This is the latest for Kyriba’s growing connectivity options that bridge global financial systems, empowering finance executives to more efficiently mobilize their global cash and liquidity.</p>
<p>“Kyriba’s vision to broaden the payment choices available to corporate CFOs and treasurers aligns with J.P. Morgan’s open banking initiatives. Our clients value the option to transmit real-time payments, and the API integration we have implemented with Kyriba enables these payments to be processed and confirmed within seconds,” said Sairam Rangachari, global head of Open Banking at J.P. Morgan. “Together we have launched the next generation of payments technology to truly modernize the payments experience for our joint clients.”</p>
<p>Real-time payments (RTP) is a game changer for many corporate finance teams who require more choices in how they send payments. In addition to the faster payment transmission and acknowledgement, real-time payments on The Clearing House’s RTP® network can be sent on-demand, simplifying the reconciliation and back office application of payments as compared to managing batch files.</p>
<p>“Our API integration with J.P. Morgan means Kyriba is the first treasury management provider and first payments hub solution to offer real-time payments to J.P. Morgan corporate customers,” said Bob Stark, vice president of strategy for Kyriba. “The speed and frictionless experience that the integration with J.P. Morgan offers is a breakthrough for our clients who want to extend real-time payment automation to their ERP and treasury systems.”</p>
<p>Kyriba is a leader in payments and bank connectivity, processing more than 83 million bank transactions, 30 million payments and 530 million ERP transactions on behalf of its clients each month.</p>

<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> May 2019</strong> – Cashforce continues to innovate in treasury digitalization by developing its next generation AI Powered Cash Forecasting module, offering accurate forecasting for CFO’s &amp; treasurers struggling to gain better cash visibility and forecasting accuracy. Originally part of a project of the AFTE (French Association of Corporate Treasurers) to disrupt various aspects of treasury, Cashforce got involved to explore how Artificial Intelligence could improve the cash forecasting process. For the initial proof of concept, Cashforce worked closely with a large, globally operating corporate to make this a reality using their financial data.</p>
<p>“While our platform is already globally recognized for providing accurate cash forecasts, we keep on exploring how we can further improve our view on the future. By including AI into the mix, we will provide both the CFO, Finance and Treasury departments with even more accurate, efficient and best-in-class cash flow analytics and cash forecasting solutions along with a single version of the truth” commented Nicolas Christiaen, CEO Cashforce.</p>
<p>As an example, Cashforce’s ‘Buffer-algorithm’ will back-test its current Cash flow forecasting model and re-apply these results onto the current model. In addition to the application of smart logic such as customer &amp; vendor payment behavior, this will result in much more accurate forecasts. Companies will be better able to predict the cash outcomes and avoid surprises.</p>
<p>Mark O’Toole, Head of Cashforce for the Americas, commented “By including a feedback loop into the forecast algorithm, Cashforce is able to accurately predict customer payment behavior, unexpected invoices, growth, seasonality and the like.”</p>
<p>After this first release, Cashforce is already working on a next version of the AI-driven forecast, by looking at more complex patterns. Several methodologies are currently being explored, ranging from basic methods such as time-series to more complex concepts such as deep-learning and neural networks. At the same time, client feedback is coming in and this gives Cashforce a lot of inspiration on where to improve and what proposition is bringing more value.</p>
<p>As a ‘next-generation’ Cash Forecasting &amp; Working Capital analytics platform, Cashforce helps finance and treasury departments save time and money by offering accurate cash flow forecasting &amp; flexible treasury automation and significant working capital improvements. Cashforce is unique in its category, because it allows users to drill down to the transaction level details and the system integrates seamlessly with ERP systems &amp; banking systems. In addition, an intelligent simulation engine enables companies to consider multiple cash flow scenarios and measure their impact. As a result, finance and treasury departments can be turned into business catalysts for cash generation opportunities throughout the company.</p>
<p>Cashforces’s innovation around big data &amp; analytics for cash management and liquidity has made them unique by bridging the gap between the CFO, finance and treasury.</p>

<p><em><strong>20<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – While global GDP growth is forecast to slow from 3.2% in 2018 to 2.7% this year, global insolvencies show a reverse trend and are expected to rise 2%. Addressing these outside factors, businesses that trade on credit are advised to perform thorough due diligence and risk assessment of their B2B customers. Atradius suggest a strategic approach to credit management to avoid the pitfalls of possible payment defaults.</em></p>
<p>Asia Pacific economies continue to be the main growth engine of the world economy. Although domestic demand in the region remains robust, several downside risks appear to cloud the growth outlook. The slowing trade growth in many countries prompts Asia Pacific businesses to increase their use of trade credit in B2B transactions to stay competitive and gain market share.</p>
<p>With an upgraded question catalogue for the <a href=""https://atradius.sg/reports-and-services/payment-practices-barometer-asia-pacific-2019.html"" target=""_blank"">2019 release of the Atradius Payment Practices Barometer Asia Pacific</a>, the survey finds that the total value of B2B sales on credit in the region increased to 55.5%, up from 48.1% last year. The biggest increase is found in Australia rising to 71.5% from 47.7% last year, which means that the overall more frequent use of trade credit raises the risk of customers' payment default. On average, 29.8% of the total value of B2B invoices issued by respondents in Asia Pacific was overdue. This percentage is highest in India (39.0%) and lowest in Japan (13.2%).</p>
<p>A key element of credit management is assessing the buyer's creditworthiness, prior to giving credit terms, which survey respondents in Singapore (53%) and China (51%) are the most likely to perform this. Reserving against bad debts, should the assessments turn into a non-payment, is practiced by 41% of respondents in Taiwan and Indonesia, versus only 33% in the region overall.</p>
<p>To remain financially sound and avoid liquidity issues caused by payment defaults of customers, 41% of respondents had to pay their own suppliers late. This was most often expressed by respondents in India (51%) and Indonesia (46%). Ultimately, an average of 2.1% of the total value of respondents B2B sales on credit (up from 1.9% last year) was written off as uncollectable.This suggests that businesses are less successful in collecting invoices than last year.</p>
<p>A concerning 31% of respondents in Asia Pacific expect customers' payment behaviour to deteriorate, and long overdue invoices (more than 90 days overdue) to increase, most alerted are respondents from India (52%) and Indonesia (35%). To protect their business against the rising trade credit risk, 42% of respondents in the region said they will increase the use of credit insurance, for China and Hong Kong this percentage rises to above 50%.</p>
<p>Eric den Boogert, Managing Director of Atradius Asia commented ""Overall, economic conditions in 2019 are expected to be more challenging than last year. But Atradius in Asia is well prepared to manage the downside risks that businesses are facing. Our understanding of the global economy, as well as of local markets across Asia, is central to helping our customers' grow their businesses. Our customers can be confident that we have the underwriting knowledge that can help them avoid unpaid invoices as much as possible and steer them towards healthy businesses and opportunities"".</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://atradius.sg/reports-and-services/payment-practices-barometer-asia-pacific-2019.html"" target=""_blank"">2019 Atradius Payment Practices Barometer for Asia Pacific</a> is annually conducted in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan.

<p><em><strong>16<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – The decision by major central banks and SWIFT to migrate to ISO 20022 is an opportunity for banks and corporates to improve operational efficiency and reassess existing business models, but will require CEO commitment and allocation of appropriate budgets.</em></p>
<p>The migration to the ISO 20022 messaging standard promises greater interoperability between various settlement networks and will enable the transmission of far richer payments data, bringing higher levels of straight-through processing and more efficient compliance processes, says Deutsche Bank’s “Ultimate guide to ISO 20022 migration”.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, the Federal Reserve and The Clearing House in the US, Eurosystem and EBA Clearing in Europe, and the Bank of England’s real-time gross settlement service will all modernise their High Value Payment Systems, almost simultaneously, underpinned by the migration to ISO 20022. SWIFT will also introduce ISO 20022 for cross-border payments, with a view to phasing out existing payment messages – making the migration the most impactful payments industry undertaking since the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).</p>
<p>“Treating this as just another IT project would be a mistake – it is game-changing and signifies an opportunity for banks and corporates to improve operational efficiency and reassess existing business models,” says Christian Westerhaus, Head of Cash Products, Cash Management, Deutsche Bank GTB. “However, making the most of ISO 20022 requires a significant and complex migration, affecting not just core payments processing, but many other banking systems and departments.”</p>
<p>ISO 20022 migration is not mandatory from a regulatory perspective, but those</p>
<p>that do not act now risk being excluded from international payment systems. This first edition of the guide, which has been produced in collaboration with PPI and focuses on the banking implications, strongly recommends banks carry out a strategic review of all internal information flows to best prepare for meeting the challenges of any future regulatory requirements. Moreover, individual characteristics of different regional ISO 20022 migration projects also have to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>“Given the effort required, it is understandable that some banks may look for shorter migration journeys. On the face of it, maintaining existing systems and converting existing formats into ISO 20022 or vice-versa, either at the inlet or outlet of the payments processing system, or at the interface, could make sense,” says Paula Roels, Head of Market Infrastructure &amp; Industry Initiatives, Deutsche Bank. “But, not only do you risk losing information this way, you almost certainly miss a fantastic opportunity to improve efficiency and client service.”</p>
<p>The guide concludes that acting as a “first mover” could also result in a competitive advantage – realising the benefits of harmonised standards and payments efficiency ahead of time, while amortising the required investment. Given this, any migration project will require CEO commitment, and allocation of appropriate budgets, resources and project teams.</p>

<p><strong>14<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – Deutsche Bank today announced that it is now able to process payments using Malaysia’s instant credit clearing system, DuitNow (read: do-it-now) for corporate clients. Duitnow is an initiative aligned with the ambitions of ASEAN 2025, which include creating a regional real-time payment ecosystem.</p>
<p>This real-time fund transfer platform will allow Deutsche Bank’s corporate clients to make payments and receive funds nationwide, processing end-to-end payments within 20 seconds using the “any-ID” or proxy principle.</p>
<p>With the key milestone of the launch of DuitNow, Malaysia moves from relying on a cheque-based payment infrastructure, to one where any participant in the instant credit clearing system can process a payment instantly at a lower cost. Additionally, with the reduction of the use of cheques, the value proposition of international banks, such as Deutsche Bank, in Malaysia is significantly strengthened.</p>
<p>DuitNow allows for the use of any-ID, where our corporates no longer have to maintain the bank details of their employees, as their National ID number on file with their Human Resources is all they need to remit salaries or reimbursements out to them.  Even if employees change their bank accounts, the funds will automatically be routed to their preferred account linked to their National ID number.</p>
<p>Another example of the benefits of DuitNow is with clients in the telecommunications industry, who no longer need to have cash in-house or issue cheques to repay deposits as they will only need a mobile phone number to pay back deposits. Insurance companies equally will be able to pay out urgent claims using the accepted proxy of their clients on file.</p>
<p>Jacqueline William, Head of Global Transaction Banking, Malaysia at Deutsche Bank, said: “We are supportive of the government’s efforts to modernise the payments infrastructure in Malaysia and will continue to invest in such initiatives, which in this case stands to greatly benefit our corporate clients by increasing the speed of local payments.”</p>
<p>Instant Payment by proxy has already been introduced in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia with the goal of facilitating the first cross-border flows within ASEAN in the next 12 months.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – Research from American Express and Institutional Investor has found that the UK’s CFOs are preparing for continued economic and political uncertainty by implementing risk management strategies for the year ahead.</p>
<p>This year’s Global Business and Spending Outlook surveyed 100 senior finance executives in the UK, more than three quarters of whom represent companies that report revenues of $1 billion or more. The research revealed that although the UK’s CFOs expect domestic economic expansion over the next year, the current economic and political climate in the UK and abroad is a significant concern.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty, the majority (68%) of senior finance executives report increased revenue growth over the previous 12 months. This figure is higher than the global average (65%).</p>
<p>Among UK respondents, almost all (89%) believe that the prospect of widely unanticipated surprise events is a rapidly growing concern for their company. As a result, 63% of senior finance executives report that their companies are more cautious about increasing spending and investment in the UK, and 77% are more cautious about investing abroad. Levels of caution are higher than the previous year on both fronts.</p>
<p>76% of CFOs also plan to increase time, attention and resources directed towards enterprise-level risk management systems and process improvements – as well as protecting the company’s physical assets. Almost two-thirds (62%) of the UK’s CFOs also report that, as a direct response to economic or political uncertainty, their companies are likely to withdraw business activities from high risk geographic areas and focus on lower risk areas over the next year.</p>
<p>Commenting on the research, Carlos Carriedo, Senior Vice President at American Express Global Commercial Services Europe said: “The UK’s businesses continue to operate in a challenging climate but our research shows they are clear-sighted and determined in their strategies for growth and managing risk. Their resilience in the face of adversity, and positive reported revenue growth, is encouraging to see.”</p>
<p>The research also highlighted other strategies that CFOs plan to implement to achieve success in 2019.</p>
<p>Meeting customer needs remains the number one priority over the coming year, with 79% of UK CFOs ranking this top of the list. The biggest shift in priorities concerns pursuing business transformation and innovation. More than half (55%) of executives say this has become an important goal, compared to only 38% last year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, over three quarters (77%) of executives say that their companies have explicit strategies to appeal to Gen Z employees, with the same proportion having explicit strategies to appeal to Gen Z consumers.</p>
<p>Carlos Carriedo continued: “Our study shows CFOs are placing growing importance on better meeting the needs of their customers – a priority that is informing their business strategies for the year ahead. In midst of economic and political change, UK organisations believe customer retention is integral to their survival. To continue to prosper, they are balancing risk mitigation with making the investments required to meet the evolving needs of their customers.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>14<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – Bank of America Merrill Lynch has taken another step on its digital transformation journey with the introduction of Apple Watch capabilities into the <a href=""http://www.bankofamerica.com/explorecashpro"" target=""_blank"">CashPro ecosystem</a>. With this development, CashPro Mobile users will be able to pair their Apple Watch with their mobile token and generate a one-time password, delivering even greater convenience by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making the security of a token available directly from Apple Watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminating the need to keep a physical token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accelerating the ability to securely approve transactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies use the <a href=""http://cashproonline.bankofamerica.com/"" target=""_blank"">CashPro platform</a> to manage their everyday treasury and lending needs. CashPro has more than 487,000 active users among the bank’s corporate, commercial, and business banking clients. The CashPro Mobile app’s popularity continues to grow. In the first quarter of 2019, clients used the app to approve more than 300,000 payments, representing over US$30bn in value, a jump of 904 percent from the same period in 2018.</p>
<p>The addition of Apple Watch into CashPro follows a series of the bank’s technology improvements to the mobile experience, beginning with the CashPro Mobile app itself in 2017. Bank of America was the first bank to introduce a digital token, and last year, the company integrated that feature into the CashPro Mobile app, eliminating the need for users to toggle between screens. Other recent investments include biometrics, simpler navigation, enhanced user interface, a personalized home view that allows clients to take action on their most critical to-do’s, and the ability to send feedback directly from the app.</p>
<p>To generate the token, the CashPro app must be installed on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>“Many people still carry their physical token on a key chain along with other banking tokens, which are bulky,” said Tom Durkin, head of Global Transaction Services (GTS) Channels at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Now, executives will no longer have to worry about forgetting to take their physical token when they are on the go, travelling for work or vacation. They’ll have everything they need on their iPhone and Apple Watch.”</p>
<p>With the physical to digital evolution of the token, we’ve introduced greater security.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to expanding our digital capabilities,” said Julie Harris, head of Global Banking Digital Strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Mobility – which offers the convenience of banking anywhere, anytime – is a critical priority for our clients, and that means it’s a critical priority for us. With the CashPro app now available on Apple Watch, we’re pleased to continue our innovative improvements on how and when clients can access tokens.”</p>
<p>Recently, the bank received recognition from Greenwich Associates in the firm’s U.S. cash management study, where the bank achieved excellence in Digital Platform Design, Digital Product Capabilities, and Digital Platform Security Capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>13<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – Fullerton Markets today announced the launch of its mobile app, PipProfit!. The release of the one-stop platform marks the brokerage firm’s foray into the app scene, where it aims to deliver improved convenience and seamless experiences to its global clientele.</p>
<p>PipProfit! boasts features that allow users to carry out trading-related activities easily, while keeping them informed of the latest news and events. Among other things, traders can look forward to sending deposit and withdrawal requests and accessing educational resources and timely market updates for profitable trading. Additionally, partners or Introducing Brokers will be able to onboard new clients more quickly and retrieve valuable business data and metrics pertaining to their clients’ performance and their business growth.</p>
<p>Said CEO of Fullerton Markets, Mario Singh, “The app was birthed with the vision of having our solutions be more accessible to a larger audience, while also making sure we better serve our existing clients. We realised that a mobile-friendly or mobile-responsive website was no longer enough. Our core services have to be fully hosted on mobile if we were to provide a richer experience for on-the-go, tech-savvy consumers. The statistics speak for themselves – interactions with brands today are twice as likely to happen on mobile than anywhere else and 80% of smartphone users are more likely to purchase from companies with mobile apps that offer answers to their questions.”</p>
<p>Apart from the familiar trade offerings that are currently available on the Fullerton Markets website, app users will also enjoy new features such as an events module. This gives them access to a complete overview of activities organised by Fullerton Markets and allows them to immediately register for any event, check in, and upload images of their participation. Users will be alerted to event updates via mobile notifications.</p>
<p>“This comprehensive platform will serve as an important tool for our clients to transfer funds, track business performance and growth and stay updated on news and happenings that have an impact on their trading journey. Through PipProfit!, we hope to take customer engagement, expediency and the trading experience to the next level,” added Mario.</p>
<p>The app can be downloaded from the App Store on iOS or Google Play Store on Android.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – Almost three quarters (71 per cent) of finance professionals support the government’s decision to delay Brexit, believing we are not ready to leave, according to the latest #BigQuestion research from Reed Finance.</p>
<p>From a poll of nearly 500 finance professionals across sectors for its #BigQuestion, Reed Finance found that businesses do not feel that the UK is ready to leave the EU. Of those asked, the majority (80 per cent) believe the government has done a bad job of Brexit, making it an unnecessarily difficult process, with 67 per cent saying they feel that their organisation hasn’t received enough advice or support from the government.</p>
<p>However, finance professionals clearly have their own ideas about what their organisations need from an exit deal. For 44 per cent getting access to the EU market is the biggest issue about leaving the Union with 70 per cent wanting a close relationship with the EU when we leave.</p>
<p>Additionally, for the 32 per cent of those asked that singled out getting access to EU workers as the biggest issue for their organisation, it will be encouraging that more than half (56 per cent) say their company hasn’t had any more difficulty retaining EU workers as a result of the referendum decision.</p>
<p>Rob Russell, Director of Reed Finance, says: “These findings show that businesses are paying very close attention to the outcome of the recent EU debates going on in Westminster. Whether they wanted to leave the EU or not, finance professionals know what they want and need when the UK is outside of the Union – they are simply looking to the government for clarity on how they go about engineering that.</p>
<p>“From an employment perspective, if our research is an indicator, then there is some positive news about talent with more than half of those asked stating that the difficulty retaining EU workers has not increased since Brexit. Given the importance of Europeans to the success of our financial services sector, it is good that this talent can be kept within our borders. This is another case for greater guidance to be given to UK businesses on how they can retain the services of their most skilled workers from across the Union and therefore avoid the issues created by a talent shortage.”</p>
<p>As government negotiations on a final deal are ongoing, some businesses have even prepared for the possibility of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit. While only nine per cent say they have prepared extensively for no-deal, more than a third (37 per cent) have done a little preparation. However, 46 per cent have done none at all.</p>
<p>Rob Russell continues: “Even as no-deal looked less likely, and has now been taken off the table, businesses tried to prepare as best they could for all eventualities. This shows the resilient nature of UK business and their determination to create companies that are flexible and protected. This level of preparation can only be a good thing for both employees and the UK economy.</p>
<p>“If there is one thing we take from our research it is that business leaders are willing to commit to a plan, have a solid opinion on what is best for their company and want to see greater clarity on Brexit. Whatever the UK’s future relationship with the EU, we can be sure that there will always be a core number of resilient, flexible and adaptable businesses across the UK ready to evolve in their new climate.”</p>

<p><strong>6<sup>th</sup> May 2019</strong> – GTreasury’s first quarterly software update in 2019 coincides with the one-year anniversary of its acquisition of Visual Risk and the beginning of its delivery of a single <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/R00s5h6Q2x000050UzV7ls0"" target=""_blank"">SaaS</a> solution for treasury and <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/es0hAV00000QU70256ms50x"" target=""_blank"">risk management</a>. The Q1 release builds upon the single solution and highlights the integration of operations globally under a single <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/G6Q0V700hn5BU0xs00005s2"" target=""_blank"">GTreasury</a> brand.</p>
<p>“We are commemorating the successful integration of our single solution with a new brand identity, signaling our way forward as one company,” says GTreasury Chief Executive Officer Renaat Ver Eecke. “Our global team is united in our focus on continuous innovation and service, grounding every decision, big and small, in the client experience.”</p>
<p>GTreasury updates its digital <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/G6Q0V700ho5CU0xs00005s2"" target=""_blank"">TMS</a> platform using the Agile approach to delivering continuous innovation with major updates each quarter. Among the many updates from Q1 are major improvements to Payments and Financial Instruments and further enhancements to GTreasury’s well-known Cash Management worksheets.</p>
<p>Using GTreasury, companies can leverage new ways of processing payments, such as point-of-purchase payments made through Zelle and other digital networks. Treasury can also service the entire organization, centralizing payments processing for better control and accuracy using GTreasury’s high-performance payment imports and extracts. These new tools enable Treasury to service the large volume files or unique and complex payment files common in other departments, such as Accounts Payable. Treasuries can also support their expanding businesses by tracking high volume wires and cross-border payments more efficiently, leveraging GTreasury’s certification with the SWIFT gpi initiative.</p>
<p>Updates to Financial Instruments in GTreasury simplify the complexities of deal management and support new and existing deal types. The new Renegotiation capability allows users to make changes or updates to a deal easily with a streamlined workflow. Users can unwind or re-position loan deposits or asset backed securities and see details of deal history and versioning.</p>
<p>New deal management and event processing updates simplify and improve the creation and management of balances and payments through the entire deal lifecycle. GTreasury’s new money market deal type allows users to easily manage money market investments or issuances with details-at-a-glance on any cash position. In addition, expanded FX mirror trading instruments now include swaps and spots as well as forwards, and back-to-back trades now allow for allocated cash flows. Users can also create new Accrual General Ledger entries for reporting withholding tax.</p>
<p>Keeping the user experience at the center of new updates, GTreasury’s newly designed Cash Management Worksheet Set-Up makes creating worksheets more flexible and intuitive. Users can quickly build and preview their progress with drag and drop functionality and more easily create formulas, which simplifies the whole process.</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> May 2019</strong> – Nivo, the Manchester-based instant messaging and identity verification platform, has announced the close of a £2m funding round from GP Bullhound, the Angel CoFund and a syndicate of angel investors. This funding will be used to accelerate growth and product innovation, cementing Nivo’s position as the fastest, safest way for financial services companies to sign up and service their customers.</p>
<p>Nivo’s secure instant messaging network includes advanced data protection features, so brands in regulated industries can connect with customers, verify identities, gather personal information and complete transactions much more easily using mobile technology. Launched in late 2018 as an early stage spin out from Barclays Bank, Nivo’s are already working with large banks, lending brokers, lenders, credit unions and professional services companies who use the platform to significantly improve customer sign ups and service efficiency.</p>
<p>Since launch, Nivo has enabled more than £20m of loans to be written by financial services organisations using its platform and has engaged with over 30,000 consumers.</p>
<p>Nivo CEO Mike Common comments: “Our mission is to make it easier for consumers to connect with service providers in regulated industries like Financial Services. Our clients are using Nivo to deliver simpler mobile experiences, which reduce effort and empower customers. This means everyone saves time, costs go down and satisfaction goes up.”</p>
<p>He added, “We’re making the latest and best financial technologies available to anyone. For service providers, it’s free to get started, with no technical effort required, then a simple monthly subscription.</p>
<p>Hugh Campbell, Managing Partner of GP Bullhound added: “Manchester is a growing hub for disruptive and world-leading FinTech firms, and we’re delighted to be putting our support behind one of its leading lights. The strength of advocacy and results from its existing client base impressed us right from the beginning, with the Nivo team developing an unparalleled product offering that is disrupting the financial services industry.”</p>
<p>Tim Mills, Managing Partner of the Angel CoFund said: “The Nivo team has achieved a great deal in a very short period of time, and solves a very real problem for enterprises needing to transact a wide range of services online. The strength of the product has led to early adoption by a broad range of well-known financial institutions. The team knows this industry very well and has built a fantastic group of supporters and advisors around them. We’re happy to be joining that group and look forward to seeing the product go from strength to strength.”</p>
<p>The funding also includes some of the UK’s leading technology entrepreneurs including Elizabeth Gooch, founder and CEO of process optimisation technology firm EG Solutions who will be joining the Board. Other investors include Scott Fletcher, founder and chairman of cloud computing group ANS, Paul Gouge and Alex Rigby, founders of leading mobile games company Playdemic, and Rodney Baker-Bates, Chairman of the Willis Group.</p>
<p>Nivo allows any provider in a regulated industry to join its network in minutes, with no upfront cost or technical expertise – allowing any brand to offer a high-quality digital experience that would normally cost millions of pounds.</p>
<p>The platform offers features including Onfido identification verification checks, the ability to securely send and receive files and photos, open banking, and electronic signatures – all delivered via instant messaging.</p>
<p>In addition to its unique position as the go-to instant messaging platform for banks, Nivo offers the most flexibility to enable e2e customer sign ups, and delivers unparalleled ease of set up and a simple monthly subscription. Clients have confirmed that sign up processes previously taking six weeks have been reduced to 15 minutes through Nivo’s platform.</p>
<p>Nivo joins existing GP Bullhound portfolio companies, including Slack, Partnerize and Unity Technologies on its list of fast-growing technology businesses.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> May 2019</strong> – SWIFT announces the launch of an ‘in-flight’ payment investigation and resolution service, available in the cloud, in a significant expansion of its network-wide payments validation toolkit. The new capability allows for dynamic query handling between banks on the SWIFT network, enabling them to quickly resolve instances in which required operational, regulatory or compliance information is incorrect or missing from payment instructions.</p>
<p>This latest development complements SWIFT’s integrated gpi pre-validation service, which is aimed at identifying and eliminating errors and omissions in payment messages, prior to payment initiation. Integrated directly into SWIFT gpi, the services will ultimately be made available to all 10,000 banks across the SWIFT network.</p>
<p>Harry Newman, Head of Banking at SWIFT, said: “In our drive towards frictionless payments, we are working together with banks and software providers to bring in a fully integrated, network-wide service to ensure a smooth payments process. It has been a consistent bug-bear of many banks that, whilst only a minority of payments are held up by errors and missing information, they are frustrating, time-consuming and costly. Ultimately all 10,000 banks on the network will be able to use these tools seamlessly to resolve them.” The new service will speed up the resolution of operational, compliance and regulatory-related issues that can arise along the payments chain. While relatively infrequent, these issues can currently take a long time to resolve. Such issues can arise from missing or incorrect information – such as the reason for payment or settlement date, or differences in regulatory controls and requirements across jurisdictions – all of which require additional information and validation.</p>
<p>Interbank efforts to resolve these blockages often involve multiple requests and responses across chains of banks. The use of unstructured, unstandardised messages prevents automated processing, resulting in time-consuming and costly processes.</p>
<p>Available in the cloud, and through a combination of the gpi tracking function and standardised industry protocols, the service will improve transparency, shorten resolution time and reduce the need for manual interventions. Users will be able to locate any hold-ups via the gpi tracker, as well as identify the beneficiary or intermediary banks that may be causing them. Using API calls, and the gpi tracker, they will then be able to automatically exchange the required information directly with the relevant banks. For smaller users, a GUI will be provided to handle the case requests and responses.</p>
<p>Using a standardised ISO 20022 format, the banks will be able to exchange requests and responses in a structured manner – thereby ensuring more efficient case resolution. Facilitating 14 enquiry types and covering three payment types (customer credit transfers, financial institution transfers, cover payments) the architecture is designed to make the service future-proof and extendable to cover any field of any payments message.</p>
<p>Mark McNulty, Global Head Clearing &amp; FI Payments at Citi, said: “In addition to our goal of providing real-time ubiquitous cross-border payments, our ambition is to ensure that any associated customer enquiries are transacted real-time. gpi case resolution is a very important step forward as it provides the platform for banks, across the payment chain, to interact in a far more dynamic, efficient and transparent manner than today and thus ultimately better serve our clients. Case resolution is well placed to build on the scale and reach of gpi to transform how enquiries associated with cross-border payments are resolved.”</p>
<p>Peng Hua, Deputy General Manager, Operation Management Department at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, said: “ICBC is extremely willing to participate in the application and promotion of the SWIFT gpi case resolution service as a market forerunner. It can be predicted that through the implementation of SWIFT gpi case resolution service, banks can achieve rapid exchange of standardised investigation information, improve the efficiency of requests and responses and provide customers with premium cross-border clearing service and outstanding structured resolution.”</p>
<p>Jean-François Mazure, Head of cash clearing services at Societe Generale, said: “Societe Generale is enthusiastic to be taking part in another SWIFT gpi initiative. This new service streamlines the investigation process and definitively accelerates the resolution of cases. This fits in perfectly with the banking industry’s innovation dynamic that constantly strives to improve service quality as well as optimise operational costs.”</p>
<p>In the first stage of its launch, the service will be piloted by 12 major banks and three case management software providers. The 12 banks taking part in the pilot are Bank of China, BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Emirates NBD, Gazprombank, HSBC, ICBC, SMBC (Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation), Societe Generale and Standard Chartered. The three case management software providers taking part are Appian, Pega and Syracom. The service is scheduled to go live in November 2019.</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> May 2019</strong> – Fintech firm Evergreen Finance London has purchased an innovative service from data analytics provider FICO to speed up its decision process around customers’ credit.</p>
<p>The company, which trades as Moneyboat and offers short term FCA-regulated loans, will use the bespoke FICO Decision Modeler to assess risk and the affordability of its products to applicants.</p>
<p>It allows the direct lender to apply highly segmented risk strategies and use business terms rather than programming to make credit decisions, making the assessment process both more intuitive and faster.</p>
<p>Steve Hadaway, general manager for FICO in EMEA, said: “Evergreen, like other fintechs we serve, need the smartest technology available to make sound lending decisions faster. In a high-risk area like short-term lending, precise risk decisions are essential. No company has as much experience as FICO at building risk management systems for lending.”</p>
<p>The three bespoke analytic models used in the cloud-based platform will allow Moneyboat to efficiently evaluate whether applicants can afford to make the monthly payments for a credit agreement, based on their income and regular outgoings.</p>
<p>It means the percentage of customers who fail to repay their loans should be greatly reduced, allowing the company to offer increasingly competitive rates on loan products in the future.</p>
<p>Moneyboat founder and director Yisroel Perkel said: “We reviewed other decision engines, but the FICO system gives us the greatest sophistication and flexibility. FICO impressed us with their expertise in this area, along with their ability to deliver both world-class software and advanced analytics.</p>
<p>“By enabling us to approve loans 24/7, their solutions will aid our strategy to rapidly grow and make short-term loans affordable and fair.”</p>

<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://highradius.com/"" target=""_blank"">HighRadius</a>, a fintech enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company, specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based autonomous systems for Accounts Receivables and Treasury processes, announced its latest offering – <a href=""https://highradius.com/solutions/treasury/cash-forecasting-ai"" target=""_blank"">AI-Based Cash Forecasting Cloud</a>. The new solution will enable treasurers to achieve accurate, real-time cash forecasting without having to  manually collect and transpose data across spreadsheets and various systems.</p>
<p>Built on <a href=""https://www.highradius.com/highradius-rivana-artificial-intelligence-for-credit-and-ar/"" target=""_blank"">RivanaTM</a>, HighRadius’ proven Machine Learning Platform for finance departments, the solution will enable companies to accurately forecast cash flows with purpose-built AI algorithms at individual operational categories including accounts receivable (A/R), accounts payable (A/P), expense and payroll.</p>
<p>Sashi Narahari, Founder &amp; CEO, HighRadius, explained, “Treasurers have been demanding a higher degree of cash forecasting accuracy to help them evolve beyond managing daily funding and low-yield investments, to making higher yield decisions. We have successfully solved A/R forecasting with AI by predicting payment dates at an invoice level and now we’re introducing AI-based, automated, forecasting models for high-variability cash flow categories including A/R and A/P to enable the digital transformation of the treasury function.”</p>
<p>HighRadius’ extensive research with treasury leaders across industries revealed that more than 98% of corporate cash forecasting is performed using spreadsheets with basic formulas. In addition to being manual and time consuming, most of these techniques do not incorporate any statistical modeling on large volumes of data to drive accurate forecasting. This is crippling corporate treasurers from making confident short-term and long-term debt and investment decisions. Trusted by Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, HighRadius has a track record of success deploying AI-driven software solutions used by various corporate finance professionals, teams and departments. The AI-based Cash Forecasting Cloud joins HighRadius’ treasury management applications which also include Cash Management Cloud and Bank Reconciliation Cloud.</p>

<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Citi announced today its NextGen project, an initiative with EY and <a href=""https://www.sas.com/en_gb/home.html"" target=""_blank"">SAS</a>, using artificial intelligence (AI) to develop an advanced risk analytics scoring engine. NextGen was created to help streamline the time-consuming, highly manual processes associated with reviewing high volumes of global trade transactions while ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>""By leveraging innovation, we continue our strategic journey to drive digitisation throughout our worldwide operations,"" said John Ahearn, Global Head of Trade for Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. ""We process 9 million transactions annually, and the NextGen project will help us optimise our processes from the back office to the front, by expanding the use of digitisation, automation and advanced analytics.”</p>
<p>“This real-time solution will help us to be able to more efficiently detect transactions with potential compliance concerns up front,” said Valeria Sica, Global Head of Trade Services for Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. “This solution assists in managing and comparing a large number of data points across current and prior transactions, which will provide more context and usable data to aid the decision maker in reviewing global trade transactions, which has traditionally been a very manual process across the industry.”</p>
<p>Citi Global Trade continues to digitise its platforms and processes to optimise the latest innovation available. As a part of this strategy, Citi digitises over 25MM trade-related pages annually with optical character recognition (OCR). NextGen will continue this legacy by utilising Artificial Intelligence technology to automate manual processes.</p>
<p>Combining EY’s deep business, risk, and technology consulting experience in the financial services sector with SAS’ leading advanced analytics platform, Citi will use the new service to further digitise its trade compliance process. This project will help to eliminate time-intensive, manual processes and provide a streamlined view of risk activity and insights.</p>
<p>“Trade compliance is a key focus for global regulators, and this drives increasing expectations about the scope and sophistication of a bank’s controls,” said Jake Jacobson, EY US Managed Services CIO. “Many banks still rely on manual, paper-based processes, driving up operational costs and impacting the customer experience. Innovative technology helps change the game entirely.”</p>
<p>The new NextGen platform (powered by SAS) is intended to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In-depth analysis of global trade transactions to help align bank resources. The programme is scalable to handle the high volume of daily transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced analytics and natural language processing to better understand networks of related parties, unstructured data and customer activity over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process automation that combines analytic results and trade related bank policies to help focus on trade transactions activities that may need further investigation in accordance with Citi’s escalation process for them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Banks face almost overwhelming scale and complexity in the trade-finance sector and in compliance activities,” said Stu Bradley, Vice President of Fraud and Security Intelligence at SAS. “SAS’ sophisticated analytics platform will help Citi drive more effective and efficient monitoring of trade transactions. The resulting performance and enhanced risk insights should lead to a better risk posture, improved response times for monitoring, and reduced operational costs.”</p>
<p>Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) enables its clients' success by providing an integrated suite of innovative and tailored cash management and trade finance services to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organisations across the globe. Based on the foundation of the industry's largest proprietary network with banking licenses in over 90 countries and globally integrated technology platforms, TTS continues to lead the way in offering the industry's most comprehensive range of digitally enabled treasury, trade and liquidity management solutions.</p>

<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Citi Hong Kong announced today the results of its survey on residential property ownership in Hong Kong for Q1 2019. The survey found that the percentage of respondents who expected home prices in Hong Kong to rise in the next 12 months increased over the preceding quarter, and so did the percentage of respondents showing an interest in property ownership, particularly among the young and single. There was also a higher percentage of respondents who took a neutral stand on whether this is a good time to purchase a home, reflecting a wait-and-see attitude among potential home buyers.</p>
<h4>Expectations reversed: more respondents expecting home prices to rise in the next 12 months</h4>
<p>The percentage of respondents who expected home prices in Hong Kong to rise in the next 12 months was up drastically from 18% in Q4 2018 to 42% in Q1 2019. In comparison, the percentage of respondents who expected home prices to fall was down significantly from 57% in Q4 2018 to 24% in Q1 2019.</p>
<p>Since the second half of 2018, the market had been battered by multiple headwinds, including the US-China trade war, interest rate hikes, and a weakening yuan. However, with these news gradually discounted during Q1 2019, the expectations among local citizens of the future property price trend were reversed.</p>

<p>Josephine Lee, Head of Retail Bank, Citibank Hong Kong, said, ""The results show that local citizens' view on the property market has reversed as they expect home prices to rise in the coming year. Given the expectations of rising home prices, local citizens are likely to become less confident in their home affordability. To make their dreams of home ownership come true, it is important for potential home buyers to consider financial services best tailored to their needs, with a comprehensive wealth management plan in place.""</p>
<p>Citibank commissioned The University of Hong Kong Social Sciences Research Centre to conduct the survey, interviewing over 500 Hong Kong respondents by phone in March 2019. Since 2010, Citibank has conducted a quarterly survey on the housing market to assess the current state of homeownership in Hong Kong, gauge public opinion on the subject of homeownership and public expectations in terms of future housing price trends.</p>

<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – A Barclays survey of Money20/20 attendees has revealed that security and collaboration are a major focus for Asia’s payments, fintech and financial services leaders.</p>
<p>The polling, taken on-site at the Money20/20 event in Singapore in March 2019, provides a range of insights into the evolution of the payments and tech industry in the region. The three day event brought together thousands of industry experts, with over 300 speakers sharing their insights on recent developments and discussing expectations for the future.</p>
<p>Barclays’ research at the event found that an emphasis on security was deemed essential for attendees, with the majority (55%) acknowledging that to keep customers loyal and provide a great experience a focus on security is required. However, despite this recognition of the crucial role of security, most respondents (62%) believe that their company could do more on cyber security or need to invest further.</p>
<p>Collaboration also scored very highly, as ‘partnerships with external organisations’ was selected as the most popular response when attendees were asked to identify the best way to increase productivity in their organisation. The benefits of collaborating were further underlined by the majority of respondents (52%) indicating that they believe the role of banks in payments innovation to be best served by partnering with fintechs for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Turning to the region specific questions, it’s clear that confidence in the potential for Asia to drive change in financial services is high, with almost half of the respondents (44%) predicting that the biggest rise in payment innovation in the next five years will be in China, with one in five (21%) selecting India.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given the important role Asian companies have played in advancing its adoption in recent years, when asked which technology would most revolutionise the way they work, two in five (39%) selected Artificial Intelligence, followed by a quarter (26%) who opted for blockchain.</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of the payments landscape was also very apparent, with frictionless payments essential for promoting customer loyalty and a great experience for more than half (53%), and digital payments identified as the most important B2B payments innovation (32%), closely followed by connectivity (25%).</p>
<p>Phil Bowkley, Global Head of Financial Institutions Group at Barclays Corporate Banking, said: “The results from our polling showed that Asia is a leading region for innovation in fintech and payments, with the advent of AI and other new technologies helping to drive the industry forwards. It was pleasing to see a focus on partnerships and collaboration identified by the leaders we spoke to, with both our survey and the panel sessions at Money20/20 highlighting the benefits of working together to help accelerate both innovation and problem solving for mutual benefit. Across Barclays, we’re committed to finding ways to harness the power of new technology and simplify payments, and look forward to exploring these themes further at the next Money20/20 event in Amsterdam in June.”</p>
<p>The survey of attendees in Singapore marked the launch of a global project to assess how attitudes of Money20/20 attendees vary across different regions. Barclays will undertake further polling at other Money20/20 events later in 2019, in an attempt to understand better what the priorities are for individuals and companies at the cutting edge of payments and technology innovation across the planet.</p>

<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Despite the 2018 tax season coming to an end, <a href=""https://cryptolandpr.dmanalytics2.com/click?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.node40.com%2Fbalance%2F&amp;i=2&amp;d=KjEdTLblRcuqmAi_2FLzfw&amp;e=editorial%40treasurytoday.com&amp;a=5i9J8mBuSVCthjUtaF05bQ"" target=""_blank"">NODE40</a>, the blockchain firm behind the Balance cryptocurrency reporting software, has today launched a number of accountant-focused upgrades that CPAs requested following a fairly arduous 2018 crypto tax filing season.</p>
<p>“Just about every CPA, accounting and auditing firm we talk with is dissatisfied with how commercial accounting software lacks sufficient features to properly track trade history, cryptocurrency cost basis, and to generate the critical audit trail necessary to backup their tax position,” said Perry Woodin, Co-Founder of NODE40.</p>
<p>Over the past few months Balance has undergone significant advancements to make it more aligned with the needs of CPAs and other financial professionals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Node 40’s innovative SMART 2.0 (Simple Multi-Account Reconciliation Technology) brings cost basis tracking directly into existing wallet and exchange ledgers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign Asset Reporting made simple with support for FBAR and FATCA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for importing data into popular tax filing software like TurboTax®, H&amp;R; Block®, and TaxAct® made available with a Tax File Format export.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drake Software export added by popular demand. Drake Tax from Drake Software is extensively used by small to mid-sized accounting firms and consistent winner of CPA Practice Advisor’s Readers Choice Awards annually since 2004, Node40 is delighted to offer this integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closing position reports now provide detailed balance data for each ledger and each currency accurate to the hour on a provided date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ledgers may now be set up to take advantage of the Like-Kind (IRC Section 1031) Exchange provision prior to 2018 along with downloadable IRS form data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generic data export option to download ledger activity represented as a CSV for custom analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for additional exchanges added as well as the option to select file upload or direct API integration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to track cost basis throughout exchanges and custodial wallets that an individual taxpayer or business interacted with was the largest hurdle for CPAs this tax season. Tracking such activity is the key component to preventing overpayment or underpayment of taxes.</p>
<p>Some online exchanges provide rudimentary worksheets to calculate taxes owed but most consumers of digital currencies buy, sell, and trade on a variety of exchanges. When personally owned custodial (off-line) wallets are factored in, the chain of custody grows even more complex. This very typical use-case makes any worksheets or tax reporting from a single exchange nearly useless and almost always wildly incorrect.</p>
<p>“These ongoing developments to NODE40 Balance, demonstrate that we are building the industry’s most comprehensive cryptocurrency accounting solution. Having been built from the ground up by engineers with the guidance of CPAs and audit practitioners, our technology and audit methodology is always aligned to meet professional standards. This will be more important as we expect to see more formalized guidelines from the IRS, SEC and other financial bodies soon,” concluded Sean Ryan, co-Founder of NODE40.</p>

<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – TreasuryXpress, the global leader in on-demand treasury management solutions recently announced that ASGC Group, a Dubai-based vertically integrated construction group best known for delivering turn key and iconic special projects in the UAE, has gone live with the firm’s enterprise treasury management solution. TreasuryXpress was selected by ASGC Group to help centralize high volume transaction management in order to achieve comprehensive treasury visibility and centralized payment processing. The solution is also helping to advance ASGC’s trade finance operations. The accomplishment is part of ASGC Group’s overall strategy towards digital transformation.</p>
<p>As one of the most influential and leading companies in the Middle East's construction industry, ASGC Group of companies, manage over 21,000 transactions monthly across 15 banks and 8 different currencies. Having to manage such a high volume of transactions through numerous individual banking portals, Elias Choufi, Head of Treasury at ASGC Group, knew he had to transform operations and set out to digitize and optimize their processes. Driven by his experienced corporate finance strategy, Choufi says “my enrollment in the Group is to enhance treasury function and be the market leader in disrupting the treasury models.”</p>
<p>“Our strategy was to digitize, automate and centralize our corporate treasury function. Since we execute and manage so many transactions locally and overseas, we wanted to find a way for our team and stakeholders to have better visibility into our payments across all our currencies, entities and banks,” says Choufi. “It is also an excellent way to go paperless. Having the ability to move from paper to electronic banking transactions was a major focus of our digitization strategy via a centralized treasury model. This also contributes to our environmental practices at ASGC.”</p>
<p>According to Choufi, “security, speed of implementation, expertise and efficiency” were the key criteria for selecting a treasury management solution (TMS) partner to help him realize his vision.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that ASCG and Mr. Choufi selected TreasuryXpress to be their partner for digital treasury transformation,” said Anis Rahal, CEO and founder of TreasuryXpress. “We believe treasury technology needs to be accessible and highly cooperative with other platforms – quickly and simply. Our technology is proven to enable digitization strategies with smart solutions that allows treasury to deploy, integrate and scale quickly and securely.”</p>
<p>According to Choufi, the solution was live and fully integrated with its two main banks and ERP solution within one month through host-to-host connectivity, a record-breaking implementation. As a result, Choufi says that it has already experienced “significant cost-savings” by reducing manual effort from 3 – 5 days of payment processing to 2 hours. The elimination of printed cheques and supporting documentation has reduced the previously significant expenses of paper work has also made a remarkable contribution to the ROI of the project.</p>
<p>TreasuryXpress’ on-demand Treasury Management Solution (TMS) model leverages modern Cloud technology and development practices to create repeatable best-practice implementation workflows. These workflows fully automate the bank connectivity process; thereby reducing time and effort spent on these tasks during traditional projects. Additionally, the TreasuryXpress approach to innovation offers a perpetual development and upgrade model that allows treasury professionals to implement, consume, and scale technology economically and rapidly.</p>

<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Many UK technology firms are planning forays into overseas markets with the intention of hiring the best international talent, according to research<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> from <a href=""https://velocityglobal.com/"" target=""_blank"">Velocity Global</a>, the leading provider of global business expansion solutions.</p>
<p>The findings show that 42% of British tech businesses say their expansion plans are being driven by a desire to recruit the best global tech talent, with Europe (37%) and Asia (36%) seen as the most promising destinations to bring in new skills.</p>
<p>Just 11% view North America as a strong potential market for the right recruits, with 6% pointing to the Middle East, according to the research.</p>
<p>China, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Germany, France and Spain were among those named as markets considered the most promising to capitalise on pools of talented workers outside of the UK.</p>
<p>Just over half (52%) of the businesses surveyed are planning to expand overseas to grow their customer base, with 43% saying their moves into new markets are being driven by the economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit.</p>
<p>Velocity Global surveyed senior decision-makers from 500 UK tech companies of varying sizes for <a href=""https://infovelocityglobal.com/report-foge-2019-main?utm_campaign=the-state-of-global-expansion-2019&amp;utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=pr"" target=""_blank"">The State of Global Expansion 2019 report</a>, revealing a sector of ambitious businesses looking to uncover growth in foreign markets.</p>
<p>Some 90% of UK tech firms are looking to expand their operations into new countries, with many planning to do so in the near future. Just under half (43%) of the companies surveyed operate in the UK only, but this is expected to fall to just 13% by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>Ben Wright, CEO of Velocity Global, said: “The survey reveals an ambitious UK tech sector which has the confidence to pursue growth internationally, with all the benefits that brings.</p>
<p>“Many of them are expanding overseas not just to expand their customer bases or to address the issue of the UK leaving the EU, but also because they want to ensure they have a presence in fast-growing markets with the best people.</p>
<p>“We know that the UK is among the best places in the world to set up a tech business but there is no escaping the issue of skills shortages. It appears businesses are thinking creatively, seeking to combine growth in new markets with the opportunity to hire their brightest talent.”</p>
<p>Although the research revealed confidence and ambition among UK tech businesses, it also uncovered a cautious outlook among some firms in the sector.</p>
<p>When asked about global expansion, 39% cited managing employee immigration as a major challenge, ahead of recruitment (36%), managing unfamiliar payroll processes (26%), communicating with clients over long distances (23%) and a lack of government support (21%).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of the 10% of tech businesses that said they were not planning to expand, more than half (52%) said seeking to expand globally is too risky.</p>
<p>Ben Wright added: “It’s understandable that some businesses continue to have reservations about taking those first steps into unfamiliar overseas markets. Yet more often than not, the myriad opportunities outweigh the risks. And with the right advice and an expert partner on hand to simplify processes, it can be hugely rewarding and the route to future growth.”</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Action on companies who fail to meet the standard of the Prompt Payment Code (PPC) has seen 17 companies removed or suspended from the Code during the past quarter, the Chartered Institute of Credit Management (<a href=""http://www.cicm.com"" target=""_blank"">CICM</a>) has announced today (28<sup>th</sup> April)<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thousands of companies who sign up to the Code, administered by CICM on behalf of the Government, pledge to uphold its best practice for payment standards in order to help end the culture of late payment, particularly for small businesses. This includes a commitment to pay 95% of all supplier invoices within 60 days.</p>
<p>Based on the new Payment Practices Reporting data that large businesses must publicly report, CICM is reviewing whether businesses are meeting the standards of the Code and paying their suppliers promptly. The first phase of these reviews has identified 17 businesses to be removed or suspended, with more removals and suspensions expected in the second phase of review currently underway.</p>
<p>Five companies have been removed from the Code for non-compliance and not providing a plan for how they will meet the terms of the Code. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BHP Billiton – a global resources business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHL – a global logistics business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GKN Plc – a multinational aerospace and automotive components business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Sisk &amp; Son Limited – an international construction company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R. Twining and Company Limited – a purchaser and seller of tea, coffee and other beverages</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A further company – The Go-Ahead Group Plc, a passenger transport provider, has been re-instated to the Code after filing data to show that it has been paying 95% of all invoices within 60 days for the last reported period. Go-Ahead Group has also provided the Prompt Payment Code Compliance Board with assurance that it will continue to honour both the spirit and the mandatory requirements of the Code going forward.</p>
<p>Twelve businesses have been suspended from the PPC, for not paying their suppliers in line with the Code, but they have committed to make changes to meet the standards of the Code and pay suppliers promptly. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Atos IT Services UK&amp;I; – an IT services business and main UK subsidiary of Atos SE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balfour Beatty Plc – an international infrastructure group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>British Sugar UK – a British producer of sugar for the UK food market</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costain Limited – a construction and engineering company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engie Services Limited – a facilities management services company, part of Engie Group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interserve Construction – a construction company owned by Interserve Group Limited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Limited – a facilities management and construction engineering company, part of KBR Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laing O’Rourke – an international engineering business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persimmon Homes Limited – a UK house building company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rolls-Royce Plc – an engineering business focused on power and propulsion systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSE – electrical and telecoms provider</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vodafone Limited – a telecoms company, part of the multinational Vodafone Group Limited</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies are already taking action to improve, which is welcomed and supported by CICM. Interserve Construction, for example, has improved its performance based on an action plan agreed with the CICM, which has seen the business reduce the number of payments over 60 days by 10% over the second half of last year; the company is continuing to improve towards compliance over the next six months.</p>
<p>The Prompt Payment Code Compliance Board, chaired by CICM’s Chief Executive Philip King and including the Small Business Commissioner Paul Uppal, regularly reviews the data reported by large companies under the Payment Practices Reporting Regulations to ensure they are upholding their commitments.</p>
<p>Businesses suspended from the Code are invited to produce an action plan setting out how they will achieve compliance with the Code within an agreed period. When they have achieved compliance their status as a Code signatory will be reinstated. If they do not, then they will be removed.</p>
<p>Mr Philip King said: “The Board is disappointed with the actions of a minority who continue to treat their suppliers unfairly, and has no satisfaction in having to name them publicly.</p>
<p>“Conversely, we are encouraged by the actions taken by The Go-Ahead Group which has now positively engaged with the Board and given us the reassurances we need to allow them to remain a Signatory to the Code. We will continue to monitor their position to ensure future reported data shows the expected improvements and compliance.</p>
<p>“As part of our work driving culture change to end late payments, we will continue to challenge signatories to the Code if the obligatory Payment Practice Reporting data suggests that their practices are not compliant with the Code.”</p>
<p>Small Business Commissioner Paul Uppal added: “As a Prompt Payment Code Compliance Board member, I will continue to support Philip King and the board in removing or suspending non-compliant signatories from the code. It is essential the code has credibility and demonstrates a commitment to ensure small businesses are treated fairly.</p>
<p>“My team has already recovered more than £3.5m in late payments and is ready and available to support small businesses experiencing poor payment practices”.</p>
<p>News of the suspensions builds on a government announcement in November, where failure of companies to demonstrate prompt payment to their suppliers could result in them being prevented from winning government contracts.</p>
<p>From September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019, any supplier who bids for a government contract above £5m per annum will be required to answer questions about their payment practices and performance. The expected standard is to pay 95% of invoices in 60 days across all their business.</p>
<p>Any supplier who is unable to demonstrate that they have systems in place that are effective and ensure a fair and responsible approach to payment of their supply chain may be excluded from bidding.</p>
<p>Kelly Tolhurst, Minister for Small Business said: “The Prompt Payment Code is a positive force for good and by naming transgressors we are supporting small businesses in the supply chain.</p>
<p>“We remain committed to supporting small businesses against poor payment practice and are delighted to see that the Prompt Payment Code Compliance Board has acted to expose those whose payment practices fall outside of their obligations to treat suppliers fairly.”</p>
<p>In October the Business Secretary Greg Clark announced that further reforms to the Prompt Payment Code were being considered, including whether the Small Business Commissioner should have a greater role in its administration as part of his wider role in tackling late payment.</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://cryptolandpr.dmanalytics2.com/click?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshocard.com%2F&amp;i=2&amp;d=vtQJFWntSOqtjkyZbpYb8g&amp;e=editorial%40treasurytoday.com&amp;a=OdraYR0SRbGWnDWFyl7zFA"" target=""_blank"">ShoCard</a>, the blockchain-based identity authentication platform has today announced the launch of their digital document signing service that links an individual’s blockchain-certified ID to a signed document. Currently attaching a signature to a real individual remains a challenge, but ShoCard has developed a method to overcome this by providing the identity proof and signature attachment to a document, delivering a more reliable, notary-equivalent process for the digital age.</p>
<p>As the internet has taken a more ubiquitous role in our lives, more digital documents are being electronically signed. Currently, there are over 75 countries globally that recognize the legal validity of e-signatures, yet it is still difficult to legally prove that someone has signed a document. By having a blockchain-certified digital ID, an individual can attach their identity to a document, digitally sign it with cryptographic proof, and automatically provide an audit trail of proof.</p>
<p>While other digital document signing systems utilize the blockchain, by hashing a digital document and using a private-key to sign the document as an attestation to their signature, without a reliable means of tying that private-key, uniquely to an identified individual, the only proof that can be provided is that a document existed in a particular form (perhaps with a signature on one of the pages) at a given time. A true link between the individual and the blockchain signature cannot be necessarily created.</p>
<p>ShoCard was designed as an identity platform that can uniquely identify a real individual. An individual’s identity can be determined through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process, matching their government identification and their biometrics together and then tying that information to their private-key on their personal device and a digital-ID on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The KYC results can be certified by a certifying authority and also maintained on the blockchain as proof of the person’s identity. With this information, it is then possible to create a true digital signature of the hash of a document that can be easily proven regardless of time lapsed and without having to rely on intermediaries as proof of recordation. This process helps tie the ease of digital document signing and a more reliable notary-equivalent process.</p>
<p>The Document-Signing service is currently available via an Android app. An iOS version will be available soon.</p>
<p>“Trustless mechanisms like ShoCard’s digital document signing service are increasingly becoming the norm, as more services begin to realize that blockchains are the best option for storing, securing and transferring proof of data,” said Armin Ebrahimi founder and CEO of ShoCard.</p>

<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions today announced a strategic partnership with Vietnam-based intermediary payment service provider, Payoo, to facilitate consumer-to-business collections for corporate clients in the country.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, Citi’s corporate clients in Vietnam will be able to receive real-time payments from their customers for services including utilities, telecommunications and credit card bills through Payoo’s extensive digital network and physical footprint of over 10,000 brick-and-mortar touchpoints.</p>
<p>""The collaboration with Payoo is exciting as it complements Citi’s capabilities to deliver last-mile digital solutions to our clients. This is in line with our strategy to leverage the potential of the thriving FinTech ecosystem in Singapore and ASEAN to enhance our client value propositions,” said Debopama Sen, Singapore and ASEAN Head, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions.</p>
<p>Linh Ngo, CEO of VietUnion, which operates the Payoo platform, said, “With our intensive knowledge of the local market, Payoo is proud to be delivering our innovative collections services to Citi’s clients. We are excited to work with Citi to develop additional enhanced services to meet clients’ evolving needs as the local payments infrastructure in Vietnam continues to develop.”</p>
<p>The partnership was announced at the sidelines of Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions’ inaugural ASEAN FinTech Day which commenced in Singapore today. ASEAN FinTech Day is part of Citi Trade and Treasury Solutions’ FinTech Accelerance Program which is designed to accelerate the delivery of solutions for Citi’s clients in partnership with key FinTech players.</p>
<p>A total of eight shortlisted FinTechs from ASEAN are presenting their prototype solutions to Citi at ASEAN FinTech Day. The inaugural event in Singapore follows from previous Treasury and Trade Solutions FinTech Days held in other markets including North America, the United Kingdom and India.</p>
<p>“Citi is actively working with FinTechs around the world to create new services and capabilities on our platforms for the benefit of our clients,” said Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. “These events play an important role in allowing us to engage with the FinTech ecosystem in order to co-create the best solutions for our clients in the digital economy.”</p>
<p>In the lead-up to ASEAN FinTech Day, Citi reached out to over 3,000 FinTechs in the region, calling for solutions that could address one or more of eight identified problem statements across three categories – C2B Collections, Trade, and Ecosystems.</p>
<p>An initial shortlist of 25 applicants were invited to pitch to over 50 Citi FinTech mentors before the final eight teams were chosen. These eight teams then joined ASEAN Design Sprint Week which began on Monday, April 22.</p>
<p>During the week, each team was paired with a Citi mentor and guided by members of the Citi Innovation Lab in Singapore as they prepared for ASEAN FinTech Day.</p>
<p>As part of ASEAN FinTech Day, each team is presenting a pitch and solution demo before a Citi judging panel. Selected finalists will work in partnership with Citi to commercialize and launch market-ready solutions in the next six to nine months.</p>

<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Award-winning payments optimisation company Ixaris today announces a new partnership with financial service infrastructure experts Banking Circle, connecting the latter’s Virtual IBAN (International Bank Account Number) technology to Ixaris’ payment products. The resulting payments solution is the travel industry's most comprehensive, streamlining payments and tapping new revenue sources in ways previously thought impossible.</p>
<p>Traditionally, seamless cross border B2B payments required companies to have a physical footprint and open a physical bank account in the territories they wanted to operate in. Launched in 2017, Banking Circle’s Virtual IBAN allows businesses to send and receive payments anywhere in the world at a low cost and in real-time, eliminating the reliance on multiple banking relationships in different territories. Banking Circle's Virtual IBAN technology, combined with Ixaris' ability to optimise every payment, will result in more efficient global payments handling for the travel industry that can generate revenue and, ultimately, profitability.</p>
<p>The cost and administration of payments, squeeze profit margins for travel companies. This is exacerbated when payments are made across borders; international transactions incur higher bank charges, poorer FX rates, payment delays and huge amounts of administration. Today, payment experts Ixaris ease that squeeze, transforming payments from a profit-draining necessity to a fully optimised revenue stream for over 200 customers in 50 countries and boosting margins by up to 20% for the world’s largest travel brands to independent travel agencies.</p>
<p>Ixaris’ Chief Executive Officer, Aran Brown comments: “Our partnership with Banking Circle allows Ixaris to offer an even more competitive edge to our travel customers, not only by optimising payments but by creating a seamless cross border transaction process across more than 25 currencies in 60 countries in a way that banks simply would not allow,"" he adds “Ixaris’ ability to optimise travel payments is now second to none.”</p>
<p>Anders la Cour, Chief Executive Officer at Banking Circle, adds: “Banking Circle Virtual IBAN plays an invaluable role in delivering faster, cheaper payments to merchants transacting around the globe. Unlike traditional business to business cross border payments, which can incur high bank charges and payment delays, our innovative and multi-award-winning solution enables Ixaris to give customers their own virtual IBAN’s. This improves payments acceptance, settlement times and reconciliation without the burden of multiple banking relationships, high fees and slow transfer times.”</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers are reporting a substantial increase of fraudulent PDF files. This fraud campaign takes advantage of recipients’ trust in PDF files as a “safe” file format that is widely used and relied upon for business operations.</p>
<p>“Increasingly, email, Office documents and now PDFs are the vehicle of choice for malware and fraud in the cyber landscape,” said SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner. “SonicWall Capture ATP with its RTDMI technology is at the forefront of catching new cyberattacks that elude traditional security sandbox technology. For example, in all of last year, our Capture ATP sandbox discovered more than 47,000 new attack variants in PDF files. This year, we’ve already seen that number rise significantly with over 73,000 PDF-based attacks discovered in March alone.”</p>
<p>Last year, SonicWall Real-Time Deep Memory Inspection (RTDMI™) identified over 74,000 never-before-seen attacks, a number that has already been surpassed in the first quarter of 2019 with more than 173,000 new variants detected. In March, the company’s patent-pending RTDMI technology identified over 83,000 unique, never-before-seen malicious events, of which over 67,000 were PDFs linked to scammers and more than 5,500 were PDFs with direct links to other malware.</p>
<p>Targets of the phishing style PDF scam campaigns typically receive malicious documents from “businesses” luring victims with attached PDF files that look deceivingly realistic with misleading links to fraudulent pages. The business offer within the PDF attachment is enticing to recipients, as it promises to be free and profitable with just the click of a link.</p>
<p>Most traditional security controls cannot identify and mitigate links to scams or malware hidden in PDF files, greatly increasing the success of the payload. This increase implies a growing, widespread and effective strategy against small- and medium-sized businesses, enterprises and government agencies.</p>
<p>RTDMI identifies and blocks malware that may not exhibit any detectable malicious behavior or hides its weaponry via encryption. By forcing malware to reveal its weaponry into memory, RTDMI detects and proactively stops mass-market, zero-day threats and unknown malware accurately utilizing real-time, memory-based inspection techniques. RTDMI also analyzes documents dynamically via proprietary exploit detection technology, along with static inspection, to detect many malicious document categories.</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> April 2019</strong> – If MPs are serious about protecting jobs and securing long-term, sustainable economic growth, they must now support a second Brexit referendum, says the CEO of one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory organisations.</p>
<p>Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of deVere Group, is speaking out as talks between Conservative ministers and their Labour shadows continue to try and find a Brexit deal that could command a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>Mr Green comments: “As soon as MPs return from the Easter recess, they must get behind plans for a confirmatory Brexit vote. If there’s the political will for it, it could be done in a matter of months.</p>
<p>“Political egos must be put aside. Time must stop being wasted on grandstanding. Momentum must be built and decisions made.</p>
<p>“Both the Conservatives and Labour are making vaguely positive remarks about their talks to find a deal that could secure a parliamentary majority. But it remains hugely doubtful as to whether they will ultimately find a way forward that both parties could defend.</p>
<p>“The countdown is on for recently extended Halloween Brexit Day. The time to take affirmative action is now; we haven’t got more time to continue with talks that may or may not reach a successful conclusion.”</p>
<p>He continues: “The lingering uncertainty surrounding Brexit is having a real impact on business in the UK, the EU, and around the world that trade internationally.</p>
<p>“This uncertainty has created a monumental lack of confidence, resulting in falling investment, spending and recruiting across Britain.</p>
<p>“In addition, the UK is currently the world’s fifth largest economy and the impact of the Brexit deadlock, which is creating a negative economic environment, will have far-reaching implications beyond the UK’s borders.”</p>
<p>He goes on to add: “If MPs are serious about protecting jobs and securing long-term, sustainable economic growth, they must now support a second Brexit referendum. After MP’s abject failure to so far find a way beyond the impasse, the next move has to be to put it back to the people.”</p>
<p>The deVere CEO concludes: “Giving the public the chance to have a confirmatory vote and giving them a final say is quite simply the only credible solution now available. But MPs must act fast or time will, once again, run out.”</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> April 2019</strong> – Singapore Bullion Market Association (SBMA), representing key stakeholders from the precious metals industry is playing a pivotal role in the region by bringing together the industry players of the bullion markets of the ASEAN countries through the sharing of knowledge and best practices and connecting them to global markets. This is also in line with the theme “Building a Sustainable Precious Metals Hub in ASEAN” for the third Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference to be held in Singapore from 9 to 11 June 2019 at ParkRoyal on Beach Road. This year, SBMA will also be celebrating its 25th Anniversary.</p>
<p>One important topic for this year’s panel discussion at the Conference is “ESG Criteria: New Paradigm that would Redefine the Precious Metals Supply Chain”. The panel will be moderated by Terry Heyman, Chief Financial Officer of World Gold Council. The panelists will comprise Richard Hayes, CEO of The Perth Mint, Sakhila Mirza, General Counsel of London Bullion Metal Association (LBMA), Jason Toussaint, Managing Director, Asia, of Responsible Gold Singapore Pte. Ltd, Jonathan Jodry, Head of Laboratories from Metalor, Jeff McCulloch, Managing Director of Clean Mining Ltd and a representative from the artisanal gold mining sector as well as a representative from a gold mine in ASEAN or Australia.</p>
<p>Mr. Albert Cheng, CEO of SBMA, said: “Asia is the largest gold mining and gold consumption market. By bringing the players in the whole eco-system at this conference, there will be opportunities for the participants to engage in the various topics lined up for this 2-day conference. One such topic is “Regional Connectivity for Mutual Benefits: Business Model between China and ASEAN”. Delegates from the Chinese Gold &amp; Silver Exchange Society (CGSE) in Hong Kong together with key gold jewellery manufacturers from Shenzhen, and representative from China Gold Association and ASEAN members can discuss ways on how best to co-operate with China.”</p>
<p>Traditionally, gold mining has depended on harsh chemicals such as cyanide to extract gold from the ground. This has left our planet with a legacy of toxic wastes which are harmful to health and the environment. For the first time at this conference, Mr. Jeff McCulloch, Managing Director of Clean Mining Ltd, will unveil his company’s breakthrough and innovative technology that provides a responsible, non-toxic alternative to cyanide in the leaching of gold. The technology will be showcased during the panel discussion on ESG and at Clean Mining’s booth.</p>
<p>The other topics to be discussed at the Conference are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“An overview on Australian gold industry, trade and markets” by Mr Thuong Nguyen, Economist, Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Australian Government.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Is Exchange Traded Structure complementary to OTC Gold Trading?</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> April 2019</strong> – NatWest has today released the latest set of Growth Funding figures, with the bank revealing that £2.9bn of the already-expanded £3bn pot has been approved for investment. The Growth Funding package will be immediately doubled to £6bn and will help businesses looking to grow, fund green initiatives and navigate the current uncertain business climate.</p>
<p>NatWest’s Growth Funding offer is just one element of the bank’s commitment to helping businesses not only navigate challenges such as the continued Brexit uncertainty but also seize the plethora of opportunities available in today’s climate for businesses to progress. NatWest has doubled the package on the back of 2018 figures that reveal its Commercial and Business Banking business supported total lending of more than £100 billion and has recently announced the expansion of its accelerator hubs for start-ups across the UK to 12, following the recent opening in Manchester. On top of this, NatWest has begun piloting the UK’s first ever business banking hubs alongside two other high-street banks.</p>
<p>Alison Rose, CEO of Commercial and Private Banking at NatWest, said: “Whatever the circumstances facing businesses throughout the UK, we are passionate about helping them achieve their goals and are flexible in how we do so. The bank is truly national in its approach to helping businesses via our regional accelerator hubs, the work through our regional boards and dedicated teams in every corner of the UK. We recognise that the challenges businesses face evolve all the time, which is why we try to innovate whenever we can.”</p>
<p>One example of the bank’s innovative offer to entrepreneurs and business owners comes through the Group’s Lombard asset finance arm. Lombard has developed an Intellectual Property Funding product which is a unique solution that allows businesses to unlock capital invested in developing  their intangible assets such as software, something Ian Isaac, Lombard Asset Finance’s Managing Director, says is imperative in today’s market:</p>
<p>“Businesses are increasingly reliant on software and other intellectual property to provide value to their customers or efficiencies within their own operating models and are spending significant amounts on research and development. Traditionally, borrowing from banks  against these types of intellectual assets has not been straightforward. We, however, have launched a product specifically designed to take into account the high value that these assets represent within a business and can provide finance linked to that value to help firms grow as a result.”</p>
<p>Green finance also remains a key focus for the bank underlined by the fact that nearly £800m has been approved for projects with a renewables and/ or energy efficiency tilt. Finance is available right now and NatWest is keen to highlight how quickly it can provide whatever solution entrepreneurs and business owners may need.</p>
<p>Alison Rose, commented: “We are working every day to look at what businesses need to not just survive, but grow. In many cases this is bespoke funding which is why we are once again expanding our total Growth Funding pot to £6bn. However, we have also seen that other support is needed. We have seen great success out of our accelerator hubs and witnessed businesses revolutionise themselves and reach new heights thanks to our Lombard IP finance product. On top of this, thanks to the review we carried out alongside the Treasury, we have identified a host of new challenges facing female entrepreneurs in particular and are already developing solutions and interventions such as our women-only crowdfunding platform, Back Her Business. I’m proud of what we have achieved already, but even more excited about what we can offer now and in the future.”</p>

<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> April 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://shakticoin.com/en/"" target=""_blank"">The Swiss Shakti Foundation</a> has opened mining registration across the world coinciding with the publication of the first of its four-part white paper.</p>
<p>The Swiss Foundation would like to bring the following three points to public attention.</p>
<h4>One: Early Adoption Incentives</h4>
<p>Early adopters are incentivized with 10,000 Shakti Coins (equivalent to USD 50,000) when they sign up for a Power Mining License. A limited number of Power Mining licenses are available per country and only a limited number of those will include the early adopter incentive. These will be awarded on a first-come, first-serve-basis.</p>
<p>Please note, this is a one-time, limited offer and the Foundation may end this incentive without notice. Visit: <a href=""https://www.shakticoin.com/static/docs/opportunity.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.shakticoin.com/static/docs/opportunity.pdf</a> – for complete Terms &amp; Conditions including how to receive the bonus bounty.</p>
<h4>Two: Financial Transparency &amp; Distributed Ownership</h4>
<p>The Shakti Network is 100% controlled and influenced by node operators (miners) for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>Given that requirement, license fees paid for accessing the Shakti Network are administrated by an independent 3rd party full-service accounting firm, based in Denver, Colorado, USA.</p>
<p>Visit: <a href=""https://www.shakticoin.com/en/white-paper/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.shakticoin.com/en/white-paper/</a> – and refer to page #6 for more information.</p>
<p>The licenses allocated to each country will be installed uniformly to reflect the population distribution across the county. The Shakti Coin Power Mining license is a digital asset class in the emerging FinTech sector and limited to one for per person to operate.</p>
<p>Shakti's T400 Power Mining nodes will be the pillars of the Shakti Network and have the potential to offer a lucrative income stream to license holders over time.</p>
<h4>Three: White Paper Release</h4>
<p>Today we have released the first installment of our four-part white paper. As you will see, the entire Shakti Coin ecosystem is new. The protocol is new, the process of creating the coin is new and the distribution is new. The first section provides an overview of the concept. Anyone interested in joining the network is encouraged to study the white paper to ensure they understand the foundational concepts of the coin – it's the third generation blockchain-based digital money.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Today HSBC and Walmart announce the roll-out of a sustainable supply chain finance programme that pegs a supplier’s financing rate to its sustainability performance.</p>
<p>This global programme allows Walmart’s suppliers who demonstrate progress in Walmart’s Project Gigaton or Sustainability Index Program to apply for improved financing from HSBC based on their sustainability ratings.</p>
<p>Project Gigaton is a Walmart initiative to avoid one billion metric tons (a gigaton) of greenhouse gases from the global value chain by 2030 through supplier commitments. Walmart’s Sustainability Index Program gathers and analyses information across a product’s life cycle, and was developed by The Sustainability Consortium (TSC), a global organisation dedicated to improving the sustainability of consumer products, to help Walmart benchmark suppliers and encourage continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Natalie Blyth, Global Head of Trade and Receivables Finance, HSBC, comments: “The procurement standards of a buyer are a huge driver for sustainability, and this is why we are proud to join forces with Walmart, the world’s largest retailer and a company that shares our mission to build a more sustainable future. In many industries it is a company’s supply chain – rather than the company itself – that is responsible for most of the environmental impact and therefore offers the greatest potential for sustainability improvements.”</p>
<p>“At Walmart, we appreciate that the only way to a sustainable future is through combined effort, and we share HSBC’s commitment to empowering our suppliers on this journey. We want to encourage companies throughout the supply chain to focus on sustainability, as we have seen first-hand how this sparks innovation and generates value. Investing in sustainability can not only lead to higher productivity and cost savings for suppliers, but can also drive their business growth as they make a positive contribution to the world,” says Matthew Allen, VP Finance &amp; Assistant Treasurer, Walmart.</p>
<p>HSBC believes that supply chains are one of the most important levers for banks and businesses to create a positive effect on the world. According to McKinsey, a typical consumer company’s supply chain creates far more social and environmental costs than its own operations, accounting for more than 80% of greenhouse-gas emissions and more than 90% of the impact on air, land, water, biodiversity, and geological resources.</p>
<p>Blyth adds: “Trade is a force for good, and trade finance has a vital role to play if we are to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Embedding sustainability in global supply chains is not only beneficial for the environment and society, but also for companies’ bottom lines. As the world’s leading international bank, HSBC is actively building new partnerships and frameworks to help deliver a more sustainable future for all.”</p>
<p>Being sustainable is seen as very important by businesses around the world. According to the recent HSBC Navigator survey, 81% of global companies say ethical and environmental sustainability is important to them and 83% aspire to be a genuinely ethical or environmentally sustainable company. Also, improving sustainability outcomes is among the top three objectives for making supply chain changes.</p>
<p>As a leading international bank, HSBC plays a unique role in supporting a shift to sustainability in global supply chains. HSBC is embedding sustainability into the products and services it offers to customers, with the aim of supporting the sustainable development of its customers’ supply chains. Nearly one-third of businesses surveyed in the recent HSBC Navigator survey plan to make sustainability-related changes to their supply chains within the next three years.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Growth in UK manufacturing export orders weakened to a three year low in Q1 2019, according to the latest Lloyds Bank International Trade Index, compiled in partnership with IHS Markit.</p>
<p>In the first three months of 2019, the Index posted a reading of 50.4 for new manufacturing exports, down from 50.8 in Q4 2018. A reading of above 50 indicates growth, while one below 50 signifies contraction.</p>
<p>Despite the drop, the number of UK manufacturers exporting reached a record high, in Q1 2019, of 81.3 per cent of firms participating in IHS Markit’s Purchasing Managers (PMI) Survey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new overseas services sales dropped at the sharpest rate since the index began in 2014. The index posted a reading of 46.8 for services exports, a fall of two points since the final quarter of last year.</p>
<h4>Consumer goods bright spot amid weakest rise in manufacturing exports since 2016</h4>
<p>Despite Q1 2019 seeing UK manufacturers continuing the longest period of sustained new export order growth since 2008, it was the weakest rate of growth since Q2 2016.</p>
<p>The weak rate of UK growth coincided with a drop worldwide, with data showing the largest downturn in international trade volumes for more than six years during Q1 2019. Asia and Europe posted particularly sharp declines in manufacturing export sales.</p>
<p>Consumer goods was the best performing export category for UK manufacturers in the first three months of 2019, posting a reading of 54.4.</p>
<p>Textiles and clothing was the strongest performing consumer goods sub-category, posting 63.1, its highest reading since 1997 and significantly up from 55.4 in Q4 2018.</p>
<p>But the strong outing for consumer goods was offset by a drop in new export orders for intermediary goods (semi-finished goods used to produce other products), which posted a reading of 47.1.</p>
<h4>US demand for tech offers respite amid decrease in service export sales</h4>
<p>UK service exports fell two points in Q1 2019 to 46.8. This is the second consecutive quarter of contraction of exports for the UK services sector and follows a four-year run of growth.</p>
<p>Driven by demand from the US and Ireland, technology services exports bucked the trend rebounding to 51.0 from 45.7 in Q4 2018. Accounting for this, firms cited that Sterling’s relative weakness had positively affected their competitiveness.</p>
<p>Gwynne Master, managing director and global head of trade for Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking, said: “In the midst of a testing climate, British companies are demonstrating undeniable resilience. The proportion of UK manufacturers trading overseas is at its highest level since 2005 and some subcategories of UK exports, including consumer goods and the technology services sector, are performing particularly well.</p>
<p>“This positivity comes in the face of international trade tensions, which are reducing demand, and sustained uncertainty at home. Of course, we will continue to be by the side of firms seeking to take advantage of opportunities abroad.”</p>
<h4>Global slowdown in economic growth reduces opportunities for UK exporters</h4>
<p>Amid the global economic slowdown, growth in international demand for British goods and services slowed in Q1 2019, from 53.1 in Q4 2018 to 52.5.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of 2019, economic growth was seen in key UK export markets, with the UAE posting its highest reading since the end of 2017 (61.7). The US posted a reading of 54.8 (vs. 54.6 in Q4 2018), thanks to an uptick in services sector activity.</p>
<p>This positivity was offset by weaker economic growth in other export markets. Namely, subdued growth in China continued in Q1 2019 (51.5 in Q1 the same as in Q4 2018), largely thanks the manufacturing sector output plateauing.</p>
<p>Closer to home, there was growth in Spain and Italy in Q1 2019, while demand conditions in France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany weakened thanks to a downturn in manufacturing outputs. Conditions in Germany have spread to Poland and the Czech Republic, where sharp contractions in manufacturing growth were measured.</p>
<p>Gwynne added: “The international trade environment is incredibly complex, and the findings of our index reflect the ongoing impact of fluctuating economic conditions in key UK export markets driven by wider global uncertainty.</p>
<p>“Exporters can benefit from doing business in a diverse set of overseas markets. The more markets a firm exports to, the more resilient it will be to geopolitical headwinds.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Small businesses in South China generally experienced positive business conditions in 2018, with small businesses from Guangzhou being the most likely from Mainland China to state that they grew, according to a survey conducted by CPA Australia, one of the world's largest accounting bodies.</p>
<p>These positive conditions are expected to continue in 2019 with Guangzhou's small businesses also being the most likely from Mainland China to expect to grow. This reflects the resilience and capability of South China's small business sector in the face of a potentially uncertain and challenging year.</p>
<p>Key to this is the very strong focus on innovation and technology by small businesses from Guangzhou and Shenzhen – with the survey results showing that small businesses in those cities not only leading the rest of Mainland China in the use of many technologies, but also leading small businesses from the Asia Pacific. Further, the survey results also show a clear link between innovation and technology, and strong business growth.</p>
<p>The findings from CPA Australia's 10th annual Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey, follow extensive surveying of more than 3,600 small business operators in ten markets, including Australia, mainland China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>With 77 per cent reporting that their business grew in 2018 and 46 per cent increasing the size of their workforce, Guangzhou's small businesses experienced the most positive conditions in Mainland China among the surveyed cities. The positive sentiment in Guangzhou is likely to continue, with nearly 80 per cent of small businesses expecting their business to grow in 2019 and over half expecting to increase their headcount.</p>
<p>Mr William Huang, President of CPA Australia South China Committee said that under a challenging environment caused by trade tensions and other issues, small businesses in South China generally performed strongly last year and show confidence in both the local economy and their business growth in 2019.</p>
<p>""I believe this confidence is built on their leading position on the utilisation of digital technologies in their business and their innovative culture.</p>
<p>""The survey findings in the Asia-Pacific show that high levels of adoption and utilisation of digital technology is one of the most positive influencers to drive business growth.</p>
<p>""We are not surprised that the small businesses in this region have strong confidence since the Greater Bay Area is one of the central engines of economic growth in Mainland China, with world-class innovation and technology at its core.</p>
<p>""Both Shenzhen and Guangzhou are the top performers in the Asia Pacific for online sales and are also leaders in the adoption of new digital or mobile payment methods in transactions. Over 80 per cent of businesses in both cities are earning over 10 per cent of their revenue from online sales, and nearly nine in ten businesses generate more than 10 per cent of their sales through new payment technologies.</p>
<p>""Further, we are delighted to find that small businesses from South China are quite sophisticated in the technologies they are investing in and adopting in their business. The survey findings show that they not only have a strong capability to identify the suitable technologies to invest for their short-term returns but also have an eye on the future and their customers, with respondents in South China being the most likely to have invested in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and customer relationship management (CRM) software among all markets surveyed in the Asia-Pacific,"" Mr Huang says.</p>
<p>Increasing cost, especially staff costs, is the factor that is most likely to have had a negative impact on businesses in South China in 2018, with nearly 60 per cent of respondents in Guangzhou stating that staff costs was the cost most detrimental to their business, ranking top in the surveyed markets.</p>
<p>""On the one hand, small business owners are facing increasing costs such as staff costs, on the other hand, they are having difficulty recruiting suitable staff to support their business growth, Mr Huang says.</p>
<p>To solve this dilemma, CPA Australia suggests that small businesses revisit their company structure and cost structure and seek to improve their business strategy and operating model.</p>
<p>""The development of the Greater Bay Area should accelerate people movement throughout its 11 cities and attract non-local talent to the area. Taking advantage of this development and new technologies, which are changing the way people work, provides opportunities for small business owners to get the staff they need to grow their business. However, this may require a change in how businesses engage talent, for example, offering more flexible and mobile work conditions to attract and retain the right skill sets from anywhere in the Greater Bay Area, or collaborating with a distant team or freelancers.</p>
<p>""In addition, through the interconnection of cities in the Greater Bay Area, there are opportunities for financial institutions to work together to create a better business environment for small businesses in South China to access to finance and support their further growth.</p>
<p>""The slowing global economy and economic uncertainties are making 2019 a challenging year for small businesses in South China, however, CPA Australia remains positive. Strong domestic consumption in South China supported by recent tax cuts, the region's leading capabilities in innovation and technology, government policies to improve SME access to finance, and emerging opportunities from the Greater Bay Area plan, make us confident that South China's small businesses will continue to grow and stay vibrant,"" Mr Huang says.</p>
<p>CPA Australia has six tips for China's small businesses in 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look for government incentives that are supportive of innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek advice on which technologies are best suited for your business before investing in those technologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use big data analytics to analyse your customers to further improve customer satisfaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore opportunities in Greater Bay Area, emerging economies on the Belt and Road, and other fast-growing markets in the Asia Pacific region and Africa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest in improving strategic and managerial skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertake a strategic review of your cost structure and potential business risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Siemens has launched a new web-based application which reveals the readiness and potential of six major cities to embrace digitalization and develop new ways of living, working and interacting. The Atlas of Digitalization is based around the interconnected themes of Expo 2020 Dubai – Mobility, Sustainability and Opportunity – and assesses how the fourth industrial revolution has already impacted urban life around the world, and the potential it could have in the future.</p>
<p>Data from 21 indicators has been analyzed from Buenos Aires, Dubai, Johannesburg, London, Los Angeles, and Taipei. From this analysis a Digital Readiness Score has been defined, considering areas such as smart electricity and transport systems, internet connections and digital governance services. The score reveals the current level of maturity of each city’s digital infrastructure, and its preparedness for a connected future.</p>
<p>Juergen Maier, CEO Siemens UK said:</p>
<p>“It is tremendous that London is leading the charge in digitalization among these global cities. In spite of all the economic uncertainty we have been facing in the UK over the last two years this study shows we are still well placed to achieve leadership globally in the fourth industrial revolution if we continue to invest, innovate and grow responsibly and sustainably.”</p>
<p>“However there is more to the UK economy than London and our Northern cities particularly in the Northern Powerhouse must also benefit from innovation and investment. Each city here in the UK and globally must address its own unique mix of challenges and opportunities by embracing digitalization; the key to sustainable, economically vibrant future cities.”</p>
<p>“The Atlas of Digitalization gives us an insight to the current status of digitalization in global cities, and the data tells us London has already made excellent progress. We hope the Atlas will inspire new ways of thinking to shape all the smart cities of tomorrow and realize the global potential of City 4.0,” added Maier.</p>
<p>The analysis takes into account areas such as innovation, greenhouse gas emissions and time spent in traffic to give the cities a Digital Potential Score, indicating where there is opportunity to grow digital capabilities to transform society and economy. Together, the Readiness and Potential scores illustrate the different capacities each city already has, and where they can develop to effect change and growth.</p>
<p>The Atlas recognizes London’s advanced implementation of digital technologies in areas such as the introduction of the congestion charge and the Ultra Low Emission Zone which will dramatically cut nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Currently road traffic in London is responsible for more than half of the city’s NOx emissions.</p>
<p>The Atlas also identifies potential for digitalization to positively impact areas in London such as improving mobile internet speeds and opening up new opportunities for internet-enabled services based on the Internet of Things such as ‘vehicle to everything communications’ to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Mark Jenkinson, City Director, London, at Siemens said: “As part of the Mayor of London’s ‘Smarter London Together’ plan to transform London into the smartest city in the world, the Greater London Authority has set out how they want to collaborate with the capital's boroughs and services, from Transport for London to the National Health Service: working more effectively with the tech community, universities and other cities to make their vision a reality.”</p>
<p>Data from the 21 indicators has been mapped across three themes: Sustainability, Mobility and Opportunity, creating unique visualization of each city’s digitalization landscape. Visitors to the Atlas of Digitalization can interact with each city and explore its data, taking an in-depth look into how each is addressing its own challenges and opportunities, and how it will impact work and life in future cities.</p>
<p>The Sustainability, Mobility and Opportunity themes are identified by Expo 2020 Dubai as having the power to build partnerships, inspire progress and develop our future cities. Siemens is Infrastructure Digitalization Partner to Expo 2020 Dubai and will use digital solutions to connect, monitor and control buildings at the site using MindSphere, the cloud-based operating systems for the Internet of Things.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>16<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Accuity, the leading provider of financial crime compliance, payments, and Know Your Customer (KYC) solutions, has announced its AI-driven account screening capability, ‘<a href=""https://accuity.com/product/firco-automated-alert-reduction/"" target=""_blank"">Firco Automated Alert Reduction</a>’, which increases the level of accuracy in detecting and evaluating screening matches during the KYC process. It has also been optimised to integrate seamlessly with WorldCompliance™ data to expand its visibility into sanctions, politically exposed person (PEP) and adverse media lists, in support of compliance requirements.</p>
<p>This new module augments existing financial crime filters and alleviates a significant burden for organisations with large-scale compliance operations that rely heavily on human operators to review potential risks. Risks associated with customer accounts can include exposure to illicit financial activity, sanctioned entities, PEPs and reputationally exposed persons (REPs).</p>
<p>Existing matching technology compares customer data to the entities listed on regulatory watch lists, but until now, has not been sophisticated enough to eliminate the abundance of ‘false positive’ results produced, with the necessary level of accuracy. Manually assessing alerts to determine quality, potential risk, and whether further investigation is required, has been a significant drain on compliance resources and a contributor to the rising costs of compliance across the industry.</p>
<p>According to the recent Chartis Research <a href=""https://www.chartis-research.com/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-aml/financial-crime-risk-management-systems-aml-and-watchlist-monitoring-2019-10741"" target=""_blank"">Financial Crime Risk Management Systems: AML and Watchlist Monitoring report</a>, “the success of an AML system is usually measured by the amount of time it saves and its reduction of false positives.”</p>
<p>Firco Automated Alert Reduction applies AI techniques to the hundreds of thousands of potential matches produced by a financial crime screening system. Its patented scoring methodology calculates the probability that a match is correct and evaluates how material the risk is to the business. The most relevant hits are flagged for immediate attention, based on the organisation’s individual risk appetite and compliance policy. Results are fed back into the screening cycle continuously, allowing the statistical model to adapt and become more intelligent as it gathers information.</p>
<p>Sophie Lagouanelle, Vice President of Financial Crime Screening at Accuity said, “Sifting through screening matches to detect the true risks can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Not only does our solution considerably reduce the size of that haystack to expose risks with unparalleled precision, but it also intelligently prioritises those risks according to the organisation’s compliance policy, so operators can be far more methodical in their approach to reviewing hits.”</p>
<p>Firco Automated Alert Reduction greatly improves the effectiveness of screening and provides significant efficiency gains to clients. It also records an electronic audit trail so screening results and the decision-making process can be shared easily with regulators. For instance, the NYDFS Part 504 rule means that for obliged entities, explainability is more important than ever. This regulation stipulates that financial institutions and payment service providers must be able to demonstrate their financial crime screening programme is fit for purpose, that they can control their software, and that the results of screening correspond to the organisation’s risk appetite.</p>
<p>The launch of Firco Automated Alert Reduction is a result of the <a href=""https://accuity.com/press-room/accuity-acquires-safe-banking-systems/"" target=""_blank"">acquisition of Safe Banking Systems (SBS)</a> by Accuity in July 2018. It is now available to financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) globally.</p>

Goods and services are sourced and shipped from a large number of suppliers, leaving business customers with a tremendous volume of expenses to process and often little information for each transaction.</p>
<p>With this collaboration, mid and large-size businesses now have a more intuitive and transparent way to understand and manage their expenses. A detailed understanding of each line-item, such as item description, price and relevant tax information, for all Amazon Business purchases, helps businesses better track expenses, expedite financial reconciliation and streamline the filing and auditing of expense reports. This product is currently available in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States for Mastercard commercial cards issued by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Bank PLC, Citi, J.P. Morgan, Lloyds Bank, NatWest and The Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
<p>“More detailed transaction data helps make doing business easier,” said Jeff Feuerstein, senior vice president, Commercial Products, Mastercard. “Our collaboration with Amazon Business streamlines financial reporting and cuts down on time spent reconciling transactions against statements. It gives our customers a clearer understanding of money spent.”</p>
<p>Companies that enroll Mastercard commercial cards through bank partners are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>View the details, quantities, unit price and tax for individual items they purchase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the shipping amounts associated with the financial charge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directly update information either in their expense management system or in the Smart Data platform</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mastercard has enhanced Smart Data, its market-leading, expense reporting and analytics suite, to leverage this enriched data to provide new reports and custom reporting tools. This capability is available to enrolled commercial card programs from participating financial institutions. Mastercard Smart Data is used by nearly 250 issuers globally.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Morgan McKinley has released its London Employment Monitor looking at city hiring for financial services from January to March 2019. Though the first quarter of 2019 saw an increase in both jobs and job seekers, a deeper dive into the data shows that the city jobs market has shrunk with jobs and job seekers dropping year-on-year to half the figures for 2017. The contraction is a result of years of Brexit related confusion that has left businesses and job seekers unwilling and unable to take risks.</p>
<p>Morgan McKinley’s data corresponds to findings by a number of groups, including IHS Markit's PMI survey which found that service sector growth ""ground almost to a halt in January"", with businesses reticent about taking any risks. BDO's Business Trends Report found that with a no-deal Brexit being the legal default outcome of the current stalemate, business confidence is ""crippled.""</p>
<p>Hakan Enver, Managing Director, Morgan McKinley Financial Services commented:</p>
<p>“We closed 2018 with a dramatically poor jobs market, because it’s become virtually impossible for businesses to grow here, so we started 2019 on the back foot. We have under half the jobs and under half the job seekers we had at this time in 2017.”</p>
<p>“The inability of the government to reach consensus on a Brexit deal has crushed confidence among City employers. Even with all the uncertainty of the last few years, there was always an assumption that come 29th March 2019, we would have some answers. Yet here we are, still waiting.”</p>
<p>“With the Brexit deadline having been extended till the 31st October—the stress on businesses is showing no sign of letting up. The government had over two years to do its homework and complete the assignment. Right before the deadline, they finally decide to try to work with the opposition to protect the people, instead of their own political power? They didn’t do the homework, they didn’t complete the assignment and now they’re asking for one extension after the other as jobs continue to flow out of London with Dublin being by far the biggest beneficiary, followed by Luxembourg, Paris, Frankfurt, and Amsterdam. It’s astonishing.”</p>
<p>“For the bigger banks, 29th  March was the deadline - there are no extensions. They have rolled out their Brexit plans and are deftly deploying staff and other resources to key EU locations. It’s the smaller firms that are now being hit hardest, as they have fewer resources with which to plan and adapt,” said Enver.</p>
<p>Britain’s bullish technology sector shows first signs of shrinking</p>
<p>Britain's technology sector—which intersects closely with the financial services sector—remains the envy of Europe, having earned £2.5 billion in new investments in 2018 according to London &amp; Partners and PitchBook. However, it also saw its lowest rate of growth in three years.</p>
<p>“Financial services and technology jobs were the crown jewels of the UK economy attracting the best and the brightest to the UK yet financial services are struggling to recruit top technology talent in the wake of Brexit. Right now, if you’re ambitious and hard working, studying and working in the UK is looking less and less like the way to get ahead,” said Enver. and ""It will take us a decade at a minimum to clean up this mess, which is why we can't afford another six months of uncertainty. And we can't afford a hard Brexit. Sadly, the government has played it in such a way that we may now end up with both,"" Enver said.</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Citi has launched CitiDirect BE® Digital Onboarding for institutional clients in Asia Pacific, introducing a completely digitized onboarding process that enables clients to open accounts in as quickly as two days.</p>
<p>Using Citi’s new digital onboarding solution, institutional clients can now complete Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements and account opening in a manner that better suits their need for speed, efficiency and flexibility. With the Asia launch, clients will also have immediate access to Citi’s suite of core online banking and payment solutions upon account opening.</p>
<p>The solution went live in Singapore and Hong Kong last week, following the launch of digital onboarding across other regions. CitiDirect BE® Digital Onboarding was first launched in the U.S. followed by six markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa in January 2019. The solution will continue be rolled out in additional markets worldwide, including in Asia, in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>The new digital solution replaces a mostly manual legacy paper-driven and courier-based documentation process and comes off the back of a global documentation rationalization program that reduced over 70% of service agreements and forms.</p>
<p>Clients can now complete their onboarding requests through a user-friendly interface on the CitiDirect BE® Digital Onboarding portal. The portal integrates the use of electronic signatures and existing data assets to complete KYC and account opening. In addition to saving time, clients will not have to interact with as many touchpoints and will be able to manage their account opening processes with greater flexibility and increased information.</p>
<p>Once in the portal, relevant data from a client’s parent entity or existing data on the client is pre-populated, allowing the client to fill in only the additional information required. Using electronic signatures and the portal’s digital document exchange feature, clients can then submit relevant documents and instructions electronically to complete an onboarding request.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of CitiDirect BE® Digital Onboarding, Asia Pacific Head of Citi’s Treasury &amp; Trade Solutions business Rajesh Mehta said, “We continue to invest in new technologies and leverage our digital capabilities to deliver an elevated client experience across our product offerings and network. As our clients manage their businesses through disruption, the need for quicker servicing is increasingly crucial. Recognizing this client need, we began by rethinking and then redesigning the client onboarding journey to introduce an optimal solution. Addressing clients’ needs, we will continue to bring new capabilities to market as we continue to make progress on digitizing our core banking capabilities, end-to-end.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – As SMEs come to terms with the need to comply with the Government’s new Making Tax Digital (MTD) initiative, growing fintech firm Countingup, the UK’s number one small business banking and accounting app, has raced past the 10,000 customer accounts milestone less than 12 months after launch.</p>
<p>Countingup’s momentum is being assisted by Making Tax Digital, a disruptive transformation of tax, which is driving SMEs’ need for simpler banking and accounting solutions. Although HMRC’s Making Tax Digital for VAT launched on April 1, 2019, a recent Research Report commissioned by HMRC revealed that 30% of the VAT mandated businesses surveyed didn’t recognise the name “Making Tax Digital”. Yet from April 2019, they will need to be filing VAT returns using a Making Tax Digital solution.</p>
<p>Countingup CEO Tim Fouracre said: “Countingup is launching Making Tax Digital-compliant VAT returns in time for the first filings for the April-June quarter, so our SMEs won’t be affected by this change. With filings for this quarter due by 7 August 2019, any business that takes up the Countingup app before that date will avoid the scare and hassle of having to change their whole approach themselves at the last minute. Joining Countingup is the simplest way for businesses to comply with the new VAT regulations without spending large sums on accounting software.”</p>
<p>The rapid growth Countingup has already achieved heralds the company’s arrival as a disruptor in the marketplace, challenging the established accounting software providers and leading business banks. Countingup has already raised £2.8 million in venture capital and is now working on the next funding round. It is also applying for a grant of £5 million from the Banking Competition Remedies Ltd (BCR) Pool D Capability and Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>Fouracre added: “These plans are made possible by our ongoing growth. Our customers have transacted more than £200 million and have already created more than 2,000 invoices. We’re delighted to have surpassed the 10,000 customer mark in under a year, considering it took Xero over two years to reach the same number, and we are continuing to push forward having now reached 12,000 customers in total.”</p>
<p>The Countingup app is primarily targeted at micro businesses: from freelancers to plumbers to gig economy workers. There are 4.3 million businesses in the UK that are just one person, which is nearly 90% of all SMEs. Countingup is not just accounting software; it’s a business current account too. As well as invoicing and automated bookkeeping, SMEs get a sort code, account number and Mastercard, all from Countingup, in one simple app.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Eight in ten CFOs (81%) say they expect the long-term business environment to be worse as a result of the UK leaving the EU, according to Deloitte’s latest CFO Survey. This is the highest level since the EU referendum in 2016.</p>
<p>The Q1 2019 CFO survey gauges sentiment amongst the UK’s largest businesses in the wake of Parliament’s rejections of Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Eighty nine CFOs participated, including CFOs of 48 FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies. The total market value of the listed companies that participated is £377 billion, approximately 15% of the UK quoted equity market. The survey ran between 26th March and 7th April, opening just after the announcement of the first delay in Brexit and covering a period that saw the failure of the House of Commons to agree a new plan and the start of Brexit talks between the Government and the Labour Party.</p>
<h4>Short-term pessimism</h4>
<p>The survey shows that pessimism about the short-term effects of Brexit remains elevated, with 49% of CFOs expecting to reduce their own capital expenditure and 22% cutting M&amp;A; as a consequence of Brexit. Around half (53%) of CFOs also expect to reduce hiring due to Brexit – the highest level in more than two years.</p>
<p>However there has been little change in confidence and risk appetite among CFOs. Of those surveyed, 13% say they are more optimistic about the prospects for their company than they were three months ago, compared to 10% in Q4 2018. In addition, 9% of CFOs now agree it is a good time to be taking greater risk onto their balance sheets, up from 7% last quarter.</p>
<p>Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: “Put mildly, it’s been a turbulent few weeks and there’s been little change in confidence and risk appetite among CFOs, as many priced in a tougher environment at the start of the year. They went into March braced for tough times and the latest round of Brexit uncertainties have not materially changed that picture. When expectations are already low, it’s harder to be disappointed.”</p>
<h4>Headwinds continue</h4>
<p>Corporates continue to face three significant pressures. First, growing economic headwinds mean that CFOs have become markedly more negative on revenue growth over the last year. Half of them (50%) now expect a decline in revenues in the next 12 months, up from 18% in Q1 2018.</p>
<p>Second, cost pressures also appear to have increased, with a record 79% of CFOs expecting operating costs to rise in the next year. Wages are likely to have impacted this, with official data showing average earnings are growing at close to their fastest pace in 11 years.</p>
<p>Third, credit conditions have become less accommodative. CFOs report that credit pricing and availability have deteriorated in the last two years. Almost a fifth of CFOs (18%) now report that credit is hard to get, up from 4% two years ago. Furthermore, 9% report credit as costly, up from 3% over the same period.</p>
<h4>Dash for cash</h4>
<p>CFOs are placing greater emphasis on cash accumulation than at any time since 2010, with 52% stating that increasing cash flow will be a strong priority over the next 12 months. This is in line with official data at the end of 2018 revealing that UK corporates held a record £747 billion of cash, equivalent to 35% of GDP and almost one third higher than in early 2016.</p>
<p>David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte North West Europe, concludes: “Large businesses are clearly looking to protect themselves against risk by raising cash levels and bullet-proofing balance sheets. They appear to be battening down hatches for tougher times ahead.</p>
<p>“While last week’s announcement on a further deferral of the UK’s departure from the EU removes an immediate unknown, the continuation of uncertainty is causing much frustration for UK businesses. As well as stashing cash, many continue to delay investment. Businesses remain in a period of further limbo.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – UK dividends jumped 15.7% in Q1 2019 to £19.7bn, easily a first quarter record, according to the latest UK Dividend Monitor from Link Asset Services. The dramatic increase was mainly influenced by very large one-off special dividends. Underlying dividends (excluding specials) by contrast grew slightly more slowly than Link expected, rising 5.5% to £17.6bn. Moreover, two-thirds of the underlying growth rate was contributed by exchange-rate effects.</p>
<p>The biggest impact came from BHP. The global mining group paid a huge £1.7bn special dividend from the proceeds of the disposal of its US shale oil interests, on top of a healthy increase in its final dividend. BHP was consequently the second largest dividend payer in Q1. Rio Tinto is following suit in the second quarter, distributing cash from the sale of its Australian coal assets.</p>
<p>The two largest-paying sectors, oil and pharmaceuticals accounted for almost two fifths of the Q1 total. Growth in these two sectors was almost entirely due to positive exchange-rate effects.</p>
<p>With the exception of a small increase from BP, the biggest companies all held their dividends flat on a constant-currency basis. Tobacco stocks, by contrast, raised their payouts substantially. Weaker sectors include telecoms, where BT cut its payout and Vodafone’s was flat in euro terms. Retail was also disappointing, with most companies holding dividends flat, but there were notable cuts from Dixons and Debenhams.</p>
<p>Top 100 dividends outperformed the mid-caps, even after special dividends and exchange rates were taken into account, reflecting a slowdown in earnings growth for companies outside the multinational superleague. After stripping out exchange rates and special dividends, top 100 payouts rose 2.6%, while mid-cap payouts fell 2.5%.</p>
<p>Yield is the expected value of dividends divided by share prices. It enables comparison between different asset classes. Despite share prices rebounding by around a tenth since January, the yield on UK shares has only dropped slightly from 10-year high in January, and now stands at 4.6% excluding special dividends. This is exceptionally attractive by historic standards, and far exceeds the yield availably on other asset classes like government bonds, property and cash.</p>
<p>Based on the slightly weaker-than-expected start to 2019, and slower growth in company earnings, Link now expects underlying growth of 3.9% this year, down from 5.3% in January. That will take underlying dividends (excluding specials) to £99.7bn, a comfortable record. The big boost from specials takes headline dividends to a record £106.1bn, smashing through the £100bn mark for the first time, an increase of 6.3% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Michael Kempe, Chief Operating Officer of Link Market Services said: “The first quarter is usually just the warm-up act for dividends, but this year it has put in a stellar performance. Miners are taking centre stage with large special dividends, but these reflect restructuring and asset sales rather than trading profits; underlying growth from this sector is now much more normal after grabbing the headlines over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>“Uncertainty abounds in markets, about the world economy, and about the outlook for the UK in the light of the turmoil surrounding Brexit. For dividends, however, we are confident that 2019 will show good growth, even if Q1 was, in truth, a touch weaker than we expected on an underlying basis.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the yield on UK shares is a third higher than its long-run average and suggests equities are still extremely cheap, both in comparison to other countries and to other asset classes. Payouts would need to fall far more than they did even during the financial crisis to bring the UK equity yield back into line with the long-run average, and we just don’t see that happening.</p>
<p>“For UK dividends this year a big unknown is the outlook for sterling, which is obviously entangled in the torturous twists and turns of the Brexit process. But over the long-term, exchange rates are just noise as losses one year are later compensated with gains. Investors focused on the fundamentals can see that UK equities provide solid income with steady growth.”</p>

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – As the International Chamber of Commerce’s (ICC) celebrates its centenary at the ICC Banking Commission Annual Meeting in Beijing from 8 – 11 April, an important milestone on the journey to achieve a globally accepted Sustainable Trade Finance framework will be reached.</p>
<p>For some time banks and corporates have been facing a growing demand, from their shareholders, customers, investors and other stakeholders, for their trade finance transactions to actively support the production of goods or services in a manner that, “minimises adverse environmental or social impact and reduces risk while also promoting environmental protection and social benefit,” says Nigel Beck, Executive and Head, Environmental and Social Risk and Finance, Standard Bank.</p>
<p>As Africa’s largest bank, operating across 20 markets on the continent, “Standard Bank is acutely aware of the bio-diversity, human rights risk and broader complexity of operating as a financial institution in an emerging or developing environment,” says Mr Beck.</p>
<p>Equally, as a global bank linking international capital to African opportunity, Standard Bank is, “alive to the pressures on global multinationals and other businesses to ‘green their supply chains’ – by meeting the growing social, economic and environmental expectations of consumers, global legislation and society,” says Vinod Madhavan, Head of Trade at Standard Bank.</p>
<p>In recognition of the central role of financial services in almost every transaction, interaction or business process, the ICC acknowledges that, “banking has an opportunity to drive global progress towards achieving ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) best practice through the development of an effective and broadly endorsed sustainable trade finance framework,” says Mr Beck.</p>
<p>To this end Standard Bank has been working with the ICC Banking Commission, co-leading a group tasked with equipping banks to encourage and finance sustainable trade practices by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Providing clarity to banks on the implementation of sustainability policy and standards through the development of guidelines on sustainable trade finance operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting industry-wide consensus on a definition for sustainable trade finance. The aim is to discourage inaccurate use of the term and to prevent ‘greenwashing,’ a practice in which trade transactions are inaccurately labeled as sustainable without any means of verifying this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring and driving the development of industry initiatives around environmental and social risks and finance provision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These goals were to be achieved across three work streams by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating guidelines for trade finance operations focusing on short-term trade finance. The guidelines will reference potential controls at the overall client as well as the individual trade finance transaction levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting a better understanding of the applicable voluntary standards, certification schemes and other approaches that can mitigate the ESG risks identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing educational and training programs for trade finance professionals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this year’s ICC gathering, “it is our job to amalgamate these three work streams into a single framework that banks can use to consistently and accurately assess trade risk while developing appropriate responses that promote sustainable trade finance,” says Mr Beck.</p>
<p>As with the Equator Principles for Project Finance which have now been adopted by over 90 banks globally, “we expect that even if only a few banks start applying ICC Best Practice in Sustainable Trade Finance initially, in a few years’ time as more banks commit to the process it will evolve into global best practice,” says Mr Beck.</p>
<p>Standard Bank’s direct involvement in assisting the ICC build an easy-to-use tool defining and enabling sustainable trade finance globally, “is part of our journey to embed our Social, Economic and Environmental (SEE) framework into our product offering, ensuring that our lending decisions and business practices evolve in a way that produces value for clients and society at large,” says Mr Beck.</p>
<p>Standard Bank’s commitment to the ICC Banking Commission’s sustainable trade finance process dovetails exactly with the aims of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 which highlights the need for trade and investment infrastructure to connect Africa. As an African bank clear in its purpose to drive Africa’s growth, partnering with the ICC to develop standards and rules in trade, in general, and universally adopted global best practice in sustainable trade finance specifically, “supports our purpose to facilitate trade and investment flows between African countries, and between African countries and global markets in a way that promotes sustainable and inclusive economic growth,” says Mr Madhavan.</p>

<p><em><strong>4<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – The Federation of European Risk Management Associations says an ISO cyber insurance guidelines is premature and inappropriate in its current form.</em></p>
<p>FERMA is concerned about the proposed standard ISO/IEC 27102 on information security management guidelines for cyber insurance. It says the proposed standard is “premature and inappropriate in its current form given the fast pace of technological development. No other insurance product is the subject of an ISO standard”.</p>
<p>FERMA members, the UK risk management association Airmic, French association AMRAE and Belgian association BELRIM, and insurance industry representatives have also expressed concerns about the project. FERMA has urged other member associations to help ensure their national standardisation body is aware of the concerns of the whole insurance market.</p>
<p>FERMA explains that ISO is currently in the final stages of approving guidelines for cyber insurance <a href=""http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001-iNIzWI9YyinKyH7TRIbjaOz-Yq4BgIhDrxz7GmKiFuZwx2z0iwlMl60aO31xy185SyDgPzQffQIkSb4zKvskPzt05BHyqzmFuN1wEr5ImYL8-jNyagMcOnK28DkPvuuuG7bo45OPl7U3eIul7fbQZDGjO06zDygqYhrN1v-_lw=&amp;c=6LEs1rMhHB-BPf2jCtqYY_IS5K7IlJwBUxM7NYiiIqyaiSM-t4u46w==&amp;ch=NGo1QqSC8z_V2PqmDzRVfpcNbnoklHZNDeChiSeNApywP21g1PC47Q=="" target=""_blank"">(ISO/IEC 27102 Information technology – Security techniques – Information security management guidelines for cyber insurance)</a>.

<p>FERMA board president Jo Willaert, said: “Cyber insurance is evolving rapidly in the face of fast technological development. Insurance buyers are working out their needs and the insurance industry is analysing how it can provide cover without unquantifiable exposures. It is too early to agree a standard.""</p>
<p>“In any case, we are not clear why a standard for cyber insurance should be intended for IT security experts. As we have consistently argued, cyber security is an enterprise risk and its management, which includes insurance, requires the involvement of risk professionals.”</p>
<p>Said Philippe Cotelle, FERMA board member: “We appreciate the importance of a well-defined scope and intention for cyber insurance, including the insurers’ information requirements, but it must be agreed by all stakeholders. FERMA, Insurance Europe and broker representatives began this process last year with the publication of <a href=""http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001F37LFJ7A3K0qy7ZpVS3Im2l616MS4U3zK674xP35QHx1b3wxAPv8dEhEAwQFfQkHeskT4P7gfOYMBcNQiwTgX6YLV3p5RxmC9Q8ujjHR17h1-ol3UvvlqtMy4qTI_GWFK02a_V8yZdmOW2ZVY979ts08mwGJM8jeGEhZ1KyGxv0=&amp;c=0VTP8IMyzCbFS9j-wdLSRG3AQlXQsB7n9h0HfsxhFkRM8V4Ui2PawQ==&amp;ch=T1XNt1nPmDlwDuVtYlZryrCp4fUUwO6moujjidIPbvTpCiU2grrYdg=="" target=""_blank"">Preparing for Cyber Insurance</a>.

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – SWIFT today publishes a new cyber report, ‘Three years on from Bangladesh: tackling the adversaries’, providing new insights into the evolving nature of the cyber threats facing the global financial community.</p>
<p>Key findings show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Four out of every five of all fraudulent transactions were issued to Beneficiary accounts in South East Asia<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approximately 70 per cent of attempted thefts were USD-based – but usage of European currencies increased</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of each individual attempted fraudulent transaction decreased dramatically – from more than USD$10m to between USD$250,000 and USD$2m</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Three years after the cyber attack on Bangladesh Bank, and the subsequent launch of SWIFT’s Customer Security Programme (CSP), SWIFT’s study of cyber attacks on banks evidences how efforts to promote robust cyber security standards, the introduction of security-enhancing tools and an increase in the scope and quality of cyber threat intelligence sharing, are paying off.</p>
<p>Based on investigations conducted over the last 15 months, the report shows how closer industry collaboration resulted in the quick identification of financial institutions targeted by cyber criminals – in most cases, before attackers were even able to generate fraudulent messages. In particular, the exchange of relevant and timely cyber threat intelligence has proved critical in effectively detecting and preventing attacks.</p>
<p>Dries Watteyne, Head of Cyber Security Incident Response Team at SWIFT, said: “SWIFT’s threat intelligence sharing has highlighted the changes to cyber criminals’ tactics, techniques and procedures used in attempted attacks, enabling industry participants to understand and respond to the increasingly sophisticated nature of cyber threats. In this report, SWIFT reveals important information about the evolving payment profile to enable more accurate detection through business indicators. It is encouraging that detection rates of attempted attacks are increasing, but we need to be mindful that malicious actors adapt rapidly. The industry must continuously strengthen and diversify its defences, investigate incidents and share information.”</p>
<p>Brett Lancaster, Head of Customer Security, said: “These cases show how SWIFT solutions including our Daily Validation Reports tool, our Payment Controls Service and the gpi Stop and Recall facility can all have real, positive impact. They also evidence the importance of implementing security controls and of understanding and mitigating against cyber risks presented by counterparties. This is why more and more customers are turning to SWIFT’s KYC-Security Attestation utility to consume that information.”</p>
<p>The report also reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extended reconnaissance periods: attackers continue to operate ‘silently’ for weeks or months after penetrating a target, learning behaviours and patterns before launching an attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timings are shifting: malicious actors previously favoured issuing fraudulent payments outside business hours to avoid detection but have more recently turned this approach on its head, acting during business hours to blend in with legitimate traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New payment corridors: the vast majority of fraudulent transactions investigated over the past 15 months used payment corridors (combinations of target and beneficiary banks) that had not been used during the previous 24 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The report recommends the:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development of new defensive measures: the development and deployment of security-enhancing innovations will help thwart cyber thieves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase of information sharing: the more information the community shares and the frequency with which it shares, the better chance of avoiding or fending off an attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adherence to robust cyber security standards: ensuring strict adherence to strong standards and implementing controls is key to prevention and detection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumption of counterparty cyber security data: users should incorporate the assessment of counterparties’ attestation data against SWIFT’s Customer Security Controls Framework into their risk management and business decision-making processes.</p>
</li>

<p>Once attackers have successfully compromised a Target bank, they will often attempt to issue fraudulent instructions to Beneficiary accounts at other banks overseas. These Beneficiary accounts are also known as “mule” accounts and are the accounts through which any fraudulently obtained funds may be obtained. <a href=""#fnref:1"" rev=""footnote"">↩</a></p>

<p><strong>9<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – The Chartered Institute of Credit Management (<a href=""http://www.cicm.com/"" target=""_blank"">CICM</a>) and The European Freight Trade Association (EFTA) are claiming victory after Companies House added a warning to its website that the information available on its site has not been independently verified.</p>
<p>Philip King, the Chief Executive of the CICM, the world’s largest recognised professional credit management body, and James Campbell, Secretary of The European Freight Transport Association (EFTA) succeeded in their representations to Companies House to challenge the alarming increase in short-firm fraud, when companies file deliberately false accounts and use credit to fraudulently obtain goods that are delivered to third-party addresses.</p>
<p>Companies House has now taken steps to display a more prominent warning throughout its website regarding the efficacy and accuracy of the information it holds, confirming that such information has not been verified. Companies House has also created a dedicated email through which businesses can raise concerns over bogus accounts <a href=""mailto:leintel@companieshouse.gov.uk"">leintel@companieshouse.gov.uk</a></p>
<p>Philip King says he is delighted with the way that Companies House has responded to their approaches: “We raised the issue, they listened to us, and they have taken action, and they should be commended for it.</p>
<p>“Credit managers use information at Companies House on which to base risk decisions, and need to be aware that the information cannot always be trusted. Companies House data is useful as one part of the decision-making process when it comes to granting credit, but should never be relied upon as the only source of information.”</p>
<p>Short-term fraud is closely associated with long-term fraud. With the former, there is no attempt to establish a credit history before a fraud is attempted. Bogus accounts are simply filed at Companies House to obtain glowing credit reference agency recommendations to be used to trick unsuspecting businesses to supply goods and services on credit with no chance of their being paid.</p>
<p>With the latter, the criminals set up an apparently legitimate business intending to defraud its suppliers and customers. The business buys goods and pays suppliers promptly to secure a good credit record before executing its ‘sting’, sometimes taking companies for many tens of thousands of pounds that they cannot recover.</p>

<p><strong>9<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> today announced the first public hackathon on its <a href=""https://www.fusionfabric.cloud/"" target=""_blank"">FusionFabric.cloud</a> open development platform, underpinned by Microsoft Azure. The FusionONE Hackathon will take place over the weekend of May 17-19 in London. Teams from banks, Fintechs, integrators and independent developers are invited to join the event and create innovations grounded in Open Banking. Mentors from Microsoft, Accenture and VC INNOVATIONS (the company behind <a href=""https://www.fintechtalents.com/"" target=""_blank"">FinTECHTalents</a>) will be on site to support the participating teams and will be part of the judging panel to select the winners.</p>
<p>Teams will be granted access to Finastra’s Open APIs – providing a window to Finastra’s core solutions, and allowing them to build new capabilities on top of trusted systems already in use at hundreds of banks globally. Using FusionFabric.cloud’s rapid development environment and integrated API management tools, teams are invited to create new solutions in one of five challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong> – apps for the next generation of financial services customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine learning insights</strong> – apps to better serve customer needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data visualization</strong> – displaying results, recommendations and learning intuitively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inclusion</strong> – building a more inclusive financial ecosystem for customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainable finance</strong> – promoting financial well-being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once fully tested, successful apps will be made available to banks through Finastra’s FusionStore – an online marketplace for banks to search for and consume applications.</p>
<p>“The FusionONE Hackathon will encourage teams to collaborate and co-innovate in building the next generation of financial applications – with a particular focus on areas that will make a real difference to people’s lives, such as customer engagement, financial inclusion and sustainable finance,” said Eli Rosner, Chief Product and Technology Officer, Finastra. “Running the event over 48 hours reflects how a platform-based approach can accelerate innovation in financial services and allow banks to rapidly deliver new products and services that evolve in line with changing customer needs.”</p>
<p>Eric Boyd, CVP, Azure AI, Microsoft, said, “With initiatives such as Open Banking and PSD2 spurring increased competition and innovation in financial services, this hackathon gives participating teams a fantastic opportunity to showcase their ideas and build prototypes. The use of APIs and cloud platforms is crucial in changing the way banks deploy new applications and engage with a new generation of developers that can help them innovate from the outside-in.”</p>
<p>Gareth Wilson, global Payments lead for Accenture, said, “We are thrilled to be working with Finastra to bring together the industry and ensure technology is at the heart of change in financial services. Open Banking is still at the start of its revolution, and it’s vital we keep building an ecosystem of partners to transform the banking landscape for consumers. We are delighted to be supporting FusionONE and look forward to seeing the next generation of ideas come to life.”</p>
<p>The FusionONE Hackathon is a pre-cursor to the <a href=""http://www.fusionone.cloud/"" target=""_blank"">FusionONE</a> open API developer conference, May 21-22 in London – four of the best apps at the hackathon will then pitch live on stage at FusionONE for the crown.</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Air exports of Land Vehicles &amp; Parts, Capital Equipment &amp; Machinery and Industrial Raw Materials will be the main contributor to sustained trade growth in Japan, according to data from the DHL Global Trade Barometer released by DHL, the world's leading logistics company.</p>
<p>The DHL Global Trade Barometer, an early indicator of global trade developments calculated using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, shows that Japan's trade growth is revealing a slight downward trend with an overall index of 57 points, two points below last quarter. However, the climate remains positive as the country's highest-growth sectors – Land Vehicles &amp; Parts as well as Capital Equipment &amp; Machinery – are set to drive up volumes in Japanese air exports in the coming quarter. Imports from both air and ocean shipments are also expected to bloom, especially with sectors like Consumer Fashion Goods and Personal Household Goods.</p>
<p>""While growth is moderately reducing in pace, Japan is still a very stable and mature economy with a balanced import-export market,"" said Charles Kaufmann, CEO North Asia South Pacific, DHL Global Forwarding. ""This quarter's results reveal an interesting shift towards higher domestic consumption, the result of a planned sales tax hike in October to protect the country's growth momentum.""<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> A slight decrease in automobile exports via ocean shipments also suggest changing consumer habits globally with regards to ride-sharing and car ownership, especially amongst the young.<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> Nevertheless, Japan's economic growth is projected to accelerate this year due to solid investment in infrastructure related to the Rugby World Cup in the later part of 2019 and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games,<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> evident in the robust trade of Basic and Industrial Raw Materials. In a climate typified by uncertainty in trade terms, Japan's moderate but consistent economic growth continues to signal positivity for businesses.""</p>
<p>The Barometer's results also suggest that global trade growth looks set to slow down over the next three months, signaling only a slight growth. However, the top three nations with the highest indexes are located in Asia, namely India, Japan, and China. Indices for all seven countries that constitute the Global Trade Barometer index – including the US, UK and Germany – are above 50 points except for South Korea. In the Global Trade Barometer methodology, an index value above 50 indicates positive growth, while values below 50 indicate contraction.</p>
<p>Launched in January 2018, the DHL Global Trade Barometer is an innovative and unique early indicator for the current state and future development of global trade. It is based on large amounts of logistics data that are evaluated with the help of artificial intelligence. In order to make this valuable data accessible for academic research and to increase the macroeconomic significance of the indicator, DHL recently entered into research cooperation with Eswar S. Prasad, Professor of Trade Policy and Economics at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, USA. The indicator is published four times a year and the next release date is scheduled for June 2019.</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – Chinese trade is forecasted to grow with an overall index of 56 despite the speed of growth slowing down, according to data from the DHL Global Trade Barometer released by DHL, the world's leading logistics company.</p>
<p>The DHL Global Trade Barometer, an early indicator of global trade developments calculated using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, suggests that China's air imports of Machinery Parts, Chemicals &amp; Products, and Temperature or Climate Controlled goods will be the biggest near-term contributor to trade growth. While air exports are expected to stagnate, ocean exports will grow for sectors like Machinery Parts, Industrial Raw Materials and Personal &amp; Household Goods. Both air and ocean shipment volumes have decreased by 3 and 1 points respectively, but overall trade is still expected to remain stable with no decline for the next three months.</p>
<p>""Despite potential softening in some industries, Chinese trade continues to grow steadily as it pursues new trade opportunities along the Belt and Road, the most recent being the 29-deal memorandum of understanding signed with Italy worth US$2.8 billion,<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>"" said Steve Huang, CEO, DHL Global Forwarding Greater China. ""This latest development highlights that despite pessimistic economic and political rhetoric surrounding China's economy, the country's trade continues to maintain momentum as it improves connectivity, deepens the cooperation in logistics networks, and simplifies market access between Asia and Europe.""</p>
<p>The Barometer's results also suggest that global trade growth looks set to slow down over the next three months, signaling only a slight growth. However, the top three nations with the highest indexes are all in Asia, namely India, Japan, and China. Indices for all seven countries that constitute the Global Trade Barometer index – including the US, UK and Germany – are above 50 points except for South Korea.

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> April 2019</strong> – India's pace of growth looks set to remain the highest of the world's largest economies despite a decrease in both air and ocean trade growth, according to data from the DHL Global Trade Barometer released by DHL, the world's leading logistics company.</p>
<p>The DHL Global Trade Barometer, an early indicator of global trade developments calculated using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, revealed that India's trade growth outlook – coming in at 59 points on the Index – will be driven primarily by an uptake in both imports and exports of Personal Household Goods, Temperature or Climate Controlled Goods and Land Vehicles &amp; Parts, which increased in index points by 19, 16 and 2 respectively. However, India's ocean trade dropped sharply by almost 20 points to 63, while air trade is also expected to stagnate in the coming quarter.</p>
<p>""India has not been immune to the current global economic climate, but businesses operating in the country can afford to remain positive: despite increasing headwinds, India has managed to maintain the highest predicted trade growth of all the GTB countries,"" said Kevin Leung, CEO, Global Forwarding Asia Pacific. ""With its annual GDP growth rate still running at an impressive 7.5%, India remains somewhat insulated from global trade volatility thanks to high domestic private consumption, which accounts for 60% of the country's GDP and is expected to generate up to $6 trillion in opportunities for growth.<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> It's no surprise that the Personal Household Goods sector is seeing a steady increase on the ocean import side, while a decrease in air exports of Consumer Fashion Goods appears to have been largely offset by high domestic consumption.""</p>
<p>The Barometer's results also suggest that global trade growth looks set to slow down over the next three months, signaling only a slight growth. However, the top three nations with the highest indexes are all in Asia, namely India, Japan, and China. Indices for all seven countries that constitute the Global Trade Barometer index – including the US, UK and Germany – are above 50 points except for South Korea. In the Global Trade Barometer methodology, an index value above 50 indicates positive growth, while values below 50 indicate contraction.</p>
<p>Launched in January 2018, the DHL Global Trade Barometer is an innovative and unique early indicator for the current state and future development of global trade. It is based on large amounts of logistics data that are evaluated with the help of artificial intelligence. In order to make this valuable data accessible for academic research and to increase the macroeconomic significance of the indicator, DHL recently entered into research cooperation with Eswar S. Prasad, Professor of Trade Policy and Economics at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, USA. The indicator is published four times a year and the next release date is scheduled for June 2019.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> April 2019</strong> – A Frost &amp; Sullivan study commissioned by Microsoft found that a cyberattack can cost a large manufacturing organization in Asia Pacific an average of US$10.7 million in economic loss with customer churn being the largest economic consequence of a cyber breach, resulting in US$8.1 million of indirect cost. For mid-sized manufacturing organization, the average economic loss was US$38,000. Furthermore, cybersecurity incidents have also led to job losses across different functions in more than three out of five (63%) manufacturing organizations.</p>
<p>While the impact of data vulnerabilities and breaches can be costly and damaging to the manufacturing organizations, its supply chain and consumers, the study uncovered that half (51%) of the manufacturing organizations in Asia Pacific had either experienced a security incident or were not sure if they had had a security incident as they had not performed proper forensics or data breach assessment.</p>
<p>The study further revealed that instead of accelerating digital transformation to bolster their cybersecurity strategy to defend against future cyberattacks, almost three in five (59%) manufacturing organizations across Asia Pacific had delayed the progress of digital transformation projects due to the fear of cyberattacks. Delaying digital transformation not only limits the capabilities of manufacturing organizations to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats but also prevents them from leveraging advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, and the Internet of Things (IoT), to dramatically increase productivity, empower their workforce and deliver new service lines.</p>
<p>These findings are part of “Understanding the Cybersecurity Threat Landscape in Asia Pacific: Securing the Modern Enterprise in a Digital World” study launched in May 2018. The findings aim to provide business and IT decision makers in the manufacturing sector with insights on the economic cost of cyberattacks and to help to identify any gaps in their cybersecurity strategies.</p>
<p>The initial study surveyed a total of 1,300 business and IT decision makers ranging from mid-sized organizations (250 to 499 employees) to large-sized organizations (&gt;than 500 employees), of which 18% belong to the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>In calculating the cost of cyberattacks, Frost &amp; Sullivan created an economic loss model based on the insights shared by the respondents. This model factors in two kinds of losses which could result from a cybersecurity breach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct:</strong> Financial losses associated with a cybersecurity incident including loss of productivity, fines, remediation cost, etc; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indirect:</strong> The opportunity cost to the organization such as customer churn due to reputational damage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“The frequency and severity of cyberattacks targeting manufacturing organizations have increased significantly in recent years, underscoring the need to protect the ever-growing volume of data generated by and made available to manufacturing organizations,” said Kenny Yeo, Industry Principal, Cyber Security, Frost &amp; Sullivan. “By integrating security into every digital process and physical devices, manufacturing organizations can not only mitigate the loss of intellectual property (IP) and customer data but also minimize downtime as well as remediation cost resulting from cyber-attacks.”</p>
<h4>Key Cyberthreats and Gaps in Manufacturing Organizations' Cybersecurity Approaches</h4>
<p>For manufacturing organizations that have encountered a security incident, data exfiltration, ransomware and remote code execution are the biggest concern as these threats have the highest impact and often result in the slowest recovery time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote code execution</strong> is a unique threat that manufacturing organizations face, and it poses a grave threat to these companies as cybercriminals can remotely access and control their operations. This allows malicious actors to disrupt production and sabotage the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As manufacturing organizations need to adhere to tight schedules and strict deadlines, a ransomware attack – where cybercriminals encrypt files to restrict users' access until a ransom is paid – can lead to production downtime and loss of customer confidence. Manufacturing organizations not only lose time and resources in dealing with the aftermath of the attack, but the entire supply chain will also be disrupted too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from external threats, the study also uncovered several key cybersecurity gaps in manufacturing organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Complex security environment impeding recovery time:</strong> Contrary to the common notion that more security solutions will lead to greater efficiency, a large portfolio of cybersecurity solutions may not be a good approach to bolster cybersecurity. The complexity of managing a large portfolio of cybersecurity solutions may lead to longer recovery time from cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The study showed that nearly three in five (57%) manufacturing organizations with 26 to 50 cybersecurity solutions took more than a day to recover from cyberattacks. Conversely, only 26% of organizations with less than 10 solutions took more than a day to recover. In fact, 35% of them managed to recover from a security incident within an hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traditional tactical viewpoint towards cybersecurity:</strong> Despite the growing sophistication and impact of cyberattacks, the study revealed that majority of the respondents (41%) hold a tactical view of cybersecurity – “only” to safeguard the organization against cyberattacks. While only one in five (19%) viewed cybersecurity as a business differentiator and an enabler for digital transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security as an afterthought:</strong> If cybersecurity is not seen as an enabler for digital transformation, it will undermine manufacturing organizations' ability to build a “secure-by-design” digital project, leading to increased vulnerabilities and risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The study revealed that only 26% of manufacturing organizations who had encountered cyberthreats considered a cybersecurity strategy prior to initiating a digital transformation project. The remaining respondents either thought about cybersecurity only after the commencement of their digital transformation projects or did not think about cybersecurity at all.</p>
<p>“Technology advances and innovations in intelligent manufacturing are delivering game-changing breakthroughs for leading businesses in every sector,” said Scott Hunter, Regional Business Lead, Manufacturing, Microsoft Asia. “As manufacturing organizations focus on increasing data-driven products and services to differentiate themselves in the global economy, building and maintaining trust within their ecosystem of partners and customers becomes an even bigger priority.”</p>
<p>“Cyber attackers are constantly looking for opportunities, so the more businesses know about their techniques and tradecraft, the better prepared they will be to build defenses and respond quickly. Building organizational resilience and reducing risk by adopting a security approach that includes prevention, detection and response can make a huge difference in the overall cybersecurity health of a manufacturing organization,” he added.</p>
<h4>Bolstering Cybersecurity Using Artifical Intelligence</h4>
<p>AI plays a critical role in manufacturing organizations as they increasingly rely on machine learning automation to increase their efficiency and output by scale while reducing cost and downtime through predictive maintenance. AI is also a powerful tool that can enable manufacturing organizations to defend themselves against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. The study revealed that 67% of manufacturing organizations in Asia Pacific have either adopted or are considering an AI-based approach to improve their security posture.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity solutions that are augmented with AI and machine learning capabilities can autonomously learn what is normal behavior for connected devices on the organization's network, and swiftly identify cyberthreats at scale through the detection of behavioral anomalies. Cybersecurity teams can also put in place rules that block or quarantine devices that are not behaving as expected before they can potentially damage the environment. These AI-powered cybersecurity engines enable manufacturing organizations to address one of their largest and most complex security challenges as they integrate thousands or even millions of IoT devices into their information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) environments.</p>

These project will be developed and owned by Sunseap Commercial Assets Pte. Ltd., a subsidiary of Sunseap Group (Sunseap).</p>
<p>These rooftop solar projects in Singapore will range from approximately 100kW to 5MW in size, and will benefit from long-term Power Purchase Agreements with more than 20 international and domestic commercial and industrial corporates such as PSA.</p>
<p>Rooftop solar projects, which tend to be individually small-scale and therefore uneconomical to finance separately, are generally funded on a guaranteed basis. “But in this case we have created an innovative structure to finance this portfolio of rooftop solar projects on a limited-recourse<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> basis and in a single loan facility. The financing is expected to help different industries in Singapore – from education to transportation to technology – offset their carbon footprint,” said Erwin Maspolim, Asia Pacific Head of Utilities, Power and Renewables, ING.</p>
<p>Mr Lawrence Wu, President and Executive Director, Sunseap Group, said, “We are proud to be the first renewable energy company in ASEAN to secure a green loan. ING’s financing will enable us to continue generating clean energy to benefit a diverse range of clients.”</p>
<h4>Facility aligned with Sunseap Green Finance Framework</h4>
<p>This S$50 million loan is on the back of a green finance framework created for Sunseap, for which ING acted as the Green Structuring Advisor. The framework is aligned to a number of global principles.<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Under this framework, Sunseap and its subsidiaries will be able to raise green financing instruments (including green loans, green bonds or other debt instruments) to finance or refinance green projects in three eligible areas: renewable energy, energy efficiency and green roof systems. These can include renewable projects including rooftop solar, run-of-river hydro and wind energy; energy efficiency projects for example smart grids, battery storage and LED lighting retrofits, as well as roof-top greenery projects.</p>
<p>Sustainalytics, a leading global provider of ESG research and ratings, was asked to provide a second party opinion on Sunseap’s Green Finance Framework. Sustainalytics’ report concluded that the framework is credible and impactful, and contributes to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7: Affordable and Clean Energy and 11: Sustainable cities and Communities.</p>
<p>Herry Cho, Head of Sustainable Finance for Asia-Pacific, ING, commented, “ING is honoured to partner with Sunseap on this market leading transaction, and we expect this deal to spark off more demand for Green Loan Principles-compliant loans in the renewable energy sector.”</p>
<p>Financing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects is crucial for countries in the Asia-Pacific region. It is estimated that by 2025, ASEAN countries will be home to over 715 million people<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup>, many of whom currently still lack access to modern energy services. Renewables can play a key role in ensuring clean and affordable energy for people across the region.</p>
<p>ING recently became the first global bank to use a science-based approach to steer its business strategy towards meeting the temperature targets set by the Paris Climate Agreement. This initiative, called the Terra Approach, enables ING to measure the bank’s lending portfolio against climate-based scenarios. ING will focus specifically on the sectors that are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions using a customised approach per sector in order to make the most impact.</p>
<p>“Energy is one of the key sectors for ING, and supporting renewable energy projects is clearly aligned with the goals for our Terra Approach,” Herry concluded.</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Citi, in partnership with Imperial College Business School has launched its latest Digital Money Index<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. The index, now in its sixth year, tracks 84 countries in terms of their development of digital money readiness.</p>
<p>For the first time, the report compares historical data collated over the last five years, rather than year on year, concluding a 5.5% improvement in overall digital money readiness for the 84 countries tracked.</p>
<p>Naveed Sultan, Global Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, commented: “The benefits of digital money have long been apparent and well-articulated by Citi. Increasingly, there is clear evidence that countries are recognizing the potential gains offered by digital money. We are delighted to be working with Imperial on the next edition of the index, and believe that this data and associated case studies provide truly valuable information and reflect Citi’s approach to collaborate with academia, policy makers and regulators to advance the financial infrastructure around the world to be compatible with today’s increasingly digital economy.”</p>
<p>The index groups countries into four clusters of digital money readiness – incipient, emerging, in-transition and materially ready. Although substantial improvements can be seen for each cluster over the past five years, the report highlights that the biggest shift has come from the incipient and in-transition countries, showing a higher than average increase in readiness.</p>
<p>Naveed Sultan, who also Chairs the Advisory Board for Imperial’s Centre for Global Finance and Technology at Imperial College Business School continued: “The index has shown that countries at an earlier stage of readiness typically face challenges relating to lack of financial and communications infrastructure, as well as access to basic financial services. Those that are more mature face challenges relating to availability and adoption of digital money solutions.”</p>
<p>Of the total number of countries in the index, this year’s report concludes that 18 countries (~22%) have advanced from one cluster to the next over the last five years, reflecting the increase in digital readiness. Countries that have advanced in to the next cluster have addressed typical bottlenecks characteristic of their peers. This shift in clusters has resulted in 50% more materially ready countries in 2019 and a 20% reduction in the number of countries in the incipient cluster.</p>
<p>Andrei Kirilenko, Director of the Centre for Global Finance and Technology at Imperial College Business School said: “For the first time in the Index’s six year history, we’ve been able to track changes across the time period, highlighting trends which are more cumulative than annual. This is reflective of how digital transformation actually works, while illustrating key bottlenecks. This information is tremendously valuable to policymakers from incipient and in-transition economies”.</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> April 2019</strong> – Deutsche Bank has appointed Sandra Hack as Global Head of Structured Commodity Trade Finance. Sandra Hack takes over from John (Mac) MacNamara who set up the original desk in 1999 and has been appointed Vice Chairman, Trade Finance Commodities. In this newly created role he will be responsible for the commodities strategy of Trade Finance &amp; Lending and key relationships on the client and investor side of the business. Mac continues to lead the Commodity Trade Finance business. Sandra and Mac will report to Daniel Schmand, Global Head of Trade Finance.</p>
<p>Sandra Hack joined Deutsche Bank in 1993 and held senior roles in Corporate and Investment Banking, Relationship Management and Credit Risk Management in Asia, in the UK, and Germany. Since 2011 she has been heading Credit Risk Management Workout &amp; Recovery Management EMEA, playing a vital role in de-risking critical client relationships. Sandra continuous to be based in Berlin.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank’s Structured Commodity Trade Finance is an award-winning franchise targeting financing for commodity corporates (producers, traders, processors, including midstream and downstream) structured around their trade flows and/or physical collateral, and focussing on the larger, big ticket syndicated transactions.</p>
<p>“There’s a cycle in commodities which, at the bottom, can put stress on some commodity companies even before extraneous factors like political risk come into play,” notes Hack. “Over the last years I have seen how Structured Commodity Finance solutions can work successfully under these stressed scenarios, which has made me an SCTF fan. I’m very excited to be entrusted with leading this experienced global team into its next growth phase.”</p>
<p>John MacNamara adds, “Over the years I’ve seen Sandra in very successful action in both emerging and developed markets in what were some very challenging situations, working with some of our most important clients. She is a natural fit for this business and has a very good feel for what works and what might not. She’s also a great professional when it comes to achieving consensus between banks and clients in this syndicated end of this market. No secret that we’ve been trying to get her to come across to Structured Commodity Trade Finance for years.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> April 2019</strong> – PRETA launched today the onboarding process for the Open Banking Europe (OBE) directory, a pan-European, centralised and machine-readable repository for active regulated entities that can perform access-to-account (XS2A) services across Europe. The directory is open to Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (AS-PSPs) and their service providers. It provides these providers with a key element for establishing compliance with the Access-to-Account requirements of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).</p>
<p>Aside from pooling the information provided by the different national registers, the directory will also contain additional operational information to help provide some transparency to Third Party Providers (TPPs) and AS-PSPs, especially with regard to cases where brand names differ from those of the legal entities that are actually accessing the account.</p>
<p>Following a stakeholder consultation started in 2016, PRETA developed the Directory of Open Banking Europe with the support of more than 40 AS-PSPs and Service Providers (SPs) to help the market in its PSD2 Access-to-Account compliance processes by providing a standardised source of information containing both regulatory and operational data.</p>
<p>The directory was delivered in January 2019 and today covers all the national registers that are currently available for verification requests, with the remainder to be added as soon as the respective national transpositions have been completed.</p>
<p>“The completion of this work marks a major milestone in the journey towards PSD2, and it has only been possible with the support of over 40 participants around Europe as well as ongoing dialogue with National Competent Authorities across Europe.</p>
<p>The road to PSD2 Access to Account is long and a centralised directory will provide interoperability between the various market participants.” said John Broxis, Managing Director of PRETA/Open Banking Europe.</p>
<p>Open Banking Europe continues to work in other topics such as: operational data to provide transparency to TPPs, QTSP engagement group, common understanding of eIDAS certificates, identification when four party models are used, the security and identification model for PSD2 APIs.</p>

<p><strong>1<sup>st</sup> April 2019</strong> – <a href=""http://www.icdportal.com/"" target=""_blank"">ICD</a>, the leading independent trading and investment risk management platform, today announced 28% growth in investment assets last year, widely outpacing the .02% market increase in institutional money market fund use. Fueling this growth, the company increased its client base by 20%, many of which came from Fortune 500 and FTSE 350 companies. ICD growth was not only driven by net new assets, but by existing clients increasing their investment through the ICD Portal, with average client assets on the portal increasing by 12% YOY.</p>
<p>ICD CEO Tory Hazard attributed the strong client growth to CFOs, Treasurers and corporate investment professionals seeking a secure, centralized investment platform, deeply integrated into their treasury technology environment. Growth was further fueled by corporate treasury organizations focusing on yield, moving funds out of low-return bank deposit products into higher-yielding money market funds. Another theme among new and existing clients was a move longer out on the maturity curve, with renewed interest in Prime Funds and Short Duration Bond Funds versus traditional government-backed products.</p>
<p>“We could not be happier with the response from our clients and the corporate treasury community as a whole,” Hazard said. “This past year was a testament to the movement that we recognized over 16 years ago when ICD’s journey began. Treasury professionals want an independent investment and risk management solution that offers a wide selection of investment options on a secure platform, wrapped in a global support infrastructure. The market shift away from biased bank portals and concentrated bank deposits seems to be increasing, and fund companies want to offer their investment products in a neutral marketplace. ICD is committed to continuing investment in personnel and technology and support infrastructure to meet the needs of our expanding client base.”</p>
<p>Additional 2018 highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>99.6% Client Retention Rate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25% Employee Growth</p>

<li>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> April 2019</strong> – PRETA S.A.S. announced today that payment transactions for a total value of over EUR 10 billion have been initiated via MyBank since the launch of the pan-European e-authorisation solution in March 2013. While it took just under five years to reach the EUR 5 billion milestone, the value doubled within less than a year. On average more than EUR 14.5 million are transacted via MyBank every day.</p>
<p>MyBank is gaining ground across the EU and is widely used for transactions in business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and public administration contexts. The pan-European solution enables the initiation of secure online-banking based payments with no set amount limit1.</p>
<p>The MyBank value proposition fully responds to market needs: it provides businesses and consumers with a safe online payment solution directly from their online or mobile banking without disclosing any account details to third parties. MyBank helps merchants to protect their customers’ data while increasing the average ticket and expand their business cross-border.</p>
<p>The solution supports public administrations in their digitalisation efforts by providing their citizens with an easy-to-use and safe way to make paperless payments.</p>
<p>Its ease of access and convenience also make MyBank an ideal tool for merchants and customers that are not – or less – familiar with the digital processes to easily collect and send money.</p>
<p>“Reaching the EUR 10 billion mark is a major milestone in the development of MyBank. The frictionless user experience, the protection of the digital identity of its users and the real-time confirmation of the irrevocable transaction make MyBank a trusted solution for all stakeholders involved in the transaction process,” said Tarik Zerkti, Managing Director of PRETA S.A.S., the company that owns and manages MyBank.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>1<sup>st</sup> April 2019</strong> – 14 leading global financial institutions have launched a drive to use technology and standardisation for the wider distribution of trade finance assets.</p>
<p>ANZ, Crédit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ING, Lloyds Bank, Rabobank, Standard Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are among the banks backing the <a href=""http://www.tradefinancedistribution.com/"" target=""_blank"">Trade Finance Distribution Initiative</a> (TFD Initiative).</p>
<p>TFD Initiative is powered by Tradeteq, the global trade finance distribution platform. Tradeteq’s technology allows banks and institutional investors to efficiently connect, interact, and transact.</p>
<p>The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) United Kingdom and the International Trade and Forfaiting Association (ITFA), the leading international association for banks and financial institutions involved in cross-border trade and forfaiting, have each joined TFD Initiative as an observer.</p>
<p>Trade finance is private financing that helps businesses cover mismatches between payment obligations and payment receipts resulting from the buying and selling of goods and services. It is a vital piece of the financial sector that supports importers and exporters as they conduct their trade activities.</p>
<p>Trade finance presents a compelling multi-trillion dollar investment opportunity for institutional investors seeking sources of attractive risk-adjusted returns with low correlation to stocks or bonds. TFD Initiative will initially focus on creating common data standards and definitions to enhance operational efficiency and improve risk management, creating a blueprint for global trade finance asset distribution.</p>
<p>Surath Sengupta, Global Head of Trade Portfolio Management at HSBC said: “As the world’s number one trade finance bank[1], HSBC is at the forefront of the industry in harnessing the power of new technologies to make trade faster, safer and more competitive.  While trade finance is currently an attractive asset class for banks, we believe technology will unlock investment from non-bank investors by removing complexity and making the underlying asset data both more structured and accessible.”</p>
<p>Nicolas Langlois, Managing Director and Global Head of Trade Distribution &amp; Liability and RWA Optimization CSDG &amp; Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered Bank, commented: “Closing the financing gap in trade finance is about providing financing to small and medium sized enterprises. This requires developing new digital solutions to package those portfolios in a standardised format accepted by a broad range of investors and to achieve speed of execution.”</p>
<p>ANZ’s Damian Kwok, Head of Trade Portfolio Management and Head of Trade and Supply Chain, Australia, New Zealand, Pacific, observed: “Trade Finance is the lifeblood that is needed to support businesses and enable them to thrive in our communities.  Therefore, it is imperative that the financing community continues to work together to support the growing requirements.”</p>
<p>Anthony van Vliet, Global Head of Trade &amp; Commodity Finance at ING, said: “In Trade &amp; Commodity Finance, it’s all about connecting global supply chains in food, energy and industrial activities. By bundling the expertise of global banks, the TFD Initiative bridges the gap between the US dollar-dominated commodity trade finance sector, and institutional investors who are not traditionally engaged in this part of the real economy.”</p>
<p>Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation’s Kazuo Yoshimura, General Manager, Global Head of Supply Chain Finance, Global Trade Finance Departmentadded; “Trade growth is vital for continued economic growth and global development. Bringing alternative investors into trade finance will provide additional funding to corporates globally. It is, therefore, that SMBC welcomes the Trade Finance Distribution Initiative as a playing a crucial role in establishing trade finance as an asset class.”</p>
<p>Naeem Khan, Global Head of Trade Finance at Crédit Agricole CIB said: “We anticipate growing needs in terms of automation of the trade finance distribution market which will enhance investors’ reach and bring distribution efficiency. This is a key step in the right direction to facilitate global trade finance market growth.”</p>
<p>Shaahien Mottiar, Head of Trade: Southern &amp; Central Africa and Head of Trade Asset Management at Standard Bank, said: “The application of technology is now enabling the involvement of non-traditional trade participants and investors. The TFD Initiative is a catalyst in driving the growing modernisation of trade and trade finance, and in developing an asset class directly connected to real economy transactions. For developing markets this means bridging the gap between perceived and real risks, and in-turn, creating opportunities for renewed sustainable growth and development.”</p>
<p>Sean Edwards, Chairman of ITFA, Head of Legal and Special Adviser to the Global Trade Finance Department at SMBC Europe, said: “Distribution of trade risk was once simple but, with the introduction of more stringent regulatory requirements and capital rules, has become more difficult to achieve efficiently. Technology offers the greatest opportunity to overcome these challenges and also brings in a potential new source of liquidity in the shape of new non-bank investors.”</p>
<p>“I believe the TFD Initiative offers the opportunity to create a global network for trade originators and liquidity providers to connect, interact and transact efficiently, thereby establishing trade finance as an easily accessible and attractive asset class for non-bank institutional investors,” concluded André Casterman, Board Member at Tradeteq.</p>

<p>COBI (Corporate and Government Bond Intelligence) is a comprehensive suite of Overbond algorithms and analytics tools that systematically price bonds and identify trade ideas across global fixed income market. COBI-Matching is an advanced AI algorithm family which makes ongoing observations of investor behavior, buying-patterns and rebalancing events. COBI-Matching identifies a set of traditional and non-traditional bond buyers, focusing on sector concentration, cross-currency classifications, credit rating profile and buying patterns. A variety of pre-processed data inputs flow into COBI-Matching algorithm, to generate best-fit bond buyer recommendations. Algorithms analyze more than 2,900 investor portfolios and rank investors’ interest based on their existing holdings and quarterly rebalancing.</p>
<p>“We are excited to offer enhanced liquidity sourcing to our buy-side clients and well as global issuers and dealer underwriters” says Vuk Magdelinic, CEO of Overbond. “Issuers or dealer underwriters now can systematically identify non-traditional liquidity pools and investors can benchmark their portfolio rebalancing decisions”.</p>
<p>Surviving next major liquidity crisis will not be as simple as merely selecting quality defensive bonds. In a market with no liquidity, price performance can be volatile and indiscriminate of credit fundamentals. COBI-Matching helps insulate investors from liquidity risk by providing robust pre-trade analytics and benchmarking. Issuers and dealer underwriters on the other hand can achieve investor diversification and liquidity benefits.</p>
<p>New algorithmic recommendations, including trade ideas, pricing tension and buyer preferences are made available to Overbond clients through its platform for front-end visualizations. Overbond also offers digital investor engagement software module that can seamlessly intake and benchmark investor preferences and appetite across large universe of comparable portfolios.</p>

<p><em><strong>19<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – NatWest is to launch a centralised virtual account management platform for SME and corporate customers servicing multiple accounts.</em></p>
<p>The new platform, developed with Nordic software house Tieto, will support regulated professions – such as legal, accountancy and insurance firms – who need to segregate clients’ monies to comply with regulatory standards. Under the new system, these customers be able to digitally self-serve all aspects of their clients’ account management activity, on one centralised platform, without the need to hold multiple bank accounts.</p>
<p>The platform’s features are also designed to appeal to corporate businesses who want to hold a smaller number of physical bank accounts, improve their payables and receivables processes, and have greater visibility and control over their liquidity positions.</p>
<p>Paul Thwaite, head of sales, specialist businesses and business banking at NatWest says: “Our new partnership with Tieto will allow us to offer innovative cash management solutions to SME and corporate customers – particularly those customers with more complex needs. Our customers want digital banking solutions that are easy to use and help them manage their business safely and efficiently, and that help them get on with doing what they do best – running their business.""</p>
<p>The bank will offer the new services under its NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland brands from October 2019, with further rollout to its Coutts and Ulster Bank NI customers planned from 2020.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – The collection and use of personal data for commercial purposes are on the rise, but concerns over privacy and cyber-security breaches are causing concern among consumers, companies and regulators alike. The report, <a href=""https://perspectives.eiu.com/technology-innovation/transparent-business-barometer"" target=""_blank"">The transparent business barometer: Preparing for the end of easy data</a>, written by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and sponsored by Ant Financial, assesses companies’ level of preparedness to face a more privacy-conscious world. It is largely based on a survey of 250 executives across China, the US, Western Europe and South-east Asia.</p>
<p>Nearly 100% of respondents agree that data privacy is important to their organisation, with a majority (54%) saying it will be much more so in three years’ time. One reason for this is the perceived importance of data privacy to good corporate governance, which is something that 88% of executives across the surveyed regions and almost all Chinese executives (98%) believe to be true.</p>
<p>Many firms are waking up to the fact that stricter laws in the mould of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation may be in the offing. In a barometer constructed for this study, companies were asked to rank their preparedness to face various data-privacy regulations, such as that which might restrict their ability to gather data directly from consumers, on a one-to-ten scale. Overall, they are relatively well prepared, although they are less willing to take different measures, such as changing business models to reduce reliance on consumer data, in response to such regulations. Compared with bullish Americans, executives in Europe are the least prepared to face regulations and least likely to try new approaches in response to them, while the sentiment in China and South-east Asia falls between those two extremes.</p>

<p>Smaller companies are also less ready to face regulations than their larger counterparts, even as some large firms, including tech heavyweights like Apple and Google, are now beginning to call for regulators to create greater clarity – a step that will hopefully lessen uncertainty going forward.</p>
<p>Michael Gold, editor of the report, says: “Businesses need to be aware that playing fast and loose with consumer data can lead to major repercussions down the road. Smart, well-co-ordinated regulations can make the business world more transparent and trustworthy amid a growing realisation that data is truly the ‘new oil’ in today’s economy.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Real estate transaction volumes in 2018 were the strongest on record reaching US$1.75trn; a 4% year-on-year (y/y) growth and surpassing previous highs of US$1.68trn in 2017, according to new data from global real estate services firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p>The Global Investment Atlas 2019 reviews international investment patterns from 2018 and anticipates market performance for the year ahead.</p>
<p>The firm forecasts record levels to be maintained in 2019, in the region of US$1.75trn, as investors target a wider range of markets to find opportunity, and more sellers come forward as real estate strategies adjust to evolving monetary policy, geopolitical tensions and structural change. The report states that pricing is expected to edge ahead, however this will be driven by stable yields and steady rental growth for the best assets rather than yield compression which has typified recent years.</p>
<p>Report author David Hutchings, Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Head of Investment Strategy EMEA Capital Markets, explains: “The economic environment is weaker than expected just a few months ago but so too is the inflation outlook on a global basis. As a result, while risk is up, the day of reckoning on interest rates for corporates and investors has again been delayed. The coming year is therefore set to see a further extension of the property cycle, offering investors another chance to get their portfolio into shape ahead of a period of slower growth.</p>
<p>“With a stable, contracted income and exposure to growth and inflation, real estate continues to be incredibly attractive and demand remains strong for the right product. However, defining the right product has become ever harder as powerful, market-moving occupier strategies are reshaped by e-commerce, social and business change, low growth and affordability constraints.”</p>
<p>James Shepherd, Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Managing Director of Greater China Research said: “Despite recent adjustments to the reserve ratio requirement, it seems unlikely that restrictions specifically targeting real estate debt are likely to be loosened in any significant way for the remainder of the year. Nevertheless, we forecast continued opening-up of the Mainland Chinese commercial property market to foreign investors and banks.”</p>
<p>Shepherd added: “With deleveraging policies likely to remain in place, real estate outflows will be slow to recover but should steadily improve should lending and outbound investment policy soften. In a time of tight liquidity back home in China, Chinese investors are actively disposing of assets at a global level including China.”</p>
<p>Shepherd added: “Cushman &amp; Wakefield forecasts that Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong are set to see increased investment demand through 2019. Beyond core cities of the Greater Bay Area, we also note strengthening interest in cities such as Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Foshan and Dongguan as well as key provincial capital cities.”</p>
<p>Catherine Chen, Greater China Head of Capital Markets Research and Forecasting, added: “Despite trade tensions between the US and China, US buying in the country reached record levels last year, particularly in Shanghai. As China transitions to a services-led economy, the nation will continue to draw in global interest to the growing CRE investment market.”</p>
<h4>A Complex International Picture</h4>
<p>North America rebounded from 2017’s volume decline to outperform in 2018, both as a target and a source of real estate investment with late-cycle tax stimulus in the US helping to offset higher borrowing costs. Although all global regions were active buyers last year, North America was the only capital source to increase overall commercial real estate (CRE) allocations compared to 2017, with volumes increasing 17% y/y to US$546bn. Investment volumes in North America are predicted to reach US$530.7bn in 2019. This is a 3% decrease y/y but a reflection of the regions’ mature position in the property cycle putting upward pressure on yields and follows an exceptional 2018.</p>
<p>CRE allocations in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) fell 2% and 1% respectively in 2018, the latter largely due to fewer global purchases over the year. European and Asian institutions are, however, increasing allocations to real estate, and both regions are also likely to see more inbound cross border demand, notably Europe in the short-term, and Asia in the medium-term as investors follow demographic trends.</p>
<p>EMEA investment volumes recorded US$331bn in 2018, a 10.8% y/y fall owing to a pull-back from both global and domestic sources and the conclusion of some large portfolio deals. European retail documented its third consecutive year of decline (US$56bn), with lower volumes across much of the region. Industrial and office transactions also contracted by -24.7% and -9.7% y/y respectively but was likely down to a shortage of investible stock. EMEA investment volumes in 2019, are predicted to reach US$339.2bn, a 2.5% increase on 2018 levels, driven by increased demand across a growing range of tier 2 cities and new sectors.</p>
<p>Robust levels of domestic and continental spending, led Asia-Pacific investors to maintain the highest overall share of investment volumes in 2018 at US$866bn, a new record for the region. While domestic investors retained the majority of transaction volumes, all sources of capital targeting the area increased investment. Development sites were the most targeted sector in the region, representing 80% of the market, previous records were also surpassed in the office and industrial sectors, while the hotel market reached its strongest point post-GFC. Asia-Pacific investment volumes are forecast to reach US$875bn in 2019, a 1% increase on 2018.</p>
<p>Following political upheaval in Brazil, Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia, and a pullback in investment linked to exchange rate depreciation against the dollar, Latin America recorded the lowest transaction volumes in almost ten years in 2018. Nonetheless, investment volumes are expected to leap 6% to US$2.4bn in 2019 as opportunistic investors grow in confidence. APAC investors are increasing their exposure to the region for example, largely looking for hotels and development land. Chinese investment into logistics facilities is also expected to continue.</p>
<h4>Continental Flows Boosting Cross Border Investment</h4>
<p>In contrast to wider nationalist trends, cross border real estate investment has flourished, growing 10.7% to US$405bn. This was led by stronger continental flows.</p>
<p>Carlo Barel di Sant’Albano, Chief Executive of Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Global Capital Markets &amp; Investor Services, said: “International capital flows are becoming yet more dynamic, increasingly cross border and more about balancing quality with quantity – this will be true whether you are referring to stock, yields, talent or living standards.</p>
<p>An abundance of capital will continue to drive the market and sustain pricing in 2019, but structural forces, such as e-commerce, will be driving areas of outperformance even as the cycle slows. Hence there is a real need to look beyond market averages to see the detail of the local market, the deal, the vendor, the lender and above all, the user.”</p>
<p>While the USA was the top target for global CRE investment (US$45bn), EMEA has retained its historical position as the most sought-after destination for international capital, with the most cities among the top ten cross border investment targets and attracting 53% (US$88bn) of global investment.</p>
<p>The USA and Canada were the top sources of cross border investment capital, together accounting for 40% of all non-domestic investment flows last year (US$125bn). German capital rounded out the top three at US$26bn. Interestingly, despite UK investment managers strengthening their continental portfolios, French cross-border investment outflows outpaced the UK for the first time on record. The make-up of cross border investment from Asia Pacific likewise altered, with mainland China and Hong Kong dropping back but Singapore and South Korea moving up the rankings.</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Norwegian bank Sbanken has selected Nets to support open banking with Nets Access to Account Services (NAAS) - a single platform that enables access to banks across the Nordics and Europe.</p>
<p>The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) will facilitate new services and better overviews of finances for bank customers. Nets’ single integration solution will give Sbanken access to account information in all banks in Norway and beyond through banks PSD2 APIs, enabling Sbanken (as third party) to develop innovative new services for its customers as PSD2 opens up the banking infrastructure.</p>
<p>Frode Åsheim, Head of Corporate Services at Nets, comments: “Banking as we know it will change radically due to the new regulation. Consumers and corporates will be able to access all their bank accounts in one place to have a better overview of their finances, and it will facilitate development of new services that benefit everyone. We have developed a standardised platform that provides third parties with the tools needed in this new world of open banking.”</p>
<p>Christoffer Hernæs, CDO at Sbanken, adds: “Taking an offensive position and leveraging PSD2 as a business opportunity is a top priority for the bank, as most Norwegian customers on average use more than one bank. By connecting to other Norwegian banks, we enable our customers to perform their top tasks such as getting a full overview of their financial health and paying their bills as easy as possible. Sbanken has chosen Nets since their platform provides easy access to the full market through one unified connection.”</p>

<p><em><strong>19<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Societe Generale extends coverage of SWIFT GPI to nine new countries in Western Europe and Asia, enabling its corporate clients to track and manage cross-border payments more efficiently.</em></p>
<p>Societe Generale today launched SWIFT gpi in nine new countries: Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Switzerland in Europe, as well as Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia. SWIFT, which has already launched in France and Monaco, enables the bank to grant clients access to the best experience for tracking and managing their cross-border payments. Benefits of SWIFT gpi include increased processing speed of global payments, fee transparency, real-time payment tracking, and end-to-end payment information transfer.</p>
<p>Societe Generale joined the SWIFT gpi initiative in 2017. The solution covers payments issued and received by Societe Generale in those 11 countries, denominated in euro or other global currencies. Corporate treasurers will soon have access to the gpi tracker through the SG Markets* platform or via host-to-host reporting solutions.</p>
<p>This new step in SWIFT gpi’s roll-out reflects the Group’s ambition to maintain its leading position in transaction banking in France and strengthen its footprint in Western Europe, in line with its 2020 strategic objectives.</p>
<p>Benoit Desserre, Deputy Head of Global Transaction Banking &amp; Payment Services for Societe Generale, says: “Today, more than a third of SWIFT gpi payments issued by Societe Generale are confirmed by the beneficiary bank in less than 5 minutes. This performance alone demonstrates the efficiency of our collaboration with SWIFT and the added value that gpi holds for our clients.”</p>
<p>Alain Raes, Chief Executive EMEA and Asia Pacific, SWIFT said: “We are delighted that Societe Generale is playing a leading role in extending the reach of SWIFT gpi. As one of the first banks in France to go live on the service, and the first worldwide to go live on SWIFT gpi for Corporates after the pilot phase, Societe Generale is transforming the cross-border payments experience for its customers. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Societe Generale as SWIFT gpi moves towards global adoption.”</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – MONEY 20/20: <a href=""http://ibm.com/investor"" target=""_blank"">IBM</a> today announced IBM Blockchain World Wire, a real-time global payments network for regulated financial institutions on the Stellar network is officially accessible in a growing number of markets.</p>
<p>Designed to optimize and accelerate foreign exchange, cross border payments and remittances, World Wire is the first blockchain network of its kind to integrate payment messaging, clearing and settlement on a single unified network, while allowing participants to dynamically choose from a variety of digital assets for settlement.</p>
<p>“We’ve created a new type of payment network designed to accelerate remittances and transform cross-border payments to facilitate the movement of money in countries that need it most,” said Marie Wieck, General Manager, IBM Blockchain. “By creating a network where financial institutions support multiple digital assets, we expect to spur innovation and improve financial inclusion worldwide.”</p>
<p>Today World Wire has enabled payment locations in 72 countries, with 48 currencies and 46 banking endpoints. Local regulations will continue to guide activation, and IBM is actively growing the network with additional financial institutions globally.</p>
<p>World Wire provides a more straight-through model for cross border payments using blockchain technology that makes money transfers point-to-point in lieu of the complexities of conventional correspondent banking. It reduces intermediaries and allows users to accelerate settlement time often in seconds by transmitting monetary value in the form of digital assets, commonly known as cryptocurrencies or “stable coins”. This simplified approach improves operational efficiency and liquidity management, streamlining payment reconciliation and reducing overall transaction costs for financial institutions.</p>
<p>The network already supports settlement using Stellar Lumens and a US dollar stable coin through IBM’s previously-announced collaboration with Stronghold. Pending regulatory approvals and other reviews, six international banks have signed letters of intent to issue their own stable coins on World Wire, adding Euro, Indonesian Rupiah, Philippine Peso, and Brazilian Real stable coins to the network. IBM will continue to expand the ecosystem of settlement assets based on client demand.</p>
<p>“RCBC is pleased to be an early innovator with plans to issue our own Peso stable coin on World Wire, pending final approval from our regulators,” said Emmanuel Narciso, Group Head, Global Transaction Banking, RCBC. “We’re focused on innovation that adds value for our customers, and World Wire presents a tremendous opportunity to transform and enhance our payment infrastructure.”</p>
<p>World Wire is now in limited production and available in a growing number of countries. Interested organizations can learn more at <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/world-wire"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/world-wire</a></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Vipps, the most popular payment app in Norway, and Nets, a market leader in the European payments industry, today announce an agreement to increase the number of payment options for consumers and simplify invoice and bill payments in Norway.</p>
<p>Rune Garborg, CEO of Vipps, comments: “We believe that this agreement will contribute to digitising all paper and email-based invoices in Norway. In the longer term, our ambition is to make the physical invoice obsolete. This partnership will create cost-savings for both corporates and consumers.”</p>
<h4>Timely payments</h4>
<p>Nets is the provider of invoicing solution eFaktura, which Norwegians have had access to for several years, and many consumers are heavy users of online and mobile banking services. But now the time has come to step up the pace of payments digitisation.</p>
<p>Frode Åsheim, Norway Country Director, Nets, elaborates: “Almost 180 million invoices are being delivered on paper or PDF in Norway every year. Consequently, many consumers forget to pay on time, creating cash flow issues for creditors. By combining the functionality of Vipps and eFaktura we are reaching more consumers, particularly young people.”</p>
<h4>Putting consumers in charge</h4>
<p>The partnership will enable consumers to pay all digital invoices and bills in Vipps or through online and mobile banking, including those previously only available in the Vipps app. Consumers will be able to receive even more invoices digitally, already filled out with relevant account details and the amount to be paid – increasing convenience for the consumer and the likelihood of timely payment.</p>
<p>Åsheim continues: “We want to make payments more convenient and enable consumers to receive bills and invoices on their preferred platform. Combining Vipps and eFaktura will empower digital consumers by providing them with an overview of their finances. This is a significant improvement on today, as currently consumers receive bills on paper, via email, or through Vipps or eFaktura, depending on which solution the invoicing business uses.”</p>
<p>Garborg adds: “All digital invoices that are today provided in eFaktura or Vipps Regning will be available as Vipps eFaktura. The consumer decides how to pay their digital invoices and bills, be it in Vipps, through online banking, mobile banking or other connected digital channels. Consumers will also have access to a full overview of all invoices paid across these channels in their online banking account, including those paid in the Vipps app.”</p>
<h4>No need for new integration</h4>
<p>Despite the differences to the front-end of the solution, the flow of digital invoices in the back-end will remain unchanged. This mean that banks, corporates and suppliers will not have to update their systems and integrations when implementing the new solution.</p>
<p>More than 3.2 million Norwegians use Vipps and around 2.6 million use eFaktura, which distributes approximately 100 million invoices each year.</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Over 100 <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> customers were upgraded to the latest compliant versions of its transaction banking software, <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/solutions/transaction-banking/trade-supply-chain-finance/fusion-trade-innovation"" target=""_blank"">Fusion Trade Innovation</a>, ahead of the new SWIFT standards deadline of 17 November 2018. The new ‘Standards MT Release’ included significant changes to category 7 messaging standards used in trade finance – the most significant set of changes to the SWIFT trade finance messaging interface in over 30 years.</p>
<p>“These were substantial changes that have been eagerly awaited by the industry, but the timelines for providers, like Finastra, to build out the new functionality required and help clients to upgrade in time for the deadline were extremely tight,” said Iain MacLennan, Head of Trade and Supply Chain Finance at Finastra. “We’re incredibly proud to have been able to ensure that all of our clients in this space were ready for the deadline, which is no mean feat and has proved a challenge for many in the industry.”</p>
<p>Finastra started this journey in April 2017, delivering the initial set of requirements to its Fusion Trade Innovation solution users later that year. Following the issuance of additional requirements by SWIFT in February 2018, Finastra continued to work with customers to complete their upgrades in record time. Amsterdam Trade Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank were among the customers upgraded in time for the regulation deadline</p>
<p>The new standards are aimed at improving operational efficiencies for banks and corporates alike. For Finastra, they also provided the opportunity to ensure that customers have access to products that will support their long-term business and provide a platform for growth in this new era of trade financing. Many of the upgrades were delivered through Finastra’s Fusion Advance service for a faster, more standardized delivery approach, easing transition.</p>
<p>Hans Sluijter, Head of IT at Amsterdam Trade Bank, another customer involved in the upgrade, said, “Undertaking such significant changes to the messaging interface of a bank, impacting their operational processes, can be a daunting experience. However, Finastra worked closely with us to make sure we were ready by the deadline without a hitch. The second stage of the SWIFT updates will be taking place in November this year, and we are confident that this will be a smooth transition.”</p>
<p>The SWIFT Standards Release for 2019 outlined significant change to guarantees messages with the introduction of a greater degree of structure, enhancing the possibility of straight through processing. The changes, originally scheduled to come into effect in November 2019, have been deferred until November 2020. Finastra is moving forward with the development and delivery of the SWIFT changes for trade finance guarantees messages this year, affording customers additional time to implement changes in a timely manner.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Female leaders are demanding better women in leadership mentoring programmes as almost all believe the current initiatives offered by their companies are ineffective with 95 per cent stating that gender discrimination and gender-bias remains an issue in their offices, according to REED.</p>
<p>The specialist recruiter asked almost 150 female leaders about gender discrimination in the workplace and issues surrounding equality, finding that there is strong support for mentoring programmes, to help more women to gain senior positions. A further third (36 per cent) of respondents want better family support and flexible working options to help with their work-life balance and career progression.</p>
<p>Despite advancements being made in gender equality, female employees still feel they are lacking the support network and role models to achieve senior positions, with a further 30 per cent stating they would like more women representatives on the board. Additionally, just over a quarter (27 per cent) said they would like to see increased advocacy from senior leaders and board members displaying commitment to gender equality.</p>
<p>In offering ways to tackle this discrimination, four in 10 (38 per cent) respondents stated they would like more visibility and acceptance of flexible working options.</p>
<p>Chris Adcock, director of Reed HR, commented: “Although massive steps have been made in creating a more equal and fair working environment for all employees, the results from this survey show a clear and resounding response that female employees still feel that gender bias is an issue in their workplace.</p>
<p>“Not only is this unacceptable, by not taking steps to remove these biases, companies are also preventing themselves from tapping into a huge talent pool. By working to remove unconscious biases in the workplace and the recruitment process, companies can expect greater competition for roles and more diverse representation in the workplace, which in turn, will contribute to improved results.”</p>
<p>Chris Adcock continues: “For those we asked, the solution lies in mentoring and people and policy driving change. While the majority of organisations do offer mentoring schemes for employees, there is still a disparity in the number of male and female role models in senior positions. Businesses that look to resolve this issue will reap the long-term rewards with lower employee turnover, more consistency across the business and a stable and equal platform for the company to grow.</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Despite wider economic uncertainty, the majority of SME and Mid-Market businesses surveyed are planning to grow in 2019 but struggle to see the value of tax relief to drive that growth, according to new research from KPMG.</p>
<p>While 94% of businesses are predicting to grow at least 5% for the year ahead, less than a quarter (24%) of businesses see the tax system as a key driver, highlighting the need for more understanding of the tax reliefs and incentives on offer.</p>
<p>KPMG’s second annual <a href=""https://home.kpmg/uk/en/home/insights/2019/03/backing-business-growth-study---2nd-edition.html"" target=""_blank"">Backing Business Growth survey</a> spoke to 1,000 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and Mid-Market businesses across the UK with an annual turnover of at least £10m – 82% of which are privately-owned – to explore their attitudes to the tax system and whether it is providing the most effective incentives and support for their growth ambitions.</p>
<h4>Businesses understand importance of tax but don’t make full use of reliefs on offer</h4>
<p>The majority (87%) of respondents said that tax was important to at least some extent in making business decisions but only around a quarter (27%) said that they were making full use of the tax reliefs and incentives on offer.</p>
<p>Businesses were clear in identifying the policies they felt were the greatest drivers of job creation and investment (such as additional tax relief for employee training and the Enterprise Investment Scheme) but were less clear on linking tax initiatives to specific outcomes that drive innovation, creativity and productivity.</p>
<p>Mike Linter, Partner and Head of National Markets Tax said: “Understanding how well the tax system is working for SME and Mid-Market businesses - the engine-room of the UK economy - could not be more important, especially as we move towards a post-Brexit economy.</p>
<p>“It’s positive to see that these businesses are planning to grow and this underlines their ambition. However our research shows that there are significant gaps where businesses struggle to use the tax system to help them reach their goals and find it difficult to link tax initiatives to specific outcomes.”</p>
<h4>Calls for tax system simplification</h4>
<p>Almost two-thirds of businesses feel that current tax policy is broadly on the right lines to encourage growth. However a similar number (63%) said that simplifying the tax system should be the priority of the government and felt (62%) that the tax system is too complex.</p>
<h4>Contrast between fast growth and moderate growth businesses</h4>
<p>While overall, the majority of those surveyed do not think tax is a ‘driver for growth’, segmenting businesses by growth expectation revealed differing attitudes between companies expecting fast or moderate growth.</p>
<p>Among higher growth businesses, 78% think the tax system supports growth compared to just 18% within the moderate growth segment.</p>
<p>Similarly compared with 27% of businesses that say they are making maximum use of the tax system, this rises to 75% within the fastest growing segment, suggesting that growth businesses are more engaged with the tax system. The report found further differences when looking at the size of firm, its location and the sector that it operates in.</p>
<p>Mike Linter concluded: “The data shows that businesses consistently feel that there is too much complexity in the system – the right incentives are there but making the most of them is not always straightforward for SME and Mid-Market businesses, which are often resource-constrained.</p>
<p>“Furthermore a businesses’ level of engagement can depend on a number of factors such as their growth aspirations, size of company, location and the sector that they operate in.</p>
<p>“One possible way forward could be to provide more explanation of the intentions behind policies which might help to raise awareness amongst these businesses. Equally businesses need to view tax as a valuable lever to grow or invest and consider it upfront as part of their decision making process rather than retro-fitting it during the tax return cycle. Only through better engagement and understanding will we be able to drive growth from the tax system through to business.”</p>
<h4>Regional differences</h4>
<p>Businesses were split on how policy could best drive local activity. Almost a third (31%) of fast growth companies want City Mayors to be able to flex business rates, but only 5% of moderate growth companies agree. Targeted regional relief gains some support in Scotland (23%) and helping attract international investment in the South West (23%). Enterprise zones are the most popular in the North West and East and West Midlands (17%).</p>

<p><strong>1<sup>st</sup> March 2019</strong> – The Lyreco Group, leading European distributor and third largest global distributor of workplace solutions for businesses, selected dynamic discounting solution, C2FO, as part of the Group’s “Working Together for Tomorrow” mission, with a focus on deepening a relationship of trust with its suppliers.</p>
<p>Lyreco distributes office, furniture, services, technology solutions, and personalised products across 42 countries, four continents, 9,000 employees, 12,000 products. The privately-held firm delivers 250,000 boxes daily. Now, it will deliver something new: early payment for their supply chain.</p>
<p>C2FO provides Lyreco suppliers with an option to be paid early by offering discounts they control on their invoices. Lyreco makes cash available to create liquidity for their suppliers. Then, the C2FO technology does the rest, matching offers with available cash to deliver early payment on approved invoices in as little as two days. The programme provides Lyreco and its valued supply chain a mutually-beneficial way to collaborate on margin improvement and sustainability.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of the project, the objective of Lyreco was to combine cash optimisation, strengthen relationships with business partners and simplify process. With this solution, the C2FO platform appeared as the better solution to answer all these needs. 100% web user friendly, the tool is the best way to make cash available for our suppliers at the most appropriate cost in their view. The win-win process is one of the main reasons why we have chosen C2FO” states Lyreco’s group treasury director, Estelle Bonnemaison.</p>
<p>The programme will be launched globally in early 2019 to support Lyreco’s diverse supply chain. C2FO offers scalability and full support for all languages and currencies. The global working capital solution provides the Lyreco Treasury team with centralised cash management. C2FO includes in-region support throughout programme launch and continuous year-over-year growth to ensure both Lyreco and its suppliers gain the most value from the initiative.</p>
<p>“Lyreco is a respectable global organisation that has made supplier collaboration at the heart of their mission. This new programme will significantly increase C2FO’s ability to provide needed liquidity to thousands of suppliers in the office supply vertical worldwide. We are truly excited about this partnership with Lyreco and sharing their vision of working together for tomorrow,” says Antoine Trépant, Managing Director, C2FO.</p>
<p>C2FO is delighted to support Lyreco in their goal of creating liquidity for their suppliers as part of our network in the office supply and retail vertical. We are the working capital solution of choice for over 80 percent of the worldwide retail market, which will help Lyreco accelerate their success.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – HSBC has launched a portal designed to allow third party payment providers to develop products and services for European consumers and businesses as required by the Second European Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and in line with the Competition and Markets Authority Open Data Specifications.</p>
<p>HSBC’s launch of its PSD2 Developer Portal will help the bank to meet the requirements of the directive, which aims to increase competition and reduce costs in the European payments industry.</p>
<p>HSBC’s Developer Portal is a secure sandbox environment where developers can test Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for three services: Account Information, Payment Initiation and Funds Confirmation. Developers can access mock data from Retail and Corporate Payment Accounts in scope of PSD2.</p>
<p>Nadya Hijazi, Global Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management Digital, HSBC, said: “We are keen to work with multiple parties to develop and test their applications and customer propositions through easy and secure access to the wide range of simulated products and services on our PSD2 Developer Portal. We look forward to working with third party payment providers across Europe to use HSBC’s services and bring new innovation to the market through an intuitive developer ecosystem.”</p>
<p>This testing facility in the secure sandbox environment provides developers with the choice of Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) and STET standards, with work underway to include the Berlin Group standards.</p>
<p>The launch of the PSD2 Developer Portal marks another step towards introducing more digital innovation and competition for payment services while ensuring high levels of security. It is anticipated that the changes will lead to increased customer choice and confidence in using Account Information Services and Payment Initiation Services, when consenting to share their financial data.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – The credible way to end Brexit gridlock and give UK and global business much-needed certainty is with a second referendum, affirms the CEO of one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory organisations.</p>
<p>The comments from Nigel Green, the founder and chief executive of deVere Group, come as the UK and the EU are preparing themselves for the most critical vote on Brexit since the 2016 referendum.</p>
<p>This evening MPs will decide whether to accept the Brexit deal struck by Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU after she has won, according to Downing Street, “binding” assurances from the EU over the controversial Irish backstop.</p>
<p>The last time Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement was put to Parliament in January, it was voted down by a margin of 230.</p>
<p>Mr Green observes: “Most legal experts agree that the much-hyped revised agreement does not, in reality, significantly change anything regarding the Irish backstop.</p>
<p>“In all probability, it will, therefore, be rejected once again in the House of Commons by MPs who handed Theresa May the biggest parliamentary defeat in history on this very issue in January.”</p>
<p>He continues: “As such, the decision remains a political one – and therein lies the main problem. There is no majority in parliament for any one way forward.</p>
<p>“What most people across the UK, as well as British and global business, do want though is an end to the paralysing gridlock and uncertainty.</p>
<p>“Politicians have proven themselves to be incapable of resolving this impasse in parliament.</p>
<p>“Therefore, the sensible – probably the only – way through is to give it back to the people, giving them accurate, unambiguous information in order to allow them to make an informed choice on the final deal.”</p>
<p>He goes on to add: “Any new vote must also include the 700,000-plus British expats who are disenfranchised from the UK political system after 15 years overseas and subsequently denied the vote on something that directly affects them.</p>
<p>“All other G7 countries except the UK allow their citizens voting rights for life. Why is Britain different? It is especially galling as they are potentially still liable for UK inheritance tax but are not allowed to vote in the UK after 15 years.”</p>
<p>There is mounting evidence that the public mood is increasingly concluding that the people need a final say in the Brexit process.</p>
<p>On Saturday 23 March, The Put It To The People march will take place in London – just six days before the UK is meant to leave the European Union. It is likely to run along the same lines as the rally on 20 October, which attracted an estimated 670,000 people.</p>
<p>The deVere CEO concludes: “There is no parliamentary majority for any Brexit option. Allowing the public to vote and giving them a final say is quite simply the only credible solution we now have available.”</p>

<p><strong>6<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – Validus Capital (Validus), Singapore's leading SME financing platform, has successfully raised US$15.2 million (S$20.5 million) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round.</p>
<p>Investment in Validus' Series B round was led by <a href=""http://fmo.nl/"" target=""_blank"">FMO</a>, Netherlands' public-private development bank. FMO has over 300 investments in banking and financial services institutions (BFSIs). Its investment in Validus marked FMO's first fintech investment in Southeast Asia, a region which saw over <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/southeast-asia-offers-best-fintech-opportunities-2018-12/?IR=T"" target=""_blank"">US$5.7 billion</a> in fintech investments in 2017 according to KPMG. Participating investors also include Taiwan's Cathay Financial Holdings, Singapore's Openspace Ventures (previously NSI Ventures), Temasek investment arm Vertex Ventures, Thailand's AddVentures by SCG and Vietnam's VinaCapital Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 in Singapore, Validus brings together accredited individual and institutional lenders and SMEs. It obtained its CMS license from MAS in December 2017. Since then, Validus has successfully topped US$133.1 million (S$180 million) in business funding - a record for P2P business lending platforms in Singapore.</p>
<p>Ajit Raikar, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Validus Capital expressed his confidence in the company's future and talks about the strong global interest in Validus' Series B fundraising, ""Southeast Asia is one of the fastest growing economic regions globally, where there is a clear need for alternative financing platforms such as Validus to complement the traditional banking and financial infrastructures. Having a strong team, technology and data science capabilities has allowed us to partner with strategic global investors for our next growth stage. This reaffirms that we are well on track to deliver on our strong growth forecasts, and our ambition to become a digital 'bank-like' fintech for underserved SMEs is well supported with two leading sovereign funds investing into Validus.""</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://sg.news.yahoo.com/p2p-lending-plug-southeast-asia-us-175b-business-031531098.html"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte</a>, SMEs contribute around 40 per cent of Southeast Asia's gross domestic product (GDP) and employ 70 per cent of the region's workforce. Despite the importance of SMEs regionally, support is generally lacking, particularly in terms of business financing. <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured Insights/Employment and Growth/How digital finance could boost growth in emerging economies/MG-Digital-Finance-For-All-Full-report-September-2016.ashx"" target=""_blank"">McKinsey Global Institute</a> reported that 39 million Southeast Asian SMEs (or 51 per cent) lack access to credit. P2P Lending has emerged as a popular alternative financing option for SMEs in Southeast Asia to service this unmet business financing gap. Per <a href=""https://www.ey.com/sg/en/industries/financial-services/ey-asean-smes-are-you-transforming-for-the-future"" target=""_blank"">EY</a>, around 68 per cent of the region's SMEs are receptive to tap into alternative financing options, including P2P Lending.</p>
<p>""Validus is particularly well-positioned to lead the P2P Lending industry's change in Southeast Asia and spearhead financial inclusion among the unbanked and underserved businesses in the Region in a more digital way. Their planned expansion to Indonesia and Vietnam will strongly contribute to job creation by SMEs in these countries. We are excited to embark on this digital journey with Validus and their very strong shareholder base, as they continue on their steady and sustainable growth trajectory,"" said Linda Broekhuizen, Chief Investment Officer, FMO.</p>
<p>With fresh funding, Validus is looking to invest heavily in technology innovation, particularly around artificial intelligence and machine learning to help make business financing even more convenient and safe for SMEs. It will also fund their Southeast Asia expansion, starting with Indonesia this year, followed by Vietnam.</p>
<p>Nikhilesh Goel Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer at Validus Capital, whose background is in private equity shared, ""Our strategic approach in fundraising goes deep beyond the size of the investment. We look for partners who share our vision in driving inclusive growth in the region, who are able to offer the value-add and guidance needed. The strong partnerships we've built with our investors will not only help us to strengthen our technology and regional expansion but also provide the deep-seated connections and valuable advice across areas like business development, capital funding and recruitment, areas which are vital for the growth of the company.""</p>
<p>Over the past year, Validus has enjoyed a tremendous series of successes where it has become Singapore's top SME P2P Lending platform. Two new products were introduced, namely Working Capital Financing and Purchase Order Financing. It experienced exponential growth in terms of loans where almost 2,000 loans were disbursed in 2018, representing a 260 per cent increase year-on-year (y-o-y) while disbursement volume increased 350 per cent y-o-y. Overall, over 300,000 Singaporeans were directly and indirectly positively impacted with the Validus platform and their growth numbers forecast a direct impact to the country's gross domestic product. Manned by an experienced SME lending team that looks beyond financial data, into behavioural patterns, Validus continues to be a beacon of support to growing SMEs across Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>6<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – SWIFT today announces a proof-of-concept (PoC) on e-Voting, using distributed ledger technology (DLT). SWIFT will jointly conduct the PoC in the Asia Pacific region, with leading securities software provider SLIB and the Singapore Exchange (SGX), along with Deutsche Bank, DBS, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p>The PoC will explore whether DLT can help simplify the currently inefficient management of shareholder meetings and the associated voting processes that are often time-consuming and resource intensive. Proxy voting in particular often results in avoidable complexity and errors that could be eliminated through greater transparency and automation.</p>
<p>SWIFT will facilitate the PoC in its DLT sandbox testing environment with Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank joining as participants, while DBS and SGX join as both participants and issuers. The participants will reuse the SWIFT network and their existing SWIFT infrastructure and interfaces to access, test and validate the applicability of DLT.</p>
<p>The PoC, which will run during the first half of 2019, is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Test the deployment of a voting solution in collaboration with issuers and a Central Securities Depository (CSD), where the information is stored and managed on a permissioned private blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate the viability of hybrid solutions based on ISO 20022, combining messaging and DLT to foster interoperability and avoid market fragmentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test SWIFT’s capacity to host third-party applications in its sandbox and reuse its security and interface stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm the use of ISO 20022 as the foundation for standardising for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that expose DLT node contents to parties with direct access to the ledger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lisa O’Connor, Managing Director, Securities, Treasury &amp; Standards, Asia Pacific at SWIFT said, “The expression of shareholders’ rights is often limited today by non-transparent, complex and inefficient paper-based processes. The emergence of blockchain technology is a new opportunity to look at improving these processes. It is also an opportunity for SWIFT to offer flexibility in the adoption of this new technology through the re-use of ISO 20022 based solutions together with a high level of security and resilience that our industry requires.”</p>
<p>Nico Torchetti, Head of Market Services, Equities &amp; Fixed Income, at SGX said, “SGX is constantly exploring innovative solutions to help digitise processes and enhance efficiency across the value chain. Together with SWIFT and SLIB, we hope to harness fintech to effect improvements in processes such as proxy voting, which would benefit many participants in our marketplace.”</p>
<p>Philippe Juanola, Vice General Manager, at SLIB said, “Leveraging the findings from the initial SWIFT-SLIB innovative e-Voting solution developed on blockchain technology, we look forward to working with our fellow participants to further this capability and test the interoperability of the solution in the Asia Pacific region”.</p>
<h4>PoC bank quotes:</h4>
<p>Tony Lewis, Head of Securities Services, HSBC, said: “Shareholder voice in corporate decision-making is stifled by the existing paper-based voting process. Technology is the solution to enhancing shareholder say. e-Voting using DLT has the potential to create greater efficiencies, transparency and participation. Through collaboration amongst key market players, the PoC has a real opportunity to revolutionise security services in Singapore. As the world’s most innovative investment bank, we are delighted to be contributing to another project building on the Republic’s position as a global fintech hub.”</p>
<p>Jeslyn Tan, Global Head of Product Management, Securities Services at Deutsche Bank, said:  “We believe that DLT-based solutions have great potential for the securities services industry and we are proud to be collaborating with SWIFT, SLIB, SGX and key market participants on this first-of-its-kind project in Singapore. Sharing best practices and working closely with market participants will allow us to create a more efficient ecosystem, which will benefit banking clients.”</p>
<p>Soh Ee Fong, Group Head, Securities and Fiduciary Services, DBS, said: “An innovative and seamless e-Voting platform in this industry is long overdue and DBS is pleased to join SWIFT in the PoC as both issuer and participant. With this solution, shareholder meetings will not be the same again. As the world’s best digital bank, DBS is proud to contribute our digital experience to help bring forward this initiative.”</p>
<p>Jyi-chen Chueh, Executive Director and Head, Custody Services, Standard Chartered Bank, said: “Standard Chartered Bank is excited to contribute to the PoC and help improve proxy voting transparency and efficiency through innovation. Proxy voting remains today an untapped area for asset servicing automation, with many paper-based processes. Enhancing market best practices through industry collaboration sits at the very core of our DNA at Standard Chartered. The co-design of an e-Voting market utility which combines blockchain technology with ISO standards could pave the way for game-changing benefits for both the investor and issuer communities.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – Standard Bank of South Africa is preparing for the go-live of a private permissioned blockchain payment system for conducting overseas foreign exchange trades on behalf of corporate clients.</p>
<p>Slated to move into live production in the second half of the year and built on the hyperledger fabric, the cloud-based system will initially cover Standard Bank and Stanbic Bank partner banks, clients and third parties directly involved in trades, and interbank network Swift.</p>
<p>“We have also decided to include our foreign currency trading app, Shyft, which provides access to a host of payment distribution partners and e-commerce platforms,” says Richard de Roos, head of foreign exchange for Standard Bank.</p>
<p>Standard Bank is also working with global banking partner, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), enabling the South African bank to extend this private permission-based ecosystem into China.</p>
<p>The network is conceived on a hub and spoke basis, “where the hub is Standard Bank and its 20 franchises across Africa working with ICBC to extend the hub into Asia, and the spokes are the various payment rails, like Swift and Sshyft,” explains de Roos.</p>
<p>When the system goes live, it is expected to significantly increase the straight-through processing of international trades. It will also speed up foreign exchange payments and settlement while making transactions more transparent, “providing an independent and much safer cloud-hosted record of all documents and steps, instantly available in real time to all parties involved,” says de Roos.</p>
<p>The aim is to capture the majority of trades that typically fail in the first mile of foreign exchange payments and settlement, then simply hand the transaction over to the Swift gpi network for fulfillment.</p>
<p>Says de Roos: ""We could actually offer clients a fully integrated end-to-end block chain solution that would dramatically reduce the incidence of trade failure while also increasing regulatory transparency and improving the visibility of liquidity.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – EBA CLEARING announced today that its instant payment system RT1 has further expanded its coverage in the German market and now reaches a critical mass of payment service providers (PSPs) operating in Germany. With this large-scale connection to EBA CLEARING’s pan-European infrastructure platform, the German banking community has laid the foundation for rolling out euro real-time payment products and services to its customers nationwide.</p>
<p>RT1 has welcomed three additional major German payment market players – Deutsche Bank, DZ BANK and Commerzbank – since November 2019. This has increased to more than 1,700 the number of PSPs in Germany that are addressable via RT1, including the German cooperative sector connected via DZ BANK. The new participants joined UniCredit AG, Hanseatic Bank and the two Landesbanken Helaba and LBBW, which were already active in RT1; the two latter have been connecting the German savings banks sector to the EBA CLEARING system via their payments hubs since mid-2018. Additional German PSPs are scheduled to connect to RT1 in the next few months.</p>
<p>These recent developments in Germany tie in with instant payment roll-out activities of other communities and individual institutions across Europe. In addition to Germany, the ramp-up at country level, as witnessed by RT1, has been gaining steam in Italy, Spain, the Baltics and Austria in particular. As a result, the total number of transactions processed in RT1 tripled from 5 to 15 million between late October 2018 and late February 2019. These 15 million instant payments, of which over 99% were settled and thus final within less than three seconds, had a total value of over EUR 8 billion.</p>
<p>“Around 900 cooperative banks in Germany have been reachable via Instant Payment since November 2018 and can receive SEPA Instant Credit Transfers. For DZ BANK, Instant Payments are a central building block in the payments business, which is why we are working intensively on active reachability: in the course of this spring, about 30 million customers of the cooperative banks will be able to initiate real-time payments,” said Jürgen Kacmarek, Head of Operations Management, Payments &amp; Accounts, DZ BANK AG.</p>
<p>“From our point of view, market penetration is crucial for instant payments. It takes quite a few participating institutions to ensure that customers get the money in their accounts within a few seconds. The number of banks offering the service is now sufficiently high for customers to be able to use it at a large scale. Customers of Commerzbank can receive payments in real time as of now,” said Stefan Wloch, Managing Director, Group Services Banking Operations at Commerzbank AG.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the tremendous support of our multinational user community, RT1 currently reaches practically all PSPs actively using the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Scheme. That corresponds to 60% of all PSPs operating in SEPA.</p>
<p>The substantial onboarding of German banks onto RT1 is a spectacular example confirming that the instant payment take-up across Europe has been making great strides. We are happy to provide a resilient backbone for the processing of these soaring transaction volumes,” said Hays Littlejohn, CEO of EBA CLEARING.</p>
<p>RT1 provides payment service providers in the Single Euro Payments Area with a real-time payment processing facility operating around the clock on any day of the year.</p>
<p>The EBA CLEARING platform went live as the first pan-European real-time payment infrastructure system on the launch date of the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) Scheme of the European Payments Council in November 2017.</p>
<p>RT1 participation is open to any account-servicing payment provider (AS-PSP) adhering to the EPC SCT Inst Scheme; the system currently reaches over 2,300 institutions. Different options to interact with the system allow any type of user access to the RT1 platform.</p>

<p><strong>1<sup>st</sup> March 2019</strong> – Fourteen banks and industry trade associations from across Europe have been testing their mettle in a war-gaming WannaCry-style attack on a simulated bank network.</p>
<p>The cyberrange exercise, hosted by UBS, follows recent predictions from the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) that artificial intelligence will be increasingly used to create new ransomware that is able to evade detection and circumvent protections in 2019.</p>
<p>The exercise convened CISOs, CIOs, heads of security and security analysts from 14 leading financial services and trade associations to participate in the simulated attack, which was also observed by several multinational retail and investment banks, asset and wealth management and financial services companies.</p>
<p>Participants took part in an on-site technical and hands-on-keyboard experience that encouraged collaboration and information sharing with other teams and organisations to bolster defences and beat off the threat.</p>
<p>“We enjoyed working with representatives from other organisations and saw first-hand the impact that collaboration and information-sharing had on the participants’ decisions-making and response times,” says Carlo Hopstaken, chief information security officer and head of cyber assurance testing at UBS. “We look forward to strengthening the relationships that we developed during the exercise and we will encourage others in the industry to communicate with their peers more to improve the overall resilience of the financial services sector.”</p>
<p>FS-ISAC says will host its next cyberrange exercise, which will feature an updated version of the ransomware, in partnership with Santander in Spain in June 2019.</p>

<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> March 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.ssga.com/home.html"" target=""_blank"">State Street Global Advisors</a>, the asset management business of <a href=""http://www.statestreet.com/home.html"" target=""_blank"">State Street Corporation</a> (NYSE: STT), today brought its Fearless Girl campaign to London with a new statue in Paternoster Square, against the backdrop of St Paul’s Cathedral. The firm also announced new global diversity impact numbers on the campaign’s second anniversary.</p>
<p>Since first launching the Fearless Girl campaign in 2017 on the eve of International Women’s Day, 445 companies of the 1,265 identified by State Street Global Advisors have responded to the call to action by either adding a female director or committing to do so.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to bring this impactful campaign to London and continue to take a stand for the important issues of gender diversity at the board and senior leadership level,” said Lori Heinel, deputy global Chief Investment Officer for State Street Global Advisors. “Studies have shown that companies with greater gender diversity at the senior leadership levels generate better returns than their peers. That drives our conviction to continue our engagement and voting efforts as we look to make further progress on this important topic.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome Fearless Girl to the City. This builds upon the City of London Corporation’s continuing efforts to increase the recognition of women in the City’s public realm,” said Catherine McGuinness, chair of the policy and resources committee at the City of London Corporation. “I hope that Fearless Girl will serve as a reminder of the progress we have made and the progress we still need to make.”</p>
<p>”We are delighted to welcome Fearless Girl not only to the City of London, but to our home at Paternoster Square,” said David Schwimmer, CEO of London Stock Exchange Group. “The London Stock Exchange Group fully supports her mission of raising awareness of the importance of diversity on boards and within senior corporate leadership.”</p>
<p>State Street Global Advisors also announced today new impact numbers demonstrating continued progress for the firm’s gender diversity asset stewardship programs in the US, UK, Australia, Japan, Canada and Continental Europe. Concluding its second year, 423 companies identified by State Street Global Advisors have now responded to the firm’s call by adding a female director to their previously all male boards and another 22 have committed to do so.</p>
<p>Starting in 2020 in the US, UK and Australian markets, and in 2021 in Japan, Canada and Continental Europe, State Street Global Advisors will vote against the entire slate of board members on the nominating committee if a company does not have at least one woman on its board, and has not engaged in successful dialogue on State Street Global Advisors’ board gender diversity program for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>As a result of State Street Global Advisors’ Fearless Girl campaign, companies and shareholders worldwide have been inspired to focus on the issue of gender diversity. Highlighting just two examples since the firm last reported impact numbers, it has seen the number of companies adding a female director increase by 57 percent in the UK and 48 percent in the US.</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – SWIFT today announces a major milestone in the take-up of gpi with more than $40trn transferred over the service in 2018. Rapid adoption saw the share of cross-border messages using gpi soar from 15% at the start of 2018, to 56% by the end of the year, a year-on-year increase of 270%. More than 3,500 banks, accounting for 85% of SWIFT’s total payments traffic, have committed to adopting gpi, evidencing how the service has achieved the near total transformation of the cross-border payments landscape just two years since launch.</p>
<p>Emma Loftus, head of global payments for J.P. Morgan’s Treasury Services, said: “SWIFT gpi delivered on the promise of greater payment transparency and predictability, highlighting how banks and industry collaboration can quickly deliver innovation. For years, clients have asked their banks for end-to-end transparency which is easy to use, understand, and implement. With 76% of our payments now being executed via gpi, we are experiencing direct benefits in our ability to respond to client enquiries. Processes that have taken days are being now completed within seconds.”</p>
<p>SWIFT gpi is already carrying over $300bn a day in 148 currencies across more than 1,100 country corridors and on average, 40% of SWIFT gpi payments are credited to end beneficiaries within five minutes. Half are credited within 30 minutes; three quarters within six hours; and almost 100% within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Thomas W. Halpin, Global Head of Payments Product Management, HSBC, said: “We are always looking for ways to provide customers with greater speed, certainty, transparency and traceability for their payments. Since integrating SWIFT gpi into our customer-facing portals and digital tools, thousands of our customers across multiple countries have been able to make payments in as little as seconds.</p>
<p>“SWIFT gpi has meant HSBCnet customers can track the progress of their cross-border payments – and it’s also helping us speed up response times to customer queries.”</p>
<p>Building on its success, SWIFT is moving rapidly to complement the core gpi service with a raft of additional functionalities and to integrate gpi into a diverse range of applications. For instance, the rollout of an integrated and interactive API-based service facilitating real-time dynamic bank-to-bank interaction to improve the predictability and efficiency of international payments will soon be complemented by a post-payment investigation and reconciliation service.</p>
<p>In tandem, SWIFT is to launch a gateway to enable e-commerce and trading platforms to directly plug into SWIFT gpi. The gateway will seamlessly connect multiple trade platforms to gpi members, thereby enabling gpi payment initiation, end-to-end payment tracking, payer authentication and credit confirmation directly from a multitude of platforms.</p>
<p>With thousands of banks using the service and gpi accounting for 99% of all traffic on some major country corridors – such as US-China, SWIFT gpi is without question the de facto standard in the new era of fast, secure and efficient cross-border payments. Already integrated into most major domestic high-value payment systems around the world, gpi payments can be tracked today through nearly 100 domestic systems, extending many of the benefits of gpi beyond SWIFT’s extensive reach. Building on this, SWIFT has successfully trialled the link-up of SWIFT gpi, via gpi members, to domestic real-time payments systems, in what will soon enable a new SWIFT gpi instant cross- border payments service.</p>
<p>Gottfried Leibbrandt, SWIFT CEO, said: “Having now passed the all-important tipping point with more than fifty per cent of cross-border payments going via gpi, we can now move quickly to realise our ambition of ensuring ubiquitous real-time – even instant – cross-border payments right around the world. By incorporating APIs, trialling distributed ledger technology and exploring new technologies such as predictive analytics, we will continue to deliver new functionalities and applications at pace – ensuring that the cross-border payments experience rapidly becomes as seamless as domestic payments.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – Mainland Chinese Real Estate Investment Overseas (MCREIO) hit a four-year low of US$15.7 billion in 2018, a marked decline of 63% y-o-y amid weakening Chinese investor sentiment, tightened policy control and growing economic headwinds, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield Research's 2019 Outbound Investor Intention Survey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the same time of reining in their spending on overseas real estate, data from Real Capital Analytics (RCA) show Chinese investors sold off over US$12 billion of overseas assets in 2018, indicating the start of a massive shift in activity now weighted more heavily towards disposals. The frenzy of disposal activity was driven primarily by ongoing stiff policy control back home, led by a clampdown on lending real estate developers and investors (Chart 1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinforcing the significant slowdown in momentum for overseas investment, 84% of investors in China surveyed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield Research indicated that they had either frozen or reduced their overseas real estate allocations over the past year in comparison to 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By destination, the U.S. and UK held on to their top-tiered positions, ranking No. 1 and 3 in terms of sentiment according to the survey results, despite ongoing U.S.-China trade frictions and Brexit uncertainties (Chart 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to RCA/Cushman &amp; Wakefield Research data, the U.S. recorded US$2.3 billion worth of acquisitions against US$3.1 billion of disposal volume, suggesting a net outflow of mainland Chinese real estate capital from the U.S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elsewhere, Hong Kong took first place for the second consecutive year with US$9.5 billion of investment despite a 20% y-o-y decrease in MCREIO volume, according to RCA/Cushman &amp; Wakefield Research data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the acquisition front, the top two sectors of interest remained Office and Residential with Senior Care leaping three places to take 3rd place in Cushman &amp; Wakefield Research's survey. Sectors shifting down a gear in terms of sentiment were led by the Hotel sector, where interest plunged 50%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, Chinese outbound investment is forecast to remain flat amid the expectation that a tight real estate lending environment will remain in place and continue to restrict deployment of mainland Chinese capital globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A clear trend of caution has emerged looking ahead to 2019, reflected in the current increasing difficulty in deployment of capital. According to the survey results, 65% of respondents said that they were significantly or severely impacted by the prevailing outbound policy control, sharply up from 50% in 2017. Moreover, only 18% of respondents said they believe the lending environment will improve in 2019.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>James Shepherd, Managing Director of Greater China Research, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said: ""We expect that Chinese banks' real estate lending may remain tight for much of the year ahead, creating an environment that will clearly continue to restrict deployment of mainland Chinese capital in general irrespective of geographic location. In a time of tight liquidity back home in China, Chinese investors are disposing of assets at a global level including China.""</p>
<p>Shepherd added: ""Contrary to some market commentators who have assumed that disposal activity in the U.S. and UK has been a direct result of prevailing political turmoil, the simple fact is that outside China MCREIO's existing portfolios are heavily weighted to the U.S. and UK, and therefore disposal volumes appear remarkably high in these markets.""</p>
<p>Shepherd continued: ""Ever popular in the hearts of Chinese investors, Australia had a strong showing, overtaking the UK for third place in terms of real estate investment in 2018.""</p>
<p>Jason Zhang, Head of China Outbound Investment &amp; Advisory Services, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said: ""Survey results, particularly on sentiment by destinations, views on RMB appreciation and global gateway property prices, have shown MCREIOs are becoming more prudent and selective under the guidance of the government investment policies.""</p>
<p>Zhang added: ""2019 will continue to be a 'quiet' year in terms of investment volumes but expect to see more M&amp;A; activities in real estate operation platforms together with their portfolios.""</p>
<p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield Research's 2019 Outbound Investor Intention Survey collected responses from around 150 of the top Mainland Chinese Real Estate Investors Overseas. The survey, conducted during the final quarter of 2018, received responses from 51 such investors, representing more than RMB280 billion of offshore capital.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.altify.com/"" target=""_blank"">Altify</a>, the pioneer and leader in Customer Revenue Optimization (CRO), today announced a new category of enterprise selling which ensures that both companies and customers gain more value from their commercial relationships. CRO is the vision of the future of Business to Business (B2B) sales, supported by recent global research findings. CRO arose from the recognition that sales and business leaders face constant pressure to align customer retention and revenue generation, two factors traditionally at odds.</p>
<p>The newly released <a href=""https://www.altify.com/crobenchmark"" target=""_blank"">2019 CRO Benchmark study</a>, which surveyed over 640 sales and business leaders globally was executed in partnership with Salesforce, MapAnything, Gainsight, Traction on Demand, NewVoiceMedia, Highspot and Outreach. It reveals 92 percent of sales and business leaders see revenue generation as their primary focus for 2019. While benchmark surveys have previously seen Customer Retention in the top spot, adopting a CRO approach ensures businesses no longer need to compromise between delivering short-term revenue goals and building long-lasting and lucrative customer relationships.</p>
<p>Customer Revenue Optimization does this by modernizing the traditional Customer Relationship Management (CRM) model and improving the personalization of the customer experience (CX) – the two critical success factors in highly complex B2B sales.</p>
<p>“Today’s empowered and educated buyers expect great experiences – they don’t want to be sold to,” said Altify CEO, Anthony A. Reynolds. “Continuously heightened customer expectations require Chief Revenue Officers and the entire revenue team to put the customer first and to optimize every experience to deliver value. Failing to understand this and to properly leverage Customer Revenue Optimization is the difference between winning customers and losing them.”</p>
<p>CRO combines Altify’s deep understanding of sales strategy and best practices, sales methodology, enabled with augmented and artificial intelligence to enable guided selling. Customer Revenue Optimization radically re-imagines and enhances the traditional CRM model to ensure organizations truly put customers at the center of their business by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Harnessing the knowledge of the entire enterprise to understand the customers’ business problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving revenue capability and execution by moving from selling products to enabling customer outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuously optimizing all organization resources to drive better experiences and unlock more revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making every employee part of the revenue team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>The new revenue imperative</h4>
<p>The demands of the global marketplace require new solutions that enable the C-suite to make critical decisions that drive revenue generation and customer retention, while still focusing on providing an elevated customer experience. The 2019 CRO Benchmark report revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>77 percent of sales and business leaders report customers are more in control of the buying process than ever before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just 46 percent believe they are good at maximizing revenue from their existing accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 43 percent close sales opportunities as they are originally forecasted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The research also reveals sales teams are not getting any better at understanding customer business problems. This year only 66 percent of respondents believe their sales team is good at uncovering the customer's business problem, and in the 2018 version of this survey the response was the exact same. The study’s results suggest organizations needs to rethink their approach to sales to focus on a scientific approach to deliver value. Overall, the findings ratify CRO as the missing piece behind the post-CRM landscape.</p>
<p>“Customer Relationship Management is yesterday’s story,’’ said Jeremy Cox, Principal Analyst in Ovum’s Customer Engagement Practice. “Being able to record activity, while useful as a system of record, does not directly impact the quality of engagement with customers. With CRO, Altify places the customer at the centre of every interaction, to focus attention on the customer’s desired outcomes, and by providing intelligent guidance on the most relevant action, to help customers achieve their aims. Revenue and growth are the natural consequence.’’</p>
<p>""IDC’s research correlates with Altify's latest CRO Benchmark in delivering one clear message - enterprises today risk losing their precious customers if they are not mapping their marketing and sales efforts to buyer needs and buying processes. Altify’s new CRO solution offers the potential to bridge this customer experience gap.” said Gerry Brown, CX Research Director for IDC Europe.</p>
<h4 id=""connecting-all-employees-to-the-customer"">Connecting all employees to the customer</h4>
<p>Customer Revenue Optimization is built for high performing B2B sales organizations that use Salesforce and modern, best-of-breed sales, marketing and customer success applications to improve sales velocity.</p>
<p>In response to the clear need for a new technology category, Altify is introducing the first Customer Revenue Optimization applications with its Spring ’19 release, featuring Dynamic Account Plans. Now all employees can contribute to customer strategy by contributing to account plans, and Chief Revenue Officers can enable a structured process to continuously test and improve those plans to optimize for customer value and revenue impact. Altify’s Spring ’19 release includes new capability to help front line sales leaders improve revenue optimization with new TeamView Opportunity Dashboards, and Opportunity Close Plans. Designed to enable sales leaders to understand progress against plans and improve coaching, TeamView dashboards track status against opportunity plans for all accounts from early deal qualification to the development and execution of mutual close plans.</p>
<p>“Altify’s Spring ’19 release with Close Plans is exciting. It will give our sales teams the ability to stay in lock-step with our customers throughout the sales process – right through to close,” said Steven Birdsall, Chief Revenue Officer at Anaplan Inc. “It’s an additional way for us to maintain our Customer First philosophy and put it into action after we win the deal.”</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to the new Spring ’19 release from Altify, and how these great new capabilities will help our sales teams to further increase their performance, improving collaboration, strengthening alignment and enabling meaningful discussion and actions across the extended account team for continued future success,” said Amaury Lambert, VP International Sales, Orange Business Services.</p>

<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> February 2019</strong> – HSBC’s PayMe announced today the launch of a beta test programme for PayMe for Business, a new person-to-merchant (P2M) payments app in Hong Kong.

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – A growing number of non-regional [GCC] organisations are turning to Islamic Finance, and in particular to sukuk instruments, to raise funds for their infrastructure and development projects, affirms a leading UAE-based investment banking expert.</p>
<p>The comments from Zahid Aslam, Managing Director of Investment Banking at Dalma Capital Management Limited, come as the firm reports an almost one-third jump in enquiries regarding Sharia-compliant bond issuances from corporations outside of the GCC.</p>
<p>The news follows S&amp;P; Global Ratings predicting in January the global issuance of Sharia-compliant foreign and local currency bonds is expected to reach as much as US$115 billion (Dh422.1bn) this year.</p>
<p>“It is our experience that sukuk-based solutions are establishing themselves as an increasingly attractive alternative for the funding of infrastructure and development projects,” observes Mr. Aslam. “For example, we are currently working with clients on a variety of ‘off the beaten path’ projects, including a refinery initiative in the CIS region and a scheme to help develop eco-tourism and sustainable farming in several African nations. We are also seeing interest from Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan.”</p>
<p>He continues: “I would suggest that there are five main drivers for this significant upward trend for sukuk-issuance to continue this year and beyond.</p>
<p>“Firstly, lower oil prices – despite recent gains – have created a funding shortfall for many.</p>
<p>“Secondly, there is notable and mounting pressure on global liquidity.</p>
<p>“Thirdly, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ongoing plans to slowly raise interest rates, making borrowing more expensive.</p>
<p>“Fourthly, global regulation is enhancing and becoming more Islamic finance-friendly.</p>
<p>“Finally, general awareness outside the GCC of the uses and benefits are becoming ever-more understood and valued. Dalma Capital, being a licensed and regulated asset manager and investment boutique with a network of institutions and accredited partners, provides all the necessary solutions for sukuk issuers and investors.”</p>
<p>Zachary Cefaratti, CEO at Dalma Capital concluded “There is growing evidence that potential borrowers who had never considered Islamic Finance are better understanding the clear benefits of such solutions.</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a>’s core banking solution, <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/solutions/retail-banking/core-retail-systems/fusion-essence"" target=""_blank"">Fusion Essence</a>, has been chosen to power Saudi Arabia’s Agricultural Development Fund’s lending services. The governmental credit institution will use the platform – traditionally used by banks for retail – to provide its customers with an improved user experience, including new services and shorter loan approval times, as well as moving the fund forward in line with the Kingdom’s strategic transformation plan, <a href=""http://vision2030.gov.sa/en"" target=""_blank"">Vision 2030</a>.</p>
<p>“The fund’s credit services are a vital element towards developing the Kingdom’s agricultural activity,” said Muneer bin Fahad Al-Sahli, General Director for Agricultural Development Fund. “It’s crucial for us to offer our clients – farmers and other players in the agricultural space – a seamless digital experience which enables them with their endeavours. With Fusion Essence, we will be able to increase automation through our loan portal, which will lead to reduced timeframes for loan approvals and improved operational efficiencies.”</p>
<p>The fund is specialized in financing various fields of agricultural activity in Saudi Arabia, to develop the sector and increase its productive efficiency. Its services allow farmers to obtain Shari’ah compliant loans for agricultural machinery and equipment. The new system is part of the Information Technology initiative, one of the Fund's 10 strategic transformation program initiatives, which seeks to achieve the fund's objectives in line with the Kingdom's vision for the future.</p>
<p>Wissam Khoury, Managing Director for Middle East and Africa, Finastra, said “This is a tremendous demonstration of the flexibility and versatility of our products. It is great to see Fusion Essence recognized for its strengths, beyond its traditional banking remit. This project will enable the Kingdom’s farmers to access credit faster, in support of agribusiness success, and in turn, encourages Saudi Arabia’s agricultural development.”</p>
<p>The fund, which has until now used a legacy system, aims to go live with the solution within the next year. The system will also enhance the credit risk management practice in the Fund in order to become effective and achieve operational excellence in tandem with its objective.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – The Municipality of Bari has started up in collaboration with <a href=""https://www.sia.eu/en"" target=""_blank"">SIA</a> – the leading European hi-tech company in the payment services and infrastructures sector - a project based on blockchain technology that aims to digitize the process of managing surety policies.</p>
<p>This is the first experiment in Italy of use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) relating to sureties in the public sector that will allow the Municipality of Bari to dematerialize the issuance process by banks, financial intermediaries, and insurance companies and certify the sureties unequivocally and irrevocably.</p>
<p>This innovative project will contribute, among other things, to reducing the processing times of the various phases, eliminating any manual errors and also preventing possible fraud by unauthorized parties related to the presentation of false documents.</p>
<p>The experiment will make use of the SIAchain technology infrastructure designed and implemented by SIA to support the development and implementation, in a secure and protected manner, of innovative applications based on blockchain, such as for example smart contracts able to verify agreements and contracts automatically.</p>
<p>""The project we have undertaken in collaboration with SIA will allow us to implement policies on the development of new technologies with significant progress in digitization and in the belief that, by increasing our experience in the use of DLT, we can support the work of PA bodies while triggering unprecedented technical and employment scenarios. We want this initiative to develop and generate value, both in the public and private sectors, and drive other public administration bodies to start up similar projects. Bari has already taken up the challenge of innovation"", commented Antonio Decaro, Mayor of Bari.</p>
<p>""The launch of the blockchain project with the Municipality of Bari represents a milestone in the field of digital PA in Italy as it shows that local authorities have the potential to improve and simplify complex administrative procedures by investing in new technologies. SIA supports the public sector in this path of innovation with the conception and development of initiatives, in protected mode, which are part of a broader digitization program of the country. We strongly believe that the SIAchain infrastructure, thanks to its high performance and safety features, offers significant benefits"", stated Nicola Cordone, CEO of SIA.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – According to Gartner’s IT Glossary, Business Intelligence (B.I) is often defined as “an umbrella term that includes the applications, infrastructure and tools, and best practices that enable access to and analysis of information to improve and optimize decisions and performance”.</p>
<p>B.I models are essentially data-driven ‘Decision Support Systems’(DSS) that are used with the intention of better supporting a business. With B.I, visual data discovery and business analytics solutions are continuing to evolve, which in turn is enabling non-technical users to interact with more types of data.</p>
<p>As a result, <a href=""https://SavoyStewart.co.uk"" target=""_blank"">SavoyStewart.co.uk</a> pulled highlights from the report ‘2019 Business Intelligence Trends’ by <a href=""https://www.tableau.com/"" target=""_blank"">Tableau</a>, to reveal the major trends that will be shaping Business Intelligence in 2019.</p>
<h4>1. Transparent AI</h4>
<p>The need for transparency has led to the growth of explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) – the practice of understanding and presenting transparent views into machine learning models.</p>
<p>Explainable A.I enables users to ask follow up questions as to why a model recommends something and what it would say if the inputs were different. According to Gartner Research, 85% of CIOs will be piloting AI programmes to buy and build outsource efforts by 2020.</p>
<p>Companies have embraced the value of A.I but for it to make a disruptive impact it must be trusted, presenting valid conclusions that will help humans better understand their data.</p>
<h4>2. Two-way data dialogue</h4>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) amalgamates computer sciences and linguistics to allow computers to better comprehend the meaning behind human language. With the natural language generation market estimated to grow to $825.3 million by 2023, B.I vendors are offering a natural language interface to visualisations.</p>
<p>This enables users to interact with their data. Understanding user context creates a more natural dialogue, which can lead to analytical conversations between the user and the system about their data.</p>
<h4>3. Actionable analytics</h4>
<p>B.I platforms are evolving to place data where people want to take subsequent action. For example, data workers need their data and actions in the same place, rather than performing an analysis and actioning it elsewhere. B.I platforms are closing this gap by merging with core business operations, workflows and processes such as analytics and dashboard extensions.</p>
<p>Actionable analytics are utilising the decision-making processes for both technical and non-technical roles, allowing data workers to analyse their data and take an action after finding an insight in the same place.</p>
<h4>4. Data ethics</h4>
<p>In light of GDPR regulations in the EU, leaders have begun assessing the future of ethical data practices. The topic of data privacy has risen in prominence and consumers are more conscious than ever about sharing their personal data.</p>
<p>This in turn is affecting how businesses approach data monetisation, as well as collection of data and the sharing of sensitive information. As data continues to proliferate in every area of business, companies are starting to evaluate how to best ensure compliance, as well as their own internal moral code of ethics.</p>
<h4>5. Cloud migration</h4>
<p>Data gravity is resulting in more businesses moving to the cloud at an increased rate, driving businesses to re-think their data strategy. Essentially this means services and applications are pulled in the direction of where the data can be found.</p>
<p>The cloud makes it easier for companies to capture and integrate different types of data. As more companies are highlighting the benefits of moving to the cloud, data gravity is also pushing analytical processes to the cloud.</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – SWIFT announces that it is to open its world-leading Know Your Customer platform, The KYC Registry, to corporates.</p>
<p>In a first step, from Q4 2019, all 2,000 SWIFT-connected corporate groups will be able to join The KYC Registry, and use itto upload, maintain and share their KYC information with their banks.</p>
<p>Enabling corporates to join The KYC Registry will be transformational both for multi-banked corporates and for their banks, who already benefit from access to the 5,100 bank strong registry and can see the huge advantage of adding corporates.</p>
<p>Major corporations use a range of banks in different jurisdictions around the world, with whom they need to exchange information to enable KYC checks. Data is held in different places and is often incomplete or out of date, making the process time consuming for both corporates and their banks.</p>
<p>The absence of uniformity, differing jurisdictional requirements and the lack of standardised data across the corporate KYC space increases these inefficiencies further.</p>
<p>The KYC Registry is an online portal for financial institutions to exchange institutional KYC Due Diligence information. The platform allows banks to share KYC data and documents with their correspondents in a secure, standardised and controlled way, as well to get access to their correspondents’ complete and validated KYC profiles, resulting in efficiency and cost savings in KYC processes.</p>
<p>The introduction of corporates will enable corporates to upload standard information to The KYC Registry as well as toexchange other KYC-relevant documents that are requested by their banks, thereby ensuring the highest level of usability of the platform. Banks will benefit by having access to corporates’ information through the same central repository they use for their correspondent KYC checks, thereby enabling efficient data sharing through a secure central utility, eliminating duplication and inefficiency.</p>
<p>Marie-Charlotte Henseval, Head of KYC Compliance Services, said: “Corporate treasurers cite KYC as one of the top three challenges they face in their bank relationships. We’re pleased to be extending what is already the largest KYC registry for banks in the world to corporate customers. This unique and well established utility already delivers huge benefits to banks, and its extension to corporates will extend them the same advantages, with a standard agreed by the community and a secure platform enabling efficient data sharing.”</p>
<p>Stephan Ziegler, Head of Bank Relations at Siemens Treasury, said:“As a global corporation, the efforts of Siemens to perform KYC-related tasks across the institution is a repetitive, lengthy and a cumbersome process. At Siemens Treasury we are constantly looking for ways to increase our efficiency. With SWIFT announcing KYC for Corporates, we are delighted to see a well-positioned player moving ahead to answer this need with the full strength of its banking and corporate community.”</p>
<p>John Colleemallay, Senior Director Group Treasury &amp; Financing at Dassault Systèmes, said: “KYC for Corporates is a dream come true for all Treasurers, considering the heavy workload involved in providing the same documentation several times in multiple formats to our banking partners.  We look forward to having a secured shared registry where we can more easily and rapidly complete the KYC processes.”</p>
<p>Daniel Ochsner, Member of Management, Würth Finance International B.V. and Chairman of SWIFT Corporate Group Switzerland, said: “We are very pleased to see that SWIFT has aligned its banking community to provide a simplified KYC experience to corporates. The success of The KYC registry for banks and the trust we put in SWIFT puts us at great ease when it comes to exchanging documents and information with our global bank partners”.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – TenCate Grass Holding is the global leader in the development, production and marketing of synthetic turf components used to produce artificial grass for sport, leisure or landscaping. The company has an active acquisition strategy and is growing fast in Europe, USA and Asia Pacific.</p>
<h4>The challenge of growth</h4>
<p>As a result of the fast growth, it became more and more time intensive to maintain an overview of the consolidated liquidity position and embedded risks. To improve this process and prepare for further growth, management decided to invest in a best-in-class treasury solution. The global treasury function is based in the Netherlands and is managed by the CFO, Mr Teekens. Trinity’s web-based TMS solution was chosen after an extensive review process. Mr Teekens comments: “I have worked with other TMS-systems but during the first demo I noticed that Trinity offered at least what I was used to, especially in the reporting- and liquidity planning area, but even more important, I saw that the system was very user friendly and therefor easy to learn for employees not 100% familiar with using a TMS.”</p>
<h4>Functionalities</h4>
<p>With the liquidity planning tool, TenCate Grass has created its own forecast structure. The regional controllers use an Excel sheet to upload the data, allowing the treasury to get a consolidated view on liquidity. The variances (e.g. actual vs forecast) can be analyzed in two ways; over time or per category. The bank balances are automatically uploaded in the system allowing TenCate to have a clear view on the global cash position. Trinity is also used to manage the intercompany loan portfolio, the global netting process, the FX exposure and the tracking of guarantees.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>The solution was implemented by Trinity’s regional partner. To optimize time spent, Trinity organized regular web-sessions to implement the solution and provide global training. This has proved to be very effective. In the end, the Trinity delivered what was promised within time and budget.</p>
<p>“My treasury is ready to scale, I can certainly recommend Trinity.” – Jan Teekens, CFO TenCate Grass Holding.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In 2018, we surveyed 200 US executives and found that sustainability is now a well-established feature on the US corporate agenda, with companies with more mature initiatives seeing it as a revenue driver. This year, we took our survey further and focused on sustainability in action by looking at the approaches US firms are undertaking to embed practices within their business models.</p>
<p>In our ongoing effort to support sustainable business initiatives, we surveyed 300 US executives across four sectors (automotive, consumer electronics/telecoms, food/agriculture, and healthcare) to discuss the shift to adopt an entirely new model that houses sustainability at its core – the circular economy.</p>
<p>Traditional businesses have operated under ‘linear’ economic models that ‘take, make, use and waste’ materials. The structure of the circular economic model focuses on businesses developing innovative propositions for customers that enable them to use products for longer, return or replace products or even share a product with other consumers. This process leads to a new type of relationship between business and customer; one that is less transactional, more long-term and solution led.</p>
<p>Our research found the circular economy is increasingly on the agenda, but US firms are struggling to understand its true value and implement it effectively. Encouragingly, interest is growing; ING’s research shows that while only 16% of US businesses have adopted the circular economic framework, 62% say moving toward this is part of their business strategy.</p>
<p>Here is what we learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By prioritizing sustainability, US businesses are growing: Twice as many US firms are embedding sustainability in strategic decision making in 2019 as we saw in 2018.</p>
<p>There has been a marked jump in the number of executives who say that sustainability is influencing business growth strategy: 85% say this today, compared to just 48% who reported this in our 2018 study. Businesses are recognizing the benefits that sustainability strategies can provide, but there is still a lot of room to grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses see a future in the circular economy: US businesses are embracing circular practices - even if in a fragmented fashion.</p>
<p>Even though only 16% of US firms say they have adopted a circular economy framework today, there is strategic intent to do so from 62% of the businesses we surveyed.</p>
<p>There are a substantial number of circular-type initiatives underway across the production cycle, and a lesser number to transform product models, demonstrating that circular thinking is becoming increasingly relevant in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But businesses are struggling to unlock the full value of circular: For businesses in the US, circular remains a story of unidentified value. Current perceptions about circular practices will need to evolve to help US firms reap circular rewards and respond to business disruption.</p>
<p>Most US businesses we surveyed are focusing on cost-saving aspects of circular initiatives rather than the value retention and creation that can be achieved through closing material loops. A minority of firms with more advanced circular strategies say that responding to evolving consumer trends is a key driver for them to pursue circular initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circular thinking requires new relationships with consumers: Our survey shows consumers are increasingly demanding circular practices, but both consumers and firms need to establish new ways to reuse and recycle products and materials.</p>
<p>33% of firms that have adopted a circular framework did so because of customer demand. In understanding how companies are becoming increasingly sustainable, it is clear there are parts of the model that we still need to discover and create standards of procedure for – particularly around the relationship between the company and customer. The firms we surveyed responded that “Difficulty recovering materials for recycling” was that biggest barrier to adoption of the circular economy model (32%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges remain, but opportunity awaits through collaboration: Successful implementation of circular models is not something a company can do by itself. To reach full potential, firms needs to work with supply chain partners, customers, financing partners and even competitors.</p>
<p>Work with your suppliers to assess the possibility of collaborating on circular initiatives.  Explore new business relationships, with new buyers for waste materials and with cities or communities to encourage greater resource recovery — and open up potential new revenue streams. Talk to your competitors, and companies in other industries, to see if there are areas in which you could cooperate on circular solutions. And finally, work with your bank to assess whether it understands, and whether it is prepared to provide financing solutions for circular models.</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – The New York Federal Reserve is to assist Bangladesh Bank in a legal challenge to recoup $81 million stolen in a massive cyber heist in 2016.</p>
<p>The hackers tried to transfer around $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank’s account with the NY Fed over the interbank Swift network. The central bank was allegedely vulnerable to the malware intrusion because it did not have a firewall and used second-hand, $10 routers to network computers connected to Swift.</p>
<p>Eighty-one million dollars in fraudulent payments ended up in an account at Philippines-based Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC), before being offloaded into the hands of casinos and gambling operators in Manila.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Bank has now filed suit against RCBC in a district court in Manhattan, and has recruited the NY Fed to provide “technical assistance” in helping the bank make its case at the trial.</p>
<p>In a statement, the NY Fed says: “The New York Fed and Bangladesh Bank believe that safe and reliable funds transfer services are critical for global financial stability, and that the type of fraud perpetrated on Bangladesh’s account at the New York Fed represents a threat to the international funds transfer system. This agreement demonstrates that the New York Fed and Bangladesh Bank are aligned in the pursuit of recovering the funds and directing litigation against those who were complicit in or benefitted from the fraud.”</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – C2FO, the world’s largest market for working capital, is proud to announce our network’s latest customer, global air transport leader, Air France. The company is the first airline to offer its suppliers the C2FO programme, a voluntary and flexible solution they can use to request early payment of their invoices. Suppliers will have control over if and when they choose to participate in the programme, and also over the rate of discount they wish to offer in exchange for early payment.</p>
<p>“Confident in the validity of the working capital marketplace concept to create value, Air France wishes to endorse a successful trendsetter role. Innovation efforts in progress at Company level are here well exemplified in the Finance area. We trust industry participants involved in the airline supply chain will be soon onboarded to enhance liquidity and match interests by improving margins or capital needs,” says Marc Verspyck, Air France CFO.</p>
<p>The C2FO initiative resulted from a strong collaboration between treasury and procurement leaders at Air France. Air transport is a capital-intensive vertical, due in part to fuel price volatility and rising maintenance costs, as well as the need to invest in rapid technology evolution and fleet. The initiative, considered as a strategic use of working capital, enables Air France treasury and procurement teams to meet KPIs while delivering substantial value to their entire organisation and supplier base.</p>
<p>The C2FO and Air France relationship is a strong endorsement for our brand new strategic partnership with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) the trade association for the world’s airlines, representing some 290 airlines or 82% of total air traffic. Together, Air France, IATA, and C2FO share the mission to support the financial health of the airline industry supply chain.</p>
<p>“We are enthusiastic about the value-ad our working capital marketplace will deliver to the air travel sector. Airlines globally are impacted by ever growing cost pressures and volatility which C2FO alleviates through better use of cash and AP optimisation”, says C2FO Managing Director Antoine Trépant. “Air France is a pioneer in the sector and we are proud to join forces with them with the support of IATA to deliver incremental value across this high-potential industry.”</p>
<p>With the IATA partnership, C2FO can offer the airline industry and its supplier base a collaborative tool that helps airlines improve margins while supporting their supply chain with access to affordable, convenient cash flow to fund growth and invest in the development of new technology for the industry.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – The development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) has growing implications for European risk managers, the Federation of European Risk Management Associations (FERMA) has told the European Commission. Speaking from the perspective of corporate users of AI, FERMA has welcomed the overall approach to create European guidelines on AI ethics, the first in the world, that are set out in Draft AI Ethics Guidelines prepared by a High-Level Group from the Commission.</p>
<p><a href=""http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001FyZoevw_ZoWEBqaTH5XM3XqC_IdJDpd4koBNnZf4vqY8I2a_8mICYl_MoS3zsufwE2kb3iV3PDpjLJe5-RGP9QxXLt5406gWKAVmFB2XMjhXefsHrasatmYHfp54aoF0cLOUZv6-xbzlAsIedQFtT7RbE3PZSC-J86X6p8hjpw8kTjOaiDWHLsTT2btZld2JN9scGKooaDAkle_sw5oTLJJ_okwUaxfFX9Jd1-X0wMkhVvnZS5dQYJjj1txfKoHy&amp;c=1CoLw8n7j9d6IGIWecaIhi1vviS93BtDEDx_sXWt8AmIIpRE-VnoXw==&amp;ch=bkoTUYUwCtgC2-WECCvTtufZDO0i6n-kcj3ZDvUYkOmoQcRiSPtFTA=="" target=""_blank"">In its response to the High Level Group stakeholder consultative document on the guidelines</a>, FERMA says it sees the draft as a starting point to efficiently manage the ethical challenges of AI.</p>
<p>Philippe Cotelle, FERMA board member with responsibility for digital transformation, stated: “We see the development of ethical rules as the opportunity to ensure there is accountability in the sphere of AI. We expect the professional practice of risk management to play a fundamental role in the implementation of AI to ensure that organisations conduct a diligent assessment of all risks facing an organisation using AI, including the ethical dimension, through a holistic risk management methodology.”</p>
<p>The 2018 FERMA Risk Manager Survey revealed that more than one-third of risk managers are already involved in identifying and assessing the risk involved with new technologies for their organisations, and FERMA expects this number to grow.</p>
<p>In its comments on the draft, FERMA also draws attention to the implications of AI for the ethical control in the insurance underwriting process and the opportunities and threats of AI technologies for the insurability of organisations. In particular, FERMA expresses concern that if AI is deployed in underwriting, insurers will know considerably more than the insurance buyer about how AI has been integrated into the underwriting process. “This asymmetry of information could potentially affect the ability of organisations to purchase insurance and consequently impact their business,” it says.</p>
<p>Philippe Cotelle adds to FERMA’s submitted comments that risk managers themselves are likely to find AI becoming part of the techniques of their own jobs, especially in risk assessment in very large enterprises. “We are at the beginning, he said, but the Risk Manager Survey found that around 9 percent of risk managers are already using AI and other technologies such as blockchain in their work.”</p>
<p>With these trends in mind, FERMA has planned a high level panel discussion on AI for the 2019 FERMA Forum which will take place on 17-20 November in Berlin.</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – The list of 2019 Greenwich Share Leaders in European Large Corporate Banking is still dominated by the big European banks, but U.S. rivals like Citi and J.P. Morgan are exploiting the struggles of some of the region’s biggest banks and climbing up the rankings tables as they pick up relationships and market penetration.</p>
<p>“US banks have traditionally been reluctant to tap into balance sheets and compete in Europe on the basis of their willingness to lend to large European corporates,” says Greenwich Associates Managing Director Dr. Tobias Miarka. “But now they are being quite aggressive and taking advantage of their lower costs of capital to capture business.”</p>
<p>Two factors play an outsized role in European companies’ decisions about which banks to use: banks’ willingness to lend and innovation across banking products, processes and digital platforms. Lower funding costs give U.S. banks an advantage in both areas, enabling them to lend at more competitive rates and also afford to make big investments in product development and IT.</p>
<p>To be sure, US banks are not the only ones delivering in these areas. On the contrary, HSBC, ranked No. 2 in market penetration across the European region, is also impressing corporate clients with its investments in the business and innovation—as is market leader BNP Paribas. Citi, at No. 4 in the rankings in market penetration, is the only US bank to actually crack the elite ranks of the Greenwich Share Leaders this year, coming in just behind third-place finisher Deutsche Bank and tied statistically with UniCredit.</p>
<p>The extent of the US advance is in the results of the 2019 Greenwich Excellence Awards in Large Corporate Banking and Cash Management. Of the 22 awards given across 15 categories, U.S banks Citi,Bank of America Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan took home a combined total of 16 awards.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that US banks have momentum, and there are signs that the US advance could be starting to extend beyond Europe’s biggest companies. Regional European banks with extensive local networks and longstanding relationships with local companies dominate, however. These deep ties explain why regional banks like Germany’s Bayerische Landesbank and Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo earn the title of 2019 Greenwich Quality Leaders in European Large Corporate Banking in their respective countries.</p>

<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – SWIFT announces a proof-of-concept (PoC) to trial gpi Link, a gateway to interlink e-commerce and trading platforms with SWIFT gpi – the new standard in cross-border payments.</p>
<p>gpi Link will seamlessly connect gpi members to multiple trade platforms thereby enabling gpi payment initiation, end-to-end payment tracking, payer authentication and credit confirmation. The gateway will enable the continuous monitoring and control of payment flows and the subsequent movement of goods by those trade platforms, while to ensure global integration and interoperability it will support application programming interfaces (APIs), as well as SWIFT and ISO standards.</p>
<p>The first stage of the PoC will work on R3’s leading blockchain platform, Corda, and aims to bring the benefits of gpi payments’ speed, ubiquity and certainty to distributed ledger technology (DLT)-enabled trade. The PoC addresses the need for DLT-based commerce to be supported by global, fast, secure and transparent settlement using fiat currencies by enabling ‘off-ledger’ payment settlement based on gpi.</p>
<p>In the PoC, corporates using the R3 platform will be able to authorise payments from their banks via gpi Link; gpi payments will be settled by the corporates’ banks, and the resulting credit confirmations will be reported back to the trade platforms via gpi Link on completion.</p>
<p>While the PoC initially addresses R3’s DLT-based trade environment, it will be extended to support other DLT, non-DLT and e-commerce trade platforms.</p>
<p>Luc Meurant, SWIFT’s Chief Marketing Officer, said: “All trade platforms require tight linkages with trusted, fast and secure cross-border payments mechanisms such as gpi. While DLT-enabled trade is taking off, there is still little appetite for settlement in crypto-currencies and a pressing need for fast and safe settlement in fiat currencies. With gpi Link, banks will be able to provide rapid, transparent settlement services to e-commerce and trading platforms, opening up whole new ecosystems to the speed, security, ubiquity and transparency of gpi and enabling them to grow and prosper in the new digital economy. Given the adoption of the Corda platform by trade ecosystems, it was a natural choice to run this proof of concept with R3.”</p>
<p>David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, said: “Following the recent launch of our Corda Settler, allowing for the payment of obligations raised on the Corda platform, it was a logical extension to plug into SWIFT gpi. SWIFT gpi has rapidly become the new standard to settle payments right across the world. All the blockchain applications running on Corda will thus benefit from the fast, secure and transparent settlement provided through the SWIFT gpi banks.”</p>
<p>SWIFT gpi, which is supported by hundreds of banks around the world, including more than 50 of the world’s top banks, is playing a transformational role in changing the cross-border payments experience for banks and corporates and enabling in excess of $300 billion worth of payments every day. Thanks to gpi, cross-border payments are now typically made within minutes or even seconds, with over 50 per cent of SWIFT gpi payments credited to end beneficiaries within 30 minutes. With the gpi Link, trade platforms will be able to seamlessly integrate gpi into their platforms, extending the benefits of gpi to a wider range of corporates and markets.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s PoC will include bank and corporate participants. A prototype will be demonstrated at Sibos in London in September 2019.</p>

<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> –  Financial services group SBI Holdings is setting up a joint venture with R3 to push the distributed ledger technology specialist's Corda platform in Japan.</p>
<p>SBI, which is R3's largest outside shareholder, will take a 60% stake in the new SBI R3 Japan venture, which will launch with around $4.5 million in capital.</p>
<p>The unit will support licensing and implementation of the Corda platform and promote collaboration with overseas offices of R3 and other Corda partners. The partners also plan to move beyond Japan to other East Asian countries.</p>
<p>SBI has a similar joint venture in place with another major blockchain player, Ripple. Late last year the pair worked with a consortium of Japanese banks to launch a DLT-based mobile payments app.</p>
<p>R3 and Ripple have had an antagonistic relationship but have been playing nice since settling a legal dispute last year over technology contracts and joint venture agreements.</p>

<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – The stock exchange of the future will most likely be dominated by direct access platforms, reducing the traditional role played by brokers and other middlemen, and the arrival of Big Tech companies as issuing venues in their own right.</p>
<p>The five-to-ten year forecast comes from a new paper published by the Swiss Stock Exchange painting eight possible scenarios for the future of stock trading.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario assumes that listed asset classes will remain dominant but that mechanisms for trading shares will move to direct access primary markets, disrupting the business models of brokers and other intermediaries.</p>
<p>The study sees the number and variety of digitalized assets increasing exponentially and a new role for Big Tech as issuing venues to support activity in their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The likeliest scenario also illustrates the key role of new technologies, including artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, big data and cloud computing. According to the study, there will in general be a sharp increase in the level of automation along the entire value chain.</p>
<p>What remains unknown is where IT infrastructure is headed. Will central ledgers be replaced by distributed ledger technology? The authors are not very bullish on permissionless distributed ledgers becoming dominant, but nonetheless believe that they may leave a permanent mark in the securities value chain.</p>
<p>“It is vital to have a clear understanding of the challenges that lie ahead in order to be able to prepare for them today,” says CEO Jos Dijsselhof. “The white paper therefore aims to promote discussion and to inspire reflection on new business opportunities, especially in the interaction between start-ups and traditional players. It is important that we keep the debate on progress open and ongoing.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Armour Comms Survey highlights alarming lack of awareness around mobile security.</p>
<p>Armour Communications, a leading provider of specialist, secure communications solutions, has published the results from its Mobile Communications Survey. The findings revealed that a third (32%) of organisations use consumer grade apps such as WhatsApp, SMS and Skype for business communications. Over two thirds (68%) use these apps regularly every day and over a third (36%) use the apps to discuss sensitive and confidential topics.</p>
<p>The Survey also asked respondents to select from a list of different well known technologies, hacks and viruses which could be used to target mobile phones – nearly half (44%) answered incorrectly.</p>
<p>David Holman, Director at Armour Comms commented; “We see stories in the press on a regular basis about data leakage, sensitive customer data that is hacked by criminals, and yet, for most organisations managing how their staff are using their mobile phones remains a challenge. Consumer-grade apps, where the user has little control of what happens to their data, are often downloaded and used within organisations for sharing sensitive information, almost by stealth, because the IT/security department has no visibility of the apps being used.”</p>
<p>While viruses and malware on mobile phones are rare, tools for eavesdropping, such as IMSI catchers are increasingly within the reach of criminals that want to spy on others. Accordingly to the latest research by Ponemon, organisations have a nearly 28% chance of having a data breach in the next two years. In another report, social engineering is involved in over 90% of data breaches, where people are tricked into doing something, like clicking a link or providing data, to someone impersonating someone else.</p>
<p>Another pitfall for the unwary mobile user is WiFi which is often not as secure as people assume. All of these type of attacks are particularly easy to do with mobile phones where standard network encryption can be poor to non-existent, due to outdated infrastructure that is in parts well over 40 years old and probably no longer fit for purpose. This makes interception of mobile calls and messages much easier than it should be, and the user would be totally unaware until it was too late.</p>
<p>“In our experience end-users don’t deliberately put data at risk, they simply want to get on with their work, and extra security can cause an issue. The survey results highlight that many organisations are unaware of the pitfalls of using consumer grade-apps for sensitive corporate information, whether that is intellectual property and trade secrets, customer information, or details of commercial transactions.”</p>

<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Singapore and Hong Kong are often seen competing for the title of Asia's most important financial hub. This report analyses the state of digital transformation in banks in both cities based on their hiring activities in 2018.</p>
<h5>Top Hiring Singapore Banks Posted More Technology Roles Than Top Hiring Hong Kong Banks</h5>
<p>While the top hiring banks in Hong Kong generally hire more positions than the top hiring banks in Singapore, the banks in Singapore hire a much larger proportion of technology jobs, with 20% of job posting being a technology job, as compared to 5% in Hongkong.</p>
<p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x_5XU44nNkADjp66nCCpkDJBsT7JrkHG"">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x_5XU44nNkADjp66nCCpkDJBsT7JrkHG</a></p>
<h5>Banks with significant presence in both cities also hire a larger number of technology jobs in Singapore as compared to Hong Kong</h5>
<p>For instance, J.P. Morgan posted 640 technology jobs in Singapore and 170 in Hong Kong and DBS posted 630 technology jobs in Singapore and only 50 in Hong Kong. Given that these banks have a significant presence in Hong Kong, it could suggest that they are basing most of their digitisation efforts in Singapore.</p>

<h5>Business Intelligence/Analytics, Data Analytics and Application Engineering were the most sought-after technology domains among top hiring banks in Singapore and Hong Kong in 2018</h5>
<p>This is in line with banks' digital transformation initiatives and their push for analytics. The hiring trend for Business Intelligence/Analytics and Data Analytics positions is consistent across many of the large banks in recent years. J.P. Morgan and OCBC seem to follow this trend to a lesser extent in 2018. OCBC technological domains are more spread out in Singapore with a slightly stronger focus in Information Security while J.P. Morgan has a deeper focus on Application Engineering.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that there is a stronger focus on Information Security positions in top hiring Singapore banks than its counterparts in Hong Kong, which is another indication of digitising efforts in Singapore, given that cyber security plays a critical role in digitisation.</p>

<p>There are some similarities in terms of skills and domain knowledge areas across technological domains in Singapore and Hong Kong top hiring banks. Business Intelligence/Analytics positions focused on business and finance related domain knowledge, while Data Analytics positions focused more on popular programming, database management and statistical skills used in Data Science. Also, banks from both countries tend to look out for Java and Cloud skills sets for Application Engineering positions.</p>
<p>However, for the Data Analytics domain, there are more Big Data related technology skills such as Big Data and Hadoop in Singapore whereas Machine Learning Algorithms, SAS and R-Programming are more sought-after in Hong Kong.</p>
<h5>Singapore banks are ramping up on its technological expertise more intensely</h5>
<p>Not only are Singapore banks looking to hire more technological talents, they are also looking to hire for a wider variety of different domain expertise, which is often necessary for digitisation of a sector. The above analysis offers a glimpse into the different approaches two rival financial hubs are taking to improve their competitive advantage in the region.</p>
<p>By analysing skills requirements across domains, companies and geolocations, it is possible to glean deeper insights into companies hiring trends as well as workforce demands in countries.</p>

<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – TreasuryXpress, the global leader in <a href=""http://treasuryxpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">on-demand treasury management solutions</a> today announced its partnership with Ebury Partners, <a href=""https://www.ebury.com/"" target=""_blank"">a leading FinTech and global finance specialist</a> to empower mid-market treasuries with broader access to more cost-effective cross-border transaction banking services through intelligent end-to-end trading and treasury solution.</p>
<p>“Ebury exists to remove boundaries that traditionally prevent businesses from achieving their growth objectives,” says Thomas Fakhouri, Head of Technology Partnerships at Ebury. “Small and medium sized organizations often deal with significant FX and transaction banking complexities but lack the large banking resources and structures required to optimize and economize their FX programs.”</p>
<p>According to Tom Leitch, Chief Operating Officer of TreasuryXpress, this is where the joint offering comes into play.</p>
<p>“What we have created with our integrated solution, is a single platform where clients can handle the entire lifecycle of an FX trade,” notes Leitch.  “From accessing the best, most competitive rates to executing the trade and settlement through to creating the accounting entries, we have removed the cost and resource barriers associated with traditional FX trading.  We have enabled our clients to reduce the cost of their FX trading programs while optimizing their treasury management operations.”</p>
<p>Users of the solution access highly affordable rates for their FX trades powered by Ebury, while signed into TreasuryXpress.  Without ever leaving the TreasuryXpress treasury management system (TMS), users can book and confirm their FX trades.  Once the trade is confirmed, a forecast entry is automatically created in the TMS.  Clients reduce the cost of their FX trades while improving the accuracy of their cash forecasting and bank reconciliation efforts. Clients will also have full access to Ebury’s capabilities, such as multi-currency accounts, competitive international payments and trade finance.</p>
<p>The joint solution characterizes the on-demand technology model of TreasuryXpress. Powered by API protocols, the Ebury and TreasuryXpress partnership reduces the length of traditional TMS and FX solution integration and implementation projects.</p>
<p>“With this partnership, we have achieved an ‘integration-on-demand’ model,” continues Leitch.  “Many TMS providers have taken the route of acquiring FX risk management and currency solutions which often take months or years to integrate into a single solution. And in the end, it is usually the client that suffers from lengthy integration periods and costs.  With our model, clients can be up and running in a matter of days – accessing the best FX rates and streamlined technology experience available.”</p>
<p>Leitch concludes, “We are extremely pleased to partner with a FinTech innovator such as Ebury to deliver on our shared vision of making financial technology frictionless and accessible to the mid-market treasurer.”</p>
<p>According to both firms, the integrated offering has already been positively accepted in the mid-market by joint clients looking to gain better FX rates and cash management efficiencies.</p>

<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/"" target=""_blank"">Capgemini</a> today launched <a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/service/perform-ai?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=none_none_link_pressrelease_none&amp;utm_campaign=performai_ai"" target=""_blank"">Perform AI</a>, a new portfolio of solutions and services to assist organizations in achieving and sustaining tangible business outcomes by building and operating enterprise-grade artificial intelligence (AI) at scale. The portfolio provides customers with a complete set of solutions to infuse AI in their organizations, delivering operational excellence and business innovation for immersive, highly personalized experiences. Leveraging the full capabilities of the entire Group – from strategy and design through to global implementation and management – Perform AI brings together people, process, data and technology to realize superior, sustainable and trusted business performance.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/service/digital-transformation-review-11-artificial-intelligence-decoded/"" target=""_blank"">recent publication</a> from the <a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/research-institute/"" target=""_blank"">Capgemini Research Institute</a> highlighted that a mix of anxiety and ill-informed opinion is obscuring the risks and opportunities of implementing AI. Organizations therefore need a pragmatic approach to move forward. In terms of anticipated demand, IDC forecasts cognitive and AI spend will grow to $52.2 billion in 2021 and achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.2% over the 2016-2021 forecast period.</p>
<p>Perform AI has been designed to address the real opportunities and the critical challenges which companies confront today, whatever their maturity on data management and AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Applying AI at scale:</strong> Moving beyond proofs-of-concept and isolated deployments to industrialize AI across the enterprise, scaling the business benefits throughout the organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empowering people:</strong> Proactively managing the impact of AI initiatives on augmented workforces and seeking the best interactions between people and AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transforming operations and beyond:</strong> Applying AI-based technologies to assist, augment or automate operations, right through to reimagining business processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embedding ethics:</strong> Applying AI with an ethical and responsible approach; one that is transparent to users and customers, embeds privacy, ensures fairness, and builds trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spurring innovation for competitive advantage:</strong> Leveraging AI to introduce entirely new business models, ways of working, products, services, and experiences, offering legacy enterprises the opportunity to leapfrog their current market positions to ones previously reserved for digitally native enterprises only.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Most companies have already started to experiment with AI to help them transform certain functions within their business, but those that adopt it effectively and throughout the enterprise will gain true competitive advantage,” comments Lanny Cohen, Group Chief Innovation Officer at Capgemini. “To realize true real-world impact and ensure sustained success, companies need to move beyond isolated initiatives to infusing AI into everything they do – from simply changing technologies to shifting the entire game. With Perform AI, we are laser-focused on applying AI to achieve mission-critical, high business impact, resulting in tangible performance outcomes for today and in the future.”</p>
<p>Capgemini’s Perform AI portfolio comprises four core components, affording vital flexibility needed for bespoke roadmaps through to rollout of AI at scale across a business:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>AI ACTIVATE:</strong> Creates the strategic direction and the organization and technology platforms for where and how AI should be applied and adopted in the enterprise for maximum impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI TRANSFORM:</strong> Delivers AI-infused performance improvements to optimize existing business processes and to create the springboard for long term growth by introducing the right AI technologies and solutions among the vast and rapidly expanding volume of tools and solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI REIMAGINE:</strong> Draws upon the strategy and innovation capabilities within <a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/service/invent/"" target=""_blank"">Capgemini Invent</a> and Capgemini’s network of <a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/service/applied-innovation-exchange/"" target=""_blank"">Applied Innovation Exchanges</a> to help organizations envision new products and services, customer experiences, operating and business models, and revenue streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI ENGINEERING:</strong> Provides foundation services to ensure the enterprise’s data estate and governance deliver trusted AI solutions in production and at scale. AI Engineering addresses the operating core of AI – data underpins every stage of the transformation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To concentrate asset and solution creation as well as expert capability development, Capgemini has created a network of cross-practice AI Centers of Excellence (CoEs). These Perform AI CoEs are now operational in France, Germany and North America, all supported by a hub CoE in India. Geographical coverage of the Perform AI CoEs will be extended throughout 2019.</p>
<p>Markets of primary focus for Perform AI are the Manufacturing and Financial Services sectors, as well as the Customer Experience domain. Capgemini has worked closely with its extensive ecosystem of technology partners, start-ups and academia to build AI solutions that help address these specific industry needs, including a Manufacturing intelligence platform leveraging computer vision for quality defects prevention and machine learning for failure detection; cognitive analytics to address multi-dimensional underwriting risk in the Financial Services sector; or natural language processing, conversational interfaces and computer-vision based emotions recognition to predict and understand consumers needs with unmatched certainty.</p>
<p>With data privacy and security emerging as some of the most important priorities for businesses, it is vital that companies balance their AI innovation with efforts to secure and maintain the trust of their customers, partners, and employees. Capgemini’s Perform AI portfolio focuses on the ability to secure data and AI platforms.</p>
<p>Building on its existing recognition as one of the world’s most ethical companies, Capgemini has integrated ethics into the foundations of its Perform AI portfolio.</p>
<p>“We have launched Perform AI to enable organizations to augment operations and potentially reinvent their business at a time when they are expected to regularly meet and exceed customers’ expectations that are higher and more diverse than ever before,” concludes Anne-Laure Thieullent, AI and Analytics Group Offer Leader, Capgemini. “Through the application of AI technologies, our Perform AI solutions will increase the speed of execution and certainty of success for our clients’ AI initiatives, which are sometimes still fragmented and not exploited to their full potential. With Perform AI and the follow up releases of this new portfolio, we are dedicated to becoming the premier AI-infused consulting and technology services company and are excited to take our clients to the next stage of their journey to the Intelligent Enterprise.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Businesses in China are cautiously optimistic for 2019 despite facing a number of global and domestic uncertainties and challenges, with tax reform and innovation and technology policies expected to provide a boost to the economy and businesses, according to the latest China Economic Survey conducted by CPA Australia, one of the world's largest professional accounting bodies.</p>
<p>Over 60 per cent of respondents forecast that China will maintain stable economic growth above 6 per cent in 2019, despite rising global economic uncertainties created by trade tensions, Brexit, and rising US interest rates. This confidence is reflected in profit forecasts for 2019, with 56.8 per cent of respondents expecting their employer's profit to increase by more than two per cent. Further, 71.3 per cent believe that their company will maintain or increase its headcount in 2019.</p>
<p>Top factors influencing this positive sentiment are tax reform, policies guiding the transformation of China to an innovative and intelligence-led economy and the Belt and Road Initiative, according to the finance and accounting professionals responding to this survey.</p>
<h5>Tax reforms seen as an important driver of economic growth in 2019</h5>
<p>As part of an ongoing agenda to improve living standards, the Government introduced a series of tax reforms in 2018, while some policies, such as individual income tax reform, came into effect on 1 Jan 2019. The survey findings reveal that the market has reacted positively to these reforms, with over half of the respondents stating that tax reform will be one of the key drivers boosting economic growth this year.</p>
<p>Respondents believe the main benefits from tax reform include decreasing business operating costs, further encouraging China's economic transformation, increasing domestic consumption and making the tax system more robust. Individual income tax reform is also expected to help businesses, with almost one third of respondents expecting that this reform alone will increase their sales volume in 2019.</p>
<h5>Innovation and technology keep boosting growth</h5>
<p>The survey found that the Government policies guiding China's economic transformation and supporting innovation and technology are expected to not only continue to boost the economy but also support business growth.</p>
<p>Over half of respondents reported that their business's investment in technology in the past 12 months has already improved their profitability.</p>
<p>Businesses in China are also investing heavily in innovation, with 75.5 per cent of respondents expecting their company will or may introduce a totally new product, service or process in 2019, which is an increase of 10 per cent compared with the survey result in 2017. We see a direct link between the Government's policies and the very strong focus on innovation and technology by businesses in China.</p>
<h5>Going global strategy and opportunities from Belt and Road Initiative</h5>
<p>Though businesses are facing rising global economic uncertainties, the professionals who responded to this survey value the business opportunities created from China's opening-up and going abroad strategy. On the Belt and Road Initiative, most respondents believe it will create new investment opportunities for Chinese businesses outside of China and create more trade opportunities.</p>
<p>When asked the business's plan in response to the Belt &amp; Road Initiative over the next three years, over half of the respondents reported an expectation that their business will take some form of action to take advantage of the initiative, including exploring new business opportunities and increasing business activities in the countries along the Belt and Road.</p>
<p>Along with a global strategy and the internationalisation of the RMB, almost one quarter of respondents say that they expect their business will likely establish or expand their presence in other countries in 2019.</p>
<h5>Business strategy in 2019</h5>
<p>Given rising global uncertainties, it is no surprise that most businesses have chosen cost management as their key strategic focus in 2019. However, under the transformation to an intelligence-led environment in China, a very high number of respondents stated that their employer's strategic focus for 2019 is to attract, retain and develop talent. This reflects their optimism in the medium to long-term and their belief that talents are critical assets to enable the business's sustainability. When asked which skills were most valued by employers, respondents identified teamwork capability, technical skills and communication skills.</p>
<p>According to the survey findings, many businesses in China will this year be attempting to strike the right balance between short-term measures, such as cost management to address current challenges, and medium to long-term investments in staff, technology and innovation, which is essential to their future growth and success.</p>

<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – BlackRock is pleased to announce that our International Cash Management team successfully migrated all of our US Dollar and Sterling BlackRock Institutional Cash Series (ICS) money market funds in advance of the regulatory deadline of 21 January 2019.  In addition, two of the Euro ICS funds have been converted successfully as well.  This on-time conversion means that, effective 14 January 2019, clients were able to seamlessly transact in the funds under their new structures. Importantly, due to the guidance received from the Central Bank of Ireland, confirming that the Reverse Distribution Mechanism would not be allowed beyond 21 March 2019, the two BlackRock ICS Euro funds, which actively operate RDM, will only be converted in March 2019. </p>
<span>Peter Loehnert, Head of International Cash Management for BlackRock, says “We have been in constant dialogue with the CBI, our systems had been updated and fully tested, and clients had been communicated to. Thanks to many months of thorough preparation we were in the position to meet the expectations of our clients.  Given the circumstances, we believe going live with all US Dollar and Sterling funds ahead of the 21 January 2019 deadline and continuing to offer the RDM mechanism in the respective Euro funds for as long as practically possible is the optimal outcome for our clients. Our post-reform line up offers the full suite of fund structures in Sterling, US Dollar and Euro so that clients have flexibility, scale and choice between the daily liquidity short term money market funds and our standard money market funds.”</span>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> January 2019</strong> – SWIFT’s figures show an average of 31.31 million messages a day in 2018 as its annual traffic rose to an all-time high of over 7.8 billion. This marks an 11.3% increase on 2017 – and a 56% increase over the last five years.</p>
<p>Traffic growth was driven by the mass adoption of SWIFT gpi – which now accounts for over half (55%) of cross-border payment instructions carried on the network, only two years since its launch. </p>
<p>Growth in SWIFT’s payments traffic was strong in all regions as well as in domestic and cross-border segments. The cooperative also recorded a new peak traffic day in 2018, processing 35.22 million FIN messages on 31 May 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Gottfried Leibbrandt, CEO at SWIFT</strong>, said: “Our traffic increase is remarkable, and I’m delighted we’ve hit an all-time high of 35 million messages in a single day. This is not only indicative of the wider growth in the global economy, but also the financial services industry’s continued trust in SWIFT. The success of SWIFT gpi and its rapid adoption has played a key part in our increased annual message traffic, with well over a million payments a day now passing over gpi.”</p>
<p>During 2018, SWIFT’s gpi service, which is supported by hundreds of banks, including more than 50 of the world’s top banks, continued to radically transform correspondent banking and is now used to send over $300bn in payments every day – more than 55% of SWIFT’s cross-border traffic. SWIFT gpi has transformed the cross-border landscape with payments typically made within minutes or even seconds, and over 50% of SWIFT gpi payments credited to end beneficiaries within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of strong traffic growth, rapid adoption of SWIFT gpi, and the roll-out of real-time payments in Australia and the Eurosystem, SWIFT continued to demonstrate operational excellence, with 99.998% availability for its FIN and 99.999% availability for its SWIFTNet messaging services</p>
<p>InterAct saw a 12% growth in traffic in 2018 mainly driven by T2S, while FileAct traffic grew 8% in 2018 with the main contributor to this growth coming from increased activity from corporate customers.</p>
<p><strong>Yawar Shah, Chairman at SWIFT</strong>, said: “In 2018, SWIFT continued its core mission and commitment to its customers by ensuring high security and continued reliability. This was achieved against a backdrop of rolling out new capabilities such as the Payment Controls Service and instant payment solutions in Australia and Europe. I’m confident that in 2019 SWIFT will continue to accelerate this momentum across its payments, securities and financial crime compliance areas.”</p>

<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> January 2019 – </strong>Today, the EU finance ministers are due to meet following the European Union’s decision to adopt tougher anti-money laundering (AML) rules. This meeting is going to confirm proposals made by the European Commission in September to give more power to the European Banking Authority – aiming to interrupt and deny criminals access to financial resources.</p>
<p>The need for tighter rules follows a number of recent incidents involving money laundering in EU banks. In the last two years alone, the UK Financial Intelligence Unit received 634,113 suspicious activity reports. These incidents have sparked concerns that AML rules are not being correctly enforced around Europe.  According to identity verification experts at <a href=""https://www.trulioo.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Trulioo</a>, a more global approach to money laundering will help to reduce risk within the financial services sector. </p>
<p><strong>Zac Cohen, General Manager of </strong><a href=""https://www.trulioo.com/blog/global-compliance/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><strong>Trulioo</strong></a><strong> comments</strong>: “As banks and financial services operate on a global scale, it is more important than ever for organisations to face the reality of handling cross border transactions. With the increased globalisation of financial services, money laundering is becoming progressively widespread. Due to limited transparency and information sharing, banks and other financial institutions are vulnerable to financial crime. If proper anti-money-laundering procedures aren’t in place, these institutions face major consequences, such as large fines – or even imprisonment – and a rise in fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>“In order to transmit counterfeit funds through banks, bad actors are turning to more sophisticated techniques such as under or over-invoicing, falsifying documents and misrepresenting financial transactions.  </p>
<p>Zac continues; “Using state-of-the-art digital tools, such as automated systems and AI driven technology helps to streamline the process of checking and verifying the ultimate beneficial owners (UBO) of a business. This in turn can isolate the source of the funds and ensure compliance to regulations. Applying programmed systems when scouring company documents will help create an enhanced electronic ID verification system to certify personal information. Combining this with ID document checks and facial recognition technology will help to paint a full picture of each business.” </p>

<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> January 2019 </strong>– ING Bank has signed a major five-year deal with enterprise software firm R3, entitling the bank to an unlimited number of licenses for R3’s commercial blockchain platform, Corda Enterprise. The deal will allow ING to roll out access to Corda Enterprise throughout the bank globally and deploy production-ready CorDapps across a wide range of business areas.</p>
<p>CorDapps in production on Corda Enterprise cover a wide range of financial services activity including trade finance, identity, insurance and capital markets. Through this deal, ING will be able to adopt CorDapps across business areas within ING, enabling the wider adoption of Corda Enterprise. </p>
<p>Corda Enterprise is a commercial distribution of Corda, R3’s open source blockchain platform, designed specifically to meet the demands of modern-day businesses. Leveraging the unique features of Corda – privacy, consensus, interoperability, ease-of-integration – Corda Enterprise offers additional features targeted at the needs of large and complex organisations, such as the world’s only Blockchain Application Firewall, 24/7 support, dedicated product management and support for industry-standard enterprise databases.  </p>
<p>In addition to taking a proactive position on blockchain technology, ING has built a reputation widely as a leader in innovation in finance. It has built a large team exploring the benefits of technologies including blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.</p>
<p><strong>Annerie Vreugdenhil, Head of Innovation for wholesale banking at ING</strong>, said: “Our longstanding joint journey with R3 has proven that this is the most mature enterprise DLT solution to serve the needs of the financial service industry.

We are one step closer to deploying live DLT solutions for our clients with the supported infrastructure in place.”</p>
<p><strong>David E. Rutter, CEO of R3</strong>, said “ING has been an enthusiastic adopter of blockchain technology and a valued long-term partner to R3. For example, in trade finance, it was involved in the first live trade on Project Voltron. It was also one of the participants in the first live securities lending transaction on blockchain through HQLAx. As ING takes full advantage of access to Corda Enterprise, we look forward to seeing how the diverse CorDapp ecosystem can deliver gains in productivity, efficiency and profitability across the bank’s diverse business areas.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>21st January 2019</strong> – China’s 4Q GDP report showed real GDP growth came in line with expectations at 6.4%oya (J.P. Morgan and consensus: 6.4%), compared to 6.5%oya in 3Q. Based on our seasonal-adjustment process, in sequential terms the economy grew 6.1% q/q saar in 4Q, compared to 6.0% q/q saar in 3Q (for comparison, the NBS seasonally-adjusted series suggests 4Q GDP growth eased to 1.5% q/q sa, compared to 1.6% q/q sa in 3Q). Besides, in nominal terms, 4Q GDP rose 9.2%oya, compared to 9.4%oya in 3Q. The implied GDP deflator eased marginally to 2.6%oya in 4Q, compared to 2.7%oya in 3Q. For full year 2018, real GDP grew 6.6%yoy (compared to 6.8%yoy in 2017, which was revised downward from the previous print of 6.9%yoy).</p>
<p>In addition to the 4Q GDP report, the high frequency monthly activity data for December shows that, on the production side, IP growth picked up moderately <span>(at 0.5% m/m sa) in December. Regarding aggregate demand conditions, on the external front, December trade report came in notably weaker-than-expected, with slowing across exports (down 6.6% m/m sa) and imports (down 15% m/m sa). On domestic demand, retail sales recovered moderately in December as we expected, growing 0.6% m/m sa, following the disappointment in the previous two months. Meanwhile, fixed investment growth came in modestly below expectations, rising 5.9% for full-year 2018 (unchanged from the growth pace in Jan-Nov). In particular, infrastructure investment growth turned up modestly in December, while real estate FAI growth eased moderately, with manufacturing FAI holding on to a solid growth pace. </span></p>
<p>A few features of the latest economic landscape are worth noting. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regarding the structure of the economy, in fully year 2018, consumption contributed to 76.2% of headline GDP growth (vs. 57.6% contribution in 2017), investment contributed 32.4% (vs. 33.8% in 2017), while net exports subtracted 8.6% from headline growth (vs. +8.6% in 2017). Besides, service sectors constitute 52.2% of total GDP in 2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding latest momentum in the economy, on the production side, the sequential trend in IP growth picked up moderately to 0.5% m/m sa in December, compared to 0.2% m/m sa in November. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the external front, December exports fell notably by 6.6% m/m sa, adding to the decline of 3.4% m/m sa in November. Details suggest plunge in shipment to the US (down 10.3% m/m sa in December), likely to be partly related to US tariff measures. Meanwhile, broad-based slowing was registered for exports to other major markets as well, including shipment to EU (down 5.9% m/m sa) and Japan (down 3.0% m/m sa). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the domestic front, fixed asset investment rose 5.9%oya in full-year 2018 (and 5.9%oya in December alone). Infrastructure FAI had been the major factor dragging overall FAI growth earlier in the year. Following notable policy support since mid-year, infrastructure FAI growth has recovered moderately lately, rising 3.8%oya for the full year (vs. 3.7%oya in Jan-Nov). According to our estimate, for the month of December alone, infrastructure FAI grew 6.2%oya (compared to 4.4%oya in November). Besides, manufacturing FAI growth has shown solid growth in recent months, rising 9.5%oya in full year 2018 (unchanged from the growth rate in Jan-Nov). Meanwhile, the pace of growth in real estate FAI eased moderately to 7.4%oya in the month of December, compared to 9.7%oya in November. In addition, private sector FAI registered solid growth at 8.7%oya for full-year 2018 (unchanged from the growth rate in Jan-Nov). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the consumption side, following the disappointment in Oct-Nov, retail sales recovered moderately in December, rising 8.2%oya (or 0.6% m/m sa). In further details, the auto sector remained the key drag, as auto sales (unit of cars) fell 0.7% m/m sa in December. Meanwhile, retail sales ex-auto picked up nicely, rising 1.3% m/m sa in December, compared to 0.8% m/m sa in November. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labor market conditions seem to be relatively stable so far, as nationwide urban survey unemployment rate came in at 4.9% in December (compared to 4.8% in November, and 5.0% in December 2017). Regarding household income conditions, average nationwide household disposable income per capita (in real terms) rose 6.5%oya in full-year 2018, compared to the rise at 6.6%oya in the first three quarters. Besides, full year 2018 urban new job creation came in at 13.61 million (compared to the official target of 11 million, and new job creation at 13.51 million in 2017). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fine-tuning the 2019 growth trajectory: weaker 1Q followed by a modest recovery</h4>
<p>We have emphasized the downside risk to our current quarter GDP forecast in recent weeks. December trade activity was much weaker than expected, pointing at weaker-than-expected domestic as well as global demand. Today’s December activity report was mainly in line with expectations, especially regarding retail sales and FAI activity (if adjusted for lower-than-expected PPI in December), with IP holding up better than expected.</p>
<p>We revise down our current quarter growth forecast from 6.1%q/q saar to 5.9%q/q saar. The cut is mainly driven by weaker-than-expected export activity, probably reflecting the impact of US-China tariff war or rising uncertainty in trade environment and likely weaker-than-expected global demand. On the domestic front, we maintain our cautious view on investment but worry less about consumption. FAI may have a weak start in the year due to continuous softening in real estate investment, a temporary funding gap for local government sponsored infrastructure investment and expected easing in manufacturing investment. By contrast, consumption growth will benefit from the new tax code for household income (middle-income families will benefit the most) that has fully taken effect since January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>We also revise up our 2Q and 3Q growth forecasts to 6.2%q/q saar and 6.4%q/q saar (previously 6.0%q/q saar and 6.3%q/q saar), and maintain our 4Q growth forecast unchanged at 6.2%q/q saar. Our full-year 2019 growth forecast stays unchanged at 6.2%oya. The modest recovery is a bit stronger than previously forecasted for two reasons. First, policy easing has been bolstered in recent weeks, mainly on the fiscal and monetary policy fronts, and we expect more to come. In particular, on the fiscal side, following last year’s announcement of a tariff reduction (from 9.8% to 7.5%), an increase in tax rebate for exports, and lower individual income tax, the authorities announced a tax cut of 200 billion per year in 2019-2021 for small business, and we expect a significant VAT cut, fiscal subsidies on home appliance and auto purchases and expansion in fiscal deficit targets will be announced in the coming months. On the monetary policy front, we expect financial market interest rates will continue to move lower, with a likely cut in 7-day reverse repo rate in March and another 100bp RRR cut in early 2Q. TSF growth will likely bottom out in the coming months. While policy easing is broadly in line with our expectations, the magnitude and pace are supportive of a recovery that may start in mid-2Q.</p>
<p><span>Second, the US-China trade negotiation appears to be moving in a more constructive direction, and optimism for a trade détente is increasing ahead of China vice premier Liu He’s trip to the US on January 30-31. The working-level meeting in the first week of January and follow-up news suggested that a wide range of issues were discussed. In the last few days, Bloomberg reported that US officials are considering easing Chinese tariffs to hasten a trade deal, and China has offered to significantly increase imports from the US by a combined value to more than US$1 trillion by 2024. It seems that positive progress has been made in trade negotiation, although it remains unclear how gaps in structural issues such as IP protection, forced technology transfer, and other non-tariff issues will be addressed. We maintain our view that the March 1 deadline will likely be extended, but the probability of a full-blow tariff war (25% tariff on all Chinese imports by the US) in 3Q19 is lower than we previously assumed. The possibility of a partial deal is increasing. A partial deal does not add much upside risk to the medium-term growth outlook for China, given that it will involve China’s strong commitment to a significant increase imports from the US (hence the negative impact on trade balance will remain, although the shock will come less from exports and more from imports). In addition, non-tariff measures could replace tariff measures if structural issues are left open, and the negative impact on business sentiment and relocation of global supply chain will remain. The key difference, with a lower probability of a full-blown tariff war in 3Q, is that the impact will likely be evenly spread out rather than a sudden blow in 3Q. </span></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> February 2019</strong> – The Philippines, through the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA), unveils a comprehensive set of new rules governing cryptocurrencies in a bid to effectively regulate and protect investors.</p>
<p>CEZA has approved the Digital Asset Token Offering (DATO) regulations that cover the acquisition of crypto assets, including utility and security tokens. Under the new framework, CEZA is the principal regulating authority. The Asia Blockchain and Crypto Association (“ABACA”) is designated as a SRO to help implement and enforce the new rules.</p>
<p>“It is our goal to provide a clear set of rules and guidelines that will foster innovation yet ensure proper compliance by actors in the ecosystem. It is our hope that these set of regulatory innovations will take the digital asset sector one step closer to adoption and acceptance by institutions and the traditional financial system,” said Sec. Raul Lambino, CEZA administrator and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Under the rules, all DATOs must have proper offering documents with pertinent details on the issuer, project, and accompanying advice and certification of experts and DA Agents. Tokens must be listed on the licensed Offshore Virtual Currency Exchange (OVCE). Stakeholders must also have confirmed arrangements with accredited wallet providers and custodians.</p>
<p>The regulations cover three levels of DATO. Tier 1 involves assets and investments not exceeding $5M with payment made in digital tokens. Tier 2 covers $6M to $10M in investments, while Tier 3 covers investments exceeding $10M.</p>
<p>Utility tokens, also known as app coins or user tokens, give holders future access to the products or services offered by a company. Security tokens, meanwhile, are backed by real assets such as equity, shares of a limited partnership company, or commodities. These are used to pay dividends, share profits, pay interest or invest in other tokens or assets to generate profits for the token holders.</p>
<p>The power of the blockchain and digitization of securities and assets are seen to make a big impact on the fintech space in the long run. CEZA’s new DATO rules will provide much needed change to the industry and encourage innovators to use new technologies responsibly.</p>
<p>“The safeguards built into CEZA’s rules and system will lead to greater investor protection and transparency. The involvement of DA agents and experts bring in competent and neutral third parties into the process to help ensure issuers are truthful and accurate,” Lambino explains.</p>
<p>Lambino said CEZA has built an ecosystem of OVCEs where tokens of issuers can be listed. CEZA and ABACA have also approved wallet providers and insured digital asset custodians to ensure proper storage and governance of investor proceeds.</p>
<p>ABACA, as a newly-appointed SRO, will help the government regulate cryptocurrency companies by effectively converting industry players into enforcers. The SRO is enforcing a code of conduct among the members and reports to CEZA any breach, violations, or any matters relating to OVCE rules and regulations.</p>
<p>CEZA has emphasized that collaboration with locator fintech firms and industry players will help the government gain insights and keep up to date with innovations on the emerging markets. The economic zone authority is using research on national and international business standards to efficiently regulate the industries and licensees under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“The SRO model allows industry players to police its own ranks, while also promoting and protecting the interests of cryptocurrency investors. The rules will remain stringent in assessing the ethics and integrity of companies eyeing to launch Digital Asset Token Offerings” says Ma. Juanita Cueto, Chairperson of ABACA.</p>
<p>“CEZA is moving forward with its goal to develop the economic zone as the center of fintech firms in Southeast and Northeast Asia. The economic zone authority has already approved and issued provisional principal offshore virtual currency exchange licenses to 19 companies engaged in the blockchain ecosystem industries.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – <a href=""https://www.efficientip.com/"" target=""_blank"">EfficientIP</a>, a leading specialist in DNS security for service continuity, user protection and data confidentiality, today announced the results of its 2019 Global DNS Threat Report, sponsored research conducted by market intelligence firm IDC.</p>
<p>Over the past year, organizations faced on average more than nine DNS attacks, an increase of 34%. Costs too went up 49%, meaning one in five businesses lost over $1 million per attack and causing app downtime for 63% of those attacked. Other issues highlighted by the study, now in its fifth year, include the broad range and changing popularity of attack types, ranging from volumetric to low signal, including phishing, 47%, malware-based attacks, 39%, and old-school DDoS, 30%.</p>
<p>Also highlighted were the greater consequences of not securing the DNS network layer against all possible attacks. No sector was spared, leaving organizations open to a range of advanced effects from compromised brand reputation to losing business.</p>
<p>Romain Fouchereau, Research Manager European Security at IDC, says “With an average cost of $1m per attack, and a constant rise in frequency, organisations just cannot afford to ignore DNS security and need to implement it as an integral part of the strategic functional area of their security posture to protect their data and services.”</p>
<p>DNS is a central network foundation which enables users to reach all the apps they use for their daily work. Most network traffic first goes through a DNS resolution process, whether this is legitimate or malicious network activity. Any impact on DNS performance has major business implications. Well-publicized cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya caused financial and reputational damage to organizations across the world. The impact caused by DNS-based attacks is as important due to its mission-critical role.</p>
<p>The top impacts of DNS attacks － damaged reputation, business continuity and finances (See Figure 1 in ‘Detailed Findings’)</p>
<p>Three-in-five, 63%, of organizations suffered application downtime, 45% had their websites compromised, and one-quarter, 27%, experienced business downtime as a direct consequence. These could all potentially lead to serious NISD (Network and Information Security Directive) penalties. In addition, one-quarter, 26%, of businesses had lost brand equity due to DNS attacks.</p>
<p>Data theft via DNS continues to be a problem. To protect against this, organizations are prioritizing securing network endpoints, 32%, and looking for better DNS traffic monitoring, 29%.</p>
<p>David Williamson, CEO of EfficientIP summarized the research “While these figures are the worst we have seen in five years of research, the good news is that the importance of DNS is at last being widely recognized by businesses. Mainstream organizations are now starting to leverage DNS as a key part of their security strategy to help with threat intelligence, policy control and automation, thus building a good foundation for their zero trust plan.”</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> June 2019</strong> – Hire Intelligence’s recent <a href=""https://www.hire-intelligence.co.uk/office-technology"" target=""_blank"">survey</a> discusses the least popular pieces of office equipment and how employees really feel about company spending.</p>
<p>After surveying 2000 workers, the survey reveals some key ingredients to better employee productivity.</p>
<p>It often feels like there is more technology than ever to deal with in the course of our working lives. Contemporary offices are a forest of technology, with mobile phones, laptops, desktops, printers, scanners, screens and tablets all supposedly being utilised to make our lives easier. But, what do we actually need to get the job done? Hire Intelligence have conducted an in-depth survey into the tech office workers actually want, what they actually use and whether it is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.hire-intelligence.co.uk/office-technology"" target=""_blank"">survey</a> covers 4 key areas of concern: technology, flexibility, productivity and motivation. From unused tech and company overspend to laptop-lifestyles and in-demand upskilling opportunities, all bases are covered when it comes to the workforce of today and what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>Some key findings include:</p>
<p>Only 43% of office workers think that their computers are fit for purpose.</p>
<p>38% said that an office laptop would significantly improve their working life; followed by wireless charging points and tablets.</p>
<p>48% of office workers thought their company should spend extra revenue on improving office technology.</p>
<p>Throughout the survey, there were some surprising discoveries. One might not think that combined printer/scanner/copiers were quite so desirable, or that office music is actually more a hindrance than a help. Furthermore, after better financial remuneration, technology and training were the most popular areas for extra spending – suggesting that career development, great equipment and flexibility with their tech are more important to office workers than leisure activities, sustainability or childcare packages.</p>
<p>Speaking about the survey, Hire Intelligence General Manager, Mark Bates said that “this survey has thrown up some interesting considerations for business owners. It would appear that employees are incredibly tech-savvy, but aren’t being asked what is it they actually require. Business owners and managers may find this survey useful when it comes to employee satisfaction, cutting costs and managing overspend.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> July 2019</strong> – New research from <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> has revealed that the market dominance of banks in the delivery of corporate treasury services is under threat from non-bank market entrants. According to its survey of 380 corporate treasurers from enterprises across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), 70 percent believe that a shift from bank to non-bank services will take place within their organizations over the next two to five years – 16 percent say this shift has already taken place.</p>
<p>The survey findings, presented in a new report, Digital Disruption Comes to the Corporate Treasury, reveals that corporate treasurers are considering using non-bank service providers for a wide range of core services including payments (71 percent), FX platforms (67 percent), liquidity pools (67 percent) and trade and supply chain networks (56 percent).</p>
<p>The move is well underway: 76 percent of respondents say their business has already integrated with trade networks to link supply chain financing with payments. More widely, just 24 percent of respondents say they now exclusively use their bank to facilitate payments, with others choosing alternatives including SWIFT gpi (46 percent) and alternative cross-border payments services (43 percent).</p>
<p>The demand for non-bank corporate treasury services comes as treasurers look to leverage technology to drive value and enable real-time payments. When asked about their top priorities for the year ahead, the treasurers surveyed cite technology enablers such as real-time payments reporting (74 percent), cash management technology (66 percent) and risk management technology (58 percent). A significant proportion also note the opportunities on offer through more advanced technologies like AI and machine learning (40 percent) and mobile channels (31 percent).</p>
<p>Significantly, there appears to be strong demand for Open Banking-enabled services among corporate treasurers. In the Finastra survey, 29 percent said it was a key opportunity for their business in 2019; and when asked about the benefits of standardized APIs in the context of Open Banking and PSD2, European respondents cite factors such as lower costs (58 percent), cash visibility (55 percent), and new services being made available from non-bank market participants (53 percent). 83 percent of all respondents state they would like to use dedicated corporate APIs provided by their bank.</p>
<p>Anders Olofsson, Head of Payments, Finastra said, “Demand for convenient, real-time, digitally-enabled services has finally come to the corporate treasury. Treasurers are seeing first-hand the benefits of powerful technology platforms that use open APIs to connect cutting-edge services and are open to collaborating with third parties to benefit from these technologies. Banks need to act fast to strengthen their relationships with customers and offer the innovative services they demand.”</p>
<p>Microsoft and Accenture provided insights into the survey.</p>
<p>Patrice Amann, Regional Leader Financial Services Industry EMEA at Microsoft said, “As we move into a new era of open standards, APIs, and interconnected business models the cloud will underpin new business ecosystems that will enable corporate treasuries to thrive and their businesses to grow. Those that fail to participate in these ecosystems might stay behind and face risk of disruption.”</p>
<p>Gareth Wilson, Global Payments Lead at Accenture said: “Businesses are increasingly looking to their banks to become more connected in the digital economy, so they can better manage their businesses with faster real-time payments and open banking. We are moving into a world where transactions clear and settle within minutes and a number of technology players can supply vital business services. Banks will need to take care not to be demoted to the plumbing of payments and build on the trust they have with their commercial customers. Competition is heating up in the battle for the business customer.”</p>

<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> June 2019</strong> – Sectigo (formerly Comodo CA), the world’s largest commercial Certificate Authority (CA) and a provider of purpose-built and automated PKI management solutions, today released findings from its latest Secure Impressions: Online Banking Study, revealing how well <a href=""https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/the-world-s-100-largest-banks"" target=""_blank"">the world's largest banks</a> in North America and Europe ensure and demonstrate security of customer information on their online banking websites. The study found that a notable percentage of banks left customers vulnerable to phishing scams.</p>
<p>Sectigo rated websites based on the presence of <a href=""https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-certificate"" target=""_blank"">SSL certificates</a> – verifications provided by a Certificate Authority (CA), which confirm that a website is authentic and legitimate. In North America, 40% of banks studied did not receive the highest rating, exemplified by the use of Extended Validation (EV) certificates to demonstrate the website’s true, authenticated identity. In Europe, 25% of banks did not receive the highest rating.</p>
<p>Sectigo rated each bank’s website according to the type of certificate used to secure the home and login pages for the bank’s online banking service. Full marks (green status) were awarded for the presence of Extended Validation (EV) SSL certificates and the maximum level of identity verification on the home and login pages.</p>
<p>Websites without an EV certificate on the home and/or login pages, received a lesser rating (yellow status). No banks in the study displayed “Not Secure” warnings, which would warrant a red status.</p>
<p>Given the extent and value of personal and financial data managed by the world’s leading financial services companies, and the fact that <a href=""https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-certificate"" target=""_blank"">76% of data breaches are financially motivated</a>, it is critical for banking customers to feel assured of the authenticity of their bank’s websites. In fact, <a href=""https://sectigo.com/uploads/resources/EVCertificates_DevOpsGlobalResearch.pdf"" target=""_blank"">90% of consumers</a> report worrying about having their online financial accounts hacked.</p>
<p>Sectigo has conducted similar Secure Impressions studies for the world’s top <a href=""https://sectigo.com/blog/how-to-make-sure-the-travel-sites-you-visit-are-safe"" target=""_blank"">travel</a> sites, as well as the UK’s most popular retail e-commerce sites.</p>
<p>“Online criminals routinely use counterfeit websites to trick consumers into unknowingly providing valuable information such as account logins, credit card numbers, and personally identifiable information that can be used for identity theft,” said Tim Callan, Senior Fellow, Sectigo. “To give customers peace of mind, financial institutions can deploy <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate"" target=""_blank"">Extended Validation</a> SSL certificates to</p>
<p>communicate the bank’s verified identity to site visitors right in the browser’s interface. The findings of our study serve as a reminder for banks to pay attention to their online presence, not only to protect customers from phishing, but also to convey that necessary protections are in place.</p>
<h4>Added Protection from Phishing</h4>
<p>Phishing and pretexting represent <a href=""https://www.phishingbox.com/assets/files/images/Verizon-Data-Breach-Investigations-Report-2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">93% of breaches</a>. Phishing is a cyberattack that is designed to fool a victim into believing the phisher is a specific, trusted party for the purpose of stealing credentials, accessing sensitive data, or propagating malware. EV, indicated by a company-branded address bar, helps to increase site transactions and protects users against phishing. EV shows customers that the website employs the best-of-breed security measures to protect transactions and ensure compliance with standards and regulations.</p>
<p><a href=""https://sectigo.com/uploads/resources/EVCertificates_DevOpsGlobalResearch.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Eight out of 10</a> people report that the presence of EV influences their perception of a brand or company and half indicate it has a significant influence. EV SSL validates that the identity of the certificate owner is reliably authenticated using the best practices available. Before issuing an EV certificate, the issuing CA must perform a specific, audited authentication process using techniques that are proven effective based on a decade of industry-wide use.</p>
<h4>Tips for Online Banking Customers</h4>
<p>When completing any online transaction or engaging with email, Sectigo recommends that customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look for the full company name at the left of the address bar to ensure the site is really part of the intended online business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never input credit card numbers, personal information, logins, or other sensitive data on any web page that is not secured with a certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using email, avoid clicking on links in unsolicited, inbound emails to avoid phishing scams.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> July 2019</strong> – State Street Global Advisors, the asset management business of State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT), today announced the launch of the State Street ESG Liquid Reserves Fund (the “Fund”) which seeks to apply financially material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores to the management of the Fund. The Fund is the first money market fund to offer a portfolio composed entirely of investments that meet ESG criteria at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to apply State Street Global Advisors’ longstanding ESG commitment to the launch of this fund, which provides the first fully ESG-focused money market fund option by incorporating sustainable investing within a cash strategy,” said Pia McCusker, global head of Cash Management at State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>The Fund uses R-FactorTM, State Street Global Advisors’ new ESG scoring system that draws on multiple data sources and leverages widely accepted and transparent materiality frameworks to generate a unique ESG score for issuers.  In particular, R- FactorTM leverages the Sustainability Account Standards Board’s (SASB) and country-specific corporate governance frameworks and provides transparency into how and what State Street Global Advisors considers to be financially material ESG factors.</p>
<p>The Fund invests in prime money market instruments that meet State Street Global Advisors’ ESG criteria. The portfolio construction process is a multi-step method involving fundamental risk budget allocation, optimization, and ESG assessment. The Fund, which is domiciled in the United States and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”), will have a floating net asset value and will be managed and operated to comply with Rule 2a-7 of the Act.</p>
<p>“As appetites for ESG investment opportunities continue to grow, institutional investors need options across all asset classes. There’s currently an industry-wide lack of ESG data that is financially material, consistently reported, and comparable across firms; using the R-FactorTM scoring system allows us to address this critical issue by incorporating State Street Global Advisors’ expertise,” said McCusker. “This is only the beginning for the application of R-FactorTM as we explore further ESG-related opportunities at the institutional level.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>July 2019</strong> – Finance professionals have seen their workload increase and little extra resource added to cope with GDPR since its implementation over a year ago, according to recent research released.</p>
<p>The research carried out recruitment specialists, Reed Accountancy and Finance, surveyed more than 1,000 finance professionals, and found that although almost half (48 per cent) of those asked saw their workload increase as a direct result of the new regulations. Only a quarter (26 per cent) said additional staff members had been hired to help cope with the larger workload.</p>
<p>Finance professionals time was further squeezed by 61 per cent stating that their organisation had not invested in any specialist technology to help manage with GDPR. Despite this, professionals are confident of compliance with 80 per cent of respondents saying their company has changed enough to fully comply with GDPR and 83 per cent feeling they know enough about the regulation.</p>
<p>Rob Russell, director of Reed Finance, comments: “Although the changes that were made to GDPR last year sent a shockwave of anxiety throughout the finance industry, it’s clear from our latest #BigQuestion research that the majority of organisations believe they’re successfully complying with the new regulations. However, it has come at the cost, with employees experiencing an increase in their workloads, combined with a lack of support through investment in new technology. This increased pressure may well lead to errors being made elsewhere in the business, or alternatively, valued employees who understand GDPR or have talent in other areas leaving the company.</p>
<p>“Data is now an invaluable asset to businesses, and one which they must prioritise. By making the investment, firms can avoid these potential issues and save themselves money in the long term by avoiding fines and costly mistakes. A starting point would be to ensure the responsibility of compliance is the responsibility of everyone through with relevant training and efficient processes. Businesses will only continue to generate and receive more data, and workloads will continue to increase. While the majority are confident about their GDPR knowledge, there are still 17 per cent that don’t feel they know enough about GDPR. This adds stress to the job and highlights the room for improvement that can be made to ease these pressures. If not, businesses may pay the price later down the line.”</p>

<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> August 2019</strong> – Almost half of the class of 2019 in the UK won’t get a graduate-level job and will remain underemployed, latest figures show.</p>
<p>The state of the graduate market, 2019:</p>
<p>About 800 000 will graduate this year in the UK (HESA, 2018).</p>
<p>380 000 of them will be underemployed, taking jobs that do not require a degree (CIPD, 2017).</p>
<p>Of the 420 000 graduates who do land a graduate-level job, 250 000 will be within tech/digital and IT roles (Graduate Coach, 2019).</p>
<p>This data has been compiled by <a href=""https://graduatecoach.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Graduate Coach</a> – the UK’s leading graduate coaching company. They have successfully coached 500+ students and graduates helping them to secure graduate-level jobs at a wide range of organisations including Deloitte, Google, IBM, The NHS and more.</p>
<p>In response to these findings, Graduate Coach has collaborated with CV-Library to commission research to gain a better understanding of why graduates are struggling to find graduate jobs that match their level of education.</p>
<p>A survey of 1500 graduates revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>90% found it difficult to work out what job would suit them best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>86% found it difficult to write a good CV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>85% find interviews difficult and nerve-wracking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>85% admitted needing work experience before entering the workforce.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://graduatecoach.co.uk/team/chris-davies/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Davies</a>, the founder of Graduate Coach said:</p>
<p>“This is a sad reality for the graduates and the country because it involves wasted potential.”</p>
<p>He also reveals: “there are three main reasons why the 48% of graduates will fail to get suitable work: They don’t know which careers will suit them best, they cannot write good achievement-based CVs and need to acquire interview skills.”</p>
<p>Chris has been coaching students, graduates and career changers for the past decade.</p>
<p>It is his mission to get more graduates into the right graduate-level job.</p>
<p>He achieves this via his 6-stage 1-2-1 coaching programme (<a href=""https://graduatecoach.co.uk/one-to-one-coaching/"" target=""_blank"">https://graduatecoach.co.uk/one-to-one-coaching/</a>), online coaching programmes, his 2 published books (The Student Book (<a href=""https://www.austinmacauley.com/book/student-book"" target=""_blank"">https://www.austinmacauley.com/book/student-book</a>)) and (The Graduate Book (<a href=""https://www.austinmacauley.com/book/graduate-book"" target=""_blank"">https://www.austinmacauley.com/book/graduate-book</a>)) and more.</p>

<p>Headline updates include an examination of how businesses are looking to payables finance as a way to offset the impact of economic volatility – not only on themselves, but also on their suppliers. As a result, more and more companies are looking to set up programmes – and extend the benefits to as many suppliers as possible in a bid to bolster supply-chain resilience.</p>
<p>“Traditionally, payables finance programmes have been the preserve of large investment-grade buyers,” says Daniel Schmand, Global Head of Trade Finance at Deutsche Bank. “But as uncertainty bites, we are increasingly seeing non-investment-grade companies looking to set up their own programmes as well in a bid to protect their suppliers and improve their own liquidity. This has always been done, but the prevailing environment is bringing the benefits into sharper focus.”</p>
<p>The paper also addresses the headwinds faced by the payables finance industry. In 2018, for instance, the warning signs of British construction company Carillion’s financial collapse were, in part, obscured by its use of payables finance in the form of its “Early payments facility”. This put the accounting practices of payables finance programmes in the spotlight, with Anil Walia, EMEA Head of Supply Chain Finance at Deutsche Bank, explaining that “further clarity of the product offering, and structure is needed to avert the danger of a negative watershed event for the supply chain finance business.”</p>
<p>Despite such challenges, payables finance continues to find new ways to be a force for good. In the past year, much discussion has centred on the implementation of sustainable business practices across global supply chains. Conscious of the benefits from both a brand and business perspective, innovative companies have begun to offer incentivised rates of financing to suppliers that meet certain sustainability criteria.</p>
<p>The updated guide also incorporates a new case study with consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble, as well as a closer analysis of the accounting treatment of payables finance programmes, the often-overlooked benefits to suppliers and the huge potential of integrating sustainability goals into the supply chain through incentivised payables programmes. These are all informed by a roster of expert contributors covering all areas of the supply chain finance landscape – rounding out a comprehensive overview of that serves as resource for the entire industry.</p>
<p>Contributors include Daniel Schmand, Chair of the ICC Banking Commission and Global Head of Trade Finance, Deutsche Bank; Alexander Malaket, President, OPUS Advisory Services International and Deputy Head of the Executive Committee ICC Banking Commission; Geoffrey Wynne, Partner, Head of Trade and Export Finance, Sullivan; Enrico Camerinelli, Senior Analyst, Aite Group; Sean Edwards, Chairman, International Trade &amp; Forfaiting Association (ITFA); and Dr. Rebecca Harding, CEO, Coriolis Technologies.</p>
<p>Daniel Schmand concludes, “By providing insights into the ever-evolving questions of our clients, we have sought to provide an update on the state of play and an outlook on how upcoming trends might shape the industry in the years to come. We hope it is useful and can stimulate further discussion of how we can progress the industry.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>16<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – SWIFT has today published a standard for ‘Pay Later’ APIs in a key step toward enabling the rapid adoption of an innovative new consumer payment model.</p>
<p>‘Pay Later’ is an instant online payment facility which offers customers the ability to use traditional bank loan financing to pay for goods purchased online. By selecting Pay Later at the point of purchase, customers are provided with available loans from their banks; they can then select and initiate a loan, knowing that the funds can immediately be credited to the merchants and items dispatched. By offering the Pay Later option, merchants are in turn able to offer a wider variety of purchase options and to reach a wider consumer audience, whilst still ensuring surety of payment.</p>
<p>By publishing an API standard for ‘Pay Later’, which is formally called the Transactional Finance Application Programming Interface, SWIFT is facilitating the widespread adoption of this new payment model by both merchants and banks around the world. Using this single standard, merchants will be able to implement the Pay Later option ensuring they are able to reach multiple banks around the world and avoid multiple costly implementations.</p>
<p>Stephen Lindsay, Head of Standards at SWIFT said: “SWIFT has long been at the forefront of banking standardisation and is continuing this work in the API world. Our work on Pay Later is a good example of how standardisation plays a vital role in ensuring the industry can take every advantage of technological innovation.”</p>
<p>Tony McLaughlin, Managing Director, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi said: “The launch of Pay Later API will support banks’ transition into the world of digital platforms. The API will enable banks to maintain the vital lending relationship, whilst driving growth of the global digital economy. Citi believes that the introduction of this interface will provide the basis for future innovations in platform banking.”</p>
<p>Anne Carøe Hald, Global Head of Payments Products at Danske Bank said: “Pay Later is an opportunity for banks to serve their customers better; to offer appropriate finance where and when customers need it. The ability to provide services in this way – seamlessly integrated in customers’ on-line lives – will be key for banks to thrive in the digital economy.”</p>
<p>Christer Holloman, CEO at Divido said: “New digital ecosystems are emerging that create magical customer experiences for millions. Financial services will be part of that transformation and become invisible enablers of the customer journey. Banks need to embrace fintech partnerships and standardised APIs for retail and wholesale banking to secure their role in the digital economy.”</p>
<p>In fulfilling its established role as a trusted standards setter, SWIFT provides a neutral venue for collaboration, standards and payments business expertise – as well as a platform for capturing, publishing and testing specifications that ensures all participants can contribute with confidence.</p>
<p>The working group on the Pay Later API standard includes banks, merchants and technology providers. This group will continue to work together to evolve the standard API specifications and rulebook. The aim is to create the conditions for a broad ecosystem of the Pay Later platform to provide optionality to customers, to give merchants a greater ability to sell their goods and to ensure a wide reach for banks. By re-using business definitions from the established ISO 20022 messaging standard that it manages, SWIFT ensures that data specified in APIs is compatible with the messages used to clear and settle instant payments, simplifying data integration for both banks and merchants</p>
<p>SWIFT welcomes contributions from industry participants to continue evolving the Pay Later standard. With the publication for version one of the specification, multiple participants, including merchants, marketplaces, fintechs and banks will be able to begin working on live pilots. The parties foresee an ongoing collaboration between industry participants to develop value added API standards to drive the growth of the digital economy.</p>

<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Technology seen as the greatest opportunity for organizations despite concerns about Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>Sword GRC, a supplier of specialist risk management software and services, has published the latest findings from its annual survey of global risk managers. Almost 150 Risk Managers from highly risk-aware organizations worldwide were canvassed for their opinions. Overall, cybersecurity was seen as the biggest risk to business by a quarter of organizations. In the UK, Brexit and the resulting potential economic fall-out was cited as the biggest risk to business by 14% of Risk Managers. The most notable regional variation was in the US where 40% of organizations see cybersecurity as the most threatening risk. The most lucrative opportunities for business were the benefits and efficiencies achieved by harnessing technology followed by expansion into new markets or sectors.</p>
<p>The Risk Managers were also asked about their acknowledgement and preparations for Black Swans (an event that is highly unlikely to materialize but if it did, would have a substantial impact). In both the US and UK, a major terrorist attack on the business is seen as the most likely Black Swan (UK 29% and US 35%), however, in Australia/New Zealand, only 13% of Risk Managers thought that one was likely. The next most likely Black Swan in the US is a natural disaster, with 48% of Risk Managers thinking it was likely or highly likely. This figure was 33% in Australia and New Zealand, and in the UK, where there are fewer adverse weather events, and no major fault lines in the earth’s crust, this figure was just 27%.</p>
<p>In the UK, Risk Managers were far more wary of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with 23% thinking it likely or highly likely that AI could get out of control. In the US this figure was 15%, and in Australia/New Zealand they clearly take a far more sanguine view with no one surveyed thinking AI was a risk.</p>
<p>Keith Ricketts, VP of Marketing at Sword GRC commented; “We are delighted to see the Active Risk Manager Survey going from strength to strength with a record number of responses in 2018. As Risk continues to grow in importance and influence in the Boardroom, we have this year focused on the biggest threats and most lucrative opportunities facing business. That cybersecurity is now recognised as the single biggest risk for many organizations is no surprise to us, as it supports the anecdotal evidence we have seen working with our clients in some of the most risk aware industries globally.</p>
<p>“Technology is a great enabler and that has never been more true. The feedback we have from our Risk Managers is that information technology is the key to almost every opportunity for business going forward, whether that is supporting expansion into new markets and geographies, streamlining processes to gain efficiency or harnessing big data and artificial intelligence to power product development and business performance.”</p>
<p>Active Risk Manager is the market-leading Enterprise Risk Management platform for global organizations in sectors such as energy, oil &amp; gas, critical national infrastructure, construction, transportation, aerospace and defense.</p>
<p>Black Swan – In traditional enterprise risk methodologies the assessment of this type of risk using a ‘likelihood x impact’ rating would potentially exclude it from the category of risk in risk appetite terms that ‘must be mitigated’. This could mean that organizations fail to plan for if the absolute worst were to happen.</p>

<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – HSBC says its use of distributed ledger technology over the last year to settle more than three million foreign exchange transactions has proved a big hit.</p>
<p>The bank has used its HSBC FX Everywhere platform to orchestrate payments across its internal balance sheets, making more than 150,000 payments worth $250bn.</p>
<p>Using a shared permissioned ledger, which provides singularity, transparency and immutability, transforms the process around intra-company foreign exchange activity, says HSBC, automating several manual procedures and reducing reliance on external settlement networks.</p>
<p>Richard Bibbey, interim global head, FX and commodities, HSBC, says: ""The global, cross-border nature of HSBC and its clients sees us conducting thousands of foreign exchange transactions within the bank, across multiple balance sheets, in dozens of countries. HSBC FX Everywhere uses distributed ledger technology to drastically increase the efficiency of these internal flows.</p>
<p>""Following successful implementation inside the bank, we are now exploring how this technology could help multinational clients – who also have multiple treasury centres and cross-border supply chains – better manage foreign exchange flows within their organisations.""</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>14<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Total business volumes in the financial services sector fell slightly in the three months to December, marking the first contraction of demand since September 2013. That’s according to the latest <a href=""http://cdn.roxhillmedia.com/production/email/attachment/710001_720000/Embargoed 0001 hrs Mon 14 Jan - Financial Services Survey data.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CBI/PwC Financial Services Survey</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sentiment among financial services deteriorated further, rounding off three full years of flat or falling optimism.</p>
<p>The quarterly survey of 84 firms reveals a marked divergence in business conditions between sub-sectors, with sentiment holding up among insurers amid a continued expansion in their business volumes. By contrast, volumes were flat or falling for banks, building societies and specialist lenders, while investment managers report the steepest fall in activity since the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Overall business volumes are expected to fall at a similar pace over the quarter to March, the first-time growth expectations have turned negative since December 2009. Financial services firms - particularly banks, building societies and general insurers - see macroeconomic uncertainty as the most important challenge over the year ahead, ahead of regulatory compliance and preparing for the impact of Brexit.</p>
<p>Profits in the financial services sector as a whole were remained flat for a third successive quarter, reflecting little change in business volumes and costs. Investment managers and general insurers reported declining profitability. In the three months to March, overall profitability is expected to fall for the first time in over three years, as a result of a more widespread deterioration in expectations across the industry.</p>
<h5>Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, said:</h5>
<p>“A combination of macroeconomic and Brexit uncertainty, regulatory compliance and global market volatility are taking a toll on the UK’s financial services sector. Financial services are a bellwether for the wider economy. The persistent weakness in optimism and the deterioration in expectations sound a warning for the outlook.</p>
<p>“It’s clear the sector is grappling with a number of other challenges too, from using data to improve customer experiences, to new entrants to the sector. However, with new risks and demands come opportunities. Insurers in particular are pulling ahead, many of whom are moving into areas such as asset management outside of their traditional markets.”</p>
<h5>Andrew Kail, Head of Financial Services at PwC, said:</h5>
<p>“Continued economic and political uncertainty means last year ended on a more pessimistic note than previous quarters for many working in UK financial services. It's a broad industry, meaning optimism varies between sub-sectors and companies, but this survey shows that investment managers, who have been more immediately impacted by volatile stock markets, are gloomiest heading in to 2019.</p>
<p>“The underlying reasons for this dip in optimism have been around for some time – political and Brexit-related uncertainty, regulatory pressures and a sustained low interest rate environment impacting margins. Competition from established peers as well as new market entrants is also high on companies' radars.</p>
<p>“UK financial services firms looking to prosper in 2019 should concentrate on issues they can control. Most importantly, by focusing on clear strategies for delivering value through products and services which meet their customers' needs, maximising the efficiency of delivering these services - keeping operating costs under control - and using technology to augment the quality and efficiency of activities across their business.”</p>
<p>Despite this outlook, firms expect to increase headcount in the quarter to March and investment intentions for the year ahead remain broadly stable. Financial services firms plan to raise spending on marketing and IT at robust rates, and capital spending in other areas is expected to be unchanged. Firms indicated that efficiency and replacement were the main drivers of investment, alongside statutory legislation and regulation.</p>
<p>Although growth in compliance spending continues to moderate, the regulatory environment is seen as the most important constraint on business expansion in the year ahead. Banks, insurance brokers and finance houses were most dissatisfied when asked whether regulators are keeping pace with digital innovations (such as digital documents, on-line platforms or apps) that could help support regulatory implementation and compliance. Common data standards/formats are seen as the most important digital innovation regulators could adopt in the next 18-24 months to help reduce the costs of regulatory implementation and compliance.</p>
<p>The more pessimistic outlook for the financial services sector in the near term is in keeping with the subdued prospects for the wider UK economy, with GDP growth expected to be held back by weak household income growth and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on investment.

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – To keep global warming below 1.5°C, The Liveability Challenge connects promising innovators with investors and industry leaders to realise sustainable solutions for tropical cities.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.theliveabilitychallenge.org/"" target=""_blank"">Liveability Challenge</a> today launched a global call for innovative clean energy and circular economy solutions for cities in the tropics, dangling Asia’s biggest prize for sustainability solutions with up to S$1m in project development funds, as well as exclusive crowdfunding campaigns and mentorship opportunities up for grabs.</p>
<p>The need for transformative action has never been greater. Humanity only has 12 years to curb its carbon emissions and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius—or risk an irreversible climate crisis. Beating this 12-year climate deadline and providing better lives for Asia’s growing urban populations will take a drastic reduction in our energy footprint and moving to a circular economy.</p>
<p>From 10<sup>th</sup> January to 5<sup>th</sup> April 2019, The Liveability Challenge is calling for ground-breaking energy and circular economy solutions that apply to tropical cities such as Singapore. Finalists will get to pitch their ideas at The Liveability Grand Finale in June, and stand to secure up to S$1m in funding, fundraising opportunities and mentorships with key investors and industry leaders.</p>
<p>Says Mr Lim Hock Chuan, Chief Executive, Temasek Foundation Ecosperity: “More action is needed as the world seeks to accelerate the transition to a decarbonised and resource-efficient future. Temasek Foundation Ecosperity champions sustainability and liveability. Together with our partners, we hope to get more people on board and help game-changing solutions get the funding and support they need to be commercialised, and in time to come, make a big, positive difference to our collective living environment.”</p>
<p>The Challenge is presented by Temasek Foundation Ecosperity and organised by Eco-Business, in partnership with Ecosperity Week 2019. A total of 28 partners from business, civil society and government are supporting The Liveability Challenge, including Envision Digital, GoMassive, Circular Economy Club, FundedHere, SGInnovate, Danfoss, Nordic Innovation House, Global Green Growth Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and more.</p>

<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Average advertised salaries for finance professionals have increased for the third year in a row, despite uncertainty in the industry, according to new data from the 2019 Reed Finance Salary Guides.</p>
<p>Analysis of more than 10m jobs posted across sectors since 2015 found that the average salary advertised within the finance profession increased by 2.0% since the start of 2018, one of the highest rates across the sectors analysed. However, this is a decline from the growth rate during 2017 (3%).</p>
<p>The continued growth of salaries for finance professionals in the past 12 months is led by senior roles such as finance director, which has increased by an average of 3.2% to £91,000 per annum, and group financial controller (3.7%). Financial analysts have also seen advertised salaries increase 3.6%. This highlights the demand for finance professionals who can lead from the front, as well as those who can analyse big data and apply the findings in a useful way.</p>
<p>Rob Russell, director of Reed Finance, says: “Uncertainty is the big theme across all sectors, and finance isn’t an exception. A survey we conducted earlier in the year revealed that nearly a third of finance professionals believe their business is ‘not prepared at all’ for Brexit. We’re seeing requests for financial professionals who can offer clarity amid the uncertainty – in other words, a safe pair of hands. Financial directors, chief financial officers and people who can direct finance will be key.</p>
<p>“This uncertainty will also likely impact the recruitment of permanent staff, so the interim and contract market will be busier for a while. We don’t have a crystal ball, but what we’re hearing from clients is that they plan to rely on shorter-term contracts before committing to recruiting on a permanent basis.”</p>
<p>Regionally, the largest average increases happened in the West Midlands, where advertised salaries rose by 3.2%. Finance directors and financial analysts in the region have experienced the biggest change, with an 8.3% and 9.2% increase in advertised salaries respectively.</p>
<p>Rob Russell continues: “Overall, people need clarity, particularly in times of economic and political uncertainty. Finance and accountancy can help businesses prepare for the future — despite the challenges ahead, we predict a lot of activity in the market.”</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – With Brexit on the horizon, UK challenger bank Starling is setting up an Irish subsidiary that will let it move into European markets, beginning with France and Germany.</p>
<p>The previously announced subsidiary will protect Starling’s passporting rights, enabling it to operate across the EU, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p>In a blog, Starling chief Anne Boden says the bank is targeting expansion in Ireland before moving on to the French and German markets.</p>
<p>Boden is also seeking to reassure UK customers worried about the “uncertainty” caused by Brexit, revealing “we’re putting contingency plans in place to ensure that normal service to customers is not interrupted”.</p>
<p>Starling is hoping for a big 2019, aiming to hit one million customers and launch a host of new products and services, including Euro accounts for UK residents, credit cards and expanded lending options.</p>
<p>Concludes Boden: “I’m glad I didn’t listen to those who told me in 2014, ‘Nobody just starts a new bank, it can’t be done’. Well we did and the success of these past five years shows that it can.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Ripple, provider of leading enterprise blockchain solutions for payments, announced today that 13 new financial institutions have signed up for the company’s payment network, RippleNet.</p>
<p>The companies include Euro Exim Bank, SendFriend, JNFX, FTCS, Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Transpaygo, BFC Bahrain, ConnectPay, GMT, WorldCom Finance, Olympia Trust Company, Pontual/USEND and Rendimento. With these additions, there are now more than 200 customers signed up for RippleNet.</p>
<p>JNFX, SendFriend, Transpaygo, FTCS and Euro Exim Bank will leverage the digital asset XRP to source liquidity on-demand when sending payments on behalf of their customers. Using XRP for liquidity when sending a cross-border payment helps financial institutions avoid the hassle of pre-funding accounts in destination currencies. It allows them to make faster, lower cost payments than they can through the traditional correspondent banking system.</p>
<p>For the financial institutions on RippleNet not currently using XRP for liquidity but interested in immediate settlement—such as CIMB or Olympia Trust Company—they are able to leverage Ripple’s technology and modern APIs for faster, lower cost and more transparent payments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kaushik Punjani, Director, Euro Exim Bank: “As a leader in trade finance solutions for global corporates and fintechs, we are uniquely placed to offer new payment channels and ways to source liquidity. Our customers—whether big corporates or individual remitters—have historically been restricted from obtaining suitable funds or settling transactions in a cost efficient and timely manner. Working collaboratively with Ripple and selected counterparts, we have designed, tested and are implementing both xCurrent and xRapid in record time, and we look forward to the benefits these will bring our customers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David Lighton, Founder, SendFriend: “The existing correspondent banking system is slow, inefficient and costly. SendFriend was founded at MIT with the belief that there must be a better way to send payments. We are excited to partner with Ripple to do just that. Through our partnership, we are bringing our customers a next-generation, blockchain payment solution that leverages XRP to address many of the efficiency and equity problems with existing remittances. For them, that means cheaper and faster payments.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ashay Mervyn, Head of Emerging Markets, JNFX: “Payments between countries are beset with inefficiencies—inefficiencies around cost, inefficiencies around speed and inefficiencies around transparency. RippleNet is specifically geared to address these problems. For our customers who range from the largest conglomerates in Africa (with operations and commitments in over 40 countries) to individuals in villages in rural Nigeria, our decision to join RippleNet and utilize their payment solution—including XRP for on-demand liquidity—just makes sense.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“In 2018, nearly 100 financial institutions joined RippleNet, and we’re now signing two – sometimes three – new customers per week. We also saw a 350 percent increase last year in customers sending live payments, and we’re beginning to see more customers flip the switch and leverage XRP for on-demand liquidity,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. “At the end of the day, our goal is to make sure our customers can provide excellent, efficient cross-border payments experiences for their customers, wherever they are in the world.”</p>
<p>RippleNet currently operates in over 40 countries across six continents.</p>

<p><strong>9<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Most central banks are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) but hardly any are at the pilot stage and even fewer see issuance as likely in the short or medium term, according to a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) survey.</p>
<p>CBDCs have emerged as a hot topic for central banks over the last couple of years. IMF chief Christine Lagarde recently argued that they could have a role in helping states manage the retreat from cash, while an EU report has suggested they could pave the way for a more stable financial system.</p>
<p>In contrast, BIS itself has said central banks should steer clear of developing their own digital currencies, billing the development as a move into unchartered waters with potentially serious implication for monetary policy and financial stability.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, a BIS survey of 63 central banks shows that 70% are currently, or soon will be, engaged in CBDC work. Of these, over half are looking at both general purpose and wholesale CBDCs, with a third just focusing on general purpose and 13% just wholesale.</p>
<p>But, only five central banks are at the pilot stage and even fewer see issuance as likely in the next six years.</p>
<p>This is largely because, while most central banks have done Henough work to clarify the challenges of launching a CBDC, they are not yet convinced that the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>This is not the case everywhere; Sweden is pushing ahead with plans to build a technical framework for the issuance of a new electronic currency, the e-krona.</p>
<p>However, CBDCs are generally being taken most seriously in emerging market economies such as Uruguay, which BIS speculates, seems to be because “financial inclusion projects create a clear mandate for central bank action, and a lack of current infrastructure limits the disruption a CBDC could create while simultaneously encouraging the use of new technology”.</p>
<p>BIS concludes that different central banks will move towards CBDCs at different speeds, warning that this creates a potential risk for “spillover effects across boundaries”. To mitigate this risk, the report urges “caution and collaboration”.</p>

<p><strong>7<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Three-quarters (74%) of businesses in the UK surveyed by Centtrip, the international payments, treasury management and foreign-exchange specialist, believe they will benefit from Open Banking within two years.</p>
<p>Introduced in January 2018, Open Banking was designed to give customers and companies control of their financial data, enabling them to view it in one place. It was also intended to provide a secure way of sharing that information with third parties and give access to better deals and a wide array of financial products and services.</p>
<p>Now, almost a year on, Centtrip has analysed its, so far slow, uptake by medium-size and large firms. The fintech’s study showed that 64% of businesses agreed that Open Banking will save them time and 58% believed it would also save them money.</p>
<p>With this new and efficient way of managing one’s finances, it came as no surprise that 62% of businesses said it made life easier for staff and 42% noticed a positive impact on their payments and expenses.</p>
<p>Although a considerable amount of development has taken place behind the scenes to make Open Banking available for wider use, 8% businesses still have no idea what it is. The lack of understanding of the benefits of Open Banking has meant that 59% of respondents are not yet reaping its rewards. In fact, only 28% of respondents aged 55 and over said they had a firm grasp of Open Banking compared to 85% of those aged between 18 and 34.</p>
<p>Brian Jamieson, CEO and co-founder of Centtrip, said: “Open Banking has a huge potential to shift the way financial data is shared and managed. A year on from its launch, we are just starting to understand its benefits and the way it may reshape the financial sector. Even so, many business leaders have yet to reap its rewards and realise its potential to revolutionise the way businesses approach and manage their financial information. Collaboration between fintech and banks is the root to its success. By joining efforts, they can do a lot more than when on their own when it comes to putting it to use.”</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – BOKIS, a Danish banking collective, and Nets, a market leader in the payments industry, have extended their existing agreement on handling payments with international cards. The agreement ensures that regional and nationwide banks in the BOKIS association, comprising 40% of the Danish payment card market, can continue to benefit from an efficient and stable card infrastructure.</p>
<p>Nets will facilitate international payment card transactions for BOKIS, a collective with more than 50 members, and provide better terms and a dedicated platform to combat card fraud until 2021.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that with the agreement we can offer our banks better terms and lower overall costs over the next few years. This is important in a highly competitive market,” says Søren Nicolaisen, Director of National Banking, BOKIS.</p>
<p>“In recent years, together with Nets, we have developed new digital solutions that provide better customer service while reducing costs for banks, for example in cardholder disputes. To continue this, we have decided to renew the existing agreement for three more years,” says Jan Kondrup, Director of Local Banks, BOKIS.</p>
<p>The previous agreement, signed in 2014, has been expanded to include new services which help to prevent card fraud, such as Smart Block and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p>Nets too, is looking forward to the continued cooperation.</p>
<p>“It should be easy for banks to offer simple and intuitive customer solutions in a payment market that is becoming more and more complex. We are pleased to be extending our partnership with the banks in the BOKIS association, thus giving us the opportunity to continue our joint development of new solutions that make everyday business easier for cardholders,” says Thomas Jul, Head of Financial &amp; Network Services, Nets.</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> January 2019</strong> – Morgan Stanley, E*Trade and Fidelity Investments are among a group of Wall Street firms backing a new equities exchange hoping to take on NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets.</p>
<p>Members Exchange (MEMX) is being set up by nine retail broker-dealers, banks and market makers, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, TD Ameritrade, UBS and Virtu Financial.</p>
<p>It is vowing to increase competition, improve operational transparency, cut costs and simplify the execution of equity trading in the US. The new entity, which needs to secure SEC approval, is promising a simple trading model with basic order types using the latest technology.</p>
<p>Steve Quirk, EVP, trading and education, TD Ameritrade, says: “All types of investors could benefit from this simplified investing experience that will foster competition and promote practices that put the needs of investors first.”</p>
<p>Shares in Nasdaq and NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange fell more than two per cent in trading on Monday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nasdaq responded to MEMX: “We welcome competition to our transparent, highly regulated equity markets. However, with more than 40 equity trading venues already in operation in the United States, we are keen to learn more about the value proposition of a new exchange.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> January 2019</strong> – Effective as of 1 January 2019, six partners of PKF Frankfurt along with 90 employees have joined the Frankfurt office of RSM GmbH. The merger creates one of the largest RSM offices in Germany and will have enormous strategic relevance owing to its location in one of the most globally-important metropolitan areas. Through this growth, RSM GmbH now has more than 600 employees across the country, positioning itself as one of the leading medium-sized audit and tax advisory firms in Germany. Worldwide, RSM is the 6th largest professional services network, with a presence in 117 countries, 750 offices and 40,000 staff.</p>
<p>RSM in Frankfurt audits and advises medium-sized businesses across all key industry sectors, of which many are publicly listed companies. The firm’s clients do business locally, regionally, domestically as well as internationally.</p>
<p>“Along with corporate groups operating internationally, we especially focus on medium-sized companies that highly value individualised care and expect us to have a deep understanding of the specific needs of a medium-sized entity,” explained Santosh Varughese, Managing Partner of the Frankfurt office.</p>
<p>He added, “Our clients operating internationally will particularly benefit from the merger with RSM by our gaining a wider range of services and competencies. RSM aspires to be the number one consultant, especially for German medium-sized companies operating globally. This is a clear promise of service, a clear statement and almost a unique positioning on the market.”</p>
<p>Gregor Schmidt, the European Regional Leader of <a href=""http://www.rsm.global/"" target=""_blank"">RSM International</a>, commented on the expansion of this office: “With this growth we strengthen our presence enormously in one of the most dynamic economic regions of Europe. By expanding the Frankfurt office, our ranking among the largest audit and tax advisory firms in Germany will climb towards the top ten.”</p>
<p>Jean Stephens, Chief Executive Officer of RSM International, commented: “For our global clients, Frankfurt is a strategically important location; a metropolitan area with enormous economic power as well as being an international hub for the exchange of goods and services. I am delighted to welcome the partners and staff in Frankfurt to our network, further enhancing our client services and bringing expert insight and knowledge to middle market businesses looking to take advantage of this key financial centre.”</p>
<p>Santosh Varughese highly values a close personal relationship with his clients: “As a partner-led firm, we offer services oriented to finding solutions, individual consulting from one hand and direct lines of decision-making. Complex issues are handled by an inter-disciplinary team responsibly led by our partners.”</p>
<p>“Owing to ever increasing globalisation, to business models becoming digitalised and to IT security gaining ever more importance, our medium-sized clients are faced with growing challenges,” emphasised Rainer Grote, member of the management committee of RSM GmbH. “We are particularly skilled in anticipating such challenges and helping our clients to handle them effectively and efficiently. Our success has proven we are on the right track. In the past year RSM GmbH was able to grow by six percent - well over average for the industry. By expanding the Frankfurt branch, we want to continue to grow at this speed and to produce many more stories of success.”</p>

<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> December 2018</strong> – Instant Reporting is the first commercial solution from Open Banking specifically tailored to large corporate customers. This is enabled by the opening up of corporate APIs (Application Programme Interfaces) in Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p>The first product from Open Banking, Instant Reporting, allows companies to access their own accounts and seamlessly integrate real time data with their own systems and processes. This new API product is the first offering from Open Banking that moves beyond PSD2 (Payment Services Directive) compliance, which requires banks to open up to third parties to offer services to account holders.</p>
<p>Gunnar Berger, Head of Nordea Open Banking says: “We have been committed to Open Banking from the beginning because we could really see the potential for creating new products and services that bring value to our customers. The exciting thing with our new product, Instant Reporting, is that it gives corporates the chance to directly access their real-time data which will have a big impact on the way they organise their businesses, freeing up valuable time and resources.”</p>
<h4>Access to real-time data</h4>
<p>Giving a company access to their accounts, balances and transactions allows them to replace their current file-based systems simply by connecting to the Instant Reporting API. Each time they log on to their ERP system they will access fresh real-time data.</p>
<p>Erik Zingmark, Head of Transaction Banking at Nordea, says: “After taking the leading position in Open Banking in the Nordics, I am delighted to see that we can now offer the first real commercially viable product from the project and one that has the potential to benefit many customers. This launch is just the first of many great products ahead resulting from Nordea Open Banking.”</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>Nordea’s Open Banking platform was launched at the end of 2017. More than 3,300 developers have now registered to test Nordea’s APIs. The next planned steps for the Instant Reporting is to provide access to Danish and Norwegian accounts.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> December 2018</strong> – The European Parliament has approved plans to make banks slash fees on cross-border euro payments between EU countries that are in the euro zone and those that are not.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no difference for euro area residents or businesses if they carry out euro transactions in their own country or with another of the 19 euro area countries.</p>
<p>However, residents of EU countries outside of the euro area do not have the same privileges. For example, a EUR10 cross-border credit transfer from Bulgaria could be subject to a fee of up to EUR24.</p>
<p>This, says the EC, is an obstacle to its vision of a single market, creating barriers to the cross-border activities of households and businesses, in particular SMEs.</p>
<p>Under the new proposals, a cross-border credit transfer in euros from Bulgaria will be priced the same as a domestic Bulgarian lev credit transfer.</p>
<p>The new rules also require that consumers are fully informed of the cost of a currency conversion before they make a payment, for example, with their card abroad. The ruling will hit banks, merchants or ATM operators who will all have to declare currency conversion charges in the same way, making it easy for consumers to select the best option.</p>
<p>Commission VP Valdis Dombrovskis, says: “With this agreement, non-euro country citizens will also enjoy one of the benefits of the euro. That is, low-cost euro transactions using highly efficient euro payments infrastructure. Moreover, this regulation will boost competition in the area of currency conversion. And it will allow Europeans to easily check and compare conversion charges when paying abroad with their cards, or when sending money online to a country with another EU currency.""</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> December 2018</strong> – A new survey from eToro US, a leading global investment platform, finds that despite a clear interest in investing in cryptoassets, education is the key barrier preventing online investors from purchasing the asset.</p>
<p>Of all online investors — including those who do or do not currently invest in cryptoassets — 69 percent of respondents were interested or very interested in learning about it.</p>
<p>However, the nationwide survey of 1,000 online investors found that proficiency in the cryptoasset class is still low. Three quarters of those who do not hold the asset class state that they are not knowledgeable about cryptoassets. Even among investors who do invest in cryptoassets, over one-fifth of respondents feel that their understanding is lacking.</p>
<p>Guy Hirsch, US managing director, eToro, says: “Late 2018 has seen the cryptocurrency market take a huge tumble, but that has not stymied investors’ interest in the asset class and its potential. Online investors are still keeping their eye on cryptocurrencies, but this survey revealed that there is a serious lack of educational resources available to those who would like to invest in or learn more about crypto. As we move toward a future where assets will become increasingly tokenized, it’s important to give investors access to the resources they need to invest in the assets they want and truly consider cryptoassets as part of their long-term investment plan.”</p>
<h4>Professional Crypto Education is Severely Lacking</h4>
<p>Across the board, education is a key barrier preventing people from investing in cryptocurrency. Almost half (44 percent) of online investors state that education is the main reason for not trading crypto. This is true even among Millennials, who are more knowledgeable about the asset class than other generations. Forty percent of Millennials who do not invest in cryptoassets say that the lack of education is the main reason they do not invest.</p>
<p>Currently, there are limited resources when it comes to learning about cryptoassets. Investors who are invested in crypto mostly lean on observing their online trading platform (67 percent) and social media (43 percent) for guidance. Among social media channels, YouTube and online crypto chat forums are most used. When it comes to approach, those who currently invest, plan to invest or are interested in investing identified the following top three approaches to learning more about investing in crypto:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with a low amount of investment to test out the market (92 percent interested or very interested)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch an experienced trader to mimic their portfolio or trading patterns (85 percent interested or very interested)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research cryptoassets using online channels (82 percent interested or very interested)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the lack of knowledge and resources, 97 percent of both Millennial and Gen X crypto-traders are interested in learning more about cryptoassets, presenting a big opportunity to provide more formal training and structured resources.</p>
<h4>Women Trade Crypto Less Than Men, But Not for Lack of Interest</h4>
<p>Across all groups of online investors who do not currently invest in cryptoassets, the top three barriers to participating in the asset class are consistent: price volatility, fear of scams, and lack of education or knowledge. However, the top reason for not trading differed significantly between men and women.</p>
<p>While men identified price volatility as the top barrier to trading crypto (41 percent), over half (51 percent) of women identified the lack of education or knowledge as the top reason for not trading. For women, the lack of educational resources is significantly more likely to affect whether they will take advantage of the asset class than men (39 percent).</p>
<p>While female investors are more likely to state that they are not well-versed in cryptocurrency trading (76 percent vs. 54 percent male), this doesn’t mean that women are less interested in learning about digital currencies. Of those who do not trade crypto, men and women are equally interested in learning about it — 61 percent of both genders were interested or very interested in more education.</p>
<p>Hirsch continues: “The investment gap between men and women is still quite stark. There are many studies that indicate this, and we are beginning to see companies provide more financial services tailored specifically for women. With cryptoassets, we need to begin closing the gap now by providing education and resources so more women feel comfortable tapping into the asset class while it is still in its relative infancy.”</p>
<h4>Desire for Financial Advice in Cryptoassets</h4>
<p>When it comes to financial advice, Millennials are more likely than Gen X or Boomer online investors to also make use of financial advisors. While 19 percent of Millennials planned on using a financial advisor to buy or sell products such as stocks, ETFs, or cryptoassets, only 11 percent of Gen X and 12 percent of Boomers indicated the same. Looking six months into the future indicates similar results. Twenty three percent of Millennials plan on using more resources such as financial advisors compared to only 14 percent of Gen X.</p>
<p>The results were even more apparent for those who currently do not plan on investing in crypto. Seventy three percent of Millennial investors would be significantly more likely to invest in crypto if advised by a financial advisor, compared to 58 percent of Gen X and 49 percent of Boomers.</p>
<p>Hirsch concludes: “It’s very encouraging to see that Millennials are in favor of using financial advisors. This makes sense as the top of the Millennial generation is approaching 40 and is starting to accumulate significant amount of wealth and are looking at their investments over the long term. Financial advisors have a lot of opportunity to tap into crypto as an asset class. There is clearly a demand — especially among Millennials — to include cryptoassets as part of a long-term investment strategy.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> January 2019</strong> – The euro, Europe's common currency, turned 20 on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2019.</p>
<p>Exactly 20 years ago, on 1<sup>st</sup> January 1999, 11 EU countries launched a common currency, the euro, and introduced a shared monetary policy under the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>The historic moment was a milestone on a journey driven by the ambition of ensuring stability and prosperity in Europe. Today, still young, the euro is already the currency of 340 million Europeans in 19 Member States. It has brought tangible benefits to European households, businesses and governments alike: stable prices, lower transaction costs, protected savings, more transparent and competitive markets, and increased trade. Some 60 countries around the world link their currencies to the euro in one way or another, and we can and are doing more to let the euro play its full role on the international scene. Other EU Member States are expected to join the euro area once the criteria are met.</p>
<p>To mark this anniversary, the five Presidents of the EU institutions and bodies most directly responsible for the euro, the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup, commented on the 20 years of the single currency and on its future.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said: “As one of the only signatories of the Maastricht Treaty still politically active today, I remember the hard-fought and momentous negotiations on the launch of the Economic and Monetary Union. More than anything, I recall a deep conviction that we were opening a new chapter in our joint history. A chapter that would shape Europe's role in the world and the future of all its people. 20 years on, I am convinced that this was the most important signature I ever made. The euro has become a symbol of unity, sovereignty and stability. It has delivered prosperity and protection to our citizens and we must ensure that it continues to do so. This is why we are working hard to complete our Economic and Monetary Union and boost the euro's international role further.”</p>
<p>Antonio Tajani, President of the European Parliament, said: “The euro is more popular today than ever: three out of four citizens believe it is good for our economy. In order for Europeans to benefit fully from the jobs, growth and solidarity that the single currency should bring, we must complete our Economic and Monetary union through genuine financial, fiscal and political Union. This will also allow Europe to better shield its citizens from potential future crises.”</p>
<p>Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said:“The creation of the euro 20 years ago — alongside the liberation of Central and Eastern Europe and the reunification of Germany— was a pivotal moment in European history. Our common currency has since matured into a powerful expression of the European Union as a political and economic force in the world. Despite crises, the euro has shown itself resilient, and the eight members which joined the original 11 have enjoyed its benefits. As the world keeps changing, we will keep upgrading and strengthening our Economic and Monetary Union.”</p>
<p>Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, said: “The euro was a logical and necessary consequence of the single market. It makes it easier to travel, trade and transact within the euro area and beyond. After 20 years, there is now a generation who knows no other domestic currency. During that time, the ECB has delivered on its main task of maintaining price stability. But we also contribute to the well-being of euro area citizens by developing safe, innovative banknotes, promoting secure payment systems, supervising banks to ensure they are resilient and overseeing financial stability in the euro area.”</p>
<p>Mário Centeno, President of the Eurogroup, said: “The single currency has been one of the biggest European success stories: there can be no doubt about its importance and impact over the first two decades of its history. But its future is still being written, and that puts a historic responsibility on us. The euro and the close economic cooperation that it entails has evolved over time, overcoming challenges in its way. It has come a long way since the start, and it has seen important changes in the wake of the crisis to help us leave the hardship behind. But this work is not yet finished, it requires continuous reform efforts in good times as in bad times. There can be no doubts of our political will to strengthen the Economic and Monetary Union. We need to be prepared for what the future may hold - we owe that to our citizens.”</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The launch of the euro marked the culmination of a long journey that had begun long before. The global monetary turmoil of the 1970s and 1980s had exposed individual European countries and called for European solutions. Moreover, with the establishment of a single market, it would be easier to work and trade if Europeans would start to use a single currency. After decades of early discussions on how an Economic and Monetary Union could be achieved, in 1988 the Delors Committee was set up. Under the chairmanship of then Commission President Jacques Delors, it examined specific, gradual steps towards such a single currency. The agreement that political leaders subsequently signed in 1992 in Maastricht brought the single currency to life, building on the report of the Delors Committee and the ensuing negotiations. As such, the signing of the Maastricht Treaty became a symbolic moment in the move towards the euro. In 1994, the European Monetary Institute (EMI) started its preparatory work in Frankfurt for the European Central Bank (ECB) to assume its responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area. As a result, on 1 June 1998, the ECB became operational.</p>
<p>On 1 January 1999, the euro was launched, becoming the official currency of 11 Member States, with monetary policy responsibilities given to the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem. After three years of appearing on people's bank statements alongside national currencies, euro banknotes and coins arrived in 12 countries, which thereby participated in the largest currency changeover in history. The original members were Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. Greece joined in 2001. Since then, a further seven Member States have introduced the euro (Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia).</p>
<h4>The second most used currency in the world</h4>
<p>The euro has come a long way from the first discussions in the late 1960s to being the currency of 340 million Europeans and used by a further 175 million worldwide. It is the second most important international currency, with around 60 countries in the world using it or linking their own currency to the euro. It is a safe store of value for international central banks, used for issuing debt worldwide and widely accepted for international payments.</p>
<p>Ten years after the financial crisis shook the world, the architecture of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union has been significantly reinforced but more work remains to be done. Building on the vision set out in the Five Presidents' Report of June 2015 and the Reflection Papers on the Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union and the Future of EU Finances of spring 2017, the European Commission set out a roadmap for deepening the Economic and Monetary Union. In December, EU Leaders also agreed to work towards strengthening the international role of the euro as part of this journey.</p>
<h4>A single currency for the benefit of all Europeans</h4>
<p>Public support for the euro has been consistently high in the EU, especially in the countries already using the euro. A majority of 74% of respondents across the euro area said that they thought the euro was good for the EU; this is the same as the record high score set last year and confirms that popular support for the euro is at its highest since surveys began in 2002. A majority of 64% of respondents across the euro area also said that they thought the euro was good for their own country. 36% of Europeans identify the euro as one of the main symbols of the European Union, the second highest behind ‘freedom' as a symbol. It has brought visible and very practical benefits to European households, businesses and governments alike: stable prices, lower transaction costs, more transparent and competitive markets, and increased trade. It makes travelling and living abroad easier, and savings protected.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – Responsibility for information security is not falling to any one senior executive function, according to the <a href=""https://www.nttsecurity.com/en-uk/risk-value-2018"" target=""_blank"">2018 Risk:Value report</a> from <a href=""https://www.nttsecurity.com/"" target=""_blank"">NTT Security</a>, the specialised security company of NTT Group, which surveyed 1,800 senior decision makers from non-IT functions in global organisations.</p>
<p>At a global level, 22% of respondents believe the CIO is ‘ultimately responsible’ for managing security, compared to one in five (20%) for the CEO and 19% for the CISO. In the UK, fewer respondents point to the CIO (19%) and CISO (18%) while the CEO gets the biggest vote at 21%. The US (27%) and Norway (26%) buck the trend with more than a quarter of respondents suggesting the CEO is responsible, while in Singapore, one third say it is the role of the CISO – the highest figure across all 12 countries. Interestingly, around one in ten people in Switzerland believe the CFO is responsible for security.</p>
<p>“Responsibility for day-to-day security doesn’t seem to fall on any one particular person’s shoulders among our response base,” says Azeem Aleem, VP Consulting &amp; UK&amp;I; Lead, NTT Security. “This narrow gap between the roles of CIO, CEO and CISO shows that no one executive function is stepping up to the plate. It could be a sign of unclear separation between the CIO and CISO though, as often they are the same or collaborate closely.</p>
<p>""On the other hand, should we be concerned that the CEO is not more involved in security matters, given the potentially damaging affects to the business, or should we be relieved that they are not managing a specialist task like this over and above other critical corporate responsibilities. The question is where do you draw the line?”</p>
<p>According to the 2018 Risk:Value report, although more people see the need for regular boardroom discussions about security, their organisations are failing to raise it sufficiently at the C-suite level. While 80% of all survey respondents agree that preventing a security attack should be a regular boardroom agenda item (up from 73% in last year’s report) only 61% say that it is, an increase of just 5% on last year.</p>
<h5>Data security poor due to lack of cohesion at the top</h5>
<p>NTT Security’s report also suggests that this lack of cohesion at the top of the organisation means that many are struggling to secure their most important digital assets. Fewer than half (48%) of respondents globally – 53% in the UK – say they have fully secured all of their critical data. But with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now fully in effect, this is no longer an opportunity, but mandatory.</p>
<p>However, companies are beginning to take control of their data as cloud computing best practices mature. Around a quarter (27%) report that the majority of their organisation’s data is currently stored on premise or in data centres (25%). However, in 12 months’ time, a similar proportion (25%) of respondents say that it will be stored in a cloud environment.</p>

<p><strong>14<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – CivilisedBank (‘the Bank’), the digital SME bank with relationship managers, has resubmitted its banking licence application to the Bank of England. The Bank has also received further funding from current investor Warwick Capital Partners (‘Warwick’), a London-based investment manager, as well as from a blue-chip, FTSE100 pension fund.</p>
<p>CivilisedBank was granted a banking licence in May 2017 and chose to release it earlier this year to allow more time to complete its build phase and ensure that it launched with an optimal customer offering. The Bank has used this time to develop its technology platform further and, by resubmitting its banking licence application, is now preparing for launch in H1 2019.</p>
<p>A new investor, a blue-chip, FTSE100 pension fund, has chosen to provide funding for the Bank’s development alongside further funding from Warwick, CivilisedBank’s main shareholder. This continued investment will further support the Bank’s path towards launch.</p>
<p>CivilisedBank is building a digital SME bank which, when launched in 2019, will offer business customers access to experienced banking experts, finance solutions and effortless digital banking that make their business lives easier.</p>
<p>Mark Stephens, Chief Executive Officer, CivilisedBank said: “It was really important that we took the time earlier this year to make sure that, when we come to market, it is with the optimal offering to customers. Since our inception, the market has changed significantly and this additional time has also allowed us to develop our proposition further to ensure it meets changing customer requirements. Resubmitting our banking licence application is a key step towards a full launch next year.</p>
<p>“That Warwick has chosen to invest further, and that a new investor has chosen to provide funding at this stage, demonstrates that our proposition resonates and confirms that we are on the right track towards providing something genuinely new within the SME banking market.”</p>
<p>Ian Burgess, Co-Chief Investment Officer and Founding Partner, Warwick Capital Partners said: “CivilisedBank will enter the banking sector with a truly different offering to SMEs, and the care and consideration taken to ensure that the proposition is fully in line with market developments makes it an incredibly exciting opportunity. We are delighted to be supporting the team on the next stage of the journey.”</p>
<p>Focused on the UK SME market and funded by SME and retail savings, CivilisedBank will serve businesses through working capital solutions and cash management, including loans, asset finance, savings and payment services. CivilisedBank will also address the UK retail market with a range of savings products.</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – EBA CLEARING announced today the kick-off of a Request to Pay Task Force to support the development of a pan-European Request to Pay (R2P) solution. The first objective of this task force is to work on a blueprint, which shall serve as a planning framework for the implementation of an R2P solution. The blueprint is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2019.</p>
<p>The task force convened for the first time today and is composed of experts from 28 financial institutions from 14 countries. A list of the participating institutions can be found at the end of the press release.</p>
<p>Request to Pay is considered as a key element in an evolving payments landscape shaped by developments such as Open Banking and real-time payments. Request to Pay solutions are aimed at further increasing certainty, transparency and convenience when making and receiving payments. The Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) has referred to Request to Pay in the context of electronic invoice presentment and payment, where it is seen as a means to speed up the end-to-end process and ease reconciliation processes in particular. In its development of a blueprint for an R2P solution, the EBA CLEARING task force will consider the many different use cases where a Request to Pay can add value to both payer and payee.</p>
<p>“Request to Pay initiatives are emerging around the world and there is a growing demand for new and enhanced payment solutions that leverage existing payment infrastructures and instruments in SEPA as well. Against this background, EBA CLEARING has decided to contribute to the development of a pan-European R2P solution,” said Erwin Kulk, Head of Service Development and Management, EBA CLEARING.</p>
<p>“Together with our user representatives, we will be working on a blueprint, which will provide a basis for wider industry engagement and for defining the timing for the development and implementation of such a pan-European R2P solution.”</p>

<p>While salary increase budgets are forecasted to be up in several markets, merit increases alone won’t be enough to hire, engage and retain talent in a hot labor market. “Companies must assess what jobs are needed for future growth and hire for those roles in a competitive marketplace while also engaging and retaining their current talent when many other job opportunities exist. Businesses with a voluntary turnover of above 10% should evaluate their employee value proposition and talent practices carefully,” says Alexander Krasavin, Partner and Radford Leader for Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>9<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – BNP Paribas and HSBC Singapore have successfully completed Singapore’s first fully digitised end-to-end letter of credit transaction between two different companies – a move that will take the digitisation of trade finance a step closer to becoming a commercial reality.</p>
<p>The transaction involved Rio Tinto selling a bulk shipment of iron ore originating from Australia to China for its customer Cargill. As part of the transaction, BNP Paribas issued a Letter of Credit (LC) over the blockchain on behalf of Cargill to HSBC Singapore acting on behalf of Rio Tinto.</p>
<p>Both BNP Paribas and HSBC enabled a seamless end-to-end transfer of electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) over traded goods using a digital LC for the first time in Singapore, by integrating the Voltron trade finance solution (through R3’s Corda blockchain platform in the back-end) with Bolero’s eBL system.</p>
<h5>New deal a further step in the digitisation of cross-border trade becoming a commercial reality</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Digital transactions ensure trade flows are faster, more secure, simpler and more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The LC issuance was completed in less than two hours for this transaction compared with 1-2 days for traditional, paper-based LCs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More counterparties were engaged in this transaction, compared to previous blockchain transactions with full digital integration, indicating that there is increased interest across the industry to digitise cross border transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The faster documentation turnaround for each shipment can potentially lead to increased flexibility in liquidity management resulting in working capital optimisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zoran Lozevski, Head of Global Trade Solutions, Asia Pacific, BNP Paribas said: “The future of trade finance is digital and paperless, and BNP Paribas is pleased to be at the forefront of changes that will make facilitating trade even easier for our clients. Blockchain technology is an important pillar in our innovation agenda and we believe that transactions like this one will help achieve greater efficiency and transparency in trade finance for the benefit of all players in this space.”</p>
<p>Ajay Sharma, Regional Head of Global Trade and Receivables Finance, Asia Pacific, for HSBC said:</p>
<p>“The transaction represents a significant advancement of this solution since our first transaction earlier this year, which further validates its commercial and operational viability to establish a new era of digital trade. Together with banks and the trade finance industry we will continue to improve this solution by adding new features and functionality as we move towards a commercial launch.”</p>
<p>Rio Tinto Head of Commercial Treasury, Abel Martins-Alexandre said: “Blockchain offers efficiencies and greater transparency, while also creating a viable new offering to our customers and stakeholders along the supply chain. This pioneering transaction demonstrated our commitment to partnering with our customers to meet their needs, to stay agile and responsive to opportunities for improving efficiencies, and make our respective businesses stronger.”</p>
<p>Lee Kirk, Managing Director for Cargill’s Metals business: “As the first fully-digitised iron ore transaction in Singapore, this marks a positive and exciting new development for the ferrous industry. What was previously a complex process is now accessible via a more modern, digitally-based approach and a secure platform. At Cargill, we are transforming our supply chains with digital technologies like blockchain in trade finance, commodity trade operations and traceable food programs to better serve our customers across the globe.”</p>

<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – Bank of America Merrill Lynch today announced its upcoming addition of document exchange and e-signature capabilities in CashPro® Assistant, an online bank administration tool that helps commercial and corporate clients more easily conduct standard account management transactions as well as access and analyze their banking information.</p>
<p>Exchanging documents and enabling electronic signing over the authenticated CashPro platform simplifies a cumbersome paper-based process. Examples of documents to be exchanged and signed include know-your-customer, legal agreements, account opening and service forms.</p>
<p>“CashPro Assistant is the center for all data, support and account administration for our clients globally,” said Hubert J.P. Jolly, head of financing and channels for Global Transaction Services (GTS) at BofA Merrill. “With the introduction of document delivery and electronic signing over CashPro Assistant, clients will benefit from the ability to exchange larger attachments and ease of electronic signing, through a channel with security controls to which they are accustomed.”</p>
<p>With the addition of document exchange and e-signature, BofA Merrill clients will be able to view and sign deposit, treasury and trade documents directly in their CashPro User Document page. With the new enhancements, they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Receive and sign documents directly in the CashPro Assistant Document Inbox – no need to separately login to secure email to receive important bank documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download, upload, save, share and print important documents to simplify document review, access and the overall CashPro experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The addition of document exchange and e-signature in CashPro Assistant is planned by year end for the U.S. and Canada. E-signature is already available directly, outside of CashPro Assistant, for deposit, treasury and trade documents, in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>“The benefits of electronic signing are already being realized with significant reduction in account setup times,” said Tom Durkin, head of digital channels for BofA Merrill GTS. “Adding it along with document exchange to CashPro Assistant will make it even more convenient for our clients.”</p>
<p>BofA Merrill’s GTS business provides comprehensive global treasury solutions across the breadth of the working capital cycle, including liquidity management, payments and receipts, commercial card, foreign exchange and trade and supply chain finance. With a history spanning more than 230 years, GTS supports thousands of clients ― small businesses, mid-size companies, large corporations, financial institutions and public-sector entities ― in more than 200 countries and 140 currencies.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>6<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – International businesses are confident that the quality of their products will appeal to Chinese consumers, understand that distribution partnerships and e-commerce platforms are key to success in this market and are targeting the growing spending power of consumers aged under 40. These were among the key findings from HSBC’s Navigator: Made for China survey, which was launched today at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai.</p>
<p>“To succeed in the future, international businesses must be ‘Made for China.’</p>
<p>China is no longer just the world’s factory; its fast-growing consumer market is prompting international businesses to re-evaluate how and what they sell to China,” said Stuart Tait, Regional Head of Commercial Banking, Asia-Pacific, at HSBC.</p>
<p>“While made-in-China goods are found in-store and online around the world, the rapid development of China’s economy means that Chinese consumers are shaping the strategies of international businesses. These companies need a new playbook: ‘Made in China’ is no longer enough; they and their products need to be ‘Made for China,’” said Tait.</p>
<p>HSBC’s Navigator: Made for China survey explores the intersection of international businesses’ growth ambitions with China’s increasingly affluent and discerning consumers. In September, the survey canvassed the views of 1,205 small and large companies in 11 key global economies that already export to China or are considering doing so.</p>

<p>Among respondents from companies currently selling in China, 37% identified being able to provide distinctive or superior products and services as the top factor that would drive their sales growth there. European respondents were particularly confident about the appeal of their products, with 45% choosing this as their top driver.</p>
<p>Another 30% of current exporters to China highlighted the rising affluence and increasing disposable income of Chinese consumers as the key catalyst for their companies’ sales growth.</p>
<h3 id=""what-chinese-consumers-want"">What Chinese consumers want</h3>
<p>According to government estimates, China is going to import US$8 trillion worth of goods in the five years from 2018 to 2022. That is equivalent to an average of US$1.6 trillion a year, which is about the same as the gross domestic product of Canada or South Korea in 2017.</p>
<p>China’s increasingly powerful consumers are equally focused on price and quality, our respondents believe, indicating that Chinese customers look for competitive pricing (40%), quality and safety (40%), and technologically superior products and services (30%) when they make their purchases.</p>
<p>International businesses also believe that technology-related products and services will achieve the fastest growth in China, reflecting the sophistication of Chinese consumers and their demand for products that can enhance their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Globally, 38% of respondents said that exports in the technology services sector (such as information technology, biomedical technology, big data and artificial intelligence) would grow the fastest. Consumer electronics (27%) and high-end intelligent equipment such as that found in the ‘Internet of Things’ (25%) were also identified as expected leaders in export growth to China.</p>
<p>“Chinese consumers haven’t just become richer,” said Helen Wong, Chief Executive, Greater China, at HSBC. “They’ve become more health-conscious, more concerned about the environment and more discerning about brands and the quality of what they buy. This is about a growing middle class buying avocados and wearable digital devices – just like middle class consumers in Europe or North America.”</p>
<h3 id=""millennials-platforms-and-partnerships"">Millennials, platforms and partnerships</h3>
<p>Most businesses we surveyed said Chinese consumers aged under 40 today will drive Chinese consumer demand for years to come: 39% believe that those born in the 1990s will provide the strongest sales growth, while 23% believe that growth will come from those born in the 1980s and another 23% believe it will be driven by those born in the 2000s.</p>
<p>Businesses already selling to China identify the importance of having both a physical and an online presence to reach their target consumers. The strategies most commonly used to access the Chinese market are developing local distributor networks (51%), entering into joint ventures (47%) and selling directly via e-commerce and m-commerce (46%).</p>
<p>The importance of e-commerce to the under-40 demographic is clear. These consumers have grown up alongside the phenomenal expansion of online shopping platforms, which recorded sales of over US$1 trillion in 2017. Businesses in Asia-Pacific and North America in particular see e-commerce platforms as key to connecting with consumers.</p>
<h3 id=""challenges-and-solutions-how-businesses-can-be-made-for-china"">Challenges and solutions: how businesses can be ‘Made for China’</h3>
<p>Understanding the local business culture was identified as the top challenge faced by foreign companies already selling to China – a concern most keenly felt among European companies (43%) but less so by companies in the United Kingdom (28%) and the United States. (33%). Adapting to local tastes, allowing more time for compliance with local regulations (both 35%) and pricing products and services more competitively (31%) were seen as further challenges.</p>
<p>The top three challenges for companies considering selling in China are finding the right local partner (34%), adapting to Chinese tastes (33%) and competition from other foreign companies (32%). Businesses are looking to overcome these challenges by setting up local partnerships (32%), improving their own distribution network or distributor relationships (31%) and improving the skills of their local employees (29%).</p>

<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – Kyriba, the #1 provider of cloud treasury and financial management solutions, today announced the launch of Business Intelligence (BI), a new, fully integrated solution within its award-winning treasury and financial management platform. The solution, announced at the AFP 2018 Conference in Chicago, is designed to help finance and treasury executives dynamically visualize and convert their expanding volumes of financial data into actionable insights.</p>
<p>Due to an increasingly complex global business environment, many CFOs and senior finance leaders are becoming mired in rapidly growing volumes of financial data, with no easy way to pull out strategic insights, according to analysts.</p>
<p>“Data overload is real and is growing at the speed of modern business and technology. The smart move for finance executives is to adopt tools that help their teams better manage and interpret large data sets,” said Kevin Permenter at IDC. “Business intelligence solutions that bring together analysis and visual dashboarding give organizations a distinct competitive advantage.”</p>
<p>While standard reporting may be suitable for routine, activity based metrics, Kyriba Business Intelligence is designed for performance-based treasury metrics and KPIs. For example, users can get instant insight into strategic questions such as “What risks are my cash flows exposed to?”, “Has our bank rationalization project met our bank fee reduction metric?”, “Are my global cash forecasts reliable?” and much more.</p>
<p>Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>On-demand analysis</h5>
<p>Quickly generate targeted analysis based on user-defined scenarios and drag and drop functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Smart visualizations</h5>
<p>Uncover trends in data and data relationships through graphical exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Self-service reporting</h5>
<p>Leverage pre-built KPIs and visualizations or build custom interactive dashboards within minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Fully integrated</h5>
<p>Fully secured within Kyriba’s scalable cloud and ready for team collaboration and segregated data workflows</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Ready to go</h5>
<p>Can be deployed immediately, with instant access to current and historical data hosted by Kyriba</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Today’s CEOs and boards of directors are asking for – and even demanding – better analysis and KPIs to help guide the business,” said Jean-Luc Robert, Chairman and CEO at Kyriba. “Kyriba Business Intelligence delivers those metrics and strategic insight through highly visual dashboards, enabling faster, more effective global business decisions.”</p>
<p>The importance of business intelligence was reflected in a new study released last week by CFO Research and Kyriba, in which a majority of senior finance leaders cited data visualization as a top technology need for helping elevate the treasury function to match industry best practices. According to the survey, “3 Key Areas Where CFOs Say Strategic Treasurers Need to be More Strategic,” “data visualization and reporting” ranked second only behind “cash management,” and just ahead of “payments management.”</p>
<p>Kyriba will be exhibiting at AFP 2018 Conference in Chicago, today and tomorrow, and its sales teams will be offering demonstrations of its all of its solutions, including Kyriba Business Intelligence.

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – HSBC India and ING Bank Brussels have successfully executed a blockchain-enabled, live trade finance transaction jointly with Reliance Industries and Tricon Energy.</p>
<p>This is an industry-first as the blockchain platform integrated with Bolero’s electronic bill of lading (eBL) platform to issue and manage an eBL. This allowed a digital transfer of the title of goods from the seller to the buyer in the underlying trade. It further enabled the underlying trade to be fully digitised.</p>
<p>The end-to-end transaction was executed on R3’s Corda blockchain platform which is a single shared application, rather than requiring multiple isolated digital systems across various counterparties located around the globe. The Letter of Credit (LC) was issued by ING Bank for Tricon Energy USA (importer) with HSBC India as the advising and negotiating bank for Reliance Industries, India (exporter). This solution is a significant improvement for any organisation involved in buying and selling goods internationally, as it truly brings together all parties onto one platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on the transaction, Ajay Sharma, Regional Head of Global Trade and Receivables Finance, Asia Pacific for HSBC said, “The use of blockchain is a significant step towards digitising trade. It has a transformative impact on trade finance transactions and enables greater transparency and enhanced security in addition to making it simpler and faster. The overall efficiency it brings to trade finance ensures cost effectiveness, quicker turnaround and potentially unlocks liquidity for businesses. We’re delighted to partner with Reliance Industries and support enhanced digitisation in trade finance. We believe that the collaborative approach adopted to develop this technology has the potential to transform conventional trade finance.”</p>
<p>Srikanth Venkatachari, Joint Chief Financial Officer, Reliance Industries said, “We are excited to partner with HSBC on digitalisation of trade finance. This reflects our continued commitment to embrace emerging technologies and industry first initiatives. The use of blockchain offers significant potential to reduce the timelines involved in exchange of export documentation from the extant 7 to 10 days to less than a day. When adopted at scale, it helps in significant optimisation of working capital. Further, use of blockchain in trade finance enhances transparency, security and synergy across all the parties and stakeholders involved.”</p>
<p>This transaction validates the commercial and operational viability of blockchain as an alternative to conventional exchanges for paper-based documentation.</p>
<p>At present buyers and sellers use paper-based LCs to underpin transactions. Physical documents are sent to each party in the transaction by post, courier or fax. While these paper documents provide certainty, the time and cost involved in processing them are deterrents for exporters and inters and impairs the pace of trade.</p>
<p>R3, HSBC, ING, the other six banks supporting the Corda application (Bangkok Bank, BNP Paribas, CTBC Holding, NatWest, SEB and Standard Chartered) are seeking to expand the network on an open-source basis to drive adoption across the industry. This includes technology partners that can provide banks and customers tool kits for easier onboarding, ecosystem participants, besides buyers/sellers and their banks.</p>
<p>HSBC has taken the lead in digitising, shaping and evolving the trade ecosystem globally through industry leading initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> November 2018</strong> – From the AFP Annual Conference TreasuryXpress, the global leader in <a href=""http://treasuryxpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">on-demand treasury management solutions</a> today announced a partnership with <a href=""https://www.yodlee.com/"" target=""_blank"">Envestnet | Yodlee</a>, a leading data aggregation and data analytics platform for digital financial services, to create a fully digitized approach to bank connectivity for corporate treasurers. The new solution will significantly reduce the time and costs associated with bank connectivity for corporate treasurers while expanding the banking reach for corporate clients worldwide.</p>
<p>“After years of experience in implementing TMS', it is clear that connectivity is the most painful aspect to tackle during a project and usually causes the most delays for corporate treasurers,” says Anis Rahal, CEO and founder of TreasuryXpress. “Treasurers and TMS providers have had to rely manual connectivity protocols and onboarding processes that often result extravagant delays. Integrating Envestnet | Yodlee’s financial data API allows us to now achieve fully automated, secure, bank connectivity in a fraction of the time and cost.”</p>
<p>TreasuryXpress’ latest innovation will provide PSD2 and open-banking compliant access to over 20,000 banks across the Americas, Europe, MENA, and APAC regions of the world. This expansive and fully automated reach will help corporate treasurers improve time-to-market and achieve comprehensive visibility in both existing and emerging markets.</p>
<p>“TreasuryXpress shares our vision for simplifying how clients can gain access to information and we are pleased to be a part of their journey,” says Matt Cockayne, VP EMEA, Envestnet | Yodlee. “Through the integration of our single, unified, API platform into their on-demand treasury management products, customers will have access to enriched data and analytical insights.”</p>
<p>The TreasuryXpress integration with Envestnet | Yodlee further expands the firm’s unique On-Demand TMS model that is characterized by instant access and automated connectivity experiences. Corporate treasurers using TreasuryXpress’ solutions will have a reliable and cost-effective on-demand alternative for accessing financial institutions that may not be on the SWIFT network or where H2H is not a viable option.</p>
<p>“Digital transformation is defined by speed and the ability to collect and access data across channels. It is not defined by whether a TMS is a Cloud solution or not. It is how that solution uses modern Cloud innovation to connect to data, particularly banking data,” continues Rahal. “By enabling clients to be able to collect their banking data on the spot, TreasuryXpress has uniquely eliminated manual bank connectivity, thus finally defining the true digital, SaaS model for the 21st century.”</p>

<p><strong><em>5<sup>th</sup> November 2018</em></strong><em> – Shell’s Foreign Exchange Central Treasury business, which manages one of the world’s largest annual FX operating turnover, has implemented a Bloomberg service that connects its subsidiaries globally. The solution is now available for use by any corporate treasury operation in the world, Bloomberg announced today.</em></p>
<p>The new technology was built by Bloomberg in collaboration with Shell and connects the company’s central treasury office directly to its 718 operating units in 22 countries, so they can quickly and electronically exchange information. The functionality helps Shell manage its group risk with more than 200 distinct bank counterparties via the Bloomberg Terminal, which is used by leading corporations and investment managers.</p>
<p>“Shell worked with Bloomberg to develop a comprehensive process that helps reduce our operating risk and transaction costs. Now, we can more efficiently route market requests from regional centers around the world to our central treasury. The Bloomberg Terminal connects Shell with all our counterparties providing straight through processing (STP) into Shell’s treasury management system,” said Michael Dawson, Shell Head of Liquidity and Foreign Exchange.</p>
<p>Tod Van Name, Bloomberg Global Head of FX Electronic Trading, said, “Shell has long been an early adopter of innovative FX technology.

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – Citi announces the launch of Commercial Cards in Vietnam, offering a comprehensive suite of innovative payment solutions for corporate clients. These include Business-to-Business (B2B) solutions such as purchasing cards and our market-first Virtual Card Account (VCA) for Payables, as well as Travel solutions such as corporate cards for travel and entertainment purposes, a central travel account with a travel management company and the Virtual Card Account for Travel.</p>
<p>These solutions are testimony to Citi’s commitment to providing greater efficiency, control and transparency to help corporate clients more effectively manage their payment and expense management processes in a seamless, streamlined and accountable manner.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch, Citi Country Officer for Vietnam Natasha Ansell said, “We are delighted to add on to our comprehensive and market-leading suite of institutional banking products for our global multinational and local corporate clients in Vietnam. This launch is a further demonstration of our commitment to the country and the development of its economy, local enterprises, banking and financial industry, and its people.”</p>
<p>Jared Mecham, Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions Head for Vietnam added, “Globalization and changing business trends have had a significant impact on the volume of travel and entertainment expenses, as well as B2B payments. At the same time, economic pressures are leading corporates to reduce expenses, tighten working capital and release trapped liquidity. In this fast evolving corporate landscape, our clients need to focus on being digital, centralized and globally compliant, and our sophisticated Commercial Card solutions allow them to do that.”</p>
<p>“The launch of Citi’s commercial cards solution in Vietnam signifies the continued expansion of our business globally and in Asia. Vietnam is the 13th and latest market in the region where we now offer our commercial cards product suite on our proprietary platforms, covering comprehensive solutions for corporate travel and procurement needs. We remain committed to offering our clients digital and innovative solutions to help them simplify their banking, heighten efficiency and meet the evolving needs of their organizations in today’s rapidly changing business landscape,” said Deven Somaya, Citi’s Head of Commercial Cards for Asia Pacific, Treasury &amp; Trade Solutions.</p>
<p>With this launch, Citi will also be the first bank in Vietnam to offer VCA, a next-generation global digital payment solution designed to provide corporates with greater security, flexibility and control over organizational expenses. With VCA, corporates are able to generate unique virtual card numbers and dynamically set spending and reconciliation controls on each virtual card number based on their specific purchasing needs. VCA safeguards against unauthorized spend, helps prevent fraudulent purchases, simplifies reconciliation and eliminates manual paper-based payments with a faster, more efficient and traceable electronic payables solution.</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – Corporates in the Asia Pacific region are increasingly mandating the use of commercial cards for all eligible purchases as they migrate from more traditional payment tools, <a href=""https://www.citibank.com/tts/insights/articles/"" target=""_blank"">Citi’s Asia Pacific Commercial Cards Survey 2018</a> shows.</p>
<p>Findings reveal that corporates are expanding commercial card programs to alternative flows including meetings and events, and procurement, for increased visibility of flows, centralized controls and governance, heightened efficiencies and improvements in operational strategies.</p>
<p>The study, the first by Citi with a focus on corporate clients in Asia Pacific, found that clients in the region had increased their commercial card spend by over 24% in 2017. Business-to-business (B2B) spend followed suit, increasing by close to 50% over the same period.</p>
<p>Polling 46 decision makers from over 40 corporates in the region across a range of industries, the survey’s findings are being released in conjunction with Citi’s Asia Pacific Commercial Payments Summit 2018 which opened in Singapore this morning.</p>
<p>Themed “Simple. Global. Digital”, the annual summit brings together over 100 industry leaders in the commercial payments space to discuss best practices and industry trends, and share thought leadership.</p>
<p>The expansion of commercial cards usage in the region has continued through to 2018. Commercial card spend for Citi’s top ten commercial cards clients increased by 23% from January to April 2018, compared with same period last year.</p>
<p>Already, 76% of clients polled have mandated the use of corporate cards for travel expenses.</p>
<p>The survey also found that of the 36% of corporate clients without a procurement card or Virtual Card Account (VCA) program, over half are now planning to adopt commercial cards to replace Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions, checks and other payment methods.</p>
<p>Citi’s VCA is a next-generation global digital payment solutions designed to give clients greater security, flexibility and control over organizational expenses. With VCA, corporates are able to generate unique virtual card numbers and dynamically set spending and reconciliation controls on each virtual card number based on their specific purchasing needs.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results of the findings, Deven Somaya, Citi’s Head of Commercial Cards for Asia Pacific, Treasury &amp; Trade Solutions said, “The expanding use of commercial cards by corporates in the region corresponds to the increasing focus on digital and technology. As business operations become more complex, corporates want solutions that are simple and digital to optimize efficiencies. We continue to innovate and co-create with our partners and clients as we further invest in and build our Commercial Cards business.”</p>
<p>Clients’ preference for digital solutions is reflected in the fact that a majority – over 80% – of those polled in the survey use Citi’s proprietary digital tools and platforms to apply for commercial cards and view card statements.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – EBA Clearing and SWIFT announced today the start of a work programme to migrate the large-value payment system (LVPS) EURO1 to the ISO 20022 standard. The migration is scheduled to be completed by November 2021, in line with the deadline set for the migration of the Eurosystem’s TARGET2 platform.</p>
<p>The agreed programme responds to the need of the EURO1 participants for a continued strong alignment of the pan-European private-industry platform with TARGET2 in order to ensure full intra-day switchability between the two systems. It will also reflect user requirements to maintain the core components and benefits of EURO1 and to seek maximal alignment with other EBA Clearing services.</p>
<p>The implementation programme was prepared by EBA Clearing and SWIFT based on the results of a comprehensive user consultation that EBA Clearing conducted in 2017/2018 on the future positioning of its RTGS-equivalent euro payments platform.</p>
<p>Hays Littlejohn, CEO of EBA Clearing, said: “The migration of large-value euro payments to the ISO 20022 standard is a major exercise for payment service providers across Europe. Our goal is to make this changeover as smooth and seamless as possible for our EURO1 participants by fully aligning with the migration plans and timetable of TARGET2.</p>
<p>Our users have requested that the core of EURO1 stay unchanged: they still see a great benefit in a highly liquidity-efficient and cost-effective LVPS platform providing immediate finality for their payments and the possibility to flexibly switch flows between EURO1 to TARGET2. At the same time, many users are looking to strengthen their central payment monitoring and steering capabilities, which is why they have asked us to seek maximum alignment for EURO1, not only with TARGET2 but also with our STEP2 and RT1 Services.</p>
<p>We are pleased to evolve EURO1 in line with this mandate and to count on the support of SWIFT, our long-standing technology partner for EURO1, in readying our flagship system for the future.”</p>
<p>Gottfried Leibbrandt, CEO of SWIFT, said: “We are delighted to be working with EBA Clearing on the evolution of the EURO1 platform, including the migration to ISO 20022.</p>
<p>Our co-operation on this strategic programme will add another chapter to the successful partnership between SWIFT and EBA Clearing, which began 20 years ago with the delivery of the system.</p>
<p>EBA Clearing’s customers will continue to benefit from the key assets of the SWIFT network – security, resilience, reach and reliability – and can count on us to keep supporting them throughout the migration and beyond.”</p>
<p>SWIFT has been providing the messaging layer for EURO1 and acting as processing agent for the payment system operated by EBA Clearing since its launch in January 1999. To give a first outlook on the cross-service deliverables to come, EBA Clearing and SWIFT presented a proof of concept of a liquidity dashboard in mid-2018, which provided an overview of the payment capacity and position of participants both in EURO1 and in RT1 based on existing EURO1 and RT1 application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>SWIFT also provides network services to connect to STEP2, EBA Clearing’s pan-European Automated Clearing House, which processes euro retail payments, and links the system with TARGET2 for liquidity transfers. From November 2018 on, participants in EBA Clearing’s instant payment system RT1 will be able to access the RT1 platform via SWIFTNet Instant.</p>
<p>EURO1 is the only private sector large-value payment system for single same-day euro transactions at a pan-European level and has been identified as a systemically important payment system (SIPS) by the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>EURO1 processes on average over 200,000 payments per day with an average total value of about EUR 200 billion. The system currently counts 48 participant banks and reaches a total of over 20,000 BICs in and beyond Europe.</p>

<p><strong>31<sup>st</sup> October 2018</strong> – we.trade and eTradeConnect announced today, the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on collaboration between the newly launched digital trade finance platform in Hong Kong, eTradeConnect, and we.trade, the leading European digital trade finance platform. After several weeks of joint work, the parties start the immediate development with this MoU, for the interconnection of the two platforms for trade transactions, allowing corporates in we.trade to initiate a trade with companies in eTradeConnect as well as requesting financing of invoices and vice versa. This signifies the first and unprecedented connection between two large-scale blockchain trade finance platforms.</p>
<p>Interconnection of blockchain networks is a key requirement to expand the reach of members and services that each individual network offers: with this MoU, we.trade and eTradeConnect, jointly with their IT partners, respectively IBM and OneConnect, have designed for the first time in the world a framework for that connection to materialise between the two platforms, through a proof-of-concept (POC) to be completed in the next months.</p>
<p>eTradeConnect, a blockchain-based trade finance platform initiated by a consortium of 12 banks in Hong Kong, has been launched since September 2018. Leveraging the unique features of blockchain technology, eTradeConnect aims to build better trust among trade participants, improve efficiency, reduce risks and facilitate trade counterparties to obtain financing by digitising trade documents and automating trade finance processes. eTradeConnect is the first large-scale multi-bank blockchain project in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>we.trade, the first blockchain-based trade finance platform in Europe, based on the IBM Blockchain Platform, was launched in June 2018 and has been providing service to 14 major European banks. we.trade aims to facilitate cross-border trades to be conducted in a seamless, simple and trustful manner. Since the launch of we.trade in June 2018, we.trade has demonstrated its solid development in Europe and has announced its roadmap of expansion beyond Europe from 2019. The collaboration between eTradeConnect and we.trade opens the first doorway between the Asian and European markets.</p>
<p>The two platforms share a common vision of facilitating cross-border trades through establishing global connectivity. The collaboration of the two platforms with similar functions using similar technology also creates strong bonding and synergy, towards the development of a global network of networks. This paves the way for a digitised trade corridor between Asia and Europe for trade finance business.</p>
<p>Haster Tang, Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform Company Limited, said ""We are delighted to collaborate with we.trade and believe that the connection between the two platforms will revolutionize the trade finance ecosystem for the benefit of trade partners. The cross-blockchain connectivity between eTradeConnect and We.trade will definitely gain recognition from the stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Roberto Mancone, COO, we.trade, echoed this sentiment, “we.trade is delighted to partner with eTradeConnect with the support from HKMA, this collaboration concerns not only IT connectivity but also operational models, legal frameworks, and governance between the networks and their users. This type of co-operation between platforms will be more and more necessary going forward, given the decentralization and proliferation of global digital solutions. It is exciting for we.trade to be at the forefront of this movement and co-developing the first such interconnection development between trade platforms. Our aim is to develop a framework that can be applied to connect to other networks in the future.”</p>

<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – Crédit Agricole Italia Banking Group launches the new instant payments service available directly from internet banking and via the mobile banking app. Starting from today and thanks to SIA’s digital platform, all holders of a current account at one of the Banks in the Group can make and receive instant credit payments directly from their computer, smartphone or tablet using Nowbanking in the desktop, app and mobile responsive versions.</p>
<p>With this new initiative, Crédit Agricole Italia Banking Group reaffirms its innovative vocation by offering distinctive payment services that allow its private and business customers to transfer up to €15,000 per individual transaction, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in line with the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme of the European Payments Council (EPC).</p>
<p>The Group’s new instant payment service is managed via the innovative SIA EasyWay platform that enables real-time exchange of transactions in a secure and protected manner with EBA Clearing’s RT1 pan-European instant payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>SIA EasyWay was created with the aim of accelerating the process of adoption of instant payments and of all the other SEPA payment and collection instruments by banks and the other European Payment Service Providers (PSP) while minimizing investments and simplifying the operative management. In addition to granting access to EBA Clearing’s RT1 system, the platform is also ready to manage instant payments on TIPS, the new service of the Eurosystem (the ECB and national central banks in the Eurozone) the launch of which is expected by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>“Since we are a proximity bank and, at the same time, a Group with an ever increasing digital vocation, we believe that the relationship with our customers is based on the development of innovative products and services that are easy to use even when on the move,” commented Filippo Corsaro, Head of Product and Customer Marketing at Crédit Agricole Italia Banking Group. “We are pleased to be able to contribute actively to the spread of this new payment method, both nationally and internationally, and to be among the first Banking Groups to offer Instant Payments to its customers. With the launch of the new service we have completed another piece of our strategic plan, 100% human and 100% digital.”</p>
<p>“The development of the collaboration with Crédit Agricole Italia represents a further step forward in SIA’s positioning as the technological partner of reference for the main European banking groups in the field of advanced payment services,” said Roberta Gobbi, Director of SIA’s Financial Institutions Division. “Italy thus confirms its place among the most dynamic countries in the adoption of instant payments, currently made available by over 1,000 payment service providers present in 12 Eurozone countries.”</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> October 2018</strong> – The Voltron initiative has launched the open platform for documentary trade, targeting production on R3’s Corda Enterprise blockchain platform in 2019. Founding members of Voltron include Bangkok Bank, BNP Paribas,  CTBC Holding, HSBC, ING, NatWest, SEB and Standard Chartered. Voltron’s initial aim is to use blockchain technology to bring significant efficiencies to transacting letters of credit.</p>
<p>Collaboration with corporate customers has been critical in shaping the initiative, with a successful live transaction with Cargill in May 2018 demonstrating the viability of the platform. Voltron is continuing to extend its corporate customer programme to undertake more live transactions and is in active discussions with a number of corporates.</p>
<p>Corporate customers will be able to connect with their banks and trading partners via a single, simplified channel, for both issuance of letters of credit and presentation/exchange of documents across an open network. In addition, trade documents produced on external networks by a corporate’s supply chain partners can be digitally sent, verified and processed in Voltron. This new model provides legal enforceability of title documents and greater digitisation across business networks on Corda, addressing the challenge of today’s digital islands bridged by paper-based processes. The Bolero network and electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) functionality is included at launch. The essDocs network and eBL solution will start the initial design and integration with the Voltron solution, with others to be added on a rolling basis.</p>
<p>Voltron will enable banks to speed up financing decisions and enhance the customer experience. The banks’ corporate clients can reduce internal operational procedures through less reconciliation with their trading partners and banks.To help lower barriers of adoption and create an open ecosystem, a unique partner programme is available to enable trade finance platform providers to offer a Letters of Credit solution on the Voltron business network. Voltron is working with four of the leading trade finance platform vendors to design and build a solution that will offer a Voltron-enabled service to their existing bank and corporate customers.</p>
<p>Voltron extends an open invitation to all banks and corporates to apply to join the network</p>
<p>David E. Rutter, CEO, R3 comments: “Today’s trade finance solutions were built in siloes, adding significant risk, operational inefficiencies and costs into the process. Previous trades conducted on Voltron have demonstrated banks can offer a commercially and operationally viable blockchain solution with significant customer benefit.</p>
<p>“It is critical for banks and corporates to have the option to work with the technology partner of their choice, as this lowers barriers to adoption and helps drive widespread deployment of Voltron via our partners. In addition, our focus on industry collaboration and open networks uniquely positions Voltron to scale by leveraging the Corda Network to ensure interoperability with other global trade initiatives and  other networks including supply chain, cash, insurance and identity.”</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> October 2018</strong> – Deutsche Bank has accelerated the opening of its IT systems to third-party service providers across its corporate and investment banking and private and commercial banking divisions. The bank is building an “ecosystem” of application programming interfaces (APIs), which will enable third-party providers such as FinTechs to develop new services and applications using the bank’s client data. In doing so, the bank aims to establish the broadest possible range of applications linked to its data and systems – expanding beyond traditional financial services.</p>
<p>“Companies such as SAP, Amazon and Apple have created ecosystems around their platforms and systems, allowing third parties to play in their gardens,” said Thomas Nielsen, Chief Digital Officer at Deutsche Bank’s Global Transaction Bank. “The financial services industry is now undergoing the same evolution.”</p>
<p>“This gives banks much greater potential for innovation and growth than they can generate by being single product-oriented. This will play a central role in driving the platform economy in banking,” adds Nielsen, who sees numerous opportunities for applications serving commercial clients right across cash and risk management, trade finance and securities services.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank’s investment bank is building on the existing Deutsche Bank Application Programming Interface (dbAPI), which was successfully launched in the private and commercial arm of the bank in 2017, and which is already linked to numerous external applications.</p>
<p>This is part of the bank’s open banking strategy, which encourages partnering companies to generate complementary and innovative products and services. These partners may be financial service providers that want to enhance existing applications with the aid of bank data, or firms that want to build completely new solutions based on that data.</p>
<p>With the help of Quantiguous Solutions, a Mumbai-based software company acquired by the bank in May this year, Deutsche Bank will accelerate the development and adoption of APIs globally.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> October 2018</strong> – SWIFT gpi has been rapidly adopted since its launch last year, and is now being used to send more than a million payments every day with a combined value of well over $100bn.</p>
<p>Building on the success of gpi, SWIFT continues to enhance the service, and is introducing the ‘tracker for all’, making a standard version of the tracker available to all SWIFT customers. From 2019, all banks on the SWIFT network – not just those signed up to gpi – will be able to trace and confirm their SWIFT payment instructions, and have visibility over their payment activity. The rollout will give all SWIFT customers end-to-end tracking, quickly and efficiently – bringing greater transparency and cost reduction. The introduction of the ‘tracker for all’ will prepare the entire industry for universal gpi adoption by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Improvements to SWIFT gpi go further. While gpi payments between gpi banks are being credited within minutes – often in seconds – payments involving domestic clearing are often delayed owing to the operating hours of domestic payment systems. As more and more countries offer domestic real-time payments 24/7, SWIFT has been working on making these cross-border payments instant as well. Over recent months SWIFT has been trialing the link-up of SWIFT gpi, via gpi members, to domestic real-time payments systems in the Asia-Pacific region. The trial showed that the average time taken for gpi payments sent from China, Singapore and Thailand to settle via a local correspondent bank and through the NPP (New Payments Platform), Australia’s real-time payments system, can be reduced to between 9 and 30 seconds (depending on the routing), down from several hours.</p>
<p>While this initial trial focussed on payments going into Australia, findings from the trial will be used to finalise a new SWIFT gpi instant cross-border payments service, which will extend gpi linkages to other real-time payment systems around the world.</p>
<p>While the instant cross-border payments effort remains underway, SWIFT has also launched gpi for Corporates (g4C) – a new multi-bank payments tracking solution on SWIFTgpi. The new service enables banks to provide gpi information to their corporate clients using FIN and ISO 20022 standards, thus allowing corporates to initiate and track their gpi payments to and from multiple banks in a single format. Corporates can thereby integrate their gpi flows into their ERP and Treasury Management Systems, gaining real-time, end-to-end views on their cross-border payments flows for the first time. The service is designed to improve corporate payment and cash management processes while reducing complexity, cost and the burden of handling exceptions and investigations.</p>
<p>Nine leading international corporates working together with seven gpi banks have so far successfully implemented multi-bank tracking of gpi payments in their treasury applications.</p>
<p>Harry Newman, Head of Banking at SWIFT, said: “Since we launched gpi last year, the enthusiasm and support has been off the charts, and gpi is already radically improving the day-to-day experience of banks and their corporate customers. The community has already achieved an enormous amount, but we are not sitting back and basking in the success – instead we are busy improving the service and fulfilling our promise to truly transform cross-border payments for everyone.”</p>
<p>The banks participating in the instant cross-border payments trial are: ANZ, Bangkok Bank, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Commonwealth Bank, DBS, ICBC, KASIKORNBANK, NAB, Siam Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and United Overseas Bank.</p>
<p>Corporates and banks live on g4C include: Airbus, BBVA, Booking.com, Borealis, Citi, Deutsche Bank, General Electric, IATA, J.P. Morgan, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Microsoft, Ping An Group, Roche, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Société Générale and Standard Chartered Bank.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – ANZ, Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered have announced a joint initiative to build a digital “Trade Information Network” by the end of 2018. The founding banks have signed a corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and have agreed to work toward piloting the Network. They will introduce the Network at the SIBOS conference in Sydney, Australia, on 22 October 2018. Once operational, it will become the first inclusive global multi-bank, multi-corporate network in trade finance.</p>
<p>The Network aims to address the unmet demand for financing earlier in the supply chain by enabling corporates to easily and securely communicate trade information directly with banks[1] of their choice. In order to develop a new industry standard in trade finance, the Network’s approach has been validated with extensive corporate and bank engagement. In addition to the founding banks, more than 20 additional banks from around the world are actively participating in developing the Network and several corporates have already expressed an interest in participating in pilots. The Network has the potential to transform international trade.</p>
<p>Corporates will be able to submit and verify purchase orders and invoices to request trade financing from the banks of their choice. By providing those banks with access to trusted trade information, the Network will help to mitigate the risk of double financing and fraudulent trade information across the industry. This enables the relevant banks to better assess risks and provide trade financing earlier in the supply chain, including for small and medium-sized enterprises who have traditionally experienced difficulty in accessing trade finance. Banks will provide financing outside of the Network using their existing systems.</p>
<p>The Network has open architecture and standardised connectivity based on a governance model similar to SWIFT to achieve maximum adoption across the supply chain ecosystem. Corporates will use a simple one-time registration process which will allow them to connect with all banks on the Network.</p>
<p>After an extensive selection process, the Network selected CGI as its technology provider due to their combination of deep trade finance, technology and business consulting expertise, and global presence. The pilot version of the Network is now complete and CGI will continue to support the development of the “Trade Information Network”.</p>
<h4>Quotes from the founding banks</h4>
<p>Mark Evans, Managing Director, Transaction Banking, ANZ: ""At ANZ, digital transformation is a key priority for us – and that includes the digitisation of trade and supply chain finance. We're excited to be a founding bank for this project because it has the potential to improve the customer experience, and be adopted globally – benefitting ANZ, our customers and the industry.”</p>
<p>Rogier Schulpen, Global Head Trade &amp; Working Capital Solutions, Banco Santander: “Cooperation between the main trade finance banks and improving transparency of our clients’ global supply chains is an obvious way to facilitate financing to SMEs around the world. Having a single platform that provides transactional data on underlying trade flows will not only enable financing, but will also stimulate further innovation in the trade finance industry.”</p>
<p>Jacques Levet, Head of Transaction Banking EMEA, BNP Paribas: “This project created by banks and for banks could be very transformative for the trade and supply chain financing space, helping corporates to communicate seamlessly with their banks. The single platform has the potential to impact the real economy by opening up an unparalleled global market in trade and supply chain finance. We are thrilled to be working on this global solution together with six other major industry players.”</p>
<p>John Ahearn, Global Head of Trade, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions: “This is truly a revolutionary project and through our legacy of innovation, Citi is pleased to play a leading role among top global banks to help transform the trade industry. From the very beginning, we recognized the need to work together and answer the call from our clients to collaboratively design such a platform while leveraging our global network.”</p>
<p>Daniel Schmand, Global Head of Trade Finance, Deutsche Bank: “Supply chain finance is an important instrument for corporates to improve their working capital performance, but not all corporate clients today can access this source as required. With this industry network initiative, banks will be able to provide clients access to more financing opportunities and longer financing periods. The possibility to unlock additional financing opportunities along the entire supply chain will further support the overall growth in global trade.”</p>
<p>Vinay Mendonca, Global Head of Product &amp; Propositions, Global Trade and Receivables Finance, HSBC: “Effectively managing and financing global supply chains is essential for sustainable growth. This initiative is focused on providing end-to-end visibility of financial supply chains across banks. This enhanced visibility enables banks to provide more pre and post shipment finance to the currently underserved supplier segment.”</p>
<p>Michael Vrontamitis, Head, Trade, Europe and Americas, Standard Chartered: “The way in which international trade is facilitated by banks has to evolve. With changing client needs and the demand for greater connectivity and accessibility, banks need to set aside traditional models and co-innovate a new global standard for trade finance to reduce the existing 1.5 trillion US dollar trade finance gap and promote commerce globally. We firmly believe the initiative has this ability and are excited to be one of the founding banks.”</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – For technology to truly be transformative, further global regulatory alignment is needed, with any regulatory approach accepting the “new realities” created by emerging solutions.</p>
<p>The emergence of new technology solutions relating to Open APIs, cloud, blockchain and artificial intelligence – and their uptake by the banking industry – has driven increasing volumes of digital data, and new market players, business models and evolving client expectations. Yet their transformative impact will only be realised with further global regulatory alignment and acceptance of the “new realities” created by emerging technologies, says Deutsche Bank’s white paper, “Regulation for banking transformation”, which includes contributions from leading experts across the banking, technology and legal industries.</p>
<p>“Technology provides us with a huge opportunity to change our business models, releasing some control of the component value chain in order to better meet the new needs of clients,” says Thomas Nielsen, Chief Digital Officer, Global Transaction Banking, Deutsche Bank. “Getting this right is something that can only be done through collaboration with regulators and a wide range of industry groups. We must be responsible – but we need to disrupt, or be disrupted.”</p>
<p>The paper, which provides detailed analysis on the current regulatory landscape with respect to emerging technology, and the key challenges to implementing technological innovation in transaction banking, concludes that conducive and forward-thinking regulation stands to be a major catalyst for a thriving and innovative banking industry. For this to happen, it concludes that any regulatory approach must be: globally aligned; technology-neutral; digitally relevant; embracing of new solutions; and industry-led.</p>
<p>“Further regulatory alignment on a global level would greatly support the development of innovative technologies for global business. This is particularly important in the context of data protection and security standards – as long as the rules vary across jurisdictions, technological solutions will be constrained by local boundaries, diluting their potential to transform the industry,” says Polina Evstifeeva, Head of Regulatory Strategy, GTB Chief Digital Office, Deutsche Bank. “This doesn’t mean we have to establish a single global standard for regulation, however. The realistic goal here is attaining a threshold level of alignment across jurisdictions in order to unleash the full benefits.”</p>
<p>The paper highlights a number of areas where regulation may not yet completely account for the “new realities” of technology. For instance, legislation relies on traditional means of ensuring data and information security – requiring access to premises where data is stored on cloud for the purpose of physical audits, as one example. Re-thinking this approach to rather focus on the advanced distributed platforms and cyber security tools employed by cloud service providers would accelerate the movement of core banking services to cloud, suggests the paper. It highlights a number of similar issues – the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for instance, enshrines the “right to be forgotten”, potentially hindering the opportunities derived from the immutability of blockchain.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> October 2018</strong> – SWIFT today announces the introduction of Payment Controls, an intelligent new in-network solution to combat fraudulent payments, and to help strengthen its customers’ existing security.</p>
<p>The commercial availability of the service marks an important milestone in SWIFT’s Customer Security Programme (CSP) – a community initiative launched in 2016 that has increased security and trust across the global financial community.</p>
<p>Payment Controls helps payment operations teams mitigate fraud risk in real-time through its unique alerting and reporting capabilities. The service may be set to flag, hold, release or reject high-risk or uncharacteristic payments in real-time, according to business needs. Initially targeted at smaller financial institutions, the utility service is hosted in the SWIFT cloud to allow users immediate access, with no hardware or software installation or maintenance.</p>
<p>Payment Controls is an important safeguard for firms as the frequency and speed of payments increases. The service bolsters SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi) – the new standard in global payments, which has dramatically improved cross-border payments since it was launched last year.</p>
<p>As part of gpi, and to further strengthen customer defences, SWIFT will introduce a new ‘stop and recall’ capability that will enable banks to immediately stop and recall a payment anywhere in the chain. The new feature will provide another barrier against fraud – mitigating business disruption and financial losses in the face of rising threats.</p>
<p>Luc Meurant, Chief Marketing Officer at SWIFT, said: “The growing threat of cyberattacks has never been more pressing, and banks need to be able to verify the integrity of payments in real time. Payment Controls demonstrates our commitment to playing our part in protecting the security of the wider financial services industry. I am confident that the new service will be an important weapon in the fight against fraud.”</p>
<p>Mark McNulty, Global Clearing and FI payments Head, at Citi, said: “Putting the right security tools in place is vital for any bank in mitigating payment fraud risk. The launch of SWIFT’s Payment Controls service is a very welcome step towards reinforcing and safeguarding the security of our ecosystem. For banks, it screens transactions in-flight and flags, holds or rejects transactions based on risk policies – ultimately protecting their operations, fighting cyber-crime and making the community safer for everyone.”</p>
<p>Patricio Melo, Executive Vice President of Technology and Operations at Banco Davivienda, said: ""For Davivienda it is a privilege to work with SWIFT, especially at this pivotal moment in the financial industry, in which banks should be working towards strengthening their payment processing systems and reducing the threat of fraud. Through the service provided by SWIFT’s Payment Controls, we are confident that our system will not only be better protected from fraud risk, but allow us to then deliver a trusted service to our clients.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> October 2018</strong> – SWIFT announces successful test results of its new instant cross-border payments proof of concept, involving banks in China, Singapore, Thailand and Australia.</p>
<p>The trial successfully demonstrated that by enabling gpi in real-time domestic systems, payments can be effected almost instantly, even when they involve domestic settlement and non-gpi banks.</p>
<p>Since going live in 2017, SWIFT gpi has removed many of the common frictions experienced in cross-border payments. 50% of gpi payments are now being credited to end-beneficiary accounts within 30 minutes and many of those within seconds. The fastest payment made directly between gpi banks in these corridors was initiated from a gpi bank in Singapore and credited to a bank account at an Australian gpi bank within nine seconds. In effect, this is already a live real-time cross-border payment.</p>
<p>However, when there are multiple banks involved in the payment chain, and the final leg needs to be cleared within the recipient country, the domestic payments are sometimes delayed owing to the limited operating hours of the local clearing systems.</p>
<p>With the advent of real-time payments systems, which typically operate 24/7, there is an opportunity to remove these frictions and ensure that many of these payments can be credited in seconds rather than hours.</p>
<p>The debut of Australia’s domestic instant payment system, the New Payments Platform (NPP), enabled SWIFT and a group of banks from Australia, China, Singapore and Thailand*, to study the feasibility of enabling the gpi service in NPP and to review how this would enable these cross-border payments to be sped up.</p>
<p>What the trial sought to establish was whether, by integrating and enabling the service via gpi members into a domestic instant payment system, the gpi experience could be extended deeper into domestic markets, to end beneficiaries’ accounts, even outside normal business hours.</p>
<p>This trial has indeed confirmed that the SWIFT gpi “payments in seconds” experience can be extended seamlessly via domestic real-time payment systems to all NPP enabled bank accounts.</p>
<p>Key highlights from the trial:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Twelve participating banks participated in this trial, with nine banks sending cross-border SWIFT gpi payments to Australia, and three banks in Australia processing the payments domestically via NPP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trial covered three country corridors, namely China-Australia, Singapore-Australia and Thailand-Australia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most real-world requirements were simulated in the test to ensure comprehensiveness, including: screening, payment validations, liquidity management, message transformation and real-time status updates to the SWIFT gpi tracker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extension of operating hours was validated with incoming payments processed both during and outside business hours in Australia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fastest SWIFT gpi payment in the trial was sent from China, reaching the end beneficiary account in Australia via NPP in 18 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fastest test payments from Singapore and Thailand were similarly credited to Australian end beneficiaries via NPP within 30 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the payments sent during the trial were processed end-to-end within 60 seconds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Eddie Haddad, Managing Director of SWIFT, Asia Pacific, said: “These results demonstrate two important prerequisites necessary to realise an instant cross-border payment service. First, we are able to extend the window for processing cross-border payments outside traditional business hours. Second, by enabling cross-border SWIFT gpi payments via gpi members, through domestic real-time payment systems, we are able to achieve faster cross-border payments amongst a larger number of institutions. The linkage was achieved by participant banks like National Australia Bank processing incoming SWIFT gpi payments onward as NPP instant payments.”</p>
<p>Mr. Paul Franklin, General Manager, Payments, National Australia Bank Limited, said: ""NAB is proud to have taken a lead role in the recent SWIFT instant processing proof of concept for cross-border payments into NPP. We have demonstrated the ability for customers to have access to funds within seconds and dramatic decreases in end-to-end processing times. It has given us an opportunity to show that our 24/7 clearing capability through NPP can be used to process international payments to other banks outside traditional RTGS business hours, which offers the potential for much later cut-off times, which is especially useful for payments originated in Asian time-zones. The success of this pilot has come from the combined effort of the participating banks, and a mutual desire to deliver a better payment experience for customers.”</p>
<p>This initial trial focussed on payments going into Australia through gpi banks into NPP, however findings from the trial are now being used to finalise a new SWIFT gpi instant cross-border payments service, designed to scale and integrate with other real-time payment systems across the world. SWIFT is in discussions, together with banks, with multiple domestic real-time payment operators and regulators to discuss how those payment corridors could also be enabled with gpi. The service will reuse existing SWIFT gpi infrastructure, adding incremental business rules to remove residual business frictions in the payments chain, thus avoiding the need for additional investment in new cross-border infrastructure.</p>
<p>Since its launch in January 2017, SWIFT gpi has been rapidly adopted by over 270 financial institutions, with more than USD100 billion in SWIFT gpi messages sent every day. Half of SWIFT gpi payments are credited to end beneficiaries in less than 30 minutes, many in seconds, and almost 100% of gpi payments are credited within 24 hours. Over 30% of all SWIFT customer payments are now sent on gpi. By the end of 2020, SWIFT will extend the benefits of its gpi service to all 10,000 banks on its global network.</p>

<p><strong>22<sup>nd</sup> October 2018</strong> – Bank of America Merrill Lynch today announced enhancements to AutoFX, its automated currency conversion product for financial institutions. The new capability uses data analytics to make settlements faster, less expensive and more certain for the sending bank. AutoFX now also allows users to customize criteria for automated conversion.</p>
<p>AutoFX enables a bank sending a cross-border payment on behalf of its client to have BofA Merrill automatically convert the payment into the recipient’s local currency. The integration of new data analytics better enables AutoFX to quickly qualify eligible transactions that are destined for beneficiaries with local currency accounts.</p>
<p>“We continue to improve our cutting-edge data analytics in our leading cross-currency solution, giving clients even more convenience when moving money across borders,” said David Kretz, head of Global Payments in Global Transaction Services (GTS) for BofA Merrill. “As the economy continues to grow more global, the ability to provide services such as automated currency conversion will become more essential for local and regional banks.”</p>
<p>Executing wire payments to foreign beneficiaries is standard in today’s global economy. However, many smaller banks lack the infrastructure, the accounts and the mechanisms to handle the currency conversions themselves. With AutoFX, the sending bank no longer needs to rely on the recipient bank to convert the currency. Instead, the conversion happens prior to delivery.</p>
<p>“As new technologies evolve and impact global commerce, cross-border payments must keep pace,” said Stephanie Wolf, head of Financial Services Companies and Governments for GTS. “In that context, we’ll continue to roll out innovations that enhance the value chain to our financial institution clients, and ultimately their own clients.”</p>
<p>BofA Merrill’s AutoFX offers an expansive global reach, with up to 89 countries and 41 corresponding currencies. As its name suggests, once set up, AutoFX runs automatically, using machine learning to better evaluate each eligible transaction and convert those destined for beneficiaries with local currency accounts.</p>
<p>BofA Merrill’s GTS business provides comprehensive global treasury solutions across the breadth of the working capital cycle, including liquidity management, payments and receipts, commercial card, foreign exchange and trade and supply chain finance. With a history spanning more than 230 years, GTS supports thousands of clients ― small businesses, mid-size companies, large corporations, financial institutions and public-sector entities ― in more than 200 countries and 140 currencies.</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Banking Commission has announced a long-term agreement with Global Credit Data (GCD), an association owned by banks and home to the world’s largest database of bank defaults, to strengthen analysis within the market-leading ICC Trade Register.</p>
<p>The ICC Trade Register is one of the few comprehensive sources to provide an objective and transparent view of the credit risk profile and characteristics of trade and export finance. GCD will now manage and oversee the collection of credit-related data from ICC Trade Register member banks. The cooperation will allow ICC and GCD to provide more granular data and detailed benchmarking reports to members.</p>
<p>Krishnan Ramadurai, Chair of the ICC Trade Register project, said: “The ICC Trade Register is an indispensable tool for the global banking system and policymakers, enhancing market understanding of the nature of trade finance and contributing to informed policy and regulatory decision-making. This agreement with GCD, which is at the forefront of data collection and analysis, will allow us to further develop and evolve the ICC Trade Register as the go-to source for quality and trusted data, which can be used for robust analysis.”</p>
<p>David Bischof, Senior Policy Manager at the ICC Banking Commission, added: “There is a direct and critical link between the availability of timely and affordable trade finance and the conduct of international trade. Since its inception, the ICC Trade Register has been instrumental in promoting dialogue and advocacy around trade finance as an asset class in its own right.”</p>
<p>The ICC Trade Register was established in 2011 and has since grown to include 22 member banks, covering over US$10.5trn of exposures and more than 20 million trade finance transactions. The trade finance products included in the register have traditionally been letters of credit, loans for import/export and performance guarantees. The next edition, to be released in the first quarter of 2019, with Boston Consulting Group as a strategic partner, will expand to include supply chain finance products and export finance provided by non-OECD export credit agencies. Data collection for the report will begin in October 2018.</p>
<p>Philip Winckle, Executive Director of GCD, said: “Extending our work with the ICC Banking Commission on this market-leading project will improve the quality of trade finance credit data for the market and for our members. This will help banks better understand the risks they take and better comply with regulatory rules such as the Basel Framework.”</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://iccwbo.org/publication/icc-trade-register-report-2017/"" target=""_blank"">latest ICC Trade Register</a>, released in February 2018, revealed the low-risk nature of transactions that support global trade, and confirmed that trade finance products continue to present banks with low levels of credit risk.</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> October 2018</strong> – <a href=""https://drooms.com/en"" target=""_blank"">Drooms</a> is moving its virtual data room (VDR) offering into the Blockchain age. As Europe’s leading VDR provider for the UK, Drooms is using this modern technology to enhance the security of transaction data archives. Until now, all data has been stored on physical data carriers following completion of a transaction. But now it can be archived in Drooms’ virtual NXG data room with blockchain protection.</p>
<p>As a result, the secured data cannot be lost, is non-manipulable and is accessible to all parties involved in a transaction at any time. Any warranty issues or necessary contract checks can be carried out quickly and problem-free via the data room after a transaction has been completed.</p>
<p>As such, the application of Blockchain archiving makes a VDR an ideal tool for solicitors and notaries.</p>
<h3>Highly promising Blockchain potential</h3>
<p>Drooms NXG with Blockchain protection is simple and practical to use with no great effort required on the part of users: The data room is not deleted following completion of a transaction; instead, metadata can be stored on the blockchain. The documents secured by blockchain are then stored on Drooms’s highly-secure servers. The Drooms VDR with blockchain archiving fulfils all requirements applicable in Europe, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Drooms NXG data room with blockchain protection is available immediately. Drooms will present the technology at the city of Frankfurt stand at the Expo Real real estate trade fair held in Munich.</p>
<p>Petter Made, Head of Product at Drooms, says: “Blockchain has enormous potential when applied to transactions. The launch of the Drooms NXG data room with Blockchain archiving means that traditional data carriers, for example those used in due diligence processes, are a thing of the past. Highly sensitive documents should not be stored on DVDs or USB sticks and stored in a cupboard. This is neither transparent nor efficient. Above all, it exposes all parties involved in a transaction, including businesses, solicitors and notaries, to a huge security risk. Blockchain archiving, with the help of our data rooms, is the correct, reliable and future-proof solution to this huge data security problem.”</p>
<p>Alexandre Grellier, Drooms CEO, says: “Once again we are demonstrating our high level of technological expertise and pioneering role in introducing new technologies into the transaction business by taking the Drooms NXG data room into the Blockchain age. The market is certainly ready to use Blockchain technology for business practices: extensive discourse with our customers has convinced us that there is both great openness towards, and heavy demand for, an innovative archiving function such as the one we are now offering. Blockchain is a technology that, in conjunction with our data rooms, delivers genuine added value.”</p>

<p>In 2018, COLG acquired Echo Financial Services Ltd which is currently re-branding to “Recognise”.

Her qualifications include both Electronic Engineering and Management.</p>
<p>Michael Goldstein, CEO, COLG said: “I am delighted that we have been able to bring Monica on board to support the group and particularly Jason Oakley and the Recognise team.

<p>Monica Velasquez-Torres said: “Having worked with the COLG and Recognise management as part of the wider PwC banking consultancy this was an exciting opportunity to join a talented, very experienced team on their licence journey and to deliver the technology vision.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018</strong> – Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ:EPAY), a leading provider of financial technology that helps make business payments simple, smart and secure, today announced it has expanded its Secure Payments solution to monitor additional payment types. The solution can now proactively monitor FileAct, SEPA, SIC4, and ISO20022 payments and provide customers with a single interface for detecting and investigating potential fraud in their payments ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We know that user and transaction monitoring across multiple channels, applications, and payment types is critical to provide enhanced fraud detection for banks and corporates,” said James Richardson, Head of Market Development Risk and Fraud, Bottomline Technologies. “Businesses and banks that rely only on ‘in-network’ capabilities to detect fraud are taking a risk.”</p>
<p>Bottomline’s Secure Payments solution protects payments across a variety of applications, channels, and payment types including: ACH, Wire, Faster Payments, Bacs, FileAct, SEPA, SIC4, SWIFT, ISO 20022, Bill Pay and Check.</p>
<p>Bottomline’s flexible platform delivers proven protection against payment fraud through advanced analytics of user behavior and transaction flows layered with intelligent machine learning. Secure Payments detects fraudulent transactions in real-time, holds payments prior to them entering the network, and secures online and mobile sessions and account activity; all while meeting evolving regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>“Part of the complexity with business payments is that they don’t come in a single flavor,” said Richardson. “The sophistication of payment related fraud schemes are evolving rapidly. Organizations need adaptable fraud detection to protect different types of payments and across multiple networks.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018</strong> – PRETA announced today that over 40 major European financial institutions and service providers have signed up to fund and complete PRETA’s pan-European PSD2 access directory.</p>
<p>With the delivery of this directory, PRETA’s Open Banking Europe initiative is answering to the market need for a single, standardised, trusted and machine-readable <a href=""https://directory-te.preta.eu/directory/account/login"" target=""_blank"">repository</a> of regulatory data related to third-party providers (TPPs). The directory is an important element in enabling access-to-account (XS2A) services. It will also provide operational data for all regulated account-servicing payment service providers (AS-PSPs) and TPPs in Europe as well as data on qualified trust service providers (QTSPs), which issue the PSD2 eIDAS certificates needed for the identification of TPPs.</p>
<p>“The strong support of our initiative by some of the largest financial institutions, covering all the countries in Europe, shows the vital need for a common and collaborative directory that combines the information from the different national repositories and makes it available in a way that is easy to access and process,” said John Broxis Managing Director of PRETA. “The effort required to understand 31 national registries, each holding multiple types of payment service provider information, should not be underestimated, but when you work together and jointly shoulder the effort, the task becomes much easier.”</p>
<p>Open Banking Europe brings together different players involved in PSD2 in one single collaborative space with the objective to shape and harmonise PSD2 implementation processes where needed. This is done through workshop, webinars, networking activities and collaborations with external partners, such as <a href=""https://directory-te.preta.eu/directory/account/login"" target=""_blank"">ETSI</a>, with whom PRETA has recently agreed an MOU to cooperate and promote PSD2 XS2A-relevant standards.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support and collaboration of all participants, Open Banking Europe has now started to work on other harmonisation and conformance aspects, supporting the industry in its move to open banking.</p>
<p>Parties interested in using the OBE directory are invited to contact PRETA at <a href=""mailto:info@openbankingeurope.eu"">info@openbankingeurope.eu</a></p>

<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – ABBYY, a global provider of content intelligence solutions and services, today announced the launch of ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 Release 2. The updated enterprise capture platform offers dramatically improved performance and higher processing speeds, continuous improvement through deeply integrated machine learning, and a brand new native cloud delivery channel. This allows any organisation pursuing a digital transformation strategy to reduce processing costs, improve accuracy, accelerate time-to-revenue, and strengthen their position in the market.</p>
<p>ABBYY FlexiCapture is an intelligent platform for capturing meaningful data, relationships, and insights from documents, forms, and correspondence to improve business outcomes. FlexiCapture transforms documents into business value by capturing and validating information in any format at its point of need. By digitising documents and automating document processes,</p>
<p>FlexiCapture helps organisations remove risk and cost, accelerate revenue, and drive competitive advantage by automatically understanding content within documents and transforming it into meaningful insights. It is available both as a core enterprise capture platform and as a data capture component of robotic process automation (RPA) solutions.</p>
<p>The platform is perfectly suited for any enterprises or organisations implementing a digital transformation strategy. It solves the key pain points by capturing and understanding information to accelerate transactions, reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and make better and faster decisions.</p>
<p>ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 R2 introduces a new delivery channel – FlexiCapture Cloud, a multitenant platform based on ABBYY FlexiCapture distributed application, which is hosted and managed by ABBYY on Microsoft Azure Cloud. It simplifies the consumption, deployment, and supportability of an enterprise capture solution and offers customers the most options in how they choose to deploy and consume intelligent capture.</p>
<p>With the new FlexiCapture, businesses and organisations also can substantially increase their processing volume and speed compared to the previous version of the software. The platform can be scaled both vertically and horizontally when deployed to support both high volume and fast document processing scenarios. Whether the customer needs to process more than 3 million documents in 24 hours or 2,000 pages a minute, FlexCapture’s architecture scales to meet the processing requirements. The user can control multi-server installations, distributed infrastructure, and operators via centralised configuration and management.</p>
<p>“FlexiCapture 12 Release 2 combines the high accuracy of self-learning intelligent capture technologies with accessibility and scalability provided by Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. At ABBYY, we aim to facilitate digital transformation delivering easy-to-integrate solutions for businesses, service providers, and software developers, so that they could achieve operational excellence, document flow visibility and ultimately better performance”, comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY.</p>
<p>The AI-powered capture technology continuously improves, providing a faster, smoother workflow, while cutting labour and operating costs. The newly implemented machine learning techniques work in two ways: on the one hand, they ensure quick solution deployment, on the other, boost on-going performance while reducing the need for offline maintenance, system downtime, and costly professional services.</p>
<p>As always, ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 Release 2 comes with ready-to-use country-specific document profiles to jump-start the automation process and supports multiple input channels including email, paper, fax, e-documents, and mobile clients for iOS and Android to quickly process documents on the go.</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018</strong> – Volante Technologies Inc., a global provider of software for accelerated end-to-end payments processing, today announced that Qatar Islamic Bank UK plc (QIB) has selected VolPay Channel: Open Banking and Token to implement PSD2 compliance for the bank.</p>
<p>Building upon Volante’s partnership with Token who provide PSD2 compliant APIs, VolPay Channel: Open Banking will deliver a complete out-of-the-box solution for handling complex orchestration related to PSD2 regulation, along with flexibility to handle the evolving Open Banking landscape.</p>
<p>VolPay Channel will not only manage the two-way communication between the API layer and the bank’s systems, but also tie the authentication and execution of the payment into a meaningful user journey across multiple use cases. The solution has been designed with interoperability in mind, providing banks with an option to work with multiple TSPs in one or more geographies. As with all VolPay Suite products, the solution includes high degrees of automation enabling a rapid implementation with minimal disruption to QIB.</p>
<p>Nadish Lad, Global head of Payment Products, Volante Technologies, commented, “Banking practice and regulation is changing faster than ever and it is important to lay down a firm foundation for Open Banking and payments orchestration rather than embarking on piecemeal development. The complexity is not only in the integration, it is also around adapting multiple use cases for a seamless improved customer experience.”</p>
<p>Philip Benson, Senior Operations Manager, QIB (UK), commented, “By using Volante’s ready-made PSD2 solution, we are able to become PSD2 compliant within only a few months, without having to divert costly IT resource to the project. This enables us to focus on our core business and we continue to serve our UK clients in the best way possible.”</p>

<p><strong>1<sup>st</sup> September 2018</strong> – IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and Demica, one of the world’s largest working-capital financial technology firms, today announced a new partnership that will help unlock as much as $9.8 billion in annual financing for suppliers and distributors in emerging markets—particularly small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>In addition, IFC participated in Demica’s $25 million second round financing that will enable the company to further expand internationally, move into inventory finance and continue to invest in its technology and operations. Additional investors in this round included Wyelands Capital, a member of the GFG Alliance, alongside strong involvement from the existing investors: JRJ Group, TOMS Capital, and 76 West Holdings.</p>
<p>Small and medium enterprises in emerging markets face a finance gap of $4.5 trillion—and the scarcity of working capital and trade finance accounts for much of that gap. Demica’s proprietary technology platform enables suppliers around the world to sell their receivables and optimize their cashflow simply and at low cost—by connecting them to large corporations and investors. Demica facilitates more than $90 billion a year in working-capital financing, connecting more than 150 corporations with suppliers and customers across more than 130 countries.</p>
<p>“IFC’s investment is an amazing endorsement from one of the world’s largest multilateral institutions,” said Matt Wreford, Demica’s CEO. “We have been working closely with them for the past twelve months and are excited about the deepening relationship. This strategic partnership will materially enhance our clients’ ability to ensure all of their suppliers can access low cost liquidity irrespective of jurisdiction.”</p>
<p>By 2022, IFC’s investment in Demica is expected to facilitate $9.8 billion in annual financing for suppliers and distributors in emerging markets—at least 40 percent of which will be small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>“Supply chains are becoming more global, introducing currency and jurisdiction complexity for investors in working-capital finance,” said Andi Dervishi, who leads IFC’s fintech investments. “At the same time, those supply chains want more capital choices and faster capital delivery. Hub-and-spoke, multi-jurisdiction and multi-currency models like Demica’s provide the business model and the infrastructure to meet these needs. Such approaches are key to IFC’s drive to create new markets by changing market architecture and market participation.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018</strong> – we.trade, a leader of blockchain based digital trade services, and three banks from the former Batavia consortium have joined forces. CaixaBank, Erste Group and UBS have joined we.trade as banking partners and shareholders alongside the platform’s existing banks: Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Nordea, Rabobank, Santander, Societe Generale and UniCredit, bringing the number of shareholders to twelve.</p>
<p>The joint endeavour ensures that companies can access the platform’s unprecedented market reach and use their network for their international trade needs, distributing we.trade across 13 countries.</p>
<p>Following we.trade’s successful launch in June, the additional banking partners strengthen the platform’s position as the largest blockchain-based digital trade financing company in production. The shareholder banks have identified significant product and technology synergies with the former Batavia banks, as they have all developed similar solutions with IBM on Hyperledger Fabric, an open source blockchain framework hosted by The Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>we.trade continues to expand and evaluate additional partners from both the banking and non-banking sectors to join its vision of an open and interoperable platform. The addition of CaixaBank, Erste Group and UBS extends we.trade’s geographical reach to the following European countries -Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.</p>
<p>The we.trade platform addresses the expectations of companies to make cross-border trade more straightforward through the extension of its digital trade network. The distribution force of participating international financial institutions positions we.trade as an innovator in the trade finance market and as a leading partner for its market adoption and expansion beyond Europe.</p>
<p>“we.trade welcomes CaixaBank, Erste Group and UBS as shareholders and users. This confirms the previously announced roadmap of we.trade and keeps us on track with our strategy of expanding our global coverage network over the coming quarters with banking and non-banking partners.”, said Roberto Mancone, Chief Operating Officer, we.trade.</p>
<p>“By joining we.trade, we will be able to provide all our international corporate clients with leading-edge digital trade solutions, consolidating our fully customer-centric innovation model” says Mar Santana Rollán, Director Foreign Trade &amp; Exchange, CaixaBank. “We’re glad that Erste Group is joining we.trade as an equal shareholder, allowing us to put together our knowledge of blockchain-based trade services, which we have built up within Batavia, and to make we.trade’s uniquely convincing offering available to our corporate clients. The enlarged we.trade stands out among trade services platforms through its innovative and proven application of blockchain technology and its unparalleled reach across markets” said Ingo Bleier, Head of Group Corporates at Erste Group. ""We're delighted to have joined forces with we.trade, we're convinced that corporates in Switzerland will benefit from this innovative offering in their international trading activities and in supporting business growth with counterparties abroad.”, states Andy Kollegger, Head CIC Products &amp; Services,UBS.</p>
<p>Hubert Benoot, Head of Trade Finance at KBC and Chairman of the we.trade Board of Directors, explained, “We are constantly looking for ways to make the experience for our customers even more seamless, simple and trustful than it already is today”. Therefore we.trade is welcoming additional partners (banks, their customers and non-banks) to share their visions and ideas for an open and interoperable platform in trade services. We.trade expects to continue expanding into additional markets in Europe and globally”.</p>
<p>“IBM believes that the key to success with blockchain solutions lies within the strength of the network,” said Jason Kelley, General Manager Blockchain Services, IBM. “we are excited to see this success as a proof point that networks will continue to grow through an evolution of coming together in complementary areas to build broader ecosystems, and in many cases a network of networks. In the innovative we.trade network there is strength in being able to securely share data within a permissioned network, banks will be able to finance supply chain processes more efficiently and with greater trust.”</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – Citi <a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/c?mod=MW_story_quote"" target=""_blank"">C, -0.45%</a> has announced the launch of its new global solution, Citi® Virtual Accounts, which allows clients to segregate their balances under a single physical account, providing enhanced visibility, control and efficiencies through centralized payments, receivables and liquidity management.</p>
<p>The in-house solution leverages the strength of Citi’s on the ground presence whilst delivering a globally consistent offering and is live with clients in Western Europe covering 16 markets and 37 currencies, with the U.S. and Asia to follow.</p>
<p>Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, commented: “Citi’s investment in proprietary virtual account technology exemplifies our commitment to providing clients with simple, global and digital solutions. Citi’s virtual account solution is a strategic enabler for corporate treasuries of both our traditional and digital clients, providing a platform for benefits such as bank account rationalization and automated reconciliation.”</p>
<p>“Citi’s virtual account solution is designed to be fully adaptable to our clients needs, allowing treasurers to tailor banking structures to their unique requirements. With a centralized view of real-time cash positions, corporate treasuries can optimize liquidity management and make more informed funding decisions,” added Mark Smith, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi.</p>
<p>The flexibility offered by Citi’s solution allows clients to individually view transaction activity, manage online banking entitlements and generate virtual account statements. Virtual account structures can be configured for a single entity or support the “On Behalf Of” model of an in-house bank. From an accounts receivables perspective, clients can harness additional transparency by using Citi® Virtual Accounts in conjunction with Citi® Payer ID Accounts to further automate the reconciliation process. In addition to servicing treasury needs, the capabilities can also be used as a business enabler for emerging client segments including digital marketplaces and the sharing economy.</p>
<p>Petra Rosenauer, EMEA Treasurer of Flex Ltd commented: “Citi’s virtual account solution differentiated itself by allowing Flex to convert existing Citi physical accounts into virtual accounts. We’re very pleased with the solution and are moving into the second phase of our bank account rationalization project.”</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – To help banking institutions keep pace with evolving business and customer demands, Oracle NetSuite today announced NetSuite Banking as a Service. A unique open banking approach, NetSuite Banking as a Service strengthens bank-to-customer relationships and helps banks create new business models and revenue streams with end-to-end business process automation that is fast, reliable and provides strong security controls.</p>
<p>With innovative fintech providers reshaping the financial services industry, banks need to rethink traditional business processes to adapt to a new era of banking. In fact, according to Forrester Research’s 2018 banking technology predictions, “More than 50% of banks will fail to exploit open banking, starting down the slow, painful path to becoming an unintentional utility.” To be successful in this new digital reality, banks must turn to open banking solutions to differentiate their services and convert customer data into a strategic advantage.</p>
<p>“Customers are demanding deeper relationships with financial institutions and as banks have struggled to meet this demand, new fintech providers have emerged to fill the gap,” said Jason Maynard, senior vice president of strategy and marketing, Oracle NetSuite Global Business Unit. “NetSuite Banking as a Service closes that gap and enables banks to provide their customers with a digital experience that we, as consumers, now expect. With NetSuite, banks finally have the means to offer the right services to enhance the customer experience and ultimately increase revenue.”</p>
<p>NetSuite leads the cloud financials/enterprise resource planning (ERP) industry by extending existing ERP solutions to integrate bank processes. From cash forecasting, to trade finance, instant business loans and credit lines, NetSuite Banking as a Service allows banks to leverage their assets to offer these features as part of their own services to meet growing customer expectations. NetSuite customers will benefit from direct access to financial services such as embedded payments, reconciliation and lending delivered as an extension of their ERP. This will help increase operational efficiency and improve workflows driving down cost and creating peace of mind for NetSuite customers.</p>

<p>“One of the most exciting categories in the financial services market is Banking as a Service. This uber category creates big opportunities across the infrastructure, platform, and fintech app level,” said Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder, Constellation Research, Inc.</p>

Morgan Treasury Services. “We are excited to offer connectivity to NetSuite’s ERP system which will facilitate a better, more efficient experience for our clients.”</p>
<p>“The Banking as a Service helps banks regain control over the customer experience, increase revenue opportunities by connecting efficiently with their corporate clients and getting access to new customers and real-time trade data,” said Rob Barnes, CEO of TradeIX. “On the other side, customers using Oracle NetSuite have a single access channel to connect to existing and new financial institutions, thus widening the range of funding opportunities.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – Barclays has announced the successful launch of a new digital platform in Western Europe, as part of a wider move to boost its Corporate Banking operations in the region.</p>
<p>The new platform is the culmination of a long-term project, with Barclays’ international corporate and institutional clients in Portugal, Spain, France and Ireland now enjoying access to an enhanced range of services. Germany is also set to join the platform later in the year, followed by other countries, allowing multinational clients to benefit from a simple, easy to manage digital corporate banking service, which complements the bank’s Investment Banking and Barclaycard Payments capabilities in Europe.</p>
<p>This enhanced platform development has been driven by a commitment to introduce products and processes that are already helping the bank’s UK Corporate Banking clients to those domiciled in Europe and to global clients with a presence in Europe. By adapting the systems from the UK, Barclays has been able to seamlessly transfer existing customers and attract new institutional and large corporate clients.</p>
<p>The changes have been designed to give clients the flexibility to structure their banking activity in the way that best suits them, from a location of their choice, and simplifies significantly Barclays’ offering on the continent. Clients can benefit from a consistent set of digital channels across Cash Management, Trade &amp; Working Capital &amp; Information Services in 25 countries through a combination of Barclays offices and partner banks. This is underpinned by a regional support model for streamlined KYC, account opening &amp; digital client on-boarding, client self-help capabilities &amp; centralised multilingual service offering.</p>
<p>The expansion of European operations has been led by David Farrow, Head of International Corporate Banking (ICB) at Barclays, and will be managed by Andres Baltar, the newly appointed Head of Europe for ICB. Andres has expanded his leadership team in the region with the appointment of new country heads for France, Spain and Portugal, who will be tasked with developing new corporate relationships in their respective territories and improving the service experienced by existing clients.</p>
<p>In addition to these leadership appointments, Barclays is also attracting clients in Europe by investing in new teams, including expanding its Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) business under NBFI Head of Europe, Andy Ponsford. The NBFI growth has been boosted by hiring new specialists based in the region, who will work closely with Barclays’ existing FinTech, Insurance, Private Equity and Asset Management teams in London.</p>
<p>David Farrow said: “We’re a transatlantic bank, so complementing our strength in the UK and US with a comprehensive European proposition allows us to meet the needs of our global clients more effectively. Many of the companies we work with have a presence in a number of European countries, which is why making sure the new platform is standardised across the continent is so important. It’s already making banking simpler for many of our clients, and this ease of use will grow further as we integrate more countries.”</p>
<p>One client already benefitting from access to the improved platform in Europe is Ebury, the financial services provider for businesses. Founded in the UK, Ebury is growing across Europe and has been able to take advantage of Barclays’ enhanced capabilities on the continent to support its expansion.</p>
<p>Mark Hewlett, Wholesale Banking Relationship Director at Ebury, said: “Barclays has been our banking partner since day one and has been instrumental in making Ebury a success. Its knowledge and understanding of our sector is unrivalled. We continue to deepen the relationship with Barclays across Europe and we continually look at how we can make the most of our strengths and capabilities to improve our proposition.</p>
<p>“The Barclays European proposition has enabled us to effectively expand our banking network across the continent, using the same services we enjoy in the UK. Our recent collaboration with Barclays in directly connecting to the Faster Payments scheme is a great example of how we can make the most of the evolving landscape to provide benefits to our clients and ourselves as a client of Barclays. A real win/win relationship.”</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – <a href=""http://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> has launched Fusion Essence in the cloud, a fully integrated core and digital solution, localized for the UK Market. Deployed on Azure, Microsoft’s enterprise-ready, trusted cloud platform, it is available to all banks, but is particularly suited to ambitious challenger banks, enabling them to come to market with velocity and allowing them to launch personalized offerings first and fast, maintaining a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Anand Subbaraman, General Manager, Retail Banking at Finastra said, “The launch of our first fully integrated cloud-based retail solution in the UK, operated by us – as opposed to licensed by us – is a significant step for Finastra. It reflects our progressive journey from a product-centric organization five or six years ago, to a solution and service driven Fintech company. Embracing a tailored retail banking solution in the cloud that gives challenger banks quick access to a comprehensive end-to-end technology offering provides them with the speed that is critical to their success. This is essential in a competitive UK market where more banks secure licenses and others look towards consolidation with larger traditional institutions.”</p>
<p>Fusion Essence in the cloud frees banks from the burden of IT operations with a pay-as-you-go subscription model. Covering all UK core and digital banking requirements, including lending, digitally originated deposits, payments and regulatory reporting, it is fully integrated with third-party providers for credit reference checks as part of AML and KYC processes and regulatory reporting. An accelerated onboarding approach powered by Fusion Essence in the cloud enables banks to launch first and, importantly, to drive fast customer adoption and business growth once live.</p>
<p>Feargal de Burca, Technology Director at KPMG, which worked alongside Finastra to build the solution said, “It’s been great to work with Finastra and Microsoft to create something innovative that supports the UK banks and building societies. The sector is changing at pace and in order to stay ahead of customer expectations, banks need to be agile, efficient and creative. I’m proud of our involvement in this unique banking service proposition.”</p>
<p>Craig Focardi, Senior Analyst at Celent, reflects on the move to cloud, “Innovative banks of all sizes are seeking to achieve ‘first mover’ advantages by migrating some or all of their IT services to the cloud in the pursuit of greater agility and cost competitiveness.”</p>
<p>Prospects joining the <a href=""https://www.finastra.com/solutions/retail-banking/core-retail-systems/fusion-essence"" target=""_blank"">Fusion Essence</a> customer community do so at a time of increasing interest in Finastra’s new open platform for innovation,FusionFabric.cloud. Customers can now join the journey and co-create the future of finance together with Finastra and its vibrant partner ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – Now in its third year, the partnership of BNP Paribas, PwC, SAP and the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT) goes from strength to strength with the publication of the latest Journeys to Treasury report. This uniquely collaborative report once again provides expert insights and practical experiences on the key topics that are dominating the treasury agenda today and shaping the treasury of the future.</p>
<p>With so many demands and priorities on treasurers’ agendas, the choice of topics was determined by a careful `survey of senior corporate treasurers in connection with the EACT Summit 2018. This survey revealed that optimising liquidity management remains a priority for many treasurers. In particular, new and emerging solutions presenting fresh opportunities to create operational and strategic advantage. Digital technologies remain an enabler of change and competitive advantage. Treasurers are embracing digitalisation in treasury to manage liquidity and risk more effectively. They are also facilitating wider digital strategies across the business through innovative payment and collection models.</p>
<p>Amidst the opportunities to enhance treasury processes and decision-making, and forge stronger business partnerships, treasurers face a range of issues. Although addressing regulatory challenges remains an issue, treasurers are also tasked with understanding, anticipating and responding to global tax reforms that are influencing corporate organisational structures. Every organisation, in every industry and country, also faces the growing scale and prevalence of cyberattacks, with the risk of financial and reputational damage and loss of business continuity. Treasurers’ role in protecting the company’s financial assets places them at the forefront of efforts to tackle and mitigate rapidly mutating cybersecurity risks.</p>
<p>This year’s report shares the findings of in-depth workshops attended by experts from the four Journeys to Treasury partners, complemented by practical insights, case studies and interviews from eleven leading corporate treasurers. The partners comment on the new edition of the report as follows:</p>
<p>“The scale of the challenge – but also opportunity – for corporate treasurers to add value to their organisations in new ways is unprecedented, but it can be difficult to know where to start. The Journeys to Treasury report offers a valuable guide to help treasurers navigate through uncertainty to create clarity and drive transformation.” [BNP Paribas]</p>
<p>“Much of the educational and thought leadership material available to treasurers presents a single point of view. The value of the Journeys to Treasury collaboration is that it provides multi-faceted perspectives that add richness of insight and acknowledge complexity.” [EACT]</p>
<p>“Corporate treasury continues to evolve to meet the challenges of international growth, emerging digital innovations and a complex, fast-changing market, regulatory and tax environment. The Journeys to Treasury partnership, and this most recent report, helps treasurers to drive and influence change with confidence, enabling them to ask the right questions, and putting the right tools at their disposal.” [PwC]</p>
<p>“Opportunities for digitalisation to transform treasury processes and decision-making have never been greater, but the focus needs to be on using new capabilities to deliver value to the enterprise. The Journeys to Treasury report helps treasurers to shape priorities and business cases to leverage new and established technologies to deliver operational and strategic benefit.” [SAP]</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – Nordea takes a major step by extending Open Banking to Sweden. This gives developers the possibility to begin building applications designed for both Finnish and Swedish customers. “We see open banking as a huge opportunity to create better financial solutions”, says Casper von Koskull, CEO of Nordea.</p>
<p>Nordea’s Open Banking platform was launched at the end of 2017 when Finnish customer data was made available to third party developers. Nordea was one of the first banks in Europe to see the potential opportunities offered by PSD2 (Payment Services Directive) regulations which require banks to open up to third parties to offer services to account holders. Since the launch of Open Banking, more than 2500 developers have registered to test Nordea’s APIs.</p>
<p>“Since going live with Open Banking, we’ve received an overwhelming response from interested developers. This is an exciting expansion and gives us the possibility of inviting third parties targeting Swedish consumers to use our Open Banking service. By moving forward with Sweden, we are maintaining our position as a frontrunner in Open Banking and are the first bank to open up two countries in the Nordics on this scale”, says Erik Zingmark, Head of Transaction Banking at Nordea.</p>
<p>Extending Open Banking into Sweden gives developers the possibility to begin building applications designed for both Finnish and Swedish customers. Following the launch, test data is available to everyone in Nordea’s Developer portal. To access real customer data, third parties are required to obtain a PSD2 licence from the relevant national financial authority.</p>
<p>“We’ve decided to embrace open banking ­– and not just for the sake of compliance with the latest PSD2 regulations. We see open banking as a huge opportunity to create better financial solutions. We know that co-creation with third parties will be essential to innovation and that’s why we’ve opened our APIs to everyone, even our competitors. We’re combining our extensive knowledge and resources with the agility of developers to drive innovation”, says Casper von Koskull, CEO of Nordea.</p>
<p>Nordea’s Open Banking team are now working on extending the services to Denmark and Norway.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to use the Account Information Service (AIS) API where they can retrieve account information details and initiate payments through the Payment Initiation Service (PIS) API. The end users, Nordea customers, will be able to authenticate themselves, and give consent to the third-party providers to access their accounts.</p>

<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – NatWest and G4S are working together to pilot the UK’s first intelligent cash management solution for businesses later this year. This innovative and secure cash solution enables businesses to benefit from automated account crediting of its cash transactions without having to deposit that day’s takings in their local branch.</p>
<p>The intelligent cash solution works like an on-site automated deposit system. When businesses deposit cash into the G4S device, the cash is validated and their accounts are credited daily. The cash is then securely held in the device until the Cash-in-Transit (CiT) provider visits the business. During the pilot, G4S will provide the integrated solution including equipment, software and services to the participating businesses.</p>
<p>Additional benefits of the system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Validation of bank notes and forgery detection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enables consolidated end of day reporting across multiple sites</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash can be held securely on site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduces losses due to administrative errors and fraud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need to “cash up” at the end of the day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alison Rose, CEO of Commercial and Private Banking at NatWest, said: “We’re committed to using technology to find innovative ways to improve efficiency and enhance our customers’ experience. The intelligent cash solution is an efficient, secure and cost effective way for cash reliant businesses to have access to that day’s takings without having to make a daily trip to their local branch, allowing them to spend more time on running their business.”</p>
<p>Jesus Rosano, Divisional CEO G4S Global Cash Solutions, said: “Our innovative cash technology benefits thousands of businesses around the world by managing their daily cash flow and payments more securely and more efficiently. G4S welcomes this partnership with NatWest to bring these benefits to their customers, through the use of G4S technology  and software.</p>
<p>“The payments landscape is changing and cash remains vital because choice of payment is important for consumers and citizens across society. G4S continues to invest in cash technology and to work with customers and payment institutions to improve the efficiency and ease of using cash.”</p>

<p><strong>18<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – SIA, European hi-tech company, leader in payment infrastructures and services, has further strengthened its positioning in the Nordic countries, by providing Danmarks Nationalbank with the new real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) that connects banks, mortgage banks and settlement systems. This RTGS platform is already in operation by the central banks of Norway and Sweden and it will soon go live in Iceland too.</p>
<p>The up-to-date technology infrastructure developed by SIA has replaced the previous in-house system that has been in use by the Central Bank of Denmark since 2001. The new RTGS system, that secures safe and real-time transfer of Danish kroner, ensures continued efficiency, operational reliability, functional sophistication and simpler maintenance of the system.</p>
<p>In this initiative, SIA has used its wholly-owned subsidiary Perago, based in Pretoria (South Africa) and specialized in central bank solutions.</p>
<p>Later this year, Denmark will be the first non-euro country to participate in TARGET2-Securities (T2S), the centralized European platform for the settlement of domestic and cross-border securities transactions.</p>
<p>The system has introduced a new innovative set of functionalities that enables the management of the integration with T2S and of liquidity in an automatic way. Moreover, it has allowed for the seamless integration with the instant payment solution.</p>
<p>“This new significant project with the Central Bank of Denmark, after those developed for Norway, Sweden and Iceland, confirms our leadership in the Nordic region in providing state-of-the-art infrastructures for the payment systems – commented Nicola Cordone, Deputy CEO of SIA – We are honored to have been chosen by 15 central banks across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Oceania that rely on SIA’s technologies to develop their financial infrastructures”.</p>

<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – HSBC announced today that from 30 September 2018, personal and business customers will be able to make real-time fund transfers to their friends, families and business partners using accounts with HSBC or other Faster Payment System (“FPS”) participants in Hong Kong through FPS. Merchants and corporates will also be able to enjoy real-time settlement and streamlined reconciliation by displaying a QR code to accept payments.</p>
<p>FPS is a new, 24/7, year round financial infrastructure in Hong Kong that enables real-time credit transfers and direct debit services to facilitate peer-to-peer and business-to-business fund transfers, as well as customers’ payments to merchants.</p>
<p>Diana Cesar, Chief Executive, Hong Kong, HSBC, said, “The Faster Payment System is a significant financial infrastructure that builds Hong Kong as a world-class smart city with full connectivity. We are committed to delivering simpler, better and faster banking services to our customers. FPS brings convenience and saves time for consumers by enabling payments to be made anytime, anywhere, and contributes to the efficiency of businesses by making real-time settlement possible. This latest digital offering is set to revolutionise the payment ecosystem in Hong Kong, bringing unprecedented convenience and security to our daily fund transfers among friends and family, as well as the day-to-day operations of businesses.”</p>
<p>Starting today, all HSBC Personal Internet Banking, Business Internet Banking and HSBCnet customers can log on to the above HSBC online banking channels or update their mobile banking apps<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> to register FPS. Customers are required to select a designated Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) or Renminbi (RMB) bank account to link with their mobile number, email address or to request a FPS identifier. From 30 September 2018 onwards, internet banking customers can instantly transfer or make payments in HKD and RMB via FPS<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>. It is free of charge<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> for HSBC personal customers to send or receive funds via FPS.</p>
<p>For business customers, HSBC’s new solution, “Business Collect”, enables merchants to accept payments<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup> via FPS with real-time settlement. To make a payment, consumers can simply log onto the HSBC HK Mobile Banking app and scan the merchant’s specific QR code<sup id=""fnref:5""><a href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">5</a></sup>. Once a transaction is completed, a payment confirmation will be sent to the merchant, with the amount settled and reconciled into the merchant’s bank account in real-time.</p>
<p>FPS provides an additional payment channel for merchants across various online and offline, face-to-face and bill payment scenarios. The first batch of pilot merchants to enjoy this new form of payment collection and reconciliation includes companies from different sectors and charitable organisations, such as Anglo Chinese Florist, Compass Group, Gold Joy Travel, GOGOVAN, Jetour Travel, Lalamove, Putien Restaurant, Satay King and Ztore.com.</p>
<p>With the launch of FPS, HSBC is set to enhance the everyday banking experience for personal and business customers.</p>

<p><strong>13<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – Absa, one Africa’s largest diversified financial services group, launches their UK office. Officially trading as Absa Securities UK, the move supports the group’s ambition to bring the world to Africa as the preferred corporate &amp; investment banking partner between UK and European investors looking to do business in the continent’s growing economies.</p>
<p>The launch also represents a key milestone in Absa’s journey to becoming a true, standalone universal African bank following its official separation from Barclays on 30 June. Formerly Barclays Group Africa, the newly independent Absa draws on a 100-year heritage, with offices in 12 countries and has recently announced plans to expand their international presence throughout the major trading corridors into Africa which include North America and Asia.</p>
<p>Opening in the UK is a key pillar of that strategy, and comes at an opportune time as UK and European investors and businesses look to an increasingly stable and prosperous Africa for opportunity in a post-Brexit environment.</p>
<p>Absa’s goal is to help UK businesses expand into, and successfully do, business in Africa. To successfully navigate relatively unfamiliar territory requires a partner with a long-history and established operations across the continent. That partner is Absa.</p>
<p>Absa brings a thorough understanding of investment flows, market participants, sector trends and regulations everywhere it operates. Headed by CJ Giddy, the UK office will give access to that expertise along with services including: liquidity management, cash management, trade &amp; working capital, risk management, card issuing and acquiring and investment banking.</p>
<p>Absa Group CEO, Maria Ramos said: “We have an ambitious growth strategy at the centre of which is the growth of our clients. Having made the strategic commitment to grow in Africa we are also focused on investing in the infrastructure and capacity we need to help our global clients maximize their own growth potential in Africa. Our UK office is an important component of our growth intentions and we are delighted to introduce it to our clients at this time.”</p>
<p>In July, Barclays Africa Group Limited officially started trading under its new name, Absa Group Limited on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Absa already has an impressive global presence across Europe, North America, Asia and Africa offering personal and business banking, corporate and investment banking, wealth management, investment management and insurance services.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – The annual Accuity Financial Counterparty KYC Survey has revealed that 75 percent of senior compliance and correspondent banking professionals have encountered added complexity in interpreting and adhering to local legislation. As global regulators continue to introduce and enforce more stringent compliance standards in efforts to mitigate the risk of financial crime, compliance officers are under pressure to have all relevant due diligence information at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Regulations such as 4AMLD and the FinCEN Final Rule have placed greater emphasis on KYC processes, particularly when it comes to accurately identifying Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO). 69 percent of survey respondents admitted to finding the collection of reliable UBO information challenging, despite moves by several countries to introduce centralised UBO registers.</p>
<p>Additionally, 76 percent of respondents continue to find rising costs and onerous processes a challenge in KYC. The highest priority for 67 percent of respondents is avoiding regulatory fines and enforcement action, yet 81 percent are struggling to adapt to changing global regulation, which has gathered pace in recent years.</p>
<p>Dalbir Sahota, KYC industry specialist at Accuity said: “The rising cost of compliance and changing regulatory requirements are driving financial institutions to constantly evolve their systems, but their operations are not designed for continuous change. The laborious processes involved in KYC continue to present hurdles, which can only be overcome with a more comprehensive systems overhaul.”</p>
<p>77 percent reported that to complete KYC checks, they must undertake manual and repetitive tasks. The recruitment and training of specialist staff also emerged as an issue frustrating the KYC process, with 68 percent of respondents flagging skills shortage as a challenge.</p>
<p>“There are significant efficiency gains yet to be made in this industry, and technology innovation will be key,” Sahota added. “We expect to see financial institutions automate more of their KYC processes as well as looking to new developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to overcome some of these efficiency challenges – so there is cause for optimism.”</p>
<p>Financial institutions have also been struggling to justify the profitability of maintaining higher risk counterparty relationships, due to the increased effort required to conduct due diligence and obtain the necessary documentation. In the survey, 84 percent of respondents confirmed they review high-risk entities in a different way to low risk entities – a figure which has increased from 74 percent in 2014.</p>
<p>“An additional cause for optimism is a slowdown in the de-risking trend we have seen develop over the last few years,” continued Sahota. “This latest survey suggests that although de-risking continues, the pace may be slowing.” In 2014, 58 percent of respondents had over 250 financial counterparties; this reduced to 47 percent in 2016 and 43 percent in 2017. Over the same period, the number of financial institutions with fewer than 250 counterparties has increased.</p>

<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> — Wan Hai Lines, the Taiwan-based carrier with the most comprehensive service network in Asia, has partnered with Bolero International, the trade finance digitisation expert, to execute its first electronic bill of lading (eBL) for a large shipment of polyester filament from Taiwan to China.</p>
<p>Executed using the Bolero ePresentation solution on behalf of Wan Hai’s customer, a Singapore-based subsidiary of a global chemicals and fibres producer, the eBL speeded up release of the cargo, removed requirements for a letter of indemnity and enabled all parties to transact with greater confidence.</p>
<p>The transaction involved two banks and transmission of documentation between Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, facilitating rapid surrender of the cargo for processing in China while avoiding the delays caused by traditional paper bills of lading on shorter routes. The speed and security of Bolero’s solution meant that the time to complete the transaction was significantly reduced from days to hours.</p>
<p>“Executing this multi-national transaction was an important milestone for us,” said Randy Chen, Vice -Chairman, Wan Hai Lines. “It not only decreased the end to end shipment time but also increased the security and confidence level for our customer and their buyer. Bolero is enabling us to achieve our ambition of streamlining multi-national workflows, reducing costs for our customers and providing much-enhanced security. This partnership gives us stronger operational capabilities and reinforces our strategy of continuous growth.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be partnering with Wan Hai Lines,” said Ian Kerr, CEO, Bolero International. “Despite the potential complications of this transaction involving Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China and two banks, the eBL still arrived in time to enable rapid release of the cargo. The Bolero solution out-performs traditional paper processes even for first-time users. For short shipments it is all too easy for delays in the documentation to cause unnecessary costs as goods cannot be released as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“With an unrivalled set of carriers, banks and corporates using our platform we are taking the lead in digitisation in international trade.”</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – In response to  feedback from its most recent industry consultation, the Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB) today announced plans for the creation of a strategic technology roadmap for OTC derivative identifiers.</p>
<p>The DSB is a fully automated generator of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) for OTC derivatives. The DSB is the first numbering agency designed to operate on a global basis to meet the particular requirements of the derivatives markets including near real-time allocation of ISINs.</p>
<p>The newly created Strategy Subcommittee of the DSB Technology Advisory Committee was developed in response to industry feedback, and will take forward the technology-related work of the original ISO standards working group (“SG2”), completed in May 2016 under the co-convenorships of ANNA and ISDA.</p>
<p>As part of the DSB’s ongoing efforts to collaborate with the industry, the Subcommittee will follow an open and inclusive process with a diverse stakeholder base, and will take into consideration other relevant regulatory and industry initiatives that the DSB should aim to be consistent with. Further details of the Strategy Subcommittee’s purpose are available in its Charter <a href=""https://www.anna-dsb.com/download/technology-advisory-sub-committee-charter/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>“The DSB looks forward to creating a robust technology roadmap to service the industry’s evolving needs around OTC derivatives identifiers,” said Marc Honegger, TAC Sponsor and board member of the DSB. “Having successfully enabled OTC derivative users to meet their MiFID II reporting requirements in 2018, we now look forward to working with industry in 2019 to develop the DSB strategic technology roadmap.”</p>
<p>Membership of the TAC Subcommittee will be announced on 11 October 2018, with the first meeting held on 8 November. In the interest of transparency, records of the TAC Strategy Subcommittee will be made available to the public on the DSB's website.</p>
<p>“The DSB’s best-in-class technology is already proven within the European regulatory environment,” said Sassan Danesh, member of the DSB management team and the Designated DSB Officer of the TAC. “We are delighted to extend the benefits of this state-of-the-art technology to additional use cases by addressing the wider recommendations of the ISO SG2 Study Group.”</p>
<p>The kick-off meeting agenda, the full list of TAC Strategy Subcommittee participants, and records of meetings will be available at the <a href=""https://www.anna-dsb.com/technology-advisory-committee/"" target=""_blank"">DSB website</a>.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>6<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – Payment Service Providers and billers are today (Thursday 6 September 2018) being invited to register to play their part in developing ‘Request to Pay’ – a new way to improve the control, flexibility and transparency of bill payments.</p>
<p>The Request to Pay portal – <a href=""http://www.requesttopay.co.uk"" target=""_blank"">www.requesttopay.co.uk</a> – has been launched by the New Payment System Operator (NPSO), the UK’s leading retail payment authority, which has responsibility to develop best in class payment infrastructure and standards for the benefit of everybody.</p>
<p>The NPSO is responsible for setting the standards and rules in retail payments and the Request to Pay service is an innovation which will be ready for the market to competitively launch from next year. It is expected to be a secure messaging service for payments – almost akin to email - overlaid on top of existing infrastructure. For each ‘request’, customers will be able to pay in full, pay in part, ask for more time, communicate with the biller, or decline the payment – giving more control to the person being asked to pay. Payers can expect to have a choice of payment methods, or be able to automatically trigger a payment as part of their acceptance of a request.</p>
<p>Potential participants are being invited to review the draft specifications and provide feedback using an API sandbox for the ‘message repositories’ which will play a role in storing, sending and receiving messages, and the ‘end-user applications’ which will make it possible for consumers and businesses to communicate with repositories. Using API (‘application programming interface’) technology as a secure way of sharing data, the proposition is for the Request to Pay service to be underpinned by a single central directory, which will enable registration of participants and identification of the services they provide.</p>
<p>All potential participants’ initial feedback will be used to help inform the draft technical specifications, which are currently provided for illustrative purposes. Two further iterations of documentation are planned to be published on the portal during 2018, as the specifications are further refined. The final versions will be published in early 2019, to enable interested participants to prepare their own competitive launches from spring 2019 onwards.</p>
<p>Paul Horlock, CEO of the New Payment System Operator, said: “We expect Request to Pay to support individuals with their financial decision-making, create a better channel for direct dialogue between payers and billers, and help more people and businesses avoid the cliff edges that can be created by an irregular income, or an unexpected or unpaid bill.</p>
<p>“By setting the standards and rules needed to make Request to Pay work, the NPSO will act as a market catalyst, encouraging developers to spot innovative new uses for Request to Pay which could benefit a wide range of sectors – from utilities to financial services, government, charities and beyond.”</p>
<p>The development of the Request to Pay service is one of the end user deliverables being overseen by the NPSO as part of its role in creating a New Payments Architecture (NPA). Any stakeholders that are interested in finding out more about the NPA, and how Request to Pay fits with the wider project, should visit the NPSO website: <a href=""http://www.newpso.uk/npa-programme"" target=""_blank"">newpso.uk/npa-programme</a></p>

<p><strong>10<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> — 80% of treasurers believe they have the majority of skills required to meet the challenges of treasury’s technological transition, but survey responses suggest they are underestimating the importance of crucial technologies, such as APIs and robotic process automation</p>
<p>The Economist Intelligence Unit’s report “The Future is Now: How ready is treasury?” written on behalf of Deutsche Bank, launches today. Based on a survey of 300 senior corporate treasury executives from around the world, it offers a comprehensive insight into how they are approaching emerging technology and regulation. The results suggest that, while treasurers are confident they are prepared for the inevitable adjustments over the coming months and years, their current perception of the importance of certain technologies – and what it will take to effectively implement and extract the most value from them – may be wrongly calibrated.</p>
<p>The survey indicates that 80% of treasurers believe that they have at least the majority of skills required to meet the challenges of treasury’s technological transition. Yet, when asked to identify the top two technologies they believe will bring the most benefit to their department respondents appeared to underestimate the value of two fundamental technologies.</p>
<p>Robotic process automation, which stands to simplify and accelerate routine treasury procedures, and application programming interfaces (APIs) – IT functions that are crucial for pooling and sharing information across different company and bank systems – were seen as being the least important technologies by respondents. Only 8% and 13% of treasurers respectively cited them as being the most beneficial for their organisation moving forward. This may indicate a lack of awareness of both the scale of these looming changes, as well as the impact they stand to have.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely still a need for investment in developing the next-generation treasury,” says Michael Spiegel, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Cash Management.</p>
<p>“And while confidence is definitely positive, it needs to be founded on a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing technological changes in the market.”</p>
<p>With 55% of treasurers reporting a change in their companies’ operating model as a result of disruption, it is clear that technology is already challenging traditional treasury operations. Making the most of these changes will begin with a thorough understanding of the necessary shifts in treasury structure, staffing and strategy.</p>
<p>Crucially, treasurers must accept the need to evolve – and not simply as a reactive measure. Collaboration with suppliers and banks is necessary from an early stage to ensure that new technologies are adopted seamlessly and efficiently, while bringing in digital expertise is also critical.</p>
<p>“Much of this boils down to treasurers bedding into their new role of contributing more directly to company strategy,” says Spiegel. “The right investments will certainly buy them the time to think more strategically, but, in the short term, they must lead the charge when it comes to persuading senior management of the need for, and direction of, strategic digital upgrades.</p>
<p>“Treasurers don’t need to be on the cutting edge of technology,” he assures, “but they do need to be proactive and aware of what is coming. This is a big part of why we sponsored the survey: we want to understand how we can best serve our clients as their treasuries start to transition. The whole industry is changing – and by maintaining a close dialogue with our clients, Deutsche Bank is able to offer meaningful and valuable support throughout this exciting technological transformation.”</p>

<h3>What is the regulation?</h3>
<h5>REGULATION (EU) 2017/1131 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL OF 14 JUNE 2017 ON MONEY MARKET FUNDS</h5>
<p>This regulation sets out rules for money market funds (MMFs) established, managed or marketed in the European Union. It lays out provisions regarding the financial instruments eligible for investment by a MMF, the portfolio of an MMF, the valuation of the assets of an MMF, and the reporting requirements in relation to an MMF.</p>
<p>This regulation applies to collective investment undertakings that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>require authorisation as UCITS or are authorised as UCITS under Directive 2009/65/EC or are AIFs under Directive 2011/61/EU;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>invest in short-term assets; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have distinct or cumulative objectives offering returns in line with money market rates or preserving the value of the investment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Scope and intent</h3>
<p>All money market funds established, managed and or/marketed in the EU. The regulation intends to provide investors with a wider degree of choice for investing their short-term cash, providing for two types of MMFs: Short-term MMFs and Standard MMFs.</p>
<p>In addition, three structural options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Public Debt Constant NAV (CNAV) MMFs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low Volatility NAV (LVNAV) MMFs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable NAV (VNAV) MMFs</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Timeline:</h3>
<h5>15 June 2016</h5>
<p>EU ambassadors agree Council’s negotiating position</p>
<h5>17 June 2016</h5>
<p>Council conﬁrms its negotiating position on money market funds</p>
<h5>7 Dec 2016</h5>
<p>Council agreement with the European Parliament conﬁrmed</p>
<h5>16 May 2017</h5>
<p>Council adopts the regulation on money market funds</p>
<h5>3 Sep 2018</h5>
<p>Aviva Investors Liquidity Funds fully compliant ahead of the deadline</p>
<h5>21 Jan 2019</h5>
<p>Deadline for all fund managers to make the necessary changes</p>

<h3>Why is the regulation changing?</h3>
<p>Events that occurred during the financial crisis led to proposals from the European Commission intended to make money market funds more resilient. The regulation changes at European level were considered necessary to help provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Equal operating conditions for European money market funds across member states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equal protection of investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provisions to ensure funds’ liquidity and stability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“We believe the proposals limit contagion channels and render the financial system safer by working to forestall future asset runs.”</p>
<p><cite>Caroline Hedges, Global Head of Liquidity Portfolio Management</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What is changing?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Investment policies of money market funds</h5>
<p>Introduces conditions on the money market funds’ portfolio structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Categories of funds</h5>
<p>Most funds are currently Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) or Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) – in the future state CNAV will only exist for 100% Government debt funds. Most funds will convert to the newly formed Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) category. VNAV will still exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity</h5>
<p>LVNAV MMF’s will need to hold at least 10% of assets maturing within one day, and 30% of assets maturing within a week to be able to meet sudden redemption requests and/or adverse market conditions. Up to 17.5% of assets held in sovereigns, supranationals or agencies can count towards the weekly limit. VNAV MMF’s will need to hold at least 7.5% of assets maturing within one day, and 15% of assets maturing within a week to be able to meet sudden redemption requests and/or adverse market conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Diversification</h5>
<p>There will be a 5% limit per issuer, max 10%per deposit counterparty, max 15% limit on reverse repurchase agreements per counterparty, max 17.5% investment in other MMFs limited to 5% per fund. Max 15 % overall exposure to securitisation and ABCPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Review Rules</h5>
<p>After five years, the European Commission will provide a report on the functioning of the regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Transparenc</h5>
<p> There will be rules on transparency in advertising MMF’s to investors and requirements on reporting to competent authorities.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key changes for the new LVNAV fund category</h3>
<p>For implementation by 21st January 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Min. 10% daily liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Min. 30% weekly liquidity (17.5% of this can be held in highly liquid assets from sovereigns, supranationals or agencies with &lt;190 days to maturity).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If weekly liquidity falls below 30%, or daily net redemptions exceed 10%, the fund’s board must meet and consider imposing fees or gates (suspend or limit redemptions for up to 15 days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity fees “reflect the cost to the MMF of achieving liquidity and ensure that investors who remain in the fund are not unfairly disadvantaged”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If weekly liquidity drops below 10%, liquidity fees and/or total redemption suspensions become mandatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If redemptions are suspended for more than 15 days over 90 consecutive days, the fund must float its share price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amortised cost accounting for sub 75 day assets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(previously 60 days) with gap to mark-to-market limited to 10bp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max. 15% exposure per repo counterparty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max. 15 % overall exposure to securitisation or ABCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sponsors are prohibited from providing financial assistance to prop up the share price, guarantee principal or otherwise support a fund.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The loan is to be used in accordance with the Group’s 2018 Green Loan Framework which has earned the Green Finance of Pre-Issuance Stage Certificate issued by the Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency (“HKQAA”) on 13<sup>thth</sup> August 2018.

This demonstrates that private companies committed to sustainable developments can also meet the stringent requirements set under the HKQAA Green Finance Certification Scheme, which had only accredited blue-chip listed companies in the past.”</p>
<p>“Over the past two decades, the Group has focused on energy efficiency management, carbon and emissions reduction, solid waste and waste water management, green buildings, resources utilisation and recycling of natural resources. We have invested over HKD150m on green projects in the past six years and succeeded in saving 25.68m kWh of electricity consumption and reduced carbon emissions by 13,540 tonnes. With the full support from our close business partners and the injection of this HKD350m Green Loan, we are geared for greener achievements in the near future.”</p>
<p>“Leo’s Green Loan programme has been completed in just 40 days which has set an industry record!” said Mr. King Lai, the Group CFO. “We are grateful to all professional parties involved, including the HKQAA team, seven participating leading banks and our internal dedicated team. Through the best efforts from all of us, we finally turned this mission from impossible to possible within a limited timeframe. We are proud to be the pioneer among privately-held companies to obtain the Green Finance Certificate. Green is the ultimate goal and we hope more and more industrial players will join us in the same path.”</p>
<p>Proceeds of the Green Loan are to be used to finance 20 green projects of the Group in China in coming few years. These include investments in plants and facilities used by the printing industry that aim at raising energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions and waste, as well as projects that promote green construction.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> September 2018</strong> – <a href=""https://www.nexmarkets.com/"" target=""_blank"">NEX Markets</a>, a NEX business which provides electronic trading technology services in the fixed income and foreign exchange (FX) markets, announces today that it has released a new report demonstrating greater transparency and improved behaviour in the FX market since the Global FX Code (the “Code”) came into effect in May 2017.</p>
<p>In the report titled <a href=""http://www.ebs.com/"" target=""_blank"">‘The FX Global Code: changing transparency and behaviour’</a>, NEX Markets has witnessed a significant reduction in hold times, reject rates and a tightening of spreads on the bilateral EBS Direct platform. This suggests an industry-wide move for greater transparency and improved market behaviour.</p>
<p>Of the top 10 liquidity providers (LPs) on EBS Direct, average hold times have reduced 61% from 93 milliseconds 18 months ago compared with 37 milliseconds today. Driven by Principle 17 of the Code, this fall in hold times indicates that fewer FX counterparties are now using the much debated ‘Last Look’ method to execute trades. In turn, this reduces the possibility of exploitation, contributing to improved counterparty relationships and a healthier market ecology.</p>
<p>Similarly, over the same period reject rates across the top 10 LPs have fallen 41%, from an average of 5.3% to 3.15%, as more trades are now being executed on the price originally quoted. As well as an increase in market liquidity, this suggests that the Code has acted as a catalyst for more efficient trading.</p>
<p>Bolstered by advanced data insights such as <a href=""https://www.nexmarkets.com/products-and-services/data-and-analytics/nex-quant-analytics"" target=""_blank"">NEX Quant Analytics</a>, these findings show that best practices outlined in the Code are being implemented, and suggest that the wind of behavioural change has begun within the FX industry.</p>
<p>Seth Johnson, CEO of NEX Markets, said: “The symmetry between a reduction in hold times and reject rates over the past 18 months demonstrates that the Code is creating a greater openness and a sea change in behaviour for the better. With increased attestation to the principles, combined with the proliferation of data and analytics in the industry, we expect to see a continued improvement in execution quality, better behaviour and greater market transparency.”</p>
<p>Yet despite over 500 institutions committing to the Code since it came into effect, there are still thousands of smaller and midsized participants in the FX wholesale market yet to sign up.</p>
<p>Tim Cartledge, Global Head of FX and Head of Product, NEX Markets, said: “It is critical that all market participants get behind the Code. Central banks have played a crucial role in promoting and ensuring its adoption; now it’s time for liquidity consumers to follow suit. If the FX industry does not take this opportunity, it is highly likely that we will end up with regulations which will be lengthy and expensive to implement. Only with full adherence can we create a fairer and healthier FX trading environment for all.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – New Deutsche Bank white paper argues that the technology and market infrastructure for creating a real-time treasury are now widely available.</p>
<p>The vision of a real-time treasury – incorporating not just instant payments, but real-time liquidity management, FX management and cash-flow forecasting – is rapidly approaching reality, according to Deutsche Bank’s white paper “The road to real-time treasury”. The paper takes in the views of a number of treasurers through case studies, interviews and surveys, and explores how the ongoing shift to real-time treasury is well under way, with the fundamental technologies for functions such as real-time FX conversion and hedging and real-time cash-flow forecasting already in place.</p>
<p>“Many treasurers see real-time treasury as a long-term vision – nice for the future-gazers, but with no short-term, practical implications,” says Shahrokh Moinian, Head of Cash Products at Deutsche Bank. “This is far from the truth. There are tangible steps that treasurers can take now to start building their real-time treasury capabilities – whether it’s integrating instant FX conversions and even instant hedges, or establishing instant cash concentration through solutions such as virtual accounts. These solutions can all add value today.”</p>
<p>According to Euromoney’s “Treasury Non-Stop: Excitement builds for real-time” survey, commissioned by Deutsche Bank, there is a groundswell of demand for real-time treasury capabilities – with almost 85% of respondents stating that they would value the ability to move cash around the clock and in real time. Just under 87% believe that 24/7 instant payments will have a positive impact on liquidity planning, forecasting and placement.</p>
<p>“For us, it’s a question of letting the market know that most of the technology needed to power real-time treasury is already available,” says Paul Cuddihy, Director, Cross Product Solutions, at Deutsche Bank. “Real-time payments and Open Banking are already being combined to remarkable effect – enabling solutions such as “push” payments, which can reduce transaction fees and eliminate traditional settlement periods of two to three days incurred by merchant acquirers.”</p>
<p>“The goal is within reach,” concludes Moinian. “Industry bodies have laid the foundations with instant payments schemes and Open Banking regulations, while SWIFT’s recent global payments innovation (gpi) for corporates pilot serves as a readymade real-time treasury solution – enabling businesses not only to initiate and track cross-border payments to and from multiple banks in a single format, but also to integrate these flows into their ERPs and TMSs.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s been noticed or not, the industry has assembled the pieces for businesses to begin constructing their own real-time treasuries. For treasurers, it’s a question of reaching out to their partner banks and working in tandem to piece the jigsaw together.”</p>
<p>Contributors include Shahrokh Moinian, Head of Cash Products at Deutsche Bank, Carola Schmitz-Becker, Vice President, Corporate Treasury, Deutsche Post, Boris Jendruschewitz, Vice President, Corporate Finance, Otto Group, and Paul Cuddihy, Director Cross Product Solutions at Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p><strong>31<sup>st</sup> August 2018</strong> – BELLIN has opened a new office in Karlsruhe, further cementing its claim as a leader in corporate banking and treasury technology.</p>
<p>Karlsruhe has steadily developed into an international high-tech hotspot and is regarded as one of the centers of excellence in Germany’s <a href=""https://bellin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ea00d0ced0091d603af29d8cf&amp;id=63cfab4772&amp;e=a4b2279679"" target=""_blank"">Digital Hub Initiative</a>. As the first occupants of its new premises at Killisfeldstrasse 30 in the city’s Durlach district, BELLIN has had the offices specially designed for its team as a creative working environment, development center and meeting hub. The new office was officially opened on August 31.</p>
<p>The Karlsruhe site will focus on driving technical development of new BELLIN products and services. Thanks to its convenient location, the office will also serve as an international meeting hub. Additionally, BELLIN will be able to cultivate existing relationships with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and surrounding IT companies. “Karlsruhe offers unique access to a large pool of promising young talent from the local university. The area is also rich with very experienced developers already working at high-tech companies,” explains Jean Pierre Wenzel, Head of Development at BELLIN. “Karlsruhe is quickly emerging as a ‘German Silicon Valley’ and our ability to set up shop alongside high-tech companies and start-ups and the close proximity to research activities is a vision we are ecstatic to pursue.”</p>
<p>The decision to open another office, in Karlsruhe around 60 miles from the headquarters in Ettenheim, was made by CTO Dr. Wolfgang Kalthoff. “The fintech industry is under a lot of pressure to innovate. Combined with our own expansion drive, this situation requires us to hire additional highly-qualified developers,” explains <a href=""https://bellin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ea00d0ced0091d603af29d8cf&amp;id=f9e48c77af&amp;e=a4b2279679"" target=""_blank"">Kalthoff</a>, who has been responsible for development at BELLIN as CTO since October 2017 and has extensive experience in managing decentralized teams. Global software development works extremely well at BELLIN, as demonstrated by the many years of successful collaboration with the Vancouver office, which opened in 2004.</p>
<p>The offices in Karlsruhe cover the entire fourth floor – an area of almost 5,000 square feet – and offer 25 ultra-modern workstations. The new team currently boasts ten staff and has an international flavor, with employees hailing from Germany, France, Russia and Iran.

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has agreed to renew the prohibition of the marketing, distribution or sale of binary options to retail clients, in effect since 2<sup>nd</sup> July, from 2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018 for a further three-month period. ESMA has also agreed on the exclusion of a limited number of products from the scope of the measure.</p>
<p>ESMA has carefully considered the need to extend the intervention measure currently in effect. ESMA considers that a significant investor protection concern related to the offer of binary options to retail clients continues to exist. It has therefore agreed to renew the prohibition from 2<sup>nd</sup> October.</p>
<p>During its review of the intervention measure, ESMA considered the specific features of binary options currently within the scope of the measures. Certain binary options were found to have specific features which mitigate the risk of investor detriment, namely; they are sufficiently long-term (at least 90 days); are accompanied by a prospectus; and are fully hedged by the provider or another entity within the same group as the provider. ESMA considers that a binary option that benefits from the cumulative effect of these three criteria is less likely to lead to a significant investor protection concern.</p>
<p>In addition, products that at the end of the term have one of two predetermined pay-outs, neither of which is less than the initial investment of the client, will be excluded. The pay-out for this type of binary option could be the higher or lower one but in either circumstances the investor would not lose money compared to their total investment. As the investor’s capital is not at risk these products should be explicitly excluded.</p>
<p>Hence, ESMA agreed to exclude from the scope of the renewal the following binary options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A binary option for which the lower of the two predetermined fixed amounts is at least equal to the total payment made by a retail client for the binary option, including any commissions, transaction fees and other related costs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a binary option that meets cumulatively the following three (3) conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the term from issuance to maturity is at least ninety (90) calendar days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a prospectus drawn up and approved in accordance with the Prospectus Directive (2003/71/EC) is available to the public; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the binary option does not expose the provider to market risk throughout the term of the binary option and the provider or any of its group entities do not make a profit or loss from the binary option, other than previously disclosed commissions, transaction fees or other related charges.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ESMA will continue to keep these products under review during the prohibition period. The renewal was agreed by ESMA’s Board of Supervisors on 22<sup>nd</sup> August 2018.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>ESMA intends to adopt the renewal measure in the official languages of the EU in the coming weeks, following which ESMA will publish an official notice on its website. The measure will then be published in the Official Journal of the EU and will start to apply from 2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018 for a period of three months.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – A variety of indicators suggest the world trade boom is over and point to downside risks for our trade forecasts. We present two new synthetic indicators that suggest world trade growth is currently running at a little below 3% y/y but could slow to around 1% y/y by year end. One possible positive is that survey-based indicators are generally holding up better than ‘harder’ data.</p>
<p>Amongst the most negative signals are those coming from freight-based indicators and especially slumping German overseas industrial orders. These indicators also have relatively high historic correlations with actual world trade. Two new indicators we look at this time – copper prices and Maersk share prices – also show negative trends and have had leading indicator properties in the recent past.</p>
<p>PMI-style export surveys from the main exporting economies look more optimistic. But even they point to world trade growth slipping to around 3% y/y by year-end, compared to our existing forecasts for next year which are closer to 4% growth.</p>
<p>World trade growth has supported the global economy over the last two years but has been slowing in recent months. This Research Briefing surveys the latest evidence from our favoured indicators – and some new ones – and introduces a pair of new synthetic world trade indicators. The signals from the new indicators are downbeat, suggesting the risk of a sharp slowdown in trade growth into year-end.</p>
<p>Our new coincident trade indicator shows world trade growth running at around 3% y/y. This is well below the 6% y/y rate seen in 2017 and early 2018. The leading indicator, meanwhile, suggests world trade growth could drop to as low as 1% by end-2018. This implies downside risks to our baseline forecasts which see 4% growth in 2019.</p>
<p>Our two new indicators are based on six variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PMI-type export surveys: our long-standing Oxford Economics world export indicator, based on such surveys for the US, UK, France, German, Korea and China, forms one of the variables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air freight data from IATA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RWI/ISL world container freight index</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>German foreign manufacturing orders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>World copper prices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The share price of container firm Maersk, which handles around a fifth of world container trade</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For each variable, we have run regressions to determine what pace of world trade growth they are associated with and these estimates feed into our new indicators (full calculation details are in the box below). Currently, all the variables point to world trade growth slowing in the months ahead, albeit to varying degrees.</p>
<p>The most negative readings come from the air and sea freight and German orders variables. All these currently suggest world trade growth of 2-2.5% y/y. But the IATA variable suggests growth slowing to 2% by year-end, the RWI/ISL variable points to trade growth near zero and German orders imply world trade declining by over 5%. Importantly, the RWI/ISL and German orders variables also have relatively strong historical correlations with world trade (around 90% and 77% respectively).</p>
<p>Negative trends are also visible in our two new indicators, copper and Maersk share prices (down 9% and 27% y/y respectively). Both point to world trade growth below 1% by year-end. These have the advantage of being available at very high frequency and were decent steers for the world trade slowdowns in 2015-16, 2011-12 and 2007-08. False steers from these variables in the past have been largely to the upside.</p>
<p>One source of optimism is that survey-based measures are holding up better. Our export survey-based indicator suggests world trade growth is currently running at a reasonable 4% annual pace. But even this indicator suggests a slowdown to around 3% y/y trade growth by Q4. It is also possible that some of our other variables will pick up in the coming months, improving the picture. On the whole though, looking across all indicators, it appears the world trade boom is over.</p>

<h3>Calculation of the new indicators</h3>
<p>We regressed the monthly growth of world trade volume (from the Netherlands CPB) on the y/y growth rates of the IATA air freight, RWI/ISL container freight, copper, Maersk share price and German foreign manufacturing orders variables and on the level of the export survey-based variable. The coefficients from these regressions allow us to associate a given value of each variable with a pace of world trade growth. The coincident and leading indicators are then assembled as the simple averages of the estimated paces of world trade growth associated with each variable at a given point in time, smoothed by taking three-month averages.</p>
<p>Our regressions also suggested that the export survey indicator, copper prices and Maersk share prices lead world trade growth by 3-4 months while the RWI/ISL index, IATA data and German orders data are broadly coincident with it.</p>
<p>As a result, the new coincident indicator is based on the simple average of the world trade growth rates associated with the current values of the RWI/ISL, IATA and German orders variables and the world trade growth rates associated with three-month ago values of the Maersk, copper and export survey variables. The leading indicator is based on the 6-month annualised trade growth rates of the RWI/ISL, IATA and German orders variables and the current values of the Maersk, copper and export survey variables.</p>

<p><strong>29<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – Standard Chartered announced today a collaboration with Siemens Financial Services, the financing arm of Siemens, and TradeIX, a digital trade provider, to carry out an industry-first client pilot to create an end-to-end blockchain-based smart guarantees proposition in trade finance. With a view to transform the traditionally paper intensive Bank Guarantees business, this is the first blockchain client pilot that fully digitises the process, from initiation of the bank guarantee to the claim handling.</p>
<p>Motasim Iqbal, Head, Transaction Banking UAE, Standard Chartered, said, “This is an industry-defining solution which we believe will transform the way guarantees are issued and processed in the UAE. Siemens Financial Services has been a key partner for us to build and develop this pilot on the distributed ledger and we believe that this technology can further be harnessed by the Dubai Smart City initiative.”</p>
<p>Unlike a letter of credit which involves multiple parties, performance details and over 100 pages of documents, a commercial bank guarantee is a much simpler instrument to digitise. This solution will enable Siemens to digitise its guarantee process for customers with large transaction volumes in the future, spanning issuance, amendments and claims, eliminating the multiple touch-points and inefficiencies which are inherent in the paper intensive process today.</p>
<p>Michael Bueker, Chief Financial Officer, Siemens LLC said, “While digitalisation is revolutionising whole industries, incorporating digital trade finance solution into our daily operations is an important step. Especially at Siemens, as a digitalisation pioneer, this move is part of our strategic mission of going digital in all arenas. This will streamline our processes and make our trade finance operations smoother, faster and more efficient. We are delighted to partner with Standard Chartered in leading such game-changing transformation which will help our customers go digital in their guarantee and claim processes and achieve higher efficiency.”</p>
<p>The pilot started in March 2018 and will be fully completed later this year. The proposition is based on auto-executing smart contracts, leveraging the Corda Distributed Ledger and application layer provided by TradeIX.</p>
<p>Rob Barnes, TradeIX said, “We believe that global trade is at the cusp of multi-level digital transformation which will revolutionise the entire business and operating model. As the platform provider, we are excited to be involved with Standard Chartered and Siemens Financial Services to help script this journey and bring the power of the distributed ledger to solve the challenges facing today’s trade ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Samuel Mathew, Global Head, Trade Products, Standard Chartered, said, “The future of trade is going to be all about data. To this end, we are excited to be the first in the industry to co-create this solution with Siemens Financial Services and explore innovative ways on how we can digitise trade and leverage real-time data to deliver efficiency gains and transform the way trade finance is conducted. Technology is core to Standard Chartered’s strategy and we remain fully committed to delivering the next generation of best-in-class trade products to facilitate trade flows for our clients across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.”</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> August 2018</strong> – Deutsche Bank today announced that it has acquired an equity stake in US-based ModoPayments, LLC (Modo), an industry leader in digital payments innovation.</p>
<p>In line with Deutsche Bank’s strategy to grow its transaction banking franchise, Modo’s technology will help the bank expand its existing digital business-to-business and business-to-consumer payments business. In particular, Deutsche Bank will be able to extend payments into non-bank payment platforms such as Alipay, Paypal, M-Pesa and WeChat beyond traditional banking channels, e.g. payment transactions to mobile wallets and peer-to-peer networks.</p>
<p>“Payments are the bloodline of banking. More and more global payments are executed electronically via Fintech and online platforms,” said John Gibbons, Head of Global Transaction Banking at Deutsche Bank. “Our investment and partnership with Modo will help us to provide our corporate and institutional clients with new digital payment functionalities and accordingly more flexibility in facilitating these transactions. Going forward, we will be able to directly process payments to mobile wallets and app-based payment solutions.”</p>
<p>“Modo’s technology will allow us to provide new transaction services and payment alternatives for the rapidly growing digital economy, for example, vendors who provide products or services like entertainment content or application development and want to be paid in their mobile wallets, an important area of growth,” adds Michael Spiegel, Global Head of Deutsche Bank’s Cash Management.</p>
<p>“The Modo team is focused on doing the most good for the most people by reducing friction in payments. That is why we do what we do every day, and this partnership with Deutsche Bank is a great opportunity to work with one of the world’s largest payment providers that can implement our technology on a global scale and further our reason for being,” said Bruce Parker, founder and CEO at Modo. “We’re excited to see where this relationship can take us and how we can continue creating interoperability between payment systems around the world.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – A growing number of UK exporters expect their ability to compete in international markets to improve over the next year, according to the latest Business in Britain report from Lloyds Bank.</p>
<p>More than half (54 per cent) expect their ability to compete in international markets to improve in the next 12 months, four points higher than six months ago.</p>
<p>Almost half of exporters (47 per cent) said they had seen their overseas sales grow over the last six months, compared with just 21 per cent who said they had fallen, with sales to the EU, the USA and China rising by 35 per cent, 32 per cent and 35 per cent respectively during that time.</p>
<p>And despite facing continued uncertainty, almost half (47 per cent) said they expected their overseas sales to increase over the next six months, compared with just 20 per cent who expected international sales to fall.</p>
<p>The good news comes as the latest data from ONS revealed the value of British exports hit a record £621 billion in the 12 months to June 2018, with service exports rising 2.2 per cent to an all-time high of £278 billion and exports of goods climbing 6.3 per cent to £343 billion.</p>
<p>However, more than 22 per cent of respondents have stated that they have not reviewed their trading plans two years after the Brexit referendum. If this is the case across all UK exports this means that potentially as many as 50,000 exporters may not have considered nor factored any changes they may need to make to their trading strategies post March 2019.</p>
<p>Clive Higglesden, head of trade and supply chain product, at Lloyds Bank, said: “We have to recognise that the Brexit negotiations can affect how businesses are feeling and this can change but it’s heartening to see UK exporters demonstrate confidence towards their trade prospects, especially in light of continued domestic and international uncertainty.</p>
<p>“However, while the ongoing negotiations around the UK’s departure from the EU and its potential impact are an important point on most businesses’ agendas, it’s maybe a cause for concern that up to 50,000 exporters may not have reviewed their own strategy since the referendum two years ago.</p>
<p>“It may be difficult to plan whilst there is uncertainty over the nature of the UK’s departure, but there is little doubt that businesses will face some degree of change in the months and years ahead. All exporters should be taking proactive measures in the interim to prepare for that.”</p>
<p>The Business in Britain report, now in its 26th year, gathers the views of more than 1,500 UK companies, predominantly small to medium-sized businesses, on a range of issues facing them.</p>
<h3 id=""top-uk-export-markets"">Top UK export markets</h3>
<p>Although nearly one in four (23 per cent) British exporters expect the biggest opportunities for international trade to be with the USA, this figure has fallen from 30 per cent at the end of 2017.</p>
<p>Similarly, 13 per cent expect the biggest opportunities to come from China, down two points from 15 per cent six months ago, while eight per cent cited Germany, down from nine per cent.</p>
<p>The fall in firms identifying these markets was caused by a significant increase in respondents to Lloyds Bank’s survey saying they ‘did not know,’ suggesting that firms are struggling to plan ahead amid such uncertainty.</p>
<p>Some 18 per cent of exporters said they ‘did not know’ where they saw their biggest overseas opportunities now, compared with six per cent six months ago.</p>
<h3 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h3>
<p>Firms state the biggest barrier to exporting is exchange rate uncertainty, which was cited by 42 per cent, the same proportion as six months ago.</p>
<p>Tariffs and quotas were cited by 35 per cent, compared with 29 per cent six months ago, while difficulty finding potential customers was mentioned by 32 per cent, up from 26 per cent.</p>
<p>Although the majority of exporters hold a positive outlook, 26 per cent expect their ability to compete in international markets to deteriorate over the next year.</p>
<p>One in five (21 per cent) said their overseas sales had dropped in the last six months, while almost as many (20 per cent) said they expected their exports to drop over the next half year.</p>
<h3 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>With negotiations ongoing between UK and EU diplomats over the future relationship between Britain and Europe, exporters most want to see the UK prioritise free trade agreements with USA (24 per cent), China (12 per cent) and the EU (11 per cent) followed by Germany (seven per cent) during discussions.</p>
<p>Clive added: “Exporting for the first time can feel daunting, particularity when the global political and economic landscape is going through a significant period of flux.</p>
<p>“But with the falling value of the pound continuing to make our goods more attractive overseas, I’m certain there are lucrative opportunities out there for firms ambitious enough to pursue them.</p>
<p>“Our International Trade Portal<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> can also help both current and prospective exporters understand the best market for their products or services, the trading requirements and conditions they face and the buyers they may wish to work with.”</p>

<p><strong>15<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – New information, out today, means customers can more clearly see how their bank compares on quality of service, following CMA and FCA action.</p>
<p>From today (15 August 2018), banks must publish information on how likely people would be to recommend their bank – as well as its online and mobile banking, branch and overdraft services – to friends, relatives or other businesses.</p>
<p>The results come from an independent survey of thousands of <a href=""https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gfk.com%2Fpersonal-banking-service-quality&amp;data=02%7C01%7Clucy.knowles%40cma.gov.uk%7Cd08485312d7e45fdf18708d601f0a859%7C1948f2d40bc24c5e8c34caac9d736834%7C1%7C0%7C636698530473127621&amp;sdata=Nv4mhWLQsAqgzu0TmiTTLv6lW9VOrR2xTm0mCTYmE5E%3D&amp;reserved=0"" target=""_blank"">personal</a> and <a href=""https://www.bdrc-group.com/"" target=""_blank"">small business</a> customers, and must be prominently displayed in banks’ branches, as well as on their websites and apps. This will make it easier for people to find out if another bank has a better offer and has been introduced to drive up competition between banks, so leading to a better overall quality of service for those who use them.</p>
<p>The new measure is one of a number being required by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) following its in-depth investigation of the sector. The CMA also requested the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) build on this by making banks release further information on their performance and services to drive up standards, and make it easier for people to judge whether they are with the best bank for them.</p>
<p>Adam Land, Senior Director at the CMA, said: “For the first time, people will now be able to easily compare banks on the quality of the service they provide, and so judge if they’re getting the most for their money or could do better elsewhere.</p>
<p>“This is one of the many measures – including Open Banking and overdraft text alerts – that we put in place to make banks work harder for their customers and help people shop around to find the best deals for them.”</p>
<p>Banks will now be required by the FCA to publish details of available services and relevant helplines. In addition, the banks will also have to provide information about the number of major operational and security incidents they have experienced, and provide updates on their websites.</p>
<p>From February 2019, the FCA will expect that banks publish figures on how long it takes to open current accounts and replace debit cards.</p>
<p>Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said: “Getting a good deal isn’t just about pricing. It’s also important for customers – including individuals and small businesses – to be able to judge the quality of service around their current account and to see whether other providers could offer something that suits them better. This information should encourage providers to offer the services that people value.”</p>

<p><strong>13<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – Tight integration between banking, treasury and risk will help the bank streamline its business and deliver enhanced customer service.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> today announced that National Bank of Egypt (UK) Limited is deploying Fusion Treasury and Fusion Risk. The treasury and risk solutions will be tightly integrated with the bank’s existing Fusion Equation core banking system – helping the bank to deliver a more comprehensive and superior service.</p>
<p>“Banks recognize that clients today want more joined-up finance, risk, payment and working capital services and expect fast, transparent, 24/7 access to these services,” said James Pinnington, Head of Capital Markets &amp; Investment Management, Northern Europe, Finastra. “A joined-up approach that fully integrates the treasury, risk management and regulatory functions at the heart of the bank’s operations is essential. We are helping the bank make this a reality so that it can service its customers in the very best way.”</p>
<p>The integration between Fusion Treasury and Fusion Risk was a key factor in the bank’s decision to partner with Finastra. Together, the solutions facilitate accurate, real-time data management – providing a holistic view of risk across the bank and helping to promote dynamic decision making based on seamless management of trading, risk, liquidity, and profitability data. In addition, increased automation and the removal of manual processes will help the bank reduce operational risk and deliver streamlined regulatory reporting.</p>
<p>“Finastra has a tightly integrated, best-in-suite product range that’s ideally suited to supporting our treasury and risk management operations,” said Yasser Ibrahim, CEO and Managing Director at National Bank of Egypt (UK) Limited. “It was important that we could deploy a solution that integrates easily with our existing core banking system, that is cost-effective, and also scalable to grow with our needs in the future. During the vendor selection process, Finastra was able to demonstrate all these capabilities and the collaboration between Finastra and our in-house team is very strong. This will be essential as we roll out the new functionality across the bank over coming months.”</p>

By leveraging Citi’s global network and leadership in Commercial Cards, this alliance offers Cvent users and Citi clients a simplified payment path to quickly and easily settle any Meetings &amp; Events (M&amp;E;) expense – with a Citi payment product – all without ever leaving the Cvent event management platform.</p>
<p>Through this global alliance, Cvent’s event management software will also integrate with Citi’s Virtual Card Account functionality to allow joint clients the ability to request a Citi Virtual Card Number for payment directly through Cvent’s platform. When meetings-related expenses can be made from the same tool where the expense is sourced, budgeted, and invoiced, the end-to-end meetings payment process will be more accurate, ultimately resulting in less time and labor spent consolidating M&amp;E; expenses.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to join forces with a global provider that is equally committed to delivering a best-in-class solution for their customers,” said Gonca Latif-Schmitt, Global Head of Citi® Commercial Cards. “We believe this integration between Citi and Cvent will make the payments process more efficient for our clients and, will facilitate the use of our Citi Meeting Card and Virtual Card Accounts as the payment of choice for all Meetings and Events spend.”</p>
<p>The Cvent and Citi integration was recognized with a 2018 Treasury Today Adam Smith Award. The awards highlight achievement in corporate treasury and are well-known across the industry.</p>
<p>“By joining our technologies together, we are able to provide both Cvent and Citi customers a more streamlined approach to online payments,” said Patrick Smith, Chief Marketing Officer at Cvent. “This alliance enables organizations to manage all of their meetings and events activities, from planning to payment, in one place. Earning the Adam Smith award reinforces the strength of our combined solution and validates our mission to work with enterprises as true strategic business partners.”</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> August 2018</strong> – UK businesses could be losing out on over £25bn in potential sales by not offering a range of consumer finance options, according to new research.</p>
<p>The findings were published in a report by specialist lending platform, <a href=""https://www.duologi.com/"" target=""_blank"">Duologi</a>, which looked at the current state of the consumer credit market and attitudes towards point-of-sale (POS) finance across a number of sectors. POS finance allows merchants – from retailers to health providers and travel companies – to offer their customers a loan to purchase a product or service.</p>
<p>The study, “Finding the right balance: the future of credit” revealed that more than three-quarters (78%) of consumers would consider purchasing through POS finance in the future – around 39m UK adults.</p>
<p>Of these, the average amount that each would be willing to borrow is £620, representing a potential £25bn sales opportunity for merchants that implement this type of payment into their business model.</p>
<p>Consumer spending behaviour is also likely to favour merchants that offer POS finance options – helping to boost sales and reputation in a number of key ways.</p>
<p>Over a third (34%) of people said they would be more likely to spend with a business that offers POS finance options. With fierce competition throughout every sector as the UK economy fluctuates in confidence, this potential to boost traffic (both online and in-store) could be critical to a brand’s survival.</p>
<p>Customers also stated that POS finance options would be a key factor in deciding where to shop; 20% of people said that if a company didn’t offer flexible finance options, they would be more likely to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Moreover, finance options can help to boost brand loyalty, with more than a quarter (28%) of people saying they would be more likely to return to a merchant that allowed them to borrow funds in this way.</p>
<p>A further 26% of people would be likely to spend more than originally planned if they found they could access a good amount of credit from a merchant.</p>
<p>Duologi co-CEO, Gary Little, commented: “Consumers are now more willing and able to borrow funds than ever before and as such, are demanding increasingly competitive credit options from lenders. There is clearly an enormous opportunity available for UK businesses to drastically boost bottom lines; one which many may not even realise they are missing out on.</p>
<p>“Fintech businesses are driving a transformation in the market. Whereas previous incarnations of consumer finance offerings may have been plagued by lengthy application processes or slow procedures, new platforms – built on powerful technology – are making this kind of transaction just as simple as paying on credit card, but with the flexibility to repay the cost in a way that suits customers’ needs.”</p>
<p>Duologi is led by co-CEOs, John Taylor and Gary Little, who between them count more than 50 years’ consumer lending experience at institutions such as Barclays and Close Brothers. Backed by global investment firm, Oaktree Capital, the company offers merchants the chance to increase their sales, boost customer satisfaction and grow profitability through the delivery of tailored point-of-sale finance options.</p>

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> August 2018</strong> – On the heels of its market-changing acquisition of Sydney-based Visual Risk, treasury and <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/Xxs0SGQ0s000Vc5f1005U60"" target=""_blank"">risk management</a> solution provider <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/K0015UQ00sc50FxfS05s0V0"" target=""_blank"">GTreasury</a> has added US-based risk expert, Peter Seward to its team of <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/c05001SU0ssQ05xVH0f7c00"" target=""_blank"">corporate treasury</a> specialists, globally. Seward will serve the market as GTreasury’s Vice President of Market Development, Risk, working with prospective corporate treasury clients in understanding how to apply technology to better manage risk and its impact on cash.</p>
<p>“Peter is a rare find,” says GTreasury Chief Executive Officer Orazio Pater. “The combination of his deep knowledge and experience in bringing innovative SaaS solutions to corporate treasury’s most complex problems is great news for <a href=""http://info.gtreasury.com/c05001SU0ssQ05xVI0f8c00"" target=""_blank"">our customers</a> and for the market at large. He will continue to translate the needs of the market across GTreasury’s innovation teams to help companies on their path to a more strategic treasury.”</p>
<p>For 10 years Seward led the product strategy at Reval, where he worked with Big 4 consultants and corporate treasurers to bring many technology firsts to market. Among these innovations were modules for new accounting standards, such as the accounting standard update to ASC 815 for hedge accounting, ASC 820 for fair value disclosure and IFRS 9, and an advanced module for Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR).</p>
<p>Seward’s technology expertise reaches far across the spectrum, from mobile applications to facial recognition for payments approval. As an early SaaS pioneer and advocate in treasury, Seward has shared his expertise as an author and speaker in the industry. Prior to Reval, Seward was a Sales Engineer at Principia Partners and a Senior Consultant for Integrity Treasury Solutions.</p>
<p>“I’m excited to be working with GTreasury – the best kept secret in the industry,” Seward says. “Its SaaS is built on the modern Microsoft Azure platform, which enables companies to grow globally without disruption and leverage the analytical power of managing cash and risk together. With its emphasis on service, its rich heritage in cash management and payments, and its ongoing integration of Visual Risk’s intuitive and visual risk management and hedge accounting capabilities, GTreasury’s SaaS solution is a win for corporate treasurers, globally.”</p>
<p>GTreasury acquired Visual Risk in April 2018 to bring an integrated treasury and risk management solution to corporate treasurers across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific.

<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> August 2018</strong> – Trade finance profits around the world are squeezed by costs of operations, fraud prevention, and especially compliance.</p>
<p>Although trade finance is part of a bank’s core business, the high number of players in the market reduces the added value, and competition is based on price. Aite Group’s newest report, How Banks Are Improving Trade Finance Operations, identifies a typical bank’s back-office trade operations cost structure and assesses what strategies major international banks are adopting to reduce operational cost elements.</p>
<p>“Digitization is not always possible, because financial institutions are limited by bilateral agreements with other banks to get digital data,” explains Enrico Camerinelli, senior analyst at Aite Group. “If paper is received, it must be processed. Counterparts need to collaborate actively to make progress toward full digital data exchange,” he adds.</p>
<p>This new Aite Group report investigates how much relationship managers are overburdened by administrative duties and how much time they could save to focus, instead, on value-added activities. For this report, Aite Group collected data from informal conversations between March and May 2018 with international bank trade finance executives.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> August 2018</strong> – Barclays has today announced that it is partnering with leading fintech business MarketInvoice, Europe’s largest online invoice financing platform, in a deal that is set to transform the way small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the UK manage cash flow and accelerate growth.</p>
<p>The bank has committed to a significant minority stake in the firm to give Barclays’ SME clients seamless access to innovative forms of finance. The new partnership is a key part of Barclays’ plans to invest in new business models for growth, and MarketInvoice’s ambition to broaden its reach across the UK.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, MarketInvoice has funded invoices worth more than £2.7bn, boosting cash flow for thousands of UK businesses. Barclays is the first high street bank to enter into a strategic partnership with MarketInvoice, giving their customer base access to the fintech’s proprietary single invoice finance product as well as broader digital invoice finance facilities.</p>
<p>The terms of an invoice normally dictate a long payment period that can be up to 120 days, leaving businesses with a cash flow gap in the interim. With invoice financing, SMEs who sell goods or services to other businesses can upload or sync their invoices to MarketInvoice’s platform and sell them to investors, unlocking fast access to funding.</p>
<p>The proposition will be introduced to Barclays’ SME clients over the coming months in areas across the UK, including the East Midlands, West Midlands, Herts and North West London, with a full roll-out set to commence nationwide in 2019. Barclays also plans to fund invoices via the platform in the future, growing its asset base further.</p>
<p>Anil Stocker, MarketInvoice CEO, said: “It’s exciting to be combining the knowledge and footprint of a 325-year old British banking institution with MarketInvoice’s tech-led online finance solutions. Bringing this together in a strategic partnership can only mean good news for UK businesses, with the segment we’re targeting responsible for upwards of 60% of UK employment.</p>
<p>“Barclays has a long history of innovation being the first bank to introduce the credit card and the ATM. It makes total sense to partner and introduce our online business finance solutions for their large customer base.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to forget that the companies you see on the FTSE 100 all started as small businesses with founders following a passion. In focusing on the needs of these entrepreneurs through this collaboration, Barclays and MarketInvoice will truly transform the experience of UK companies in sourcing finance.”</p>
<p>Ian Rand, CEO of Barclays Business Bank, said: “Invoice finance is a product that has come of age in the digital era, it’s efficient, effective and controllable for small businesses.</p>
<p>“A number of our clients told us that they feel pressured into offering longer payment terms in order to stay competitive. This ties up their cash flow, preventing them from seizing growth opportunities.</p>
<p>“Invoice financing gives small businesses the power to obtain funding in a fast and innovative way, and capitalise on those moments. Our corporate bank already offers invoice financing to large businesses, so it’s great news that we’re able to extend the proposition to work for our SME clients as well.”</p>
<p>Barclays also recently launched £100,000 unsecured lending for SMEs, doubling its maximum for unsecured business loans from £50,000 to £100,000.</p>
<p>This increase adds to Barclays’ already class-leading unsecured lending offering which allows qualifying SME clients to access pre-assessed affordable lending up to £25,000 on the go via their mobile and through online banking, often receiving the cash that same day.</p>

<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> August 2018</strong> – The Cheque and Credit Clearing Company (C&amp;CCC;), which supports the paper clearing system for cheques and credits as well as the Image Clearing System, has appointed Alan McDonald as its first General Manager.</p>
<p>Alan previously held the roles of Managing Director and Director of Planning, Finance and Risk within the C&amp;CCC.; He has been with the organisation since April 2017. Immediately prior to that he worked in interim finance leadership positions with Tesco Bank and Clydesdale Yorkshire Banking Group delivering operational and efficiency improvement.</p>
<p>Alan’s appointment follows recent industry-wide changes as operational responsibility for the C&amp;CCC; transferred to the New Payment System Operator (NPSO) earlier this month. This was part of a planned consolidation of the UK’s three retail payment schemes that has seen Bacs Payment Schemes Limited, Faster Payments Scheme Limited, the Cheque &amp; Credit Clearing Company Limited and UK Payments Administration Limited become wholly-owned subsidiaries of the NPSO. The NPSO is the organisation that maintains and develops the payment systems and standards which are the lifeblood of the UK economy, and works in the public interest to ensure that these systems are safe, open, innovative and resilient.</p>
<p>Alan McDonald, General Manager of the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, said:</p>
<p>“I am delighted to take on this new role as part of the NPSO at such an exciting time for the cheque and for the payments industry as a whole. The cheque continues to be a vital payment method for older people, small businesses and many charities and, with the introduction of cheque imaging, the future of the cheque has been secured for many years to come.”</p>
<p>Last year, 405m cheques were written in the UK showing that the cheque is still a valued payment method in particular situations and for certain groups of people. In addition, the introduction of the Image Clearing System in the UK – which allows cheques to be processed electronically and significantly speeds up the time it takes for them to clear – has brought the cheque firmly into the 21st century. The new system was launched as a phased roll-out on 30<sup>th</sup> October 2017. As banks and building societies connect their various deposit channels into this new clearing infrastructure, it enables them to exchange images of cheques electronically for clearing and payment, significantly speeding up the clearing process.</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – HSBC Global Asset Management has launched a US Treasury Money Market Fund, the HSBC GLF US Treasury Fund, in response to demand from investors for a broader range of cash investment solutions. The fund is a new sub-fund of HSBC Global Liquidity Funds plc, an Ireland-domiciled fund company with US$40 billion of short-term money market fund strategies. The new fund will meet the new European regulations for Public Debt Money Market Funds as they are introduced, and will continue to operate with a Constant Net Asset Value.</p>
<p>The fund, which has been assigned a AAAm and AAA-mf rating from S&amp;P; and Moody’s respectively, aims to provide investors with security of capital and daily liquidity together with an investment return which is comparable to short-dated US Dollar denominated US Treasury returns. The fund seeks to achieve this through investing in a mix of short-term debt including: Treasury bills, bonds, and repurchase agreements.</p>
<p>Hugo Parry-Wingfield, EMEA Head of Liquidity Product, HSBC Global Asset Management, commented: “This new fund is aimed at investors who want exposure to US Treasuries but with the added advantage of same-day liquidity. HSBC Global Asset Management has over 25 years experience in managing money market assets, and we run over US$10 billion in similar strategies in the US. This new international fund will be managed under our globally consistent proprietary investment and liquidity management process, complementing a conservative investment objective.”</p>
<p>“Many US Dollar investors require exposure to US Treasuries as a lower risk alternative to other money market instruments, and this fund provides investors with a pooled solution while offering the potential for attractive money market yields.”</p>
<p>HSBC Global Asset Management is one of the world’s largest money market fund managers and currently has US$64.4 billion in liquidity assets under management across 10 currencies (as at July 2018).</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – As UK banks continue to report their interim results, the forecast remains positive for banking giants Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group. While the outlook is rosy, traditional lenders still face fierce competition from digital challenger banks, with 61 percent of smartphone owners opting to bank solely online.<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup></p>
<p>RBS is expected to outperform analyst predictions<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> and Lloyds’ strong financial performance is forecasted to continue<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup>. Although confidence is high, traditional institutions remain under pressure to maintain market share in the increasingly digital climate. To do so, many are focusing on securing their long-term future by improving customer-centricity, regardless of the short-term impact on profit.<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Many traditional banks are looking for novel ways to raise the standard of their customer services, with features such as chatbots and roboadvisors, says Bhupender Singh, CEO of <a href=""https://www.intelenetglobal.com/travel-logistics-hospitality.html"" target=""_blank"">Intelenet® Global Services</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh comments: “Despite 42 percent of people moving to alternative service providers for personal banking needs, over half are choosing to stick with their traditional bank, making these institutions a force to be reckoned with.<sup id=""fnref:5""><a href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">5</a></sup></p>
<p>“But this does not mean that traditional lenders should become complacent – in the age of the customer, it is crucial that banks can provide advice and support that is truly in the customers’ best interest. One way that banks are streamlining the customer experience, is by using chatbots and AI technology to carry out customer interactions.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh continues: “For instance, voice recognition software can be paired with customer records and predictive tools to identify a specific customer and confirm which department they require before sending them there directly, without the customer having to explain their problem multiple times. This dramatically improves the customer experience and, for one bank, has reduced the average handling time by 40 percent.</p>
<p>“But while technology is a key part of the solution, it is important to remember that it is simply that – a part of the puzzle. A human touch is still essential to solve many of the financial issues that people face. Much of the best automation and AI technologies in the banking sector takes away the burden of repetitive tasks for staff, allowing them to focus their efforts on quality in-person service.”</p>

<p><strong>26<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – BELLIN, a global leader in corporate banking and treasury technology, has appointed André Scheffknecht to its management team.</p>
<p>Scheffknecht joined the company as Chief Sales Officer (CSO) in June, assuming responsibility for BELLIN Group’s international sales activities. His appointment signals BELLIN’s intent to vigorously pursue expansion in international markets, particularly in North America and Asia.</p>
<p>The new face on the management board brings more than 18 years’ experience in international sales and marketing to the post. With his global network of contacts, he will ramp up worldwide sales of BELLIN solutions and play an active part in partner management. Recently, Scheffknecht successfully turned around the fortunes of several ailing international technology companies and sold them on. He began his career with an IT security company, where he developed sales structures in the EMEA, APAC and North America regions.</p>
<p>Scheffknecht’s approach fits perfectly with BELLIN's philosophy of putting people first. “BELLIN maintains close contact with its clients. We will now further leverage and expand our knowledge of their needs and the solutions which are effective – in combination with developing efficient sales structures – on a global basis,” explains André Scheffknecht. “I am absolutely convinced that sales is about people and a relationship between them. And this is exactly the attitude in evidence at BELLIN,” remarks Scheffknecht, explaining his motivation for joining BELLIN in Ettenheim.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>30<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – CLS, a market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing, and data solutions, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a collaboration on a proof of concept (PoC) for LedgerConnect − a distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform for the financial services industry designed to enable banks, buy and sell side firms, FinTechs and software vendors to deploy, share and consume services hosted on a shared distributed ledger network.</p>
<p>On LedgerConnect financial institutions will be able to access services in areas such as, but not limited to, know your customer processes, sanctions screening, collateral management, derivatives post-trade processing and reconciliation and market data. By hosting these services on a single, enterprise-grade network, organizations can focus on business objectives rather than application development, enabling them to realize operational efficiencies and cost savings across asset classes.</p>
<p>Nine financial institutions, including Barclays and Citi, are participating in the PoC and have selected services from a number of vendors including Baton Systems, Calypso, Copp Clark, IBM, MPhasis, OpenRisk, SynSwap and Persistent Systems to participate in the PoC.</p>
<p>As financial institutions increasingly work to implement DLT into their operations, capital markets remain saturated with multiple systems performing the same business functions and with siloed pockets of data that require expensive reconciliation processes. DLT can help reduce these inefficiencies and improve the speed of doing business by providing a single, shared version of events and one implementation of common business functions.</p>
<p>However, it can be cost prohibitive and time-consuming for each vendor, bank, or consortium to create and operate its own unique DLT infrastructure for multiple services when proven technology already exists. LedgerConnect aims to solve this problem by providing a single shared and highly secured network on which multiple services can be deployed and consumed. This allows financial institutions to focus on transforming business processes rather than creating multiple new blockchain applications, networks and services in silos that could lead to increased interoperability costs and complexity.</p>
<p>Operating on a private permissioned network based on the IBM Blockchain Platform and Hyperledger Fabric technology, LedgerConnect will be designed for regulated and security-conscious enterprises and available across asset classes. Support for additional ledger technologies may be provided in the future, based on market demand and developments.</p>
<p>Commenting on LedgerConnect, Alan Marquard, Chief Strategy and Development Officer, CLS said, ""LedgerConnect is part of CLS's strategy to explore how we can provide safe and robust solutions that create efficiencies and reduce risk for a diverse range of firms operating in the financial markets. We expect LedgerConnect to deliver enhanced efficiencies and economies of scale over single-purpose distributed ledger networks.""</p>
<p>“Together IBM and CLS have been early pioneers in advancing blockchain solutions for the financial services space,” said Marie Wieck, general manager, IBM Blockchain. “Building on the success of CLSNet and leveraging the strong relationship CLS has with the world’s leading financial institutions, LedgerConnect is uniquely positioned as a blockchain marketplace for the financial services industry, which will accelerate innovation across the ecosystem with value added services for blockchain networks.”</p>
<p>On completion of a successful PoC, generation of market demand, and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, CLS and IBM plan to make the platform widely available to the industry.</p>

<p><strong>31<sup>st</sup> July 2018</strong> – Betway, the online gambling company, is working with Accuity, the leading global provider of risk and compliance, payments and know your customer solutions, to optimise its financial crime compliance screening capability at a time when gambling firms are under pressure to balance regulatory demands with maintaining a seamless customer experience.</p>
<p>The UK Money Laundering Regulations 2018 and the Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) are pushing many gambling firms to take greater responsibility for understanding who their customers are and whether it is safe or ethical to do business with them. For many, this has meant a significant shift in culture as well as a move to implement additional compliance processes, which can be costly and time consuming.</p>
<p>Having implemented Firco Compliance Link, an Accuity solution for screening customer accounts and transactions against regulatory watch lists in 2016, Betway is now upgrading the technology to include the Automated Screening Manager (ASM), providing the compliance team with fast, consolidated intelligence on positive matches. The enhanced solution will enable Betway to provide an efficient service to its growing community, whilst continuing to adhere to the increasingly stringent compliance obligations placed on financial services firms and designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs).</p>
<p>Nick Wilson, EMEA Director, Accuity, said: “We believe Betway is ahead of the curve, having made the shift several years ago to recruit compliance talent from the banking sector and implement a robust financial crime compliance screening programme. The business is proactively looking ahead to the next challenge, which is to optimise its operational procedures, increase efficiency and ensure a seamless customer experience.”</p>
<p>With most gambling activity being cash heavy and non-face-to-face, it is vital that screening is not a one off activity. By implementing Firco Compliance Link – ASM, Betway will be able to continuously screen its customer base against caution lists from major sanctioning bodies and law enforcement agencies worldwide, and receive automated alerts when a potential red flag is identified. Hits and non-hits alike will be stored, providing a full audit trail of all data entered, rather than just those where positive matches are made. Betway will benefit from reduced overall processing times and manual intervention, improving the customer experience through faster on-boarding whilst also operating at a high standard of financial crime compliance.</p>
<p>Anthony Werkman, CEO, Betway Group, said: “At Betway we are dedicated to rooting out money laundering activity and developing our defences against financial crime. Firco Compliance Link – ASM enables us to continuously monitor our client base, reduce false positives and demonstrate a full audit trail to regulators. The system gives me confidence that our business is equipped to operate safely and ethically, and most importantly, that our clients are protected.”</p>

<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – OCBC Bank has appointed Mr Melvyn Low, 51, Head of Global Transaction Banking, to its management committee effective 18 May 2018. Mr Low joined the bank in February 2018 as Head, Global Transaction Banking.</p>
<p>Mr Low brings with him more than 25 years of banking experience across sales and product management, transaction services, cash management, trade and securities and fund services.</p>
<p>18 of those years were spent at Citibank N.A. where Mr Low’s last role was as the Head of ASEAN and Singapore, Treasury and Trade Solutions, covering the financial institution’s transaction services business in eight countries.</p>
<p>One of the key highlights during his stint in the American bank was the launch of Citi’s Innovation Lab in Singapore – the bank’s first in Asia – for transaction services in 2012, for which he played an instrumental role.</p>
<p>Mr Low has channelled this expertise into building Singapore’s e-payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>He has been a director of the Singapore Clearing House Association since 2010 and was a key member of the committee behind the 2014 launch of FAST (Fast and Secured Transfers), an electronic funds transfer platform that allows customers to transfer SGD funds almost immediately between accounts of 20 participating banks in Singapore.</p>
<p>FAST is the foundation for electronic funds transfer service PayNow – an integral part of Singapore’s latest push toward a cashless society.</p>
<p>Being a career transaction banker, Mr Low is passionate about developing young talent and moulding the next generation of leaders in this field.</p>
<p>He engaged the National University of Singapore Business School to develop the world’s first full-credit course on transaction banking for undergraduates in 2012. This course goes beyond theory, providing students with practical insights and exposure to the industry.</p>
<p>For his contributions, Mr Low was named ""Transaction Banker of the Year for ASEAN"" by The Asset magazine in 2015.</p>
<p>In the same year, he was conferred the title of IBF Distinguished Fellow which recognises industry captains who have demonstrated outstanding leadership capabilities, professionalism, and who have contributed significantly to the industry.</p>
<p>Mr Low holds a Master of Business Administration from the University of British Columbia, Canada.</p>
<p>Said Mr. Samuel Tsien, Group CEO, OCBC Bank, “Melvyn brings with him a wealth of experience in transaction banking and innovation, and a solid track record of growing new capabilities and businesses across the region. In the past few months since joining us, Melvyn has assimilated well into the OCBC culture. He is also a valuable member of the Management Committee.</p>
<p>“Transaction banking plays a pivotal role in OCBC’s strategy. Increasing trade flows through Asia, coupled with a rising interest rate environment, present huge opportunities for trade finance and cash management. We therefore look forward to the fresh ideas and initiatives that Melvyn will bring to the team, entrenching our position as a dominant, digitally-driven transaction banking franchise in Asia.”</p>
<p>Said Mr Low, “Almost 30 years ago, I landed my first banking job – an internship at OCBC’s then technology department – so this is a homecoming for me. It is especially meaningful to be returning as a senior leader at a time that can be considered a watershed moment in banking, as the industry becomes increasingly intertwined with technology. I look forward to continuing my work with the management team and my colleagues as we chart new paths forward for the bank.”</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> July 2018</strong> – Houlihan Lokey, the global investment bank, today announced the formation of HL Finance, LLC (“HL Finance”) to arrange senior secured leveraged loans for financial sponsor-backed, privately-held, and public corporate entities.</p>
<p>HL Finance will act as arranger on syndicated loan transactions and has entered into an agreement with HPS Investment Partners, as the initial strategic investor, to participate in the transactions and provide underwriting commitments of up to $1 billion.</p>
<p>Houlihan Lokey, through this platform, will participate in both committed and best efforts transactions across a broad range of financings, including leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, dividend recapitalizations, and refinancings, primarily for borrowers with EBITDA and capital needs in excess of $50 million and $250 million, respectively.</p>
<p>“The creation of a syndicated leveraged finance platform leverages our core advisory capabilities and relationships and combines them with the credit underwriting and portfolio management strengths of market-leading asset managers. Importantly, this initiative is driven by significant client demand and is consistent with our advisory business model,” said Scott Beiser, CEO of Houlihan Lokey.</p>
<p>Syndicated leveraged finance is highly complementary with and will operate as part of Houlihan Lokey’s Capital Markets Group, led by Global Co-Heads Chris Dunlop, Anthony Martino, and Gregg Newman. In anticipation of launching this initiative, the Group has added significant senior talent over the past year, including Matthew Lyness and Ed Ribaudo. Mr. Lyness and Mr. Ribaudo were both formerly Managing Directors with GE Antares in New York, serving as client team leaders with structuring and syndication responsibilities, respectively.</p>
<p>The Capital Markets Group, which consists of 35 professionals based in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, London, Madrid, Milan, and Sydney, through its private capital solutions and capital markets advisory offerings, raised more than $12.5 billion across approximately 40 transactions during Houlihan Lokey’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about the continued growth of our Capital Markets Group and believe this new capability, combined with our deep expertise across industry sectors, substantially increases the opportunity to support our clients’ needs,” said Scott Adelson, Co-President and Co-Head of Corporate Finance.</p>

<p><strong>23<sup>rd</sup> July 2018</strong> – Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a leader in Global Commercial Card solutions, today announced that it has launched a mobile application for cardholders of prepaid cards. The app launch demonstrates the bank’s commitment to making the lives of our clients and their cardholders easier by bringing new, digital capabilities to corporate and government clients and to their customers or beneficiaries.</p>
<p>“Prepaid card programs can deliver considerable benefits to companies and government agencies of all sizes. In replacing checks, prepaid cards can help organizations simplify compliance, eliminate manual work, lower expenses, and reduce risks,” said Hubert J.P. Jolly, head of financing and channels for Global Transaction Services at BofA Merrill. “With the mobile app, we’re excited to bring a new level of convenience and transparency to our clients’ prepaid cardholders.”</p>
<p>The app is designed for cardholders who receive a reloadable prepaid card from an employer, government agency or entity with whom they do business. The key features of the mobile app include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Viewing balances:</h5>
<p>Cardholders can check their balances while on the go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Viewing transactions:</h5>
<p>Users have instant access to pending and posted transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Finding an ATM:</h5>
<p>Users can access an interactive map that makes it easy to find a nearby ATM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Suspending or reactivating cards:</h5>
<p>Cardholders can use the app to place a lock on their card in the event that it is lost or stolen. They can also use it to unlock their card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Managing and receiving alerts:</h5>
<p>Users can set up email and text alerts to be notified when card balances are low, when deposits are received, and when their personal information changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Biometrics:</h5>
<p>For biometric-enabled devices, users can take advantage of touch or facial recognition to authenticate their device, replacing the need to input a password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“While cardholders can already access their account information either online or via customer service phone number, the mobile app makes it even easier for them to manage their financial transactions, which they can now do regardless of their physical location,” added Jolly.</p>
<p>The BofA Merrill Prepaid mobile app is free and available to download from the Apple iTunes® and Google Play™ stores.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – SWIFT, along with a number of corporates and banks, today announces plans to start testing an enhanced multibank standard to further improve the cross-border payments experience for multi-banked corporates. This enhanced standard, designed and built in conjunction with 10 multinational corporates and 12 leading banks, streamlines the process for corporate treasurers by allowing them to initiate and track gpi payments to and from multiple banks in a single format and integrate gpi flows in ERP and Treasury Management Systems.</p>
<p>The first-of-its kind, this cross-industry collaboration tailors SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi) for multibanked corporates, by introducing a common solution delivered in the same way by all gpi banks. This new standard will enable application providers and banks to give corporates better visibility and transparency, improving payments certainty, traceability, exception handling and allowing them to reconcile directly in their treasury operations. Pilot participants are to begin a test phase ahead of bringing this flow into production in the next few months.</p>
<p>Corporates and banks participating in the pilot include Airbus, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Booking.com, Borealis, Citi, Deutsche Bank, General Electric, IATA, Intesa Sanpaolo, J.P. Morgan, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Microsoft, National Australia Bank, Ping An Group, Roche, RTL Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Société Générale, Standard Chartered Bank and UniCredit. Together with the pilot participants SWIFT has invited leading treasury application providers to integrate the gpi flows into their own systems in order to deliver a fully embedded gpi experience in corporate treasury systems.</p>
<p>Lisa Wagner, Group Treasury Manager at Microsoft said “The ability to access a greater level of payment information in a timely manner through SWIFT gpi will bring immediate benefits to our payments experience with greater transparency and responsiveness to our vendors. Providing multi-bank information all in one place and in the same format fits into our modern finance roadmap.”</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to participate in the SWIFT gpi for Corporates pilot,” says Martin Schlageter, Head of Treasury Operations at Roche. “There are many challenges to tackle with cross-border payments but SWIFT gpi, combined with the broader SWIFT for Corporates programme, will bring considerable benefits to improving the transparency and visibility of our cross-border payments.”</p>
<p>The standard design has been developed through a series of SWIFT-led co-creation workshops with pilot banks and corporates. It supports FIN &amp; ISO 20022 standards to allow corporates to access their payments status across SWIFT and bank proprietary channels.</p>
<p>“Corporates want to track payments in real time and get confirmation of credit to the beneficiary’s account,” says Marc Delbaere, Global Head of Corporates at SWIFT. “This new multi-bank capability will enable that experience in a consistent fashion, across multiple banks and multiple corporates. Having this information instantly in the corporate treasury space is what corporate customers are asking for.”</p>
<p>Launched in early 2017, gpi already has over 180 banks signed up, and accounts for nearly 30% of SWIFT crossborder payment traffic. More than 100 billion USD in SWIFT gpi messages is sent every day, enabling payments to be credited to end beneficiaries within minutes – many within seconds.</p>
<p>To date, 35 million gpi payments have been sent across 450 country corridors, in more than 100 currencies. In major corridors, such as USA-China, gpi already accounts for nearly 50% of payment traffic.</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – The European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT) has today launched a register for corporates adhering to the FX Global Code (Code). Since its drafting phases, the EACT has supported the Code, which is a set of global principles of good practice in the foreign exchange market published in May 2017.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Code is to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent market for all market participants. The Code provides a common set of principles to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale foreign exchange market. The Code covers areas such as ethical behavior, governance, execution, information sharing, risk management and confirmation and settlement processes. Adherence to the Code applies in a proportionate manner to different types of market participants, depending on the type of participant and the complexity of their operations and their engagement with the FX market.</p>
<p>The EACT’s register is intended for corporate treasury departments that are participating in FX markets as end-users. The EACT register is included in the Global Index of Public Registers.</p>
<p>EACT Chair Jean-Marc Servat, said: The FX Global Code is a very positive initiative aiming at ensuring fair and transparent FX markets that benefit all participants, including corporate end-users. We believe that a widespread adherence to the Code and its principles can truly help improve the functioning of FX markets and prevent some of the dysfunctions of the past. We therefore encourage corporate treasury departments to familiarise themselves with the Code’s principles and to adhere to it, as well as to prompt their banking partners to adhere to the Code. The EACT welcomes corporations to post their Statements of Commitment on its register to demonstrate their adherence and support to good practices in the FX market.</p>
<p>The EACT FX Global Code Register is <a href=""https://eact.eu/fx-global-code"" target=""_blank"">available here</a>.</p>
<p>More information on the Code can be <a href=""https://www.globalfxc.org/fx_global_code.htm"" target=""_blank"">found here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>17<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – NatWest has today announced that it has joined Marco Polo, the trade finance platform that uses blockchain technology to dramatically reduce the costs, risks and time involved in businesses trading with each other. The initiative is coordinated by the financial technology firm TradeIX and R3 to collaboratively apply emerging blockchain technology to the global trade finance market.</p>
<p>NatWest is the latest bank member to join Marco Polo, a trade finance initiative that has become the largest network of commercial banks in the trade finance market. Banks, including BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, ING, Standard Chartered Bank, Natixis, Bangkok Bank, SMBC, DNB and OP Financial Group are working with technology companies R3 and TradeIX in an effort to make trade finance smarter, more transparent and better connected.</p>
<p>Rowan Austin, Head of Trade &amp; Working Capital Product at NatWest said: “We are really excited to be joining the Marco Polo network and making an important step forward that will help reduce much of the time, expense and uncertainty in conducting international trade. We want to leverage distributed ledger technology for our clients and the best way to achieve this is through global collaboration with other financial institutions and leading technology providers.”</p>
<p>The founding mandate from bank members of Marco Polo is to better serve trade customers’ needs by converging the physical, information and financial supply chains with digital trade data to enable easier access to credit, minimise risk and increase transparency through a global digital platform.</p>
<p>“The momentum around Marco Polo continues to build. We’re delighted to see NatWest join the growing network of financial institutions working together with R3 and TradeIX to bring much needed transparency and efficiency to trade finance.” said David E. Rutter, CEO of R3.</p>
<p>Marco Polo is focusing on a state-of-the-art trade finance platform for global working capital needs that helps minimise the risks of making and receiving payments The Platform is powered by R3’s Corda blockchain technology and open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) purpose-built for the global trade ecosystem. It allows banks to offer participants and to easily integrate into trade orchestrations bringing in ERP, procure to pay, logistics, payment, insurance data, real-time into the transactions.</p>
<p>“Today, corporate clients expect highly-connected platforms that can accelerate corporate growth by improving working capital with an asset-agnostic trade finance engine that supports the entire asset lifecycle and access to broader funding providers,” said Daniel Cotti, CFO and Bank Partner Relationships at TradeIX. “We are very excited to have NatWest part of Marco Polo of forward-looking leaders who are building the trade finance network of the future today.”</p>

<p><strong>12<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions has entered into a strategic partnership with HighRadius Corporation, a software company specializing in cloud-based integrated receivables to launch Citi® Smart Match.</p>
<p>Leveraging HighRadius’ proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology along with its own proprietary assets, Citi will dramatically increase the efficiency and automation of the cash application process of matching open invoices to payments received for its corporate clients. This partnership follows a strategic investment made by Citi Ventures in HighRadius earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with HighRadius demonstrates our continued engagement with fintechs and the commitment to being the best for our clients. By joining forces with fintechs like HighRadius, we can rapidly advance the use of new-age technologies across our global footprint and develop solutions such as Citi® Smart Match, to provide tangible value to our clients’ business”, said Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions.</p>
<p>Citi® Smart Match can help clients enhance straight-through-reconciliation rates by bringing together disparate pieces of payment data and applying AI and ML enabled business logic to match payments received with expected receipts in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>Corporations often experience delays in applying cash due to the difficulty in obtaining the remittance information required to reconcile invoices. Cash application can also be hindered by inconsistent payer behavior and payment mechanisms used. Many clients facing these challenges are seeking innovative solutions to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automate manually intensive processes thereby reducing costs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decrease days-sales-outstanding (DSO), optimizing working capital; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage exceptions quickly, increasing operational efficiency</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Citi’s investment in its core transaction banking infrastructure coupled with its on-the-ground presence in over 90 countries allows clients to manage their treasury operations from a single point of interaction, with global consistency. The strength of Citi’s network is demonstrated through its extensive solution offering, including Payer ID and Direct Debit capabilities, which both facilitate automated reconciliation. The addition of AI and ML to Citi’s receivables reconciliation solution suite offers a compelling proposition, allowing Citi to better serve its multinational clients across the globe.</p>
<p>“HighRadius is thrilled to have Citi as both a partner and an investor,” said Sashi Narahari, Founder and CEO of HighRadius. “We recently announced an investment from Citi and today we have further extended that relationship. Leveraging Citi’s extensive global network and capabilities, HighRadius will be able to offer an enhanced proposition to multinational corporations.”</p>
<p>Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) enables our clients’ success by providing an integrated suite of innovative and tailored cash management and trade finance services to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations across the globe. Based on the foundation of the industry’s largest proprietary network with banking licenses in over 90 countries and globally integrated technology platforms, TTS continues to lead the way in offering the industry’s most comprehensive range of digitally enabled treasury, trade and liquidity management solutions.</p>

<p><strong>16<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – Citi has launched Citi® Payment Insights, a new service providing institutional clients with real-time payments visibility, and ability to action payments on-demand via its electronic banking platform, CitiDirect BE®.</p>
<p>Citi® Payment Insights empowers clients with a complete view of the transaction lifecycle within Citi’s entire global network, and across the correspondent banking eco-system by integrating the transparency provided by SWIFT’s gpi initiative. This enhanced visibility is being launched in 50 markets and includes processing status, processing timelines, charges deducted across correspondent banks, and the amount credited to the beneficiary.</p>
<p>“This new service highlights our dedication to provide a frictionless experience to our clients in a rapidly changing business environment”, said Naveed Sultan, Citi’s Global Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions. “We are constantly searching for innovative solutions to help our clients succeed in the digital economy.”</p>
<p>The Institutional payments industry has traditionally suffered from a lack of full traceability as payments are routed through the global financial system. The servicing of payment inquiries occasionally relies on lengthy, manual and paper based investigation processes between banks. Leveraging banking industry advancements like SWIFT gpi and the latest technologies such as APIs, cloud computing, and Big Data, Citi has taken a transformative approach to digitize its client’s payments experience with innovative omni-channel solutions, including APIs, to meet clients' needs.</p>
<p>While developing Citi® Payment Insights, Citi worked with Royal Dutch Shell to deliver a seamless digital experience to control payments globally. Processes that in the past could have taken several days can now be completed in as few as two to three clicks. “Digitalization is an integral part of our Cash Management 2020 strategy. We are excited to see our requirements translate into tangible platform features that benefit both Shell and Citi. We have received positive feedback from the users who participated in the pilot that they found the service to be very intuitive. We look forward to introducing these features to our cash management team globally and reaching 75%+ elimination of targeted inquires over time”, said Darsh Johal, Head of Global Cash Management, Royal Dutch Shell.</p>
<p>Citi® Payment Insights has been designed based on client feedback, and the current features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Payments Tracking</h5>
<p>Provides instant access to payment status including rejects and returns; making the tracking of a payment as easy as tracking a postal package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Incoming Payments</h5>
<p>Offers a view of incoming payments before a credit is posted into clients’ accounts for improved working capital management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>On-Demand Proof of Payment</h5>
<p>SWIFT messages and branch signatures that can be saved, printed, or sent via email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Grant/Deny Debit Authority</h5>
<p>Allows clients to provide debit authority online, when remitter recall funds posted to a client’s account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Return of Funds</h5>
<p>Enables beneficiary to return credits not recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Clients are at the center of our strategy to continually improve security, transparency, speed, convenience and efficiency in the global payments industry.” said Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. “Citi® Payment Insights is a significant step forward in executing on this strategy. This service will deliver tangible value to all our client segments and the new technology platform sets the foundation for future innovations. I want to commend the Shell team for their digital leadership and thank them for their active engagement throughout the design of Citi® Payment Insights” he added.</p>
<p>Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) enables our clients’ success by providing an integrated suite of innovative and tailored cash management and trade finance services to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations across the globe. Based on the foundation of the industry’s largest proprietary network with banking licenses in over 90 countries and globally integrated technology platforms, TTS continues to lead the way in offering the industry’s most comprehensive range of digitally enabled treasury, trade and liquidity management solutions.</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – EBA CLEARING announced today that its pan-European instant payment system RT1 successfully connected six new participants yesterday (see end of document for the full list of the new participants). The new joiners brought the total number of RT1 participants to 28 and expanded the reach of the system from around 600 to over 1,000 addressable payment service providers.</p>
<p>With the 10 July 2018 joining window, RT1 has particularly increased its reach in Germany, where Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) and Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen (Helaba) connected the savings bank sector with 385 payment service providers to the pan-European platform.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased to support the German savings bank sector in offering instant payments to its 50 million customers. Our connection to RT1 enables these institutions to be among the early movers on euro real-time payments at European level and the first sector in Germany to integrally roll out instant payment products at a mass scale.” said Wolf-Rüdiger Braun, Head of Division Operation Services at LBBW.</p>
<p>“Processing SCT Inst transactions requires not only new IT infrastructure but also liquidity management and other support services operating 24/7. As one of two processing hubs for the German savings bank sector, Helaba has successfully risen to the challenge of providing our institutions with the seamless and carefree processing services they need to ensure that their customers can make payments with instant finality during and outside of their bank’s operating hours.” said Markus Jörg, Head of Cash Management at Helaba.</p>
<p>“RT1 has been designed to fulfil the needs of payment service providers and their customers all over Europe. To this effect, the platform offers great flexibility in terms of participation and access options and is use case-agnostic. The growing reach of the system testifies to the success of this approach and we have further developments in the pipeline to evolve RT1 functionality in line with user needs as SCT Inst volumes continue to ramp up across SEPA,” said Hays Littlejohn, CEO of EBA CLEARING.</p>
<p>RT1 went live on the launch date of the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) Scheme of the European Payments Council (EPC) on 21 November 2017. The system provides payment service providers in the Single Euro Payments Area with a real-time payment processing facility operating around the clock on any day of the year.</p>
<p>The service is open to any account-servicing payment service provider (AS-PSP) adhering to the EPC SCT Inst Scheme. Different options to interact with the system allow any type of PSP access to the RT1 platform.</p>

<p><strong>11<sup>th</sup> July 2018</strong> – Barclays Africa Group Limited has officially been renamed Absa Group Limited and started trading under its new name and new share code (ABG) on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange today. The name change marks the start of a new era for the group as a standalone African group with a new brand design fit for a forward-looking business in a digital age.</p>
<p>No longer just a South African brand, the new Absa Group has a presence in 12 African countries and plans to open international offices in the UK and the US.</p>
<p>“Our new name and brand are an expression of our new purpose and strategic direction, which commits us to growing in Africa,” Absa Group Limited Chief Executive Officer Maria Ramos said. “We are rallying around a shared sense of purpose and identity while celebrating our diversity,” she said.</p>
<p>Absa Group launched a new growth strategy on 1 March 2018 as it separates from Barclays PLC. The strategy prioritises cultural transformation as well as restoring leadership position in the group’s core business areas, and developing pioneering propositions for customers and clients. The new Absa brand design is an expression of the group’s new purpose, which is: ‘bringing your possibility to life’.</p>
<p>The rollout of the new Absa brand design in South Africa will be completed in 2019. The new Absa brand will also be rolled out to Absa Group’s Barclays banks in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia by mid-2020, subject to approvals including from regulators in those countries. Product and service functionality will not be affected by the rebranding programme.</p>
<p>In renaming Barclays banks across the continent, the group will be able to build on the pedigree of the Absa brand as a strong and stable bank. The brand has substantial equity – Absa was named the fourth most valuable brand (with an estimated value of R18.9 billion, or about US$1.5 billion) in South Africa by global brand valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance this year.</p>
<p>“We would like to build the brand as a bank that Africa’s people can be proud of, a truly independent African bank with global scalability,” said Ramos. “A single brand will enable us to unite behind a single identity, purpose and strategy; we are excited by the enormous opportunity we have to create a bank that Africa can be proud of.”</p>

<p>This new suite of Cloud-based software solutions provides Serrala customers with everything they need to securely and efficiently manage inbound and outbound payments and treasury worldwide, across multiple enterprise systems. The Alevate suite of solutions will be continually expanded to address customer challenges. The first product to be made available will be Alevate Payments.</p>
<p>Alevate Payments is a highly flexible and secure solution that acts as a global payment hub across multiple, disparate enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The Cloud-based solution will enable companies to achieve a unified view of all payment transactions globally and perform related cash management and cash pooling activities. Suitable for multinational clients as well as medium-sized businesses, the solution uses intelligent robotic process automation to convert payments into the correct payment format, sign the payments with strong cryptography, and provide a centralized connection between a company and the various banks it uses.</p>
<p>Organizations can use Alevate Payments as a standalone solution to centralize and standardize payments or they can combine it with Serrala’s SAP-integrated FS² solutions to provide greater organizational cash visibility. Whether the solution is deployed in the Cloud or as a Cloud-based managed service, it provides organizations with a highly versatile, multi-tenancy, multi-country, multi-bank, and multi-ERP payment solution.</p>
<p>According to Ingo Czok, SVP Cloud Solutions, Serrala, “Companies today want to be faster and more agile and they want to be up and running in the shortest possible time. Setting up a complex payments operation is much quicker in the Cloud.”</p>

When considered against the realities of tech adoption highlighted by the survey – 98% of respondents identify “increasing automation” as a priority, while only 17% have full cloud deployments – it becomes clear that the need for effective cloud solutions is critical.</p>
<p>“Cloud is the future and we want to help our customers with the best solutions for their specific business needs” says Sven Lindemann, CEO of Serrala. “Payment fraud is increasing globally, and Cloud solutions such as Alevate Payments, along with our managed services offering, provides a clear advantage for our customers: a single source of truth that is easier to control, audit and manage in a global business environment.”</p>
<p>Alevate Payments is the first in this suite of cloud solutions that Serrala will be launching this year. Future cloud-based solutions in the Alevate suite include Alevate Archiving, Alevate Accounts Payable, and Alevate Cash Application.</p>
<p>Alevate is the first solution unveiled since the launch of the new Serrala brand, formerly the Hanse Orga Group, following a series of strategic M&amp;A; efforts. Integrating the experience and offerings of the acquired companies, Serrala offers an inbound and outbound payments ecosystem that provides security and compliance at every step in the value chain.

<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2018</strong> – we.trade today confirmed that the first live trades have taken place on the platform. Over the last 5 days, 10 companies have executed trades, via 4 banks. These trades signify the first commercially viable open account trades, harnessing blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Many banks and companies are looking for a more efficient and cost-effective way to trade internationally. The we.trade solution, built on the IBM Blockchain Platform, powered by Hyperledger Fabric, offers customers access to a simple user-interface, leveraging innovative Smart Contracts and opens up potential new trading opportunities.</p>
<p>“The we.trade platform is a live, blockchain based trade platform. These transactions prove that we.trade is a robust and commercially viable proposition. We are delighted to have launched for the first time in the world, a blockchain based platform that enhances the overall customer experience, when trading internationally. The next step will be getting buy-in from additional banks and their customers in Europe and further afield”, said Roberto Mancone, Chief Operating Officer, we.trade.</p>
<p>Hubert Benoot, Head of Trade at KBC and Chairman of the we.trade Board of Directors, explained: “This live trade is a massive achievement for all involved. Not only has we.trade built a technical solution, it has also managed to create real collaboration across multiple banks and increased the connectivity of the trade ecosystem. This really is collaboration at its finest.”</p>
<p>we.trade was established by Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Nordea, Rabobank, Santander, Societe Generale and UniCredit to address the expectations of their customers to make cross-border trade more straightforward. The consortium has succeeded in meeting each banks internal governance and procedures requirements to make this innovation a reality.</p>
<p>“As we.trade has moved from pilot applications to conducting live transactions across borders, it has demonstrated the power of blockchain technology in an enterprise setting,” said Parm Sangha, GBS Blockchain Leader, IBM. “To convene a large network of regulated banks and demonstrate how blockchain technology can help them gain efficiencies and provide greater transparency in live transactions is a disruptive model that has the potential to reshape the future of global trade finance.”</p>
<p>At present we.trade is available across eleven European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK. we.trade expects to expand into additional markets in Europe and globally as further banking partners come on board.</p>

<p>Roger Vincent will step into the newly-created Chief Innovation Officer role to head up UK operations, after serving for many years as Head of Innovation at Equifax UK and pioneering their international Open Banking strategy.</p>
<p>Lisa Callaghan will move from the role of accountant to Chief Financial Officer at Trade Ledger’s Sydney office, after representing technology start-ups from inception through to early fundraising as a partner at Interactive Accounting.</p>
<p>The expansion will boost Trade Ledger’s international traction and product market fit, allow it to take advantage of open banking, and prepare it for further accelerated global growth. It comes after Trade Ledger’s Open Innovation Banking Award from Barclays Bank last month, and its participation in the Australia-UK Chamber of Commerce-sponsored fintech trade mission this week.</p>
<p>“Roger and Lisa bring an incredible depth of knowledge and experience to our business at a crucial time in our global development, and in the evolution of financial services as a whole,” said Martin McCann, CEO and Co-Founder of Trade Ledger.</p>
<p>“Lisa’s extensive and hands-on experience with hundreds of growth-stage company operations makes her a natural fit to manage both our financial direction and our general operations. Roger’s reputation, network, and thought leadership in Open Banking innovation makes him the natural choice to manage our UK operations.</p>
<p>“These appointments will strongly support the next part of our “Born Global” strategy – entry into the exciting and fast-moving European market.</p>
<p>“They will also help us take advantage of huge opportunities created by impending regulatory changes that are driving the pace of bank transformation into tech-driven business models, such as General Data Protection Regulation, Open Banking, and the Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2).</p>
<p>“It’s a perfect storm of opportunities for a corporate banking credit platform like us,” concluded Mr McCann.</p>
<p>Roger pioneered innovation in the UK consumer and commercial lending environments, including the conceptualisation and delivery of the <a href=""http://email.prnewswire.com/wf/click?upn=7VDqtAz2AW-2FeY7XnbvsasfcsENA7-2F3KuavMPjyUQqfLdTI9jdtO03QkN5H6fVf2HVQpGUiIwCrBkyXpCh-2BhwXPVR0z30LbwdVP3uQof-2BvOyh-2FvM-2Fzpa-2F0qn9JHH-2B5l558K-2BgOIfis5FuByhgwljw7A-3D-3D_bZlu4Ql58y5HyaRwGkQGtlU9UgeDlOdEch4hTBoYiHlGlKajXuMxzFMFEtD7JGZ6rn403jU9uEzR2kenpfbEjm732H6oStwIBHA-2FUCoP5f2k1733afL-2FAOVucKO3nVQpye14fOKvThmWgycfYmZ71GKZ1rPOEbpIRLL21s0hIQeGpHNxqIP43pwEe383t2XFjvjyyDEKZ8zB1k4QwFHnC3xB1WHuZA2Vap4Ht0KFcdsg05AEPJbKJt4uDlaTl9ai73-2FoeJEGyjLB-2BGXWYWuXVWTmFOe4xXxgcSxzNgJo0qLYVoNFXK8h-2BGdgftcwsxYvhtIdLQ-2BNIBoxWJ0H3TuiDH6w-2F7U3fVZ-2B6PtPBJX9xC-2FGc2Kwv0MQAyshOxW-2B5vff"" target=""_blank"">first live use case</a> of UK open banking in credit decisioning for HSBC. He was integral in driving open data strategy, policy and standards at a corporate and industry level in the UK and internationally.</p>
<p>Roger Vincent said: “We’ve seen significant disruption in the retail banking sector through a number of significant regulatory and technological advancements, but have only yet scratched the surface of what’s possible. SME’s are the lifeblood of domestic and international GDP, so applying my skills to help these businesses survive and grow is going to be incredibly rewarding. Doing it with a team as talented as Trade Ledger is going to be very special indeed.”</p>
<p>Lisa Callaghan said: “After 15 years in public practice, I’ve witnessed time and again the limited borrowing options available to businesses, especially those that are not capital intensive. Trade Ledger is the first company solving this complex issue on a global scale.”</p>

<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2018</strong> – Bank of America, N. A. Shanghai Branch (BANA Shanghai) announced today that it has been named a market maker for <a href=""http://www.chinabondconnect.com/en/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">Bond Connect</a> between mainland China and Hong Kong, and that it has completed its first client trade in China’s interbank bond market through the programme.</p>
<p>The first phase of Bond Connect was launched in July 2017. It allows overseas institutional investors to invest in China’s interbank bond market via Hong Kong. Phase two, which will allow investors from China to trade in major overseas over-the-counter bond markets, is expected at a later stage.</p>
<p>“Bond Connect is an important access channel for international investors to tap into China’s interbank bond market,” said Jin Su, co-head of Asia Pacific Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill). “China’s economy is more open and more globally connected than ever before. Demand is set to rise.”</p>
<p>BANA Shanghai is one of the most active market makers among foreign banks in China’s interbank bond market for onshore clients. Now, as a market maker in Bond Connect, BofA Merrill is able to provide overseas investors seamless access to China’s US$9trn interbank bond market.</p>
<p>“For the past two decades, the world focused on ‘Made in China’, but during the next decade, the focus will shift to ‘Trade in China’,” said Joydeep Sengupta, co-head of Asia Pacific FICC at BofA Merrill. “China has the world’s third-largest bond market, but overseas investors currently own less than three percent of it. Bond Connect has enormous potential as the international investor community rebalances towards China.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> July 2018</strong> – Bank of America Merrill Lynch today announced enhancements to CashPro Mobile, including the addition of fingerprint and facial recognition and an embedded token that allows users to quickly and securely access the application and complete payment approvals.</p>
<p>Companies use the <a href=""http://cashproonline.bankofamerica.com/"" target=""_blank"">CashPro banking platform</a> to manage their everyday treasury needs. The platform has more than 475,000 active users among the bank’s commercial, large corporate, and business banking clients. The mobile app’s popularity is growing, with more than 28,000 payment approvals made via CashPro Mobile in the first quarter of 2018 – a jump of 188 percent from the same period in 2017.</p>
<p>“Many factors are at play in the growth of mobile adoption and the demand for more robust features in mobile apps,” explained Hubert J.P. Jolly, head of financing and channels for Global Transaction Services (GTS) at BofA Merrill. “Top among them is the expectation treasurers bring from conducting mobile banking for their personal finances. The new features on CashPro Mobile allow corporate treasurers to conduct their business banking anywhere, anytime, in a secure, more simplified way.”</p>
<p>With CashPro Mobile’s integrated token feature, users no longer have to jump between the mobile app or token app or carry their physical token. The secure biometric authentication through fingerprint or facial recognition offers a simplified sign-on experience, providing stronger security than passwords provide today.</p>
<p>“Mobile’s ease of use and security features make it the ideal channel for corporate treasurers to access their cash and treasury information on a 24/7 basis,” said Tom Durkin, head of Global Digital Channels in GTS at BofA Merrill. “We’re excited to optimize the experience with our enhanced CashPro Mobile app, and look forward to introducing even more capabilities later this year.”</p>
<p>Today’s announcement is the latest investment in mobility and CashPro as a platform. BofA Merrill was the first bank to introduce integrated mobile check deposit and digital tokenization to the mobile experience. Additionally, last year, the bank introduced <a href=""https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/commercial-and-middle-market-banking/bofa-merrill-announces-cashpro-assistant"" target=""_blank"">CashPro Assistant</a>, a tool that uses artificial intelligence and predictive analytic capabilities to help commercial and corporate clients easily access and analyze their banking information.</p>

<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> July 2018</strong> – International payments company <a href=""http://www.airwallex.com/"" target=""_blank"">Airwallex</a> today announced the successful completion of its Series B fundraising. The company has now secured US$80m in outside investment, taking their total fundraising to US$102m.</p>
<p>In this round, returning Series A investors Tencent and Sequoia China were joined by fellow China based Hillhouse, Sir Ka-Shing Li’s Horizons Ventures from Hong Kong, Indonesia’s Central Capital Ventura (BCA) and Australia’s Square Peg, with whom Airwallex partnered in December for US$6m Series A+ funding.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand operations globally, with particular focus in South East Asia to deliver on what Airwallex has coined the ‘dream factory model.’</p>
<p>As explained by COO and Co-Founder Lucy Liu, “This model focuses on delivering full end to end solutions – not just FX and payments – enabling our clients to accelerate their global growth and open them up to new markets.”</p>
<p>Chinese based Sequoia have demonstrated strong confidence in the company’s ability to change how the world does business with the region, again participating in Airwallex’s fundraising.</p>
<p>Sequoia Founder Neil Shen said, “With the acceleration of global economic integration, foreign exchange and cross-border payments have received more and more attention from organisations. We believe that Airwallex’s continuous improvement of cross-border payment solutions can help Chinese companies solve this pain point, and thus better demonstrate their value in the global competition arena.”</p>
<p>Providing connections with China and SEA remains at the core of the business. The global distribution of Airwallex’s funding will elevate their focus within the region; the company has Singapore and Hong Kong in their sights, and will expand their presence in their home market of Australia.</p>
<p>Singapore has quickly become a key focal market for Airwallex. Their Singapore based team has grown rapidly, adding senior product and business development roles in recent months, demonstrating their ongoing commitment to building on the ground teams who specialise in delivering market specific solutions.</p>
<p>Within Hong Kong, funds will be put towards encouraging financial inclusion for SMEs in the market, and will seek to acquire a Virtual Banking licence in Hong Kong to support the fintech ecosystem globally.</p>
<p>Airwallex will use the new funding to seed the go-to-market for a new product suite that will solve the pain felt by SME’s attemping to grow internationally, but hitting sizeable payments and FX barriers.</p>
<p>“Airwallex wants to support businesses with awesome financial products,” Lucy says. “In providing these solutions, we intend to shake up the industries we’re playing in. We’re creating better, more cost effective one-stop-shop solutions using technology delivered around the world.”</p>
<p>“Our end game is to provide the global network required for businesses to scale globally and take advantage of the digital and online opportunities that exist when you’re transacting in multiple markets.”</p>
<p>Built to bolster foreign exchange payments around the world, the Airwallex platform is powered by a sophisticated FX and payment engine and a transparent pricing model to avoid inflated margins and minimise market risk. The platform supports thousands of transactions per second, providing a cost-effective alternative to existing payment networks for businesses looking to automate and scale international payment workflows.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>28<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – Enterprise blockchain software firm, R3, today announced that its partners have completed over 300 transactions on a Know Your Customer (KYC) application built on the Corda blockchain platform during a four-day collaborative trial.</p>
<p>A total of 39 firms participated in the project, including ABN AMRO, ALD Automotive, Alfa Bank, Bank ABC, Bank of Cyprus, BCI, BNP Paribas, China Merchants Bank, Commercial International Bank – Egypt, CTBC Holding, Deutsche Bank, DNB, Hana Bank, ING, KB Kookmin Bank, Banca Mediolanum, Natixis, National Bank of Egypt, NH Nonghyup Bank, Qiwi, Raiffeisen Bank International, RCI Bank and Services – the financial services provider for Groupe Renault, SBI Bank LLC, Shinhan Bank, Societe Generale, US Bank and Woori Bank. In addition, the regulators and central banks involved included Banco de la República (Central Bank of Colombia), Federal Reserve of Boston, Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia, and Superintendencia de Banca Seguros y AFP de Peru.</p>
<p>The transactions were conducted in 19 countries across eight time zones. Banks were able to request access to customer KYC test data, whilst customers could approve requests and revoke access. Customers were also able to update their test data which was then automatically updated for all banks with permission to access it.</p>
<p>The 39 participants deployed and ran a total of 45 nodes in Microsoft Azure, demonstrating the power of collaboration using shared business logic on the Corda network. The participants were able to communicate and manage test customer KYC data across the Corda network using a CorDapp designed and built by Synechron.</p>
<p>Traditional KYC processes are complex and often duplicative. This self-sovereign model allows corporate customers to create and manage their own identities including relevant documentation and then grant permission to multiple participants to access this data. This reduces duplication and costs by eliminating the need for each institution to individually attest and update KYC records.</p>
<p>In addition, Corda’s unique approach to sharing data, whereby only those with a need to see it will have access, addresses any concerns around data privacy and security that may arise when sharing identity data.</p>
<p>David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, said, “KYC requirements present a significant challenge to financial institutions and the process is often slow and time-consuming. As our corporate membership continues to grow, there has been increasing demand for blockchain-based KYC solutions. Not only does this project demonstrate how blockchain can allow institutions to retain control of and manage their own identity, but it also validates the design choices we made in our approach to privacy on Corda.”</p>
<p>Tim Coates, US Blockchain Lead at Synechron, comments, “We are proud to continue to advance KYC processes for banks, corporates, regulators and data services, and are grateful for the support of R3 and its member banks. The Corda platform solves many of the KYC-specific requirements, and supports gradual network adoption. Blockchain’s immutability used as a new verification mechanism, and its peer-to-peer nature enabling greater data privacy, are two of the native features that have attracted many in the KYC sector to blockchain. This initiative attempts to begin to solve some of the substantial problem statements behind Corporate KYC, re-working the KYC Utilities of the past – from centralized to decentralized; from trusted to trustless; from 3rd party data stores to controlling your own data.”</p>
<p>Yorke Rhodes, Principal, Azure Blockchain Engineering of Microsoft, comments, “As financial institutions and fintechs move their blockchain projects from innovation labs to lines of business, they require a seamless integration between their preferred ledger stack and infrastructure, and a robust set of platform components and tooling to develop, manage, and optimize blockchain applications. With R3 and Synechron, we have both the technology and industry expertise to help our banking sector accelerate blockchain projects aimed at solving shared business problems.”</p>

<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – Tradewind has announced the closing of a $1 million post shipment finance facility for an international trading company based in China that specializes in the import and export of auto parts.</p>
<p>Through its arrangement with Tradewind, the company received the liquidity it needed to support both open account terms requested by its overseas buyers and payment before delivery sought out by its suppliers. The company sells mostly to customers in Europe and the US and, with Tradewind’s assistance, was able to take on larger orders and compete for bigger buyers.</p>
<p>The client approached Tradewind to replenish its cash flow after it had purchased goods from Chinese suppliers but was still waiting on payment from buyers abroad. As automated production lines replace manual labor in the auto parts industry, factories are pressured to meet these new operating expenses and therefore demand a short turnaround in payment from their customers. On the other hand, with more options available in the market, foreign buyers expect not only higher quality products and better prices but also longer payment terms. Consequently, the overlap in payment cycles caused a liquidity crunch that stagnated the client’s growth, because as a trader, it relies heavily on cash.</p>
<p>With office locations in China, Tradewind provided liquidity readily to the client and removed the financial burden placed on its shareholders, whose capital the company solely depended on for investment purposes. Tradewind’s financing package also includes credit protection, which enabled the client to feel more secure in case of buyer insolvency.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to onboard companies like this whose prominence in the international marketplace requires flexible payment terms for both its buyers and suppliers. We are happy to see that Tradewind’s cash flow solutions provided the necessary liquidity for the client to stay competitive in the global auto parts industry,” says Alex Li, Country Manager of Tradewind China.</p>
<p>Tradewind provides innovative international cash flow solutions tailored for global clients. Focused on the mid-market, its core products are non-recourse factoring and supply chain finance. The group has built an unrivaled reputation for the depth of its international finance expertise by maintaining a network of offices around the world including the USA, Mainland China, India, Hong Kong, UAE, Turkey, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iceland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Peru and its headquarters in Germany. Combining financing, credit protection, and collections into a single trade finance facility, Tradewind offers streamlined, flexible and best-in-class services.</p>

<p><strong>27<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – SEB, a leading Nordic financial services group, has gone live on SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi) service.</p>
<p>With SWIFT gpi, SEB can now offer a rapid cross-border payments experience – with real-time payments tracking and transparency on bank fees and foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>Nearly half of gpi payments are credited within 30 minutes, many within seconds – and almost 100% within 24 hours – SEB’s clients can now fast-track their international payments. The service also enables end-clients to track the status of their payments from end-to-end, and provides an unprecedented level of visibility into each payment – including information about each bank in the payment chain and any fees that have been deducted.</p>
<p>Paula Da Silva, Head of Transaction Services at SEB, said: “We have supported the initiative from the beginning, and are really happy to be live. SWIFT gpi improves the payment process that clients use today and we will support over 40 currencies on this platform. The focus going forward is to explore new opportunities that SWIFT gpi gives. With everything going on in the payment landscape we need to deliver continuous improvements to keep abreast of developments and enhance the customer experience.”</p>
<p>Vikesh Patel, acting Head of UK, Ireland and Nordics at SWIFT, said: “We are delighted to see SEB go live on gpi and offer a high-speed, transparent and trackable cross-border payments service to their clients. SWIFT gpi is the most transformational change in cross-border payments in 30 years, and is quickly becoming the new norm thanks to banks such as SEB.”</p>
<p>To date, over 180 financial institutions around the world are signed up to SWIFT gpi, with over US$100bn in SWIFT gpi payments being sent daily across 450+ international payment corridors.</p>
<p>Following the SWIFT community’s recent endorsement of global gpi adoption, SWIFT gpi will be the standard for all cross-border payments by the end of 2020.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>20<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – The two companies have just used the blockchain technology to renew a credit line worth €325 million, the first initiative of this collaboration.</p>
<p>BBVA and Repsol have just closed a revolving credit facility (RCF) which for the first time uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) in a pioneering pilot in the area of corporate finance. Negotiation of the long-term credit line worth €325 million was completed using BBVA’s blockchain network, which reduced the process to a matter of hours rather than days in a fully transparent operation that allowed the tracking and approval of the documentation involved.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicia-pertusa-b161b9/"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Pertusa</a>, Head of Strategy and Blockchain at BBVA, said the first pilot by BBVA and Repsol kicks off an alliance to explore the potential of DLT technology in corporate finance. “This operation is the fruit of BBVA’s pursuit of integrating innovative and disruptive financial products for corporate clients and to offer them the best solutions that meet their needs,” Pertusa explained while taking part in the third day of the Spanish Association of Economic News Journalists (<a href=""https://www.apaie2018.org/"" target=""_blank"">APIE</a>) conference organized at the International Menéndez Pelayo University (UIMP) in Santander and sponsored by BBVA.</p>
<p>Today’s agreement comes within BBVA’s strategy of harnessing the advantages of blockchain in corporate banking and of enhancing the use of the entire range of products and services in this business area. BBVA recently unveiled <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-indra-deliver-worlds-first-blockchain-supported-corporate-loan/"" target=""_blank"">the first corporate loan using blockchain technology</a> in conjunction with the Spanish technology group Indra in a deal worth €75 million. Earlier this week BBVA CEO <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/biography/carlos-torres-vila/"" target=""_blank"">Carlos Torres Vila</a> announced that the Group will begin <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-ready-negotiate-and-contract-syndicated-loans-blockchain/"" target=""_blank"">testing the negotiation and contracting of syndicated loans</a> using blockchain, which will allow to dramatically streamline processes in this kind of operation.</p>
<p>This latest development is a natural evolution of the platform designed by BBVA, which has now taken bilateral corporate loans to another level by showing its viability for revolving credit facilities. The deal reaffirms BBVA and Repsol position at the vanguard of the application of these new technologies, which, while still requiring further development from a regulatory and technical point of view, are already showing the extent to which they constitute a leap in efficiency in financial processes.</p>
<p>For Repsol, the accord with BBVA advances its focus on digitization and innovation. The Spanish energy group has earmarked blockchain as a technology with great potential and competitive edge for its new businesses. Repsol already has a lab for its lines of development in improving financial processes with added security and efficiency and advances in the supply chain and client fidelity.</p>
<p>“Repsol wants to actively take part in collaborative environments. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is here to stay and the agreement with BBVA advances our strategy of driving digitization in all areas of our activity”, said Nuria Ávalos, the head of Blockchain and Digital Experimentation at Repsol.</p>
<p>The solution developed by BBVA and Repsol used different types of blockchain. The negotiation between BBVA and Repsol and agreement of the conditions was developed using a private blockchain network (Hyperledger), while the signed contract was registered used the Ethereum test network (testnet) through a hash, or unique document identifier that guarantees its immutability.</p>
<h3 id=""improvement-in-processes"">Improvement in processes</h3>
<p>During her presentation in Santander, Alicia Pertusa noted that the private (or federated) side of DLT has allowed financial institutions such as BBVA to take forward improvements in processes in areas such as payments, the issue of securities and international trade as well as in projects focused on digital transformation.</p>
<p>BBVA forms part of the main international consortia looking to create standards such as R3, Hyperledger, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Spain’s Alastria.</p>
<p>Turning to the challenges facing financial institutions to strengthen the use of blockchain in the financial sector, Pertusa underscored the primary need for regulations that protect users while encouraging innovation. Technically, she said, DLT need to be more robust, facilitate scalability and have inter-operational standards that guarantee communication among different networks.</p>
<p>The new tie-up with Repsol will drive the development of new services and customer experiences that are more rapid, transparent and competitive.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>25<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – The SWIFT Community is to universally adopt the gpi service, in a move which will see all 10,000 banks on SWIFT’s global network use the g<a href=""https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/global-financial-messaging/payments-cash-management/swift-gpi"" target=""_blank"">lobal payments innovation service</a> (gpi) for cross border payments.</p>
<p>The decision to move to universal gpi adoption has been taken against the backdrop of the rapid success and unexpectedly fast adoption rate of gpi to date. The service has already been taken up and is being promoted by 49 of the world’s top 50 banks. With the full support of the SWIFT board, representing the entire SWIFT community, this decision will drive global take-up of gpi, so that by the end of 2020 every bank on the network is able to offer same day end-to-end delivery with full tracking and transparency, throughout the payment chain.</p>
<p>Yawar Shah, Chairman of SWIFT, said: “The gpi service has been designed, developed and deployed in record time, and is already radically transforming the cross-border payments experience. Unmatched in scale, no other service has been able to safely deliver hundreds of billions of dollars in payments around the world in minutes or seconds. The time is now right to accelerate the adoption of gpi, ensuring that all banks on the network adopt it. The Board has therefore endorsed the network-wide implementation of gpi.”</p>
<p>Luc Meurant, SWIFT’s Chief Marketing Officer, said: “With gpi we are rolling out an ambitious global programme involving all the banks, currencies, and routes on the network, to ensure global adoption by end 2020. This move to accelerate adoption and extend the dramatic improvements being afforded by gpi will be transformative for the industry and its end customers.”</p>
<p>To assist the smaller or more occasional users, which collectively account for a very small percentage of cross border payments, SWIFT will introduce and support these users in implementing a basic gpi service, enabling all payments to and from these banks to receive full gpi treatment throughout the payment chain.</p>
<p>Launched in early 2017, gpi already accounts for 25% of SWIFT cross-border payment traffic. More than 100 billion USD in SWIFT gpi messages is sent every day, enabling payments to be credited to end beneficiaries within minutes - many within seconds.</p>
<p>Since going live, SWIFT gpi has seen rapid adoption with more than 180 banks already signed up to the gpi service. The rapid and widespread adoption of SWIFT gpi has been driven by end-customer demand for a faster, more transparent cross-border payments service, improved remittance information and predictability.</p>
<p>Nearly 50% of gpi payments are completed and credited to end beneficiaries’ accounts in less than 30 minutes, enabling banks to deliver a much enhanced service to their customers. To date, 35 million gpi payments have been processed, and hundreds of thousands of payments are being sent daily across 450 country corridors, in more than 100 currencies. In major corridors, such as USA-China, gpi already accounts for nearly 50% of payment traffic.</p>

<p><strong>19<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – Hang Seng Bank, the leading domestic bank in Hong Kong, has gone live on SWIFT’s global payments innovation (SWIFT gpi) service, which aims to increase the speed, transparency and traceability of cross-border payments for banks and customers.</p>
<p>As the new standard for cross-border payments, the gpi service already accounts for 25% of all SWIFT customer payments. Hundreds of thousands of gpi payments are being sent on a daily basis. Over 160 banks globally have signed up for the service, with more than 50 of these having already gone live.</p>
<p>SWIFT gpi facilitates faster payments to end-beneficiaries, with most payments being credited within minutes, or even seconds. The service also enables customers to easily track the status of payments. In going live on SWIFT gpi, Hang Seng will enhance the cross-border payment service experience for its customers.</p>
<p>Mr Donald Lam, Head of Commercial Banking at Hang Seng, said: “Hang Seng is committed to providing commercial customers with seamless and reliable cross-border financial solutions that enable them to take advantage of new opportunities and grow their business across the region. With SWIFT gpi, our customers will benefit from a more efficient and transparent payment process as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen our cash management capabilities.”</p>

Transactions can now be credited to their end-beneficiary in a matter of minutes and tracked in real-time. As Hong Kong remains a major financial hub and the gateway to China, we are delighted to support its growth and ambitions with gpi and we look forward to working closely with Hang Seng Bank to help them deliver value to their customers.”</p>

<p>As CFO, Zaramella will be responsible for the oversight of the company’s global Finance, Information and Technology Solutions and shared services functions.

<p>Gladden said, “I have enjoyed working with the Mondelēz International team to build a world-class global Finance organization. Leaving the company is a tough decision, but I look forward to a new career experience and depart knowing that Luca is an ideal choice to be the company’s next CFO. Luca and I have worked side-by-side over the past few years, and I have incredible respect for his financial expertise and company knowledge. I’m confident in the company’s long-term strategic direction and the team who will lead its delivery, including Dirk, and now, Luca.”</p>
<p>With more than 20 years of broad financial experience in both emerging and developed markets, and a track record of delivering strong results, Zaramella has an intimate knowledge of the company’s business across products, markets, operations, competitors and customers. Over the past four years, Luca has assumed a range of responsibilities to prepare him for this role, including Corporate Controller, Treasurer and global head of Financial Planning &amp; Analysis. Zaramella has served as Mondelēz International’s Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance since 2016 and was the Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller from 2014 to 2016.

<p><strong>13<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – Deutsche Bank today announced it has successfully launched eVault – a secure digital repository for exchange of documents – making it the first third-party document custodian to offer solutions for the handling of secure documents for its clients.</p>
<p>eVault is a legally compliant solution to move securely original electronic files from one party to another, while preserving its unique digital ownership. The eVault platform ensures authentication of the original documents in passing between owners, irrespective of how many duplicate electronic files there may be of the same record. The repository system relies upon digital tamper-proof seals and has an audit trail that ensures compliance and provides detailed reporting.</p>
<p>“The launch of our eVault reflects our continued commitment to provide innovative solutions for our clients,” said Jose M. Sicilia, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Trust and Agency Services. “Our top priority is to deliver market leading solutions for clients that enables them to conduct their current and future business in the most streamlined manner.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank is the first bank to make use of the technology, which will empower the bank’s document custody group to take possession of electronically originated assets for clients as the loan market continues to transition to a paperless process.</p>
<p>“With the eVault technology, our Document Custody group solidifies its leadership position as a comprehensive solution provider to handle both current and future market trends, and it is an important step in our overall digitization strategy,” said Thomas Nielsen, Chief Digital Officer for Deutsche Bank’s Global Transaction Banking business. “We continue to capitalize upon the remarkable capabilities afforded by new technologies in order to optimize our clients’ experience. This is just the beginning.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><strong>14<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – Wirecard, the international innovation leader in digital financial technology, is expanding its B2B portfolio with services based on blockchain. The blockchain forms the basis for a highly efficient global network. For example, between producers and processors of raw materials such as coffee, crude oil or steel – markets in which agreements on payments can be made in future without intermediate steps.</p>
<p>Wirecard is expanding its existing digital payment and banking platform with the supply chain payment solution based on blockchain technology. The prototype focusses on linking merchants with producers, capturing all business processes in so-called “smart contracts” – digital contracts based on blockchain – while minimizing the risk of fraud. In this way, all steps along the commercial chain, from drawing up contracts, to quality assurance and guarantee of origin, are mapped transparently in a decentralized database. Digitalization is therefore now shaping global supply chains where today many processes are still conducted via analogue data carriers such as fax and written documents.</p>
<p>Markus Braun, CEO of Wirecard AG, said: “We see great potential in the digitization of payment processes worldwide. Today we can use our years of experience, for example in payment processing within the travel and mobility industry, in which fast transactions to various stakeholders play a major role in bringing this process via blockchain technology to completely new markets – which already have a great demand today. With our worldwide presence, we are in the unique position to meet this need.”</p>
<p>Jörn Leogrande, EVP of Wirecard Labs, commented: “Within the framework of the private blockchain technology, Wirecard initially maps the possibility of direct interaction via a platform as well as the possibility for payments. Our experience in the area of financial and Internet technology puts us in a position to be able to transfer further services with concrete application examples to the blockchain. For example, the technology can be used to establish a comprehensive loyalty system, transparent and cost-efficient banking solutions for emerging markets and a secure, decentralized and efficient method for collecting, validating, storing, approving and updating trustworthy KYC data.”</p>

<p>The new global role took effect on June 1, 2018.</p>

<p>Mr. Cronin said: “Bill’s leadership capabilities and accomplishments while managing the US Technology Banking group make him a natural choice to lead MUFG’s effort to expand and enhance this critical sector on a global basis.”</p>

<ul>

<p><strong>31<sup>st</sup> May 2018</strong> – Dianrong, a leader in online marketplace lending in China, and R3, a global enterprise software firm, today announced that Dianrong’s next version of its supply chain finance solution will be made available on Corda, R3’s blockchain platform for finance and business.</p>
<p>Dianrong has been a pioneer in leveraging fintech and blockchain to improve supply chain finance for small businesses. The new Corda app (“CorDapp”) will further expand Dianrong’s reach both in China and globally by leveraging R3’s proven enterprise-grade blockchain technology platform.</p>
<p>Dianrong’s advanced blockchain solution enables end-to-end financing through an entire supply chain. The new R3 CorDapp will deliver an efficient and secure access point, while ensuring transparency and enhancing trust among the counterparties. Dianrong and R3 are now working to integrate Dianrong’s established supply chain finance solution onto Corda.</p>
<p>Soul Htite, Executive Chairman Dianrong, said: “Today, only 15 percent of micro and small businesses have adequate access to credit. This funding gap is particularly evident in large, complex supply chains where small business owners struggle to get the basic financing they need to operate. As a company commited to serving small businesses in China and around the globe, Dianrong believes the power of fintech and blockchain processes are the key to bridging this funding gap, while also building greater transparency and trust across global supply chain finance processes.</p>
<p>“Dianrong has made the strategic decision to further expand our supply chain finance network to make it easier for partners worldwide to adopt our solution. R3’s proven Corda platform will help provide the scalability, customization and global reach supply chain finance demands. And through a CorDapp, we can make this solution even more accessible and easier to use for supply chains in China and around the world,” Mr. Htite said.</p>
<p>David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, comments: “Blockchain’s unique ability to record, track and verify trades has direct applicability to financing smaller suppliers and managing goods throughout a supply chain. Lack of traceability and transparency is a major challenge for supply chains and parts of the logistics industry today.</p>
<p>“The CorDapp we are working on with Dianrong will be a powerful new tool to help address those challenges. It will provide greater access to Dianrong’s solution and help deliver a permanent, immutable record of each smaller supplier within a network, which will allow supply chain operators to make more informed and timely decisions about funding them. This strengthens the overall efficiency and transparency of the entire supply chain,” said Mr. Rutter.</p>

<p><strong>5<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – The increased digital networking and automation of machines via the Internet of Things (IoT) in the age of Industry 4.0 makes it possible to access machine capacity and production data.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things refers to networked physical devices that communicate among themselves on their own via the internet. Mechanical engineers and operators, for example, can use it to optimise machine capacity, minimise downtimes and customise maintenance cycles to suit utilisation patterns. The objective is to improve the efficiency of use for capital goods. These new technologies also make new business models possible, such as pay per use, pay per part, equipment as a service, and more.</p>
<p>Commerzbank has now become the first German bank to develop a data-based loan solution for this purpose. At its core, the new “pay-per-use loan” is an investment loan whose repayment is linked to the usage of the machine. The loan repayment schedule is calculated based on the actual usage of capital equipment, which helps preserve the user’s liquidity. If machine utilisation is low, the repayment burden is also low. It follows, then, that if there is an increase in production – and a rise in turnover – the repayment rate for the pay-per-use loan also rises.</p>
<p>This innovative solution for corporate clients has been developed by Big Data &amp; Analytics experts at Commerzbank. At the beginning of the year, Commerzbank founded the new group division Big Data &amp; Advanced Analytics under the leadership of Kerem Tomak in order to perform focused analytics of big and complex data and their business usage.</p>
<p>The prototype for this new digital loan model was put together by Commerzbank with machine tool manufacturer EMAG GmbH &amp; Co. KG in Salach (Baden-Württemberg). The networking of the machine tools at EMAG allow for a detailed look at their utilisation patterns, which in turn dictates the calculation of the loan repayment rate. KMB Technologie für rationelle Fertigung mbH, a company specialising in rationalised manufacturing and headquartered in Saxony-Anhalt, uses these types of machines for parts production in the automotive sector. The production cycle typical of the industry is well reflected in the repayment process of the prototype.</p>
<p>For Dr. Achim Feinauer, COO of EMAG GmbH &amp; Co KG, the pay-per-use loan represents one of the few features of Industry 4.0 which has successfully been translated from theory into practice. “On the path to networked production many obstacles, very often mental ones, have to be overcome. Pay-per-use is characterised by a direct combination of usage, ie turnover and earnings, to the costs of the investment. The benefits to liquidity requirements are tangible on a daily basis and are an incentive to implement Industry 4.0 in practical day-to-day production.”</p>
<p>“Thanks to the ability of our machines to communicate information, we are creating additional benefits for our customers,” says Claus Mai, CFO of EMAG GmbH &amp; Co. KG. “As a result of the cooperation with Commerzbank and the development of customised financing, these benefits are heightened for our customers. As one of the leading providers of manufacturing systems we are pleased that Commerzbank is taking such innovative paths together with us.”</p>
<p>“The pay-per-use loan from Commerzbank allows us to invest in a new generation of machines from EMAG,” says Sven Hartwich, Commercial Manager at KMB Technologie Gesellschaft für rationelle Fertigung mbh. “With the flexible repayment rates we can adjust our liquidity for production and turnover. This in turn allows us to lower our break-even point further in order to achieve better overall financial stability.”</p>
<p>Jan-Philipp Gillmann, Divisional Board Member, Segment Development &amp; Digitalisation in the Corporate Clients business segment at Commerzbank adds: “With our new pay-per-use loan, as the leading bank for corporate clients, we are taking another major step towards Industry 4.0. We are delighted that our long-standing client EMAG as well as KMB were willing to take that step with us. The jointly developed solutions are an important new element in our digitalisation strategy. Following on from the fully digitalised advisory process for hedging products and the digital loan platform, the pay-per-use loan will be rolled out over the course of this year as the next innovation in financial solutions for small and medium-sized enterprises.”</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – <a href=""http://www.finastra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Finastra</a> today announced the appointment of Simon Paris as Chief Executive Officer. Paris, who currently serves as Finastra’s Deputy CEO, will take over as CEO from Nadeem Syed as a part of a planned succession process. The company’s strong performance during its first year has been driven by double digit bookings growth and the integration of Misys and D+H.</p>
<p>“A once-in-a-generation transformation is taking place in the financial services industry and Simon has the vision, leadership and experience to lead Finastra through this evolution,” said Robert Smith, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners. “Over the past six years, Nadeem has built the company into a leading player in the Fintech industry, and Simon, with his understanding of how open platform technology can change the face of financial services, will take Finastra to the next level as a true platform company.”</p>
<p>In his role as Deputy CEO, Paris has been responsible for driving all of Finastra’s go-to-market operations including sales, marketing, and partner relations and has overseen significant growth in Finastra’s market traction and global footprint. He advocated the shift to a cloud-based model for all Finastra solutions and is spearheading the company’s transformation from a solution to a platform organization.</p>
<p>“I am immensely proud of what we have achieved at Finastra,” said Syed. “The breadth and depth of our solution portfolio is unparalleled in the industry and our leading edge solutions are underpinned by an immensely scalable operational platform. Simon is a dynamic leader whose vision for the future of financial services is exactly what Finastra needs and I am confident that the company will continue to flourish under his leadership.”</p>
<p>During Syed’s tenure, he has more than doubled the company’s revenue, led the successful merger with D+H and increased the customer base from 2,000 to more than 9,000 globally. He was recently recognized as a winner in the 2018 CEO Today Europe Awards. Syed is joining Vista Equity Partners as an Operating Principal, and will continue to serve on Finastra’s Board of Directors providing guidance and counsel to Paris and the Finastra leadership team.</p>
<p>“Finastra is in a unique position in the Fintech industry. We are changing the way in which financial software is developed, deployed and consumed in financial services and I couldn’t be more honored to have been chosen to lead the company through the next stage of this incredible transformation,” said Paris. “The opportunity ahead is huge and with our board’s support, I’m looking forward to taking our employees, our customers and our partners on this journey.”</p>

The Company has released the platform to select members of its global network of more than 300 correspondent banks, to obtain feedback and incorporate recommendations. A full roll out to its entire network of counterparties is planned for later in 2018. FXePrice will be free of charge for banks in the Company’s network.</p>
<p>With FXePrice, correspondent banks will be able to feed the Company with local currency live prices electronically. The Company will have the capability to execute a large number of transactions instantaneously with multiple counterparties. Traditionally, FX price discovery in the developing world has occurred manually via phone, email or messaging. FXePrice automates this process and facilitates instant electronic price discovery via both streaming and request-for-quote (RFQ) functionality, which significantly reduces the time and cost of execution, as well as errors associated with manual processes. Critically, the platform allows banks on the Company’s network to submit prices even during off-market hours for certain currencies, maximizing their abilities to capture flows by showing overnight interest and participate in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>Carsten Hils, Global Head of INTL FCStone Ltd’s Global Payments Division commented on today’s news, “Our trusted global network of more than 300 correspondent banks is a foundation of our business, and we are excited to offer them an innovative, electronic FX pricing and trading solution with FXePrice. The platform revolutionizes the Company’s price discovery and execution process and adds a whole new level of transparency to the process.”</p>
<p>FXePrice users can stream foreign exchange prices through the web-based platform, which reduces latency and ensures efficiency by integrating with counterparties’ straight-through-processing (STP) systems. All prices posted on the platform, including after-hours prices, are executable and verifiable. The accurate pricing provided through the portal is especially valuable for the currencies used in the developing world, for which traditional methods of price discovery lack transparency and are often unreliable.”</p>
<p>Francois Beau Yon de Jonage, SVP at INTL FCStone Ltd’s Global Payments Division, who designed the platform, concluded, “FXePrice gives banks in the developing world easier access to the latest technology and allows for better transparency with the local currency price in country. Given our position in the marketplace, we are uniquely positioned to provide a single solution to the local banks. We believe this to be especially valuable for those counterparties who may not otherwise have sufficient resources to adequately streamline their local currency rates. We have currently released the platform to select members of our correspondent banking network in order to source their feedback and integrate them into the system, after which time we will roll out the platform for our entire global network. I look forward to providing updates to our counterparties throughout this process.”</p>

<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> June 2018</strong> – Citi has today announced that is has successfully enrolled as a Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) on the UK Open Banking Directory, becoming the first corporate bank to do so. Inclusion in the directory will allow Citi to begin piloting new payment and collection services for clients.</p>
<p>Ireti Samuel-Ogbu, EMEA head payments and receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi commented: “We see Open Banking as a significant development in the banking landscape in Europe and increasingly in other regions as regulators seek to drive competition and innovation in financial services. Open Banking in the UK is particularly attractive to us and our clients as it enables collections with open APIs standardized and live across the Competition and Markets Authority nine banks. Citi continues to work with the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) and regulators around the globe to drive positive development in open banking and to deliver payment system innovations that work for both consumer and business users.”</p>
<p>Open Banking in the UK, which went live in January 2018, requires the nine largest UK banks to publish open APIs, enabling regulated third party providers to access bank accounts securely and with account holder consent, via open APIs. The directory is part of a wider shift in the global banking landscape from batch processing to real-time, hyper connected banking – an era of real-time payments and collections, and banking systems becoming accessible through APIs.</p>
<p>Imran Gulamhuseinwala, Trustee of the Open Banking Implementation Entity commented: “We are delighted to have Citi enrolled in our UK Open Banking Directory and are excited by their vision to leverage open banking to create new payment services for the UK market. As a leading global bank, Citi’s engagement is a strong endorsement of the UK Open Banking initiative and we look forward to further collaboration to develop the open banking ecosystem.”</p>

But as a result of numerous acquisitions made in recent years, we were operating with seven different brands: Hanse Orga, Soplex, SYMQ, Cogon, Dolphin, e5 and Tembit”, says Sven Lindemann, CEO of Serrala, formerly Hanse Orga Group.</p>
<p>As a global company uniting several unique entities, it was important to be recognized under one joint name and to communicate with one voice to customers and partners. At the same time messaging and visuals needed to be refreshed and updated – all perfectly sound reasons to go through a whole rebranding process.</p>
<p>“Of course, this wasn’t a decision we took lightly. Brand equity is such an important concept today, but we knew that, with the right approach, we could not only achieve our goals around refreshing the brand, but also hold on to the core values that our existing clients appreciate and expect. We also felt that a new brand with more of a cosmopolitan feel would bolster our global expansion plans going forward”, explains Lindemann.</p>
<p>Serrala enlisted the help of a US firm, Carbone Smolan Agency (CSA), an award-wining design-led branding agency. “As part of the founding family of Hanse Orga, I was keen to ensure that the new brand had more than just face value. For me, getting the right storyline behind the rebrand was critical”, says Lindemann.</p>
<p>The new name is inspired by the Sierra de la Serrella, a powerful mountain range in Spain symbolizing confidence and security. Born from the belief that no problem is too large to solve, Serrala brings clarity to complexity.</p>
<p>Serrala already supports over 2,500 companies worldwide with advanced technology and personalized consulting to optimize all processes that form part of the universe of payments: from order-to-cash, procure-to-pay and treasury to data and document management. Represented on three continents with 16 offices in Europe, North America and Asia, the company has over 550 employees who are dedicated to service companies of all industry sectors – from medium-sized companies to global players.</p>
<p>The redesigned Serrala logo and website showcase a fresh and new look for the company, bringing the enterprising nature and passion for process automation of the company front and center. Website visitors will also find a grown dedication to providing finance and IT professionals with in-depth content in the form of white papers and blog posts, focused on the latest news and technology in the industry and generating discussion about trends and new ideas.</p>
<p>Using the momentum of the rebrand, Serrala will focus its future plans very firmly on the universe of payments – with the aim of providing clear efficient cash visibility and secure financial processes.</p>
<p>Serrala will offer robust, ERP-integrated, on-premise and cloud solutions. What sets the company apart from many of the vendors in the market is combining those two worlds into hybrid cloud solutions. “ERP-integrated solutions are still popular, of course, but we see the hybrid cloud as an important evolution for our clients. Clients do not always want to be strong-armed into working in the ERP environment and many corporates want to extend the value of their enterprise systems – both of which are possible through the hybrid cloud”, explains Lindemann.</p>

<p><strong><em>29<sup>th</sup> May 2018</em></strong><em> – Currencies Direct has today announced a successful trial of Ripple’s xRapid platform.</em></p>
<p>This is one of the first successful trials of a digital asset by a mainstream financial services organisation. It marks a departure from the speculative trading of cryptocurrencies that has dominated the marketplace thus far and a shift towards the intended purpose of digital assets – as a means of value transfer.</p>
<p>The trial saw Currencies Direct conduct a number of transfers between pre-screened organisations in seconds, compared to the 3 to 5 day period that transfers currently take. The trial has served as a technological proof of concept for XRP as a means of value transfer, achieving superior speed of payment and end-to-end transparency, compared to traditional means of payment.</p>
<p>Brian Harris, Chief Product Officer at Currencies Direct, said of the move “our trial with XRP was a resounding success. We’re currently assessing our next steps, but the evidence we’ve gathered indicates that the use of XRP is a game changer, making payments near-immediate and significantly improving service to our customers.”</p>
<p>“Our goal is to offer the best possible service. We believe that utilising cryptocurrencies in this way – as a transfer of value, rather than as a store of value – is the next logical step for our industry. It is, after all, the intended purpose of cryptocurrencies and we’re proud to be leveraging new technology to deliver the most convenient and seamless experience for our customers.”</p>
<p>With xRapid, a financial institution connects directly to exchanges in both the sender’s and receiver’s countries. The sender’s currency is exchanged into XRP and then in seconds that XRP is exchanged into the destination currency in the second digital asset exchange. Once this transaction has taken place, the funds are sent out to the recipient and arrive in their account in their native currency. The transaction is tracked, and the result is a cross-border payment that is faster than ever before.</p>
<p>Asheesh Birla, Senior Vice President of Product at Ripple, said: “The results speak for themselves - xRapid leverages XRP to transform the way money moves by significantly lowering the cost and time it takes to make a cross-border payment. xRapid offers an enhanced payments experience, while also allowing payment providers to gain a competitive advantage in the market.”</p>
<p>“This represents a revolutionary step for the industry and clearly shows how FinTech companies like Currencies Direct are helping to revolutionise the financial services sector,” explains Harris. “We’re proud to be early adopters of this technology.”</p>

<p><strong>24<sup>th</sup> May 2018</strong> – SWIFT announces today that just 15 months after the service launched, 25% of all SWIFT cross border payment traffic is being sent over the global payments innovation (gpi). SWIFT gpi, the most transformational change in cross-border payments in 30 years, dramatically enhances the customer experience by increasing the speed, transparency and end-to-end tracking capability of payments. It is set to be the standard for all cross-border payments made on the SWIFT network by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>SWIFT gpi has seen rapid widespread adoption since going live in 2017. More than 165 banks, representing 80% of SWIFT’s cross-border payments traffic, and including 49 of the world's top 50 banks, have signed up to the service. To date, 50 million gpi payments have been processed, with hundreds of thousands of payments sent daily across 350 country corridors, in more than 100 currencies. In major corridors, such as USA-China, gpi already accounts for more than 40% of payment traffic.</p>
<p>Commenting on the growth in adoption of gpi, Harry Newman, SWIFT’s Head of Banking said: “It’s clear that the global payments industry needs to evolve in order to provide customers with a modern, service that meets their expectations. As a truly global, fast, secure and transparent cross-border service, gpi is delivering real and tangible change, and the increase in its use is testament to the huge benefits it delivers to end customers. With more than 25% of traffic and over $100bn a day now flowing securely over gpi, it is rapidly becoming the new cross-border standard.”</p>
<p>The strong growth in the adoption and use of SWIFT gpi has been driven by demand for a faster, more transparent cross-border payments service. Already, nearly 50% of gpi payments are completed and credited to end beneficiaries’ accounts in less than 30 minutes, many within seconds.</p>
<p>In March 2018 SWIFT announced the extension of its gpi Tracker to cover all payment instructions sent across the network, enabling gpi banks to track all their SWIFT payment instructions at all times, and giving them full visibility over all their payments activity. As a direct result of the speed and transparency afforded by gpi, banks using the service have seen a significant reduction in frictions and as much as a 50% fall in their enquiry costs.</p>
<p>Newman added: “As more and more banks see the dramatic enhancements and efficiencies provided by gpi, we’re seeing its adoption grow every day. The rapid delivery of a payment message in less than 30 minutes and the transparency provided by the tracker gives banks’ end customers greater visibility and a substantially enhanced service, allowing goods orders and shipments to be commenced much sooner.”</p>

<p><strong><em>24<sup>th</sup> May 2018</em></strong><em> – On May 23rd, 2018, thyssenkrupp traded an FX Forward with Commerzbank and this transaction was instantaneously replicated in a Blockchain successfully.</em></p>
<p>The use of Blockchain completely eliminates the need for a manual or semi-automated reconciliation between the client and the bank, thereby drastically reducing operational risks in FX transactions. The EUR/PLN FX Forward deal, which amounted to EUR 500,000 with a one month tenor, was initiated by thyssenkrupp using FX Live Trader, Commerzbank’s flagship FX Trading Platform. The deal confirmation was sent to thyssenkrupp directly via CORDA, a distributed ledger designed for finance by the R3 blockchain consortium.</p>
<p>On this achievement, Nikolaus Giesbert, Divisional Board Member, Fixed Income, Currencies &amp; Commodities and Trade Finance &amp; Cash Management, Commerzbank AG, said “Reconciliation is a major issue for banks when trading FX. Significant resources are dedicated to resolving the issues that occur during the matching process. This deal demonstrates how the use of distributed ledger can transform and digitalise the processes in this space. Commerzbank is pleased to be working with thyssenkrupp on this deal and to further develop digital banking solutions for corporates”.</p>
<p>With this pilot transaction, Commerzbank and thyssenkrupp have now affirmed a real FX transaction via Blockchain. In the future, the option of offering FX Post Trade Confirmation and Matching via Blockchain may offer significant benefits. Firstly, a more streamlined FX transaction process and a real time confirmation can offer efficiency gains for corporate treasurers by offering real time liquidity positions. Secondly, the use of Blockchain will completely eliminate the need for transaction reconciliation, since the transaction is stored as a single immutable record on the Blockchain. This drastically reduces time delays, operational trade risks, manual errors, and reconciliation problems in the process. Thirdly, the Blockchain based system will eliminate the need of the various third party solutions that banks use to send transaction confirmations to the clients. However, to fully realize these efficiency gains, technical, regulatory and legal requirements need to further develop.</p>
<p>“The comprehensive insight into the Blockchain process clearly shows how to connect market participants in the future in a highly secure and efficient manner while reducing transaction costs by avoiding external software solutions.

<p><strong><em>17<sup>th</sup> May 2018</em></strong><em> – Openlink, an ION Investment Group company and leader in trading, treasury and risk management solutions, today announced that Municipality Finance Plc (MuniFin) of Finland selected Openlink's solution to enhance the institution's straight-through processing (STP) capabilities and comprehensively manage risk across the organization.</em></p>
<p>As Finland's second largest credit institution, MuniFin is owned by the Finnish public sector, Finnish municipalities, the government of Finland, and Keva, a public sector pension fund. MuniFin provides financing and financial risk management to support public housing, infrastructure, and other socially and environmentally sustainable investment targets.</p>
<p>MuniFin launched a significant, internal transformation effort across its capital markets, customer finance, back office, risk management and IT functions. The team sought a solution that provides customizable STP capabilities across multiple asset classes and can meet unique business requirements. The search led MuniFin to work with Openlink and implement the new platform in November 2017.</p>
<p>Marjo Tomminen, executive vice president and chief financial officer of MuniFin, said, ""MuniFin's mission to provide competitive and timely financing for the Finnish public sector is based on overall operational excellence, how quickly and transparently we bring deals to closure, and a comprehensive view of risk. As we migrated to Openlink's platform, we challenged ourselves to streamline and integrate our workflows. We also strengthened our foundation of deal data for improved analytics, reporting and compliance, and shifted to even higher value work that serves the evolving needs of our customers.""</p>
<p>Concurrently, MuniFin launched new instruments—such as green financing for environmentally friendly projects—and needed a platform that can grow with the future direction of Finland's public sector projects.</p>
<p>""Our team at Openlink is very pleased to partner with MuniFin on a truly transformational journey that requires new operating models,"" said Bernard Delahaye, chief revenue officer of Openlink in EMEA. ""There is a reason why MuniFin has the most satisfied customers within the Finnish financial sector. Efficient and transparent back office operations are the backbone for any financial institution to deliver value to customers and build long-term public trust.""</p>

<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> May 2018</strong> – <a href=""http://tradeshift.com/"" target=""_blank"">Tradeshift</a>, the leader in supply chain payments and marketplaces, today launched an industry first: becoming the only cloud platform to bring supply chain payments, supply chain finance, and blockchain-based early payments together into one unified end-to-end solution, <a href=""https://tradeshift.com/enterprise/solutions/pay/"" target=""_blank"">Tradeshift Pay</a>. With these innovations, Tradeshift takes aim at a <a href=""https://blog.tradeshift.com/the-9-trillion-dollar-question-why-is-so-much-liquidity-locked-up-in-the-supply-chain/"" target=""_blank"">$9 trillion problem</a> – namely, the global capital trapped in accounts receivable as a result of archaic payment practices and the digital disconnect between large business buyers and their suppliers.</p>
<p>Tradeshift brings the first end-to-end supply chain payments and finance solution to business commerce with Tradeshift Pay. Using a single unified wallet, buyers can take advantage of a wide range of payment options, including virtual card payments of invoices and purchase orders, dynamic discounting, supply chain finance through bank partners, or blockchain-based payments.</p>
<p>“In an industry where 50% of US payments are check-based and companies around the world struggle to access finance and payments, Tradeshift Pay is a real enabler for the digitally connected economy,” said Christian Lanng, CEO and Co-founder, Tradeshift. “For the first time, businesses can go to one single wallet to handle all their payments, end-to-end, across all channels. And for the first time, you can do both regular and blockchain-based early payments in one platform in the cloud.”</p>
<p>With a platform that works both on and off blockchain, businesses can give smaller unbanked business and companies access to electronic payments and finance, anywhere in the world. And companies can get paid much faster – from an average of 30-45 days in EU and US down to a couple of days – helping address the $9 trillion supply chain liquidity problem.</p>
<p>As the first truly multi-finance solution, Tradeshift Pay is supported by more than a dozen major banks and card providers, including <a href=""https://tradeshift.com/press/hsbc-and-tradeshift-join-forces-to-revolutionise-working-capital-financing/"" target=""_blank"">HSBC</a>, <a href=""https://tradeshift.com/press/santander-and-tradeshift-partner-to-improve-speed-and-simplicity-in-supply-chain-finance/"" target=""_blank"">Santander</a>, and <a href=""https://tradeshift.com/press/tradeshift-taps-into-blue-ocean-of-chinas-supply-chain-financing-market-with-regions-largest-fintech-company/"" target=""_blank"">CreditEase</a>.</p>
<p>As the market leader in supply chain payments, including accounts payable automation, e-invoicing, and global tax compliance solutions, Tradeshift brings a history of innovation to the growing B2B payments market, which is expected to reach $2.2 trillion globally by 2020. Tradeshift has already seen massive growth over the last few years in the category of supply chain payments and today processes as much trade as Bitcoin and Ethereum combined.</p>

<p><strong><em>22<sup>nd</sup> May 2018</em></strong><em> – Bottomline Technologies, a leading provider of financial technology that helps make complex business payments simple, smart and secure, today announced a new voice-assisted Paymode-X app, which will make it easier for businesses to understand and access information on key payment transactions.</em></p>
<p>An extension of the Paymode-X B2B electronic payment network, the Paymode-X app provides businesses with details such as who has paid and how much has been paid, all within a secure mobile application. The Paymode-X network enables payments between more than 385,000 businesses, and it is integrated with Visa Payables Automation technology to help deliver Visa commercial card and virtual business-to-business payment capabilities.</p>
<p>“As the largest B2B payment network our focus has always been on delivering innovative, secure payment technology,” said Jessica Moran, General Manager, Paymode-X Business Solutions, Bottomline Technologies. “Our goal is to make business payments simple and more accessible—voice is an ideal way to do that.”</p>
<p>Paymode-X members will be able to use the voice-enabled app to inquire about electronic payments that have been received or are in process, including those made by ACH and virtual card.</p>
<p>“Leveraging voice in B2B payments is inherently more complex due to larger dollar amounts, higher transaction volumes, and the implications of payment fraud,” continued Moran. “We are working to remove that complexity and offer users a more intuitive and natural experience.”</p>
<p>Bottomline’s focus on making business payments simple, smart, and secure uniquely positions the company to deliver on the potential of voice for B2B payments. The Paymode-X app will be available in the summer of 2018.</p>

<p><strong><em>22<sup>nd</sup> May 2018</em></strong><em> – Renewi plc, the international waste-to-product company, today announces that it has signed an amendment and extension to its main banking facility, thereby converting it to a €550m Green Loan.</em></p>
<p>Renewi is wholly focused on sustainability, with the vast majority of its assets classified as ""green"" as they support ""pollution prevention and control"" as defined in the ICMA Green Bond Principles and the LMA Green Loan Principles.  Renewi is one of the first FTSE 250 companies to refinance its entire bank borrowings using this green certification.</p>
<p>The facility is also one of the first to introduce sustainability improvement into the terms of the borrowing facility. Accordingly, Renewi will benefit from a lower margin payable on its borrowings in the event that it achieves each of five ambitious sustainability objectives. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increases in Recycling and Recovery Rates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth in Carbon Avoidance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase in fleet efficiency, reducing emissions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition to a low polluting Euro VI fleet; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing reduction in the 3 day accident rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific measures for each of the targets will be disclosed in Renewi's annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report which will be published on the Company's website on 11 June.</p>
<p>The €550m facility has been extended to May 2023 with options to extend into 2025. It is structured so as to allow future green bonds and green debt placements to be issued under the same Green Framework.</p>
<p>The innovative green facility has been financed by Renewi's six relationship banks: ABN, BNPPF, HSBC, ING, KBC and Rabobank. This strong endorsement from the banks, demonstrates their continued support of Renewi and broader support for the circular economy by rewarding companies that contribute positively to the environment. This funding support directly enables Renewi to make incremental investments to achieve its sustainability targets.</p>
<h5>Toby Woolrych, Chief Financial Officer at Renewi, said:</h5>
<p>""We are delighted with this green conversion of our banking facilities with our six banks and to do so using this innovative and ground-breaking Green Framework. This facility secures our funding for the long term and demonstrates that our focus on sustainability is matched with our approach to financing. This summer we will be committing to ambitious new sustainability objectives and this facility ensures that by giving new life to used materials we can also reduce the costs of our funding.""</p>
<h5>Leonie Schreve, Head Sustainable Finance from ING, said:</h5>
<p>""Renewi is a ""Pure Play"" sustainability focused company and virtually all its assets and operations are ""Green"". Sustainability is an important strategic priority for ING and we are very proud to support Renewi to align its financing operations with its core business by formulating a Green Framework which serves as an umbrella for Renewi's current syndicated facilities and future debt issuances. Furthermore, as Renewi is stepping up its already high sustainability standards by setting even more ambitious sustainability targets, it will be rewarded by a margin reduction when these targets are met.""</p>
<p>ING and ABN acted as sustainability coordinators for the transaction.</p>

<p>The Corporate &amp; Investment Bank (CIB) has submitted an application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) seeking to establish a new, fully-integrated securities company in which it would hold a 51% stake, increasing to 100% as allowed by regulations over the next few years. The bank’s Asset &amp; Wealth Management business is also pursuing its desire and intent to increase its current joint venture stake in China International Fund Management Co Ltd to a majority interest, subject to agreement with its joint venture partner and the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>“Our investment in China is a commitment to bring the full force of J.P. Morgan Chase and our resources to the country,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase. “We will hire people, lend to businesses, support the development of markets and strengthen communities through philanthropic initiatives. These developments are important for China, the U.S. and global commerce, and an encouraging sign for the world’s two largest economies.”</p>
<p>As the newly appointed CEO of China, Leung will be responsible for managing onshore and offshore activities in the country, helping to bring J.P. Morgan’s global network and resources to the country. He has been with J.P. Morgan for 21 years in a career that has taken him to Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. Leung started his career in Rates Derivatives trading and has held trading roles in Emerging Markets, Credit Hybrids and Equity Derivatives. Most recently, he served as the co-head of Global Equities &amp; Prime Services with Jason Sippel, who will become the sole head of that business.</p>
<p>David Li, J.P. Morgan’s Senior Country Officer for China, will also become a Vice Chairman of Global Banking. His expertise and experience will be extremely valuable as he dedicates more of his time advising key clients in the region. “Having Mark as the CEO of China brings the best of J.P. Morgan to this market,” said Li. “I look forward to working closely with Mark as J.P. Morgan China enters into the next phase of investments.”</p>
<p>“China represents one of the largest opportunities in the world for many of our clients and for J.P. Morgan Chase,” said Daniel Pinto, Co-President &amp; Co-Chief Operating Officer of J.P. Morgan Chase and Chief Executive Officer of the CIB. “It is a critical component of our growth plans, both globally and in Asia Pacific. Our scale and global capabilities give us a unique ability to help Chinese companies grow internationally and also bring foreign investment and capital to China.”</p>
<p>The opportunity to have a majority-controlled and integrated securities company in China will allow J.P. Morgan’s CIB, a top underwriter of both debt and equity as well as a leader in cross-border M&amp;A;, to accelerate its dialogue with onshore Chinese clients as they expand and grow their businesses. The bank is also looking to double its research coverage of China-listed companies across all sectors, helping to educate global investors about exciting local opportunities. Additionally, J.P. Morgan’s Markets franchise, the largest in the world, will continue to invest in systems and platforms in an effort to provide better access and liquidity to China’s maturing capital markets.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s Treasury Services business, which processes more than $5 trillion in global payments every day, provides its offerings to Chinese companies, as does the bank’s growing Custody &amp; Fund Services business, which holds more than $23 trillion in assets under management for clients around the world.</p>
<p>The bank is also well-positioned to provide China’s institutions and individuals with world-class private banking and asset management services as the country’s economy and wealth continue to grow.</p>
<p>“Our ongoing investments in China reflect our long-term commitment to one of the largest, fastest-growing and most exciting markets in the world,” said Mary Erdoes, Chief Executive Officer, Asset &amp; Wealth Management.</p>
<p>As a result of these initiatives, J.P. Morgan intends to significantly increase its hiring of talented graduates from local universities and develop their international skills.</p>
<p>“J.P. Morgan has a long history in China – fast approaching 100 years – and we are very focused on making sure we are well positioned for many more successful decades to come,” said Nicolas Aguzin, CEO and Chairman of J.P. Morgan, Asia Pacific. “Over the past four years, under the leadership of David Li, we have strengthened our management team onshore, deepened our client relationships, and paved the way for future opportunities. We are looking forward to entering our next exciting phase of growth with greater capabilities.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan was recently appointed by the People’s Bank of China as an RMB clearing house in the U.S., the first non-Chinese bank to be designated. The firm also recently announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, under which both banks will expand cooperation and leverage their international and domestic strength to better support Chinese companies going global and multinational companies coming into China.</p>

<p>The Corporate &amp; Investment Bank (CIB) has submitted an application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) seeking to establish a new, fully-integrated securities company in which it would hold a 51% stake, increasing to 100% as allowed by regulations over the next few years. The bank’s Asset &amp; Wealth Management business is also pursuing its desire and intent to increase its current joint venture stake in China International Fund Management Co Ltd to a majority interest, subject to agreement with its joint venture partner and the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>“Our investment in China is a commitment to bring the full force of J.P. Morgan Chase and our resources to the country,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase. “We will hire people, lend to businesses, support the development of markets and strengthen communities through philanthropic initiatives. These developments are important for China, the U.S. and global commerce, and an encouraging sign for the world’s two largest economies.”</p>
<p>As the newly appointed CEO of China, Leung will be responsible for managing onshore and offshore activities in the country, helping to bring J.P. Morgan’s global network and resources to the country. He has been with J.P. Morgan for 21 years in a career that has taken him to Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. Leung started his career in Rates Derivatives trading and has held trading roles in Emerging Markets, Credit Hybrids and Equity Derivatives. Most recently, he served as the co-head of Global Equities &amp; Prime Services with Jason Sippel, who will become the sole head of that business.</p>
<p>David Li, J.P. Morgan’s Senior Country Officer for China, will also become a Vice Chairman of Global Banking. His expertise and experience will be extremely valuable as he dedicates more of his time advising key clients in the region. “Having Mark as the CEO of China brings the best of J.P. Morgan to this market,” said Li. “I look forward to working closely with Mark as J.P. Morgan China enters into the next phase of investments.”</p>
<p>“China represents one of the largest opportunities in the world for many of our clients and for J.P. Morgan Chase,” said Daniel Pinto, Co-President &amp; Co-Chief Operating Officer of J.P. Morgan Chase and Chief Executive Officer of the CIB. “It is a critical component of our growth plans, both globally and in Asia Pacific. Our scale and global capabilities give us a unique ability to help Chinese companies grow internationally and also bring foreign investment and capital to China.”</p>
<p>The opportunity to have a majority-controlled and integrated securities company in China will allow J.P. Morgan’s CIB, a top underwriter of both debt and equity as well as a leader in cross-border M&amp;A;, to accelerate its dialogue with onshore Chinese clients as they expand and grow their businesses. The bank is also looking to double its research coverage of China-listed companies across all sectors, helping to educate global investors about exciting local opportunities. Additionally, J.P. Morgan’s Markets franchise, the largest in the world, will continue to invest in systems and platforms in an effort to provide better access and liquidity to China’s maturing capital markets.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s Treasury Services business, which processes more than $5 trillion in global payments every day, provides its offerings to Chinese companies, as does the bank’s growing Custody &amp; Fund Services business, which holds more than $23 trillion in assets under management for clients around the world.</p>
<p>The bank is also well-positioned to provide China’s institutions and individuals with world-class private banking and asset management services as the country’s economy and wealth continue to grow.</p>
<p>“Our ongoing investments in China reflect our long-term commitment to one of the largest, fastest-growing and most exciting markets in the world,” said Mary Erdoes, Chief Executive Officer, Asset &amp; Wealth Management.</p>
<p>As a result of these initiatives, J.P. Morgan intends to significantly increase its hiring of talented graduates from local universities and develop their international skills.</p>
<p>“J.P. Morgan has a long history in China – fast approaching 100 years – and we are very focused on making sure we are well positioned for many more successful decades to come,” said Nicolas Aguzin, CEO and Chairman of J.P. Morgan, Asia Pacific. “Over the past four years, under the leadership of David Li, we have strengthened our management team onshore, deepened our client relationships, and paved the way for future opportunities. We are looking forward to entering our next exciting phase of growth with greater capabilities.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan was recently appointed by the People’s Bank of China as an RMB clearing house in the U.S., the first non-Chinese bank to be designated. The firm also recently announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, under which both banks will expand cooperation and leverage their international and domestic strength to better support Chinese companies going global and multinational companies coming into China.</p>

<p>The blockchain transaction involved a bulk shipment of soybeans from Argentina, through Geneva’s trading arm of Cargill, to Malaysia, through Cargill’s Singapore subsidiary as the purchaser. A Letter of Credit was issued using Corda by HSBC to ING. The two banks were acting on behalf of the Cargill entities.</p>
<p>The transaction demonstrates that blockchain as a solution to trade digitisation, is commercially and operationally viable. Conventional exchanges for paper-based documentation related to letters of credit usually take between 5-10 days. This exchange was done in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Letter of Credit transaction was an end-to-end trade between a buyer and a seller and their respective banking partners, completed on a single shared application rather than multiple systems.</p>
<p>“What this means for businesses is that trade finance transactions have been made simpler, faster, more transparent and more secure,” said Vivek Ramachandran, HSBC’s head of growth and innovation. “The need for paper reconciliation is removed because all parties are linked on the platform and updates are instantaneous. The quick turnaround could mean unlocking liquidity for businesses.”</p>
<p>“Cargill believes blockchain can help our company nourish the world in a safe, responsible and sustainable way. Therefore, it’s a key technology we are exploring and using with our own customers and, now, using for ourselves with the completion of this transfer on Corda,” explained Rani Misra, Regional Treasurer, APAC, Cargill. “Simply put, we took a highly manual, complex transaction and made it more secure and efficient. We see the exciting potential of extending this technology into other areas of our financial ecosystem.”</p>
<p>David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, added, “This transaction represents another major milestone for Corda as we work with the industry to make enterprise blockchain a reality in trade finance. Corda enables the development of applications like this one that bring all parties together on a single, shared infrastructure while ensuring the highest levels of privacy and security.”</p>
<p>Ivar Wiersma, Managing Director, Innovation Wholesale Banking, ING, said: “It’s exciting to see this transaction has been completed successfully with clear client benefits in speed and ease in execution. On top of that, it shows the power of collaboration. Collaboration with other ecosystems’ stakeholders like regulators, ports, customs and logistics providers such as large shipping carriers. And in particular, collaboration with other banks, even our peers.”</p>
<p>R3 and the group of 12 banks supporting the Corda application are seeking to expand the network on an open basis to drive adoption across the industry. They welcome engagement from banks and other ecosystem participants.</p>

<p>Based on support and feedback from the Settlement Optimization Working Group, DTCC is taking a phased approach to the implementation of Settlement Optimization, beginning with Night Cycle Re-engineering.</p>
<p>By focusing initially on re-engineering the night cycle, a processing batch occurring in the overnight hours, DTCC seeks to significantly increase settlement rates going into the next morning. Today’s more sequential algorithm results in a night cycle settlement rate of about 45% for all transactions during that period. However, DTCC estimates it can increase that same settlement rate to as high as 90% as a result of the re-engineering.</p>
<p>This increase in settlement in the night cycle is a prerequisite for the Working Group to explore the implementation of Settlement Optimization Phase 2, the introduction of morning settlement in addition to today’s end-of-day settlement process. By moving from the afternoon of settlement date to the morning before market open, the risk associated with funds settlement will be reduced.</p>
<p>“Night Cycle Reengineering will create and lead to a number of industry benefits including improved processing efficiency, reduced operational risk and improved intraday settlement finality,” said Murray Pozmanter, DTCC Managing Director and Head of Clearing Agency Services. “With this plan, we are beginning to bring our vision for the evolution of the U.S. equities market structure to life.”</p>
<p>The new approach to the night cycle introduces an advanced settlement processing algorithm capable of evaluating each member’s transaction obligations, available positions, transaction priority instructions and risk management controls while identifying the transaction processing order that maximizes the number of transactions settled.</p>
<p>The Settlement Optimization Working Group, formed in September 2017 and now with about 50 members including major service providers, gave important feedback on the re-engineering proposal including the proposed timeline and key processing times.</p>
<p>The launch of Night Cycle Re-engineering is subject to regulatory approval, as are the additional phases that will be addressed over time.</p>

<p>HSBC’s Global Head of Liquidity and Cash Management, Diane S. Reyes, says the introduction of Face ID means business customers can now enjoy even faster and more secure access to mobile banking.</p>
<p>“Customers are benefitting from both the convenience of HSBCnet Mobile and the highest level of security with the introduction of Face ID,” she says. “HSBCnet Mobile use has grown by 60 per cent in the last year alone, with an equivalent growth in value. With single amounts of up to USD1 billion authorised on the app, we know our customers will appreciate the additional security and ease Face ID allows.”</p>
<p>Face ID technology works by recognising facial features, analysing over 30,000 reference points to create a ‘depth map’ of the face. HSBC’s Face ID log-on connects the bank’s mobile application programming interface (API) securely to the phone’s software to authenticate the user – with less than a one-in-a-million chance of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>HSBC incorporated Face ID as part of its ‘Digital Transformation for Corporates’ (DTC) programme, which is designed to build and develop a customer-centric digital banking experience.</p>
<p>“We are pioneering this technology within the financial services sector for businesses and corporates,” says Niall Cameron, HSBC’s Global Head of Corporate and Institutional Digital. “Our unparalleled global digital footprint allows us to deploy new technology like this quickly and at scale to make a real difference to our customers.”</p>
<p>The first smartphone model to support Face ID is Apple’s iPhone X. Almost a fifth of current HSBCnet Mobile customers on Apple phones are already using it. The bank’s Touch ID option will remain available on smartphones that can scan fingerprints.</p>

<p>Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is a secure and decentralised way of sharing data and transactions. The project is one of the first of its kind in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Reconciling policy information and premium payments made by a broker to an insurer on behalf of customers is a slow and painful process,” said Paul Goodwin, ANZ Managing Director Institutional NZ.</p>
<p>“The blockchain solution will be much more efficient for the industry as well as being very secure. As a ‘single source of truth’, it will provide greater visibility throughout the process, remove uncertainty and help make response times faster.</p>
<p>“This technology will work with existing industry solutions to capture relevant information; ensuring payments can be forecast and made without the need for reconciliation.”</p>
<p>ANZ has been a leader in blockchain technology and will build on the results of its property guarantees blockchain solution.</p>
<p>“Distributed ledger technologies are driving major efficiencies across many industries by enabling previously complex, manual processes to operate in real time with full transparency,” said Mike Smith, Managing Director, IBM New Zealand.</p>
<p>“IBM used design-led thinking principles and practices to reinvent the business processes behind intermediated insurance at ANZ.</p>
<p>“The result is an interoperable network that could not only decrease policy costs and improve customer service, but also build a foundation for the introduction of other transformative technologies, such as artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>“We’re always looking at ways to generate operational efficiencies and the Proof of Concept was an exciting way to test whether a technology solution can speed up the reconciliation process for insurance premium payments, while at the same time improving the customer experience for policyholders and our business partners,” said Tim Buckett, Chief Financial Officer at Suncorp New Zealand.</p>
<p>ANZ and IBM have released a proof-of-concept white paper on the technology, and how it will benefit the insurance industry.</p>

<p>Overall, Fitch estimates that the Saudi Arabian money fund sector grew by around 10% over the three years to end-December 2017 in US dollar terms, with asset expansion particularly high in 2017. This compares with a global money fund growth of 5% over the same period.</p>
<p>Saudi money funds are primarily denominated in Saudi riyals, although a limited number are denominated in US dollars. Saudi Arabia is approximately by total asset the 20th-largest money fund domicile (approximately 19 billion in US dollar terms) globally. While Saudi Arabia is a middle-ranking money fund domicile, it is by far the largest in the Middle East region. Money funds represent around 73% of total mutual fund assets domiciled in Saudi Arabia. As in other smaller mutual fund markets, money funds offer a first step into investment for risk-averse investors through effecting limited maturity transformation and hence offering superior rates - and diversification - to bank deposits. Fitch expects continued growth in the Saudi Asset management industry, which is already the largest Islamic asset management industry globally.</p>
<p>Saudi money funds benefit from a solid regulatory framework: they are regulated under the Investment Funds Regulations of the Capital Market Authority of Saudi Arabia as amended 23 May 2016. This provides for limits on concentration, market and liquidity risk. For example, applicable regulation in Saudi Arabia caps funds’ weighted average life (WAL), a measure of sensitivity to spread risk, at 120 days. This aligns with US and European regulatory requirements. On the other hand, applicable regulation requires only10% weekly liquidity, which is substantially lower than the 30% required by US and European regulation. Furthermore, Saudi Arabian money funds can run more concentrated portfolios than would be permitted under US or European regulation, although the funds reviewed by Fitch demonstrate prudent diversification, with issuer exposures typically capped at 10%.</p>
<p>Saudi money funds primarily invest in murabaha contracts and sukuk issued by Fitch-rated domestic and regional sovereigns, banks or corporates. Saudi Arabia itself is rated ‘A+’/‘Stable’/‘F1+’, with a Country Ceiling of ‘AA’. Fitch rates most domestic and regional banks investment-grade.</p>

<p>DBS’ clients in Singapore and Hong Kong are the first in Asia to be able to tap into this digital solution at no extra cost. Powered by SWIFT Global Payments Innovation (gpi), DBS’ clients in China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan will also be able experience the same transaction transparency and speed in the next few months.</p>
<p>Navinder Duggal, Group Head of Cash Product Management at DBS said that cross-border payments are becoming more commonplace as Asian businesses spread their wings and grow their supply chains globally.</p>
<p>Duggal said, “When it comes to processing cross-border payments, corporate treasurers tell us that they want faster and more efficient payments. The DBS SWIFT gpi solution gives companies online visibility when tracking payments across more than 48 gpi banks across the globe and this is set to increase as more banks come on board.”</p>
<p>“Corporate cross-border payment volumes have increased by 25% in the last 12 months. Today one in four of all cross-border transactions are received by their beneficiaries in less than two hours, and we expect these volumes to rise,” Duggal added.</p>
<p>A SWIFT survey<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> found that 86% of treasurers are looking for efficient payment processes and effective customer support when choosing a bank for cross-border payments. While there has been much technological innovation, the survey also found that businesses wanted underlying challenges of payment tracking and speed with cross-border payments solved without the need to deploy expensive solutions and resources.</p>
<p>With the new DBS SWIFT gpi solution, customers can now track<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> the status of their cross-border payments instantly, online without the need to call the DBS corporate call centre. By logging into DBS IDEAL, the Bank’s corporate online banking platform, clients will be able to find out whether funds have been received by the beneficiary, where the funds are in the cross-border payment chain.</p>
<p>Today, one in four cross-border USD payments made by corporate and SME clients from Singapore and Hong Kong are benefitting from end-to-end visibility of their cross-border payments from origination to the receipt of funds by the beneficiary.</p>
<p>Dai Kai, Chief Financial Officer, PetroChina International (Singapore) Pte. Ltd said that their business has benefitted from having a real-time cashflow position. “This is an example of an innovative initiative that gives corporates like us complete transparency of cross-border payments settlement online and helps make doing business easier,” said Dai.</p>
<p>Hong Kong’s TCC Group<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> Tony Lam, General Manager, Finance and Treasury Division said said that the group is using the solution to help them stay on top of their cash management needs. “Efficient cash management has become much more important than in the past to shipping groups like TCC. By pioneering this new online initiative, DBS has enabled us to keep constantly ahead in the global marketplace,” said Lam.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Ng Wai Hoe, Medical Director, National Neuroscience Institute said that NNI appreciated the flexibility of online tracking without the need to call DBS’ corporate hotline. “NNI is benefitting from operational efficiency and productivity. We are now also able to have greater visibility on each transaction, and this benefits our vendors as well,” said Ng.</p>
<p>DBS business clients making cross-border payments to other DBS accounts across its network benefit from instant transfers in six markets, leveraging DBS’ Asian connectivity. Called DBS PriorityPay, the value of transactions through this service has increased year-on-year by 60%.</p>

<p>To date, 160 financial institutions around the world are committed to SWIFT gpi, with nearly 50 live on the service.</p>
<p>SWIFT gpi dramatically increases the speed, transparency and traceability of cross-border payments for users, allowing banks to credit payments to end beneficiaries within minutes, many within seconds.</p>
<p>Overall, nearly 50% of SWIFT gpi payments are credited within 30 minutes and over 90% of payments within 24 hours. Those that take longer do so for a clear, known reason – such as extra compliance checks, complex foreign exchange conversions, or regulatory authorisations.</p>
<p>SWIFT gpi enables banks’ customers to track the status of a payment in real-time and provides an unprecedented level of visibility into each payment, including information about each bank in its path and any fees that have been deducted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“SWIFT continues to focus on delivering value to its members and the clients they serve. The organisation’s ability to develop new services and functionality helps its members support the needs of their clients and prepares them for the opportunities and challenges of the future.”</p>
<p><cite>Diane S. Reyes, Group General Manager and Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management at HSBC</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The innovative, cloud-based, tracker ensures both counterparties receive confirmation in real-time when the supplier or beneficiary is credited. SWIFT gpi also promises same day use of funds, delivering speed, certainty and predictability to its clients.</p>
<p>More than US$100bn in SWIFT gpi messages are being sent daily across 350 international payment corridors, representing nearly 10% of SWIFT’s cross border payment traffic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are always looking to offer our clients the benefits of increased speed, transparency, security and traceability which have become vital requirements for any business that relies on making or receiving international payments. We remain committed to exceptional client service in the payments space.”</p>
<p><cite>Tom Halpin, Global Head of Payment Products, Global Liquidity &amp; Cash Management at HSBC</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephen Grainger, Head of UK, Ireland and Nordics at SWIFT said: “Having yet another of the world’s largest banking and financial organisations go live with SWIFT gpi is a testament to the service, which is quickly becoming the gold standard for international payments. We have seen a rapid surge in both adoption rates and the number of transactions on SWIFT gpi and continue to add new banks and country corridors almost daily as we expand our coverage across institutions, markets and geographies.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>SWIFT has held exploratory talks with banks from the Asia Pacific region, including ANZ, Bangkok Bank, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, China Guangfa Bank, Commonwealth Bank, DBS, ICBC, Kasikornbank, NAB, Siam Commercial Bank, UOB and Westpac about the development of an Asia Pacific cross-border real-time payments system based on gpi. At the workshops SWIFT and the participating banks determined that such a service would have significant benefits that would extend beyond gpi banks and their customers, deep into the domestic markets, eventually affording a complete real-time cross border payments experience for all bank customers in the region.</p>
<h5>The group agreed the service should be rolled out in three distinct phases:</h5>
<p>Phase 1 will see the introduction of a new real-time gpi sub-scheme, to facilitate real-time cross-border payments between gpi banks in the region. Building on the significant success of <a href=""https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/global-financial-messaging/payments-cash-management/swift-gpi"" target=""_blank"">SWIFT gpi payments</a>, which already significantly reduce cross-border payment times to minutes, will ensure real-time settlement of cross-border payments between signatory gpi banks in the region.</p>
<p>Phase 2 will effectively extend the SWIFT gpi rails into existing real-time payment systems within each recipient country, thus ensuring that “inwards and onwards” payments can be settled in real-time in each of the four markets, irrespective of whether the final beneficiaries hold accounts at banks that are connected to SWIFT or that are using gpi.</p>
<p>A third phase would look to link domestic real-time payment systems via <a href=""https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/global-financial-messaging/payments-cash-management/swift-gpi"" target=""_blank"">SWIFT gpi</a> to facilitate full cross-border real-time payments between their respective customers. This aims to enable both sending and receiving account holders to benefit from a full real-time payments experience – again independently of whether they hold accounts at banks that are connected to SWIFT or using gpi.</p>
<p>Eddie Haddad, Managing Director of SWIFT Asia Pacific said: “With the widespread adoption of domestic real-time payments systems in the region, a cross-border real-time service is both a natural extension for SWIFT gpi in Asia Pacific and a real game-changer for bank customers. SWIFT is uniquely positioned to help our customers leverage their existing investments in infrastructure, to standardise connectivity across multiple markets and to drive efficiencies in support of cross-border trade, facilitating further integration in the ASEAN region.”</p>

<p><cite>Eddie Haddad, Managing Director of SWIFT Asia Pacific</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the initial workshops, SWIFT and participating gpi member banks have begun work on defining a common cross-border real-time scheme that banks can review and test. The design of the new service will build on existing SWIFT gpi service rules to help resolve additional business process frictions in the payments chain. SWIFT has also commenced discussions with the New Payments Platform (NPP) in Australia to enable SWIFT gpi payments to be processed onwards through their newly launched domestic real-time payments system. SWIFT has helped to design, build and deliver the NPP, and is playing a key role in operating the infrastructure for the NPP.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, gpi already accounts for nearly 10% of SWIFT cross-border payment traffic, and is enabling more than a hundred billion dollars to be transferred across the world rapidly and securely every day. More than 160 banks, including 48 out of the 50 top banks on SWIFT, have signed up to the service, sending hundreds of thousands of payments daily across 350 country corridors – including major corridors such as USA-China, where gpi already accounts for more than 30% of payment traffic.</p>
<p>“SWIFT gpi already reduces cross-border payment times to minutes, even seconds and indeed nearly 50% of gpi payments are already being completed in less than 30 minutes”, said Haddad. “This new scheme will both further speed up those payments, and extend the reach of the gpi capability far deeper into domestic markets, driving radical change in the cross-border payments market across the region. We look forward to seeing this work in practice and to more countries, and banks joining the new service.”</p>
<h5>Below are some comments from participating banks:</h5>
<p>“It is a natural extension of the SWIFT gpi proposition that we look to connect real-time payment infrastructures – such as the NPP in Australia – with similar platforms in other markets. By exploring how to connect with other infrastructures, we will be able to deliver faster cross-border payments to our customers in close to real-time, regardless of time zones and the constraints of daily cut-off times” – Mark Evans, Managing Director of Transaction Banking, ANZ</p>
<p>“Bangkok Bank is excited to explore cross-border real-time payments with SWIFT, which we believe will deepen connectivity across the global payments landscape, in turn providing us with increased speed and transparency in cross-border payments. The initiative will help deliver a more efficient and predictable payments experience with direct benefit to our clients” – Pongbhoka Buddhi-Baedya, Head of Global Payment Services, Bangkok Bank</p>
<p>“CBA is one of the largest users of SWIFT’s gpi and one of the first major banks in Australia to go live on NPP.  The take-up of our NPP solution by our customers has been exceptionally strong and we are excited about the possibilities that combining the two can create” – Michael Eidel, Executive General Manager, Cash-flow and Transaction Services, Commonwealth Bank</p>
<p>“DBS is proud to be amongst the first Asian banks to go live with SWIFT gpi, an industry initiative. SWIFT gpi enables corporate customers to track their cross-border payments end-to-end on a real-time basis and have clear information on funds being credited to recipients’ accounts. The on-demand tracking capability has transformed corporate customers’ experience with cross-border payments, strengthened the financial supply chain relationship between buyer and seller, and also reduced customer service requests received at the bank” – Navinder Duggal, Group Head of Cash Product Management, DBS</p>
<p>“Taking advantage of the new cross-border real-time payments service, ICBC believes that the efficiency of cross-border payments will increase significantly and the connectivity across markets in Asia Pacific region will be highly enhanced. ICBC will integrate inner resources to push the R&amp;D process of this service and explore the application among its overseas branches” – Peng Hua, Deputy General Manager, Operation Management Department, ICBC</p>
<p>“Making real-time transaction for cross-border remittance will become a norm in near future. SWIFT gpi has been extending to many valid use cases that enhance the opportunity to make cross-border payments less complicated for all parties” – Silawat Santivisat, Executive Vice President, Corporate Product and Service Division, Kasikornbank</p>
<p>“We are continually looking for opportunities to deliver better customer experiences, and key to this is collaborating with like-minded organisations and leveraging API technology. Enabling real-time delivery of cross-border payments will provide significant benefits to our customers” – Paul Franklin, General Manager, Payments, Customer Products &amp; Services, National Australia Bank Limited</p>

<p>These transactions mark an important step in establishing Batavia as an open ecosystem that is built on the IBM Blockchain Platform. It has the potential to revolutionize the client experience by providing a digital and automated way of arranging, securing and financing international trade transactions. The pilot transactions were conducted with a variety of transportation modes, geographies and trading parties of various sizes, highlighting Batavia’s ability to scale and manage diverse transaction types.</p>
<p>In covering the end-to-end process of a trade, Batavia encompasses both the closing of trade agreements and the execution of smart payments, which can be automatically triggered by specified events in the supply chain and recorded in the blockchain. The platform is able to integrate track and trace and risk management tools, which can be tied to key events in the supply chains and signals from IoT devices, agreed upon between buyer and seller. These and many other Batavia features help to establish the trade finance platform as a solid foundation for a future trade finance ecosystem.</p>
<p>Alexander Dietlmeier, Head of Group Treasury at AUDI AG: “Blockchain is an important future technology for Audi. In cooperation with Commerzbank, we have processed a worldwide, blockchain-based commercial transaction through the Batavia platform for the first time – efficiently, safely and transparently. This achievement has demonstrated to us once again the great potential this innovative application holds. We have gained important experience that will enable us to continuously develop our capabilities in this field, and we will be testing this technology for other use cases in our distribution process.”</p>
<p>“It is very important to involve our corporate clients as early as possible in our research and development activities regarding the digitalisation of trade finance. I am very grateful to Audi for their cooperation and their support for our project. Our joint successful live transaction gives an idea of the potential of our platform. The trade data and the smart payment automatically triggered by shipment data build an important basis for risk management and financing tools adding value to every supply chain”, said Niko Giesbert, Divisional Board Member, Fixed Income, Currencies &amp; Commodities and Trade Finance &amp; Cash Management, Commerzbank AG.</p>
<p>Building on the successful development of a minimum viable product and the first pilot transactions with clients, the Batavia project is looking to enter a new phase focused on the building out of a production-ready solution. This may include joining forces with fintechs, financial institutions or other innovation leaders in the market.</p>

<p>SMEs in the supply chains of developing countries must often wait long periods (typically 30-90 days) to receive payment for delivered products. To finance this working capital gap and keep the business going while awaiting payment, suppliers often need to provide collateral to borrow short-term funds from their local bank. Many struggle to do so, meaning that their business growth and production levels are constrained.</p>
<p>The partnership between CDC and Standard Chartered will provide a financing ‘bridge’ that gives suppliers the opportunity to get paid early while enabling buyers in a supply chain to maximize their working capital. This improves cash flow for both buyers and suppliers, while boosting transparency and cutting risk across the supply chain. This partnership is a unique example of how blended finance helps boost international trade as an engine for inclusive economic growth and is central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</p>
<p>The agreement, which is a 50:50 risk-sharing facility, is expected to disburse at least US$150m to suppliers over three years. Under the memorandum, the two institutions will bear the risks of local anchor buyers involved in supporting their supplier base. Buyers will typically be Standard Chartered clients, while the suppliers who will benefit most from early payment will be small companies in national and regional supply chains.</p>
<p>Secretary of State for International Development, Penny Mordaunt MP said: “The global financial &amp; commodity crisis sharply reduced the availability of trade finance and SME finance in many developing economies. Since then, CDC and Standard Chartered have been working to promote innovative risk-sharing and trade finance arrangements that maintain and expand financing lines and promote trade and investment in these economies.</p>

<p>“International payments are executed faster, more securely, and with more transparency. This significantly eases the burden on company finance departments in particular.” This was the interim assessment of Michael Spiegel, Head of Cash Management at Deutsche Bank. For the first time, clients can obtain real-time information on the status of their payments.</p>
<p>Since November 2017, Deutsche Bank has been using “SWIFT gpi Service” for international payments, for example from Germany and the USA. Deutsche Bank currently settles around ten percent of these transactions worldwide.</p>
<p>Current data highlights the benefits for the bank’s clients: Deutsche Bank executes some 90 percent of all gpi payments in less than 24 hours and nearly half of all payments in under 30 minutes, for example US dollar payments from Shanghai to Sydney. Some payments are even executed in less than one minute, eg USD transfers from the US to the UK or Germany.</p>

<p>Capital Connections helps SMEs to access alternative sources of capital after being unable to secure traditional financial backing. Business customers are signposted to the panel of innovative sources of finance including equity crowdfunding, marketplace lenders and now invoice financing.</p>
<p>MarketInvoice helps businesses get paid faster by unlocking cash tied up in unpaid invoices. Businesses can choose to fund specific invoices or their whole ledger, based on funding needs. The range of invoice finance solutions help to improve cash flow, quickly and easily. It’s a simple way to get paid upfront, without having to wait out lengthy payment terms.</p>
<p>Last month, MarketInvoice reached the milestone of funding £2bn worth of invoices and business loans to UK companies. Launched in 2011, the company has provided business finance solutions to thousands of businesses across the UK who employ more than 19,000 people. During this time over 90,000 invoices have been funded to 93 countries. In 2017, MarketInvoice almost doubled the average amount advanced to UK businesses – from £606,000 in 2016 to £1.14m.</p>
<p>Anil Stocker, CEO and Co-founder of MarketInvoice commented: “Featuring on this panel will broaden our reach and help even more businesses achieve their goals. Companies across the UK are choosing to diversify funding sources with more than £4b advanced through alternative finance firms. Furthermore, the invoice finance [and asset-based lending] sector is providing more finance to UK businesses than ever before. Funding volumes are up 5% year on year and stand at just over £23b. This is the highest figure ever.”</p>
<p>“As the first invoice finance provider on the panel, we will be able to showcase how invoice finance can help businesses of all sizes and work with them to find the right solution. Enhancing access to borrowing is essential for jobs and economic growth.”</p>
<p>Alison Rose, CEO of Commercial and Private Banking at Natwest, said: “We’re excited to welcome our first invoice finance provider to Capital Connections. MarketInvoice has serviced a large number and wide variety of businesses. Their robust service, quick and easy to use solutions, provide another distinct choice for the many innovative businesses in the UK. As the biggest supporter of British business, we understand that traditional funding routes are not always the best option for fast growing start-ups. Through Capital Connections we’re able to signpost a broad choice of funding options through its impressive range of alternative lenders.”</p>
<p>MarketInvoice is the ninth alternative finance provider to join Capital Connections, alongside Funding Circle, Assetz Capital, Start Up Loans, Seedrs, Together, iwoca, Esme Loans<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> and NatWest Social &amp; Community Capital<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>.

<p>Two new HSBC teams in Guangdong and Hong Kong will collaborate closely as they deliver tailored advice and services for technology firms in the Greater Bay Area.</p>
<p>HSBC China’s first Innovation and Technology Team, set up under the Commercial Banking business in Guangdong province, will mainly focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in “New Economy” industries such as e-commerce and advanced manufacturing. The number of technology customers served by HSBC’s Commercial Banking business in Guangdong’s Pearl River Delta has more than doubled over the past three years.</p>
<p>Neo Wang, Head of Commercial Banking for Guangdong at HSBC, said: “The Pearl River Delta, led by Shenzhen, is emerging as China’s ‘Silicon Delta’. With our universal banking platform and strong cross-border capabilities, HSBC has become the banking partner for many leading technology companies in the region. This dedicated team serving SMEs will allow us to better support the innovation ecosystem by providing customised services and products to local start-ups and advanced manufacturing companies, generating new momentum for the Bank’s business growth in the region.”</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, HSBC’s new Innovation Business and Growth Team is dedicated to helping local technology start-ups grow and expand beyond Hong Kong. HSBC is committed to supporting local entrepreneurs and innovative companies: over 70% of new business account openings in Hong Kong are for start-ups that have been incorporated for less than one year. Last December, the Bank launched Innotech Business Instalment Loans, the first product of its kind in Hong Kong, which provides fast and simple financing solutions to businesses to embracing digital technology.</p>
<p>Terence Chiu, Head of Commercial Banking for Hong Kong at HSBC, said: “The Greater Bay Area initiative is a key catalyst for innovation as well as cross-border collaboration in the region. Establishing the Hong Kong- Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park and Guangzhou-Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Corridor will support the growth of the technology sector in Hong Kong and the region as a whole. We have set up these new teams to help our customers capture opportunities from China’s growing leadership in innovation.”</p>
<p>Innovation and technology are policy priorities for the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments. The latest official data shows Guangdong is now home to 33,000 hi-tech companies – more than any other Chinese province. This is five times the number it had five years ago. In Hong Kong, there are more than 650 start-ups and technology companies, and about 13,000 professionals and R&amp;D practitioners in the Hong Kong Science Park.</p>
<p>The Bank also held innovation and technology summits in Shenzhen and Silicon Valley in 2017, bringing together businesses and investors so they can connect and exchange ideas, as well as pick up best practices from industry leaders based in the major tech hubs of China and the US. In Hong Kong, HSBC’s annual Digital Summit has become an important annual event for businesses seeking to learn more about how digital can help them grow.</p>

<p>Ahead of the final implementation date of the new rules in January 2019, BlackRock Global Cash Management actively seeks to address the required changes by creating a product range that best leverages the breadth of product offering provided for by the new rules. The final regulatory text of the EU Money Market Regulation importantly preserves Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) for public debt MMFs, while introducing a new type of fund, the Low-Volatility NAV (LVNAV) MMF.</p>
<p>LVNAV is intended to replicate the utility of CNAV MMFs, with greater sensitivity to market pricing, and additional safeguards and controls built into the fund structure. BlackRock plans to migrate the current range of CNAV Prime Institutional Liquidity MMFs to this new LVNAV structure starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, and will also introduce a new series of funds as a result of the regulation.</p>
<p>“We are committed to bringing the best offering forward for our clients and aim to set the standard for the industry. We believe an early transition to the new regulation will allow for a more seamless conversion and reduced risk of complications at year-end, when liquidity pressures may increase”, Peter Loehnert, Head of BlackRock’s International Cash Management Business, commented. “We will continue to work with our clients and partners to understand their needs, and incorporate these requirements as the final details fall into place.”</p>
<p>Managing a $449.9 billion platform on behalf of its clients, throughout its history BlackRock Global Cash Management has consistently demonstrated the ability to navigate transformational changes for the industry. BlackRock has a proven record of implementing change in the cash management sector having completed two transactions, with both BofA Global Capital Management and Cachematrix, in the last two years all while successfully implementing the requirements of US Money Market Fund Reform.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Today, Saxo Bank launches SaxoTraderPRO, a new trading platform for active traders and institutional clients offering a unique combination of a feature rich trading platform and ease of use.</p>
<p>The new platform is an advanced multi-screen trading platform offering a fully customizable workspace for both Windows and Mac with no monthly fees.</p>
<p>SaxoTraderPRO has its foundation in Saxo Bank’s unparalleled global capital markets access. As a leading facilitator in global capital markets, Saxo Bank connects private and institutional clients with more than 100 global liquidity providers and exchanges to offer access to more than 35,000 financial instruments across asset classes. Clients have access to ETFs, Stocks, Bonds, CFDs, Forex, Futures and Options that are cross margined from a single account.</p>
<p>Catering to active traders and institutional clients, SaxoTraderPRO is set to replace the current SaxoTrader platform, while SaxoTraderGO continues to cater to a wider range of retail traders and investors.</p>
<p>Kim Fournais, Founder and CEO, said: “We were a Fintech before the term was created and the core of Saxo Bank has always been our trading technology and trading platforms. We strive to democratize trading and investment, essentially providing traders and investors with the same professional tools and market access as fund managers and large financial institutions.</p>
<p>“I am proud that we yet again deliver on our vision with the launch of SaxoTraderPRO. Based on our scalable business model and efficient technology, SaxoTraderPRO offers intuitive and free access to tools and functionality that has previously been the preserve of a select few and carrying hefty fees.”</p>
<p>Christian Hammer, Head of Platforms, said:“We know that our active traders and institutional clients demand unparalleled access to global capital markets combined with a high level of control through advanced trading tools, fast and reliable execution and extensive options for customizations to fit their individual trading needs.</p>
<p>“To ensure exactly that, we have worked with the latest front-end technologies such as HTML5/JS/REACT which connect to a single REST API that clients can also access directly to develop their own bespoke functionality for trading, risk monitoring or reporting purposes.</p>
<p>“We have placed our clients at the center of the development process with constant feedback, early prototyping and A/B testing with in-lab usability studies. A lot of unique features have been developed based on specific feedback from our beta users like the margin break down module to help our clients manage their risk.</p>
<p>“I am very proud of the result of our efforts and SaxoTraderPRO is an obvious first choice for active traders and institutional clients looking for both a feature rich trading platform and user friendly interface with no monthly license fees.”</p>
<p>SaxoTraderPRO will be launched across Saxo Bank’s markets in the coming months starting with the UK and Denmark and then APAC, with remaining countries to follow later in April and during May.</p>

<p>The Verify-Your-Supplier feature represents a targeted approach to payment fraud, including Payment Diversion schemes, by providing companies and suppliers with an independent verification tool that enables them to store, maintain and verify account master data. This represents a “security-in-numbers” approach to curtailing fraud with the aim of engaging as many suppliers as possible and offering users a complete database that helps them cover all bases.</p>
<p>“Payment fraud is an issue that concerns all companies worldwide. And with everyone exposed, it seems only logical that we join forces in tackling it,” explains Miroslav Sokolovic, Senior Manager GTB Services at BELLIN. “The more comprehensive the accurate data directory, the easier it gets to weed out the fraudsters.” The Verify-Your-Supplier feature complements BELLIN’s GTB Hub Global Transaction Banking app that also features a comprehensive Find-Your-Bank search function, a Rate-Your-Bank peer review feature and a Follow-Your-Bank change notification feature, with a groundbreaking Track-Your-Payment function to be added soon. GTB Hub is available for both iOS and Android and can be downloaded in the App Store and Play Store.</p>

<p>The new regulations require providers to make a number of changes to their funds in terms of structure, composition, valuation, liquidity requirements and information reporting.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, MMFs will be split into two types, with three structural options available to investors. The new regulations will also preserve Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) for government funds and will create a new type of fund — Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV).</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be leading the industry in announcing our timeline for implementing these changes. In providing our clients complete optionality under the re-categorisation required by the new regulations, we’re well positioned to continue to offer clients the benefits of short-term liquidity investing with a comprehensive range of products,” said Jim Fuell, Head of Global Liquidity Sales, International at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p>
<p>“We are committed to ensuring that our clients experience a smooth process as we transition to meet the new rules and that they have plenty of time to review their investment options,” said Kerrie Mitchener-Nissen, Head of Product Development, International, for the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Global Liquidity business.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The invisible payment revolution has reached Ciudad BBVA. More than 1,000 users can now order a coffee, pick it up without waiting in line and pay for it without their wallets. They do so thanks to an app that also allows you to reserve a table, eat and leave without even asking for the bill. Customers just need to waive to the waiter, who will verify their reservation in the system so that the bill is automatically registered in their account. If you want, you’ll always be able to see the content and amount on your account during the meal. When you finish, you can leave whenever you want without any type of additional interaction being necessary (neither with the app, nor the waiter).</p>
<p>The new payment system is part of BBVA’s determination to lead the development of invisible or frictionless payments in order to transform customers’ purchase experience in stores. This new trend allows the payment part of the purchase process to “disappear” or to be made practically non-existent for the user. The app was designed along with <a href=""https://es.sodexo.com/home.html"" target=""_blank"">Sodexo Iberia</a>, the Group’s restaurant partner. It forms part of a pioneer project in the world to first bring these new experiences to the restaurant and cafeteria sectors, and later to other stores. The next step in developing the project will be the integration of <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/memory-of-a-goldfish-no-problem-if-the-password-is-you/"" target=""_blank"">biometric technologies</a>, which will give a new meaning to the expression “face value”.</p>
<p>“With this project, we’re eliminating the friction points for customers when they make a purchase in a store. They avoid lines, and have a more digital experience with better information,” BBVA’s Head of Global Payments <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-ba%C3%B1%C3%B3n-154174"" target=""_blank"">Ignacio Bañón</a>, said.</p>
<p>The app not only automates payments, but it allows you to make reservations from a smartphone, reducing the time you wait at restaurants. In this way, customers can show up, sit at their reserved table, eat and leave directly without having to ask for the bill or manually pay. Thanks to this system, users now save between 7 and 10 minutes, and restaurants have recorded increased billing and productivity. “The system benefits both the customer, who doesn’t require as much service, and the restaurant, which no longer has to manually charge the customer,” adds BBVA’s Bañón.</p>
<p>To automate payments, the user just needs to first register in the app and enter their credit card details. The application also offers the possibility to share the payment with other users by sending a message directly from the app.</p>
<h3>Payment with zero clicks</h3>
<p>The application also optimizes the activity of Sodexo cafeterias at BBVA headquarters, where customers are served quicker. In these establishments, the system allows users to select the specific products they want to consume so that they are ready to be picked up without waiting in line. In addition, the system allows scheduling favorite orders that can be automatically ordered and paid by just opening the app.</p>
<p>“We call it the ‘zero click’ payment, the customer just has to open the app and their favorite order will already be set, which they can pick up and take away without even having to take out their cell phone again,” adds Bañón, Once the customer picks it up, their card is automatically charged. It is the fastest solution on the market, because the order is made in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>BBVA is also implementing a customer loyalty solution within the app, which accesses offers and promotions. In one month of use, the application has been downloaded by more than 1,000 employees, around 15% of all those who work at BBVA’s headquarters in Madrid. In addition, 10% of the orders made on Expresso, one of Ciudad BBVA’s most frequented coffe shops, are now made via the app. As for the establishment, the use of this new system has increased the average total expense by 50%.</p>
<h3>Paying ‘face value’: the next step</h3>
<p>In addition to cafeterias and restaurants, a common feature in work centers like Ciudad BBVA are the self-service restaurants, where users pick up products themselves and take them to the table on trays.</p>
<p>To improve the experience in this format, BBVA is already working on developing a facial recognition system to allow users to pick up their food and sit down directly, without needing to make a manual payment, or for anyone to check the user’s identity. The system, which is already being piloted, recognizes the user’s face through cameras equipped with <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/what-is-artificial-intelligence/"" target=""_blank"">artificial intelligence</a>, and directly charges the card associated with their profile.</p>
<p>The tests are being carried out in BBVA’s Central restaurant, a establishment that each day hosts an average of 2,000 people within a period of just two hours and offers more than 15 different menus. The project is being carried out with technology from <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/veridas-new-biometrics-company-bbva-das-nano/"" target=""_blank"">Veridas</a>, the JV biometrics firm that BBVA created in 2017 along with <a href=""http://www.das-nano.com/"" target=""_blank"">Das Nano</a>. The firm specializes in developing software to digitally verify and authenticate one’s personal identity through facial, voice, image, document or fingerprint recognition. In this case, the system uses <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/machine-learning-intelligence-learns/"" target=""_blank"">machine learning</a> algorithms through which the machines ‘learn’ to identify both the faces of users and products on the tray in order to make the correct charge on their card.</p>
<p>Making payments is an area under drastic transformation, with different trends now being combined in an ever changing competitive arena. “Our aspiration is to create new payment experiences that help people and stores to improve their lives and businesses, something that forms part of our strategy to turn digital banking into an aide for customers,” explains Bañón. In fact, the Group is working to make invisible payments possible through pilot projects with large firms in different sectors: restaurants, cars, food and fashion.</p>
<p>With around 7,000 employees, and more than six points of sale in different formats (restaurants, cafeterias, etc.), <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/featured/ciudad-bbva/"" target=""_blank"">Ciudad BBVA</a> represents an ideal test platform for exploring new forms of payment. “We are very happy to be working with BBVA on this innovative project. For Sodexo, a company dedicated to improving quality of life through our services, it’s enormously interesting to have access to payment solutions that contribute to optimising customers’ experience,” said Sodexo Iberia president, Carina Cabezas.</p>

<p>“Currencycloud has always been committed to building technology that enables businesses to send funds quickly and securely with a click of a mouse. Providing the second half of that equation — receivables — is the natural next step,” said Todd Latham, CMO and Head of Product. “This launch is a revolution in collections and provides the infrastructure needed to fast track B2B innovation, allowing companies to go global while acting local. Businesses can now focus on what is important — growing, scaling and staying competitive.”</p>
<p>In today’s economy, companies must engage in global commerce to compete, creating a complex web of transactions. While information sharing is fast and seamless, the high cost and slow pace of global payments is prohibitive to business growth. According to an <a href=""https://atradius.us/reports/payment-practices-barometer-americas-2017.html"" target=""_blank"">Atradius</a> survey, nearly one-third of foreign business customers of companies in both North America and Europe named the “complexity of the payment procedure” as a major factor behind foreign payment delays.</p>
<p>Currencycloud’s Global Collections enables businesses with customers in the US or EU to pay or get paid as if they were a local business — without having a physical presence there. The new functionality allows businesses to generate international bank account numbers (IBANs) and Virtual Account Numbers (VANs) so their customers receive US dollars or Euro transfers without incurring fees.</p>
<p>“Using Currencycloud’s beta release of Global Collections reshaped the way we approach global payments by significantly reducing the time and expense traditionally associated with it,” said Neil Ambiker, CEO of B2B Pay, a payments company that provides a virtual bank account solution for non-resident companies. “It does so much more than streamline account receivables. It has empowered us to provide customers a frictionless experience, foster trust in our brand and most importantly, grow at an international level.”</p>
<p>Additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Faster Receivables:</h5>
<p>Same day receipt of funds allows businesses to get paid faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Lowered Costs:</h5>
<p>With access to Currencycloud’s competitive FX rates, companies are no longer at the mercy of the rates large banks provide. They can convert at wholesale rates and hold funds in 35 currencies, avoiding costly fees and markups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Easy Integration:</h5>
<p>Customers can easily build their own product on top of Currencycloud’s market-leading APIs or use its user interface. End users are not required to open a Currencycloud account, which removes friction from the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Global Collections will be rolled out in March. To learn more about Currencycloud, please visit <a href=""http://www.currencycloud.com"" target=""_blank"">www.currencycloud.com</a></p>

<p>The new API aims to provide corporate treasurers and finance directors with a greater degree of visibility over the FX market, helping them mitigate risk, reduce currency exposure and improve cash flow. The API will also be of value to product managers and application developers who require reliable forex data to power their web services, pricing engines, and digital products. Simple to use, extensive <a href=""http://developer.oanda.com/exchange-rates-api/"" target=""_blank"">API documentation</a> is available on OANDA’s website, including easy-to-follow instructions in order to ensure the seamless integration with ERP, TMS, billing software and more.</p>
<p>Vatsa Narasimha, President and Chief Executive Officer, OANDA Corporation, commented, “As an over-the-counter market, there is no central exchange for currency pricing, which can make it difficult to gauge accurate FX rates. However, because OANDA has been collecting FX data for more than 20 years, we are uniquely positioned to combine this knowledge with access to a full range of interbank liquidity, proprietary trading technology, and pricing algorithms in order to create an accurate market consensus across a wide range of FX instruments, including real-time foreign exchange rates. Trusted for accuracy and reliability, our rates are acknowledged by several tax authorities and governmental agencies around the world, and are widely considered to be the gold standard in exchange rate data.”</p>
<p>The new API is already proving to be of value to OANDA clients.

<p>With 34 participating banks each with their own node deployed in the SWIFT <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> sandbox, the initiative was one of the most extensive blockchain proofs of concept powered by Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 executed in the industry so far, both in terms of participant engagement and in terms of the scale of the infrastructure deployed.</p>
<p>With the PoC SWIFT set out to work with the technology in a “many-to-many” setting addressing a real business issue, and draw lessons for larger scale implementations of the technology in the bank-to-bank payment area. The PoC sought to assess whether <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a>, combined with SWIFT assets, would meet industry-level governance, security and data privacy requirements, whether <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> could bring concrete benefits over other architectures, and to check DLT’s current level of maturity to serve as a production-grade application within a mission-critical global infrastructure.</p>
<p>Based on the business and technical requirements validated by the participating banks, SWIFT developed a <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> solution through which Nostro Account owners and their servicers could share a private confidential ledger recording transactions related to their Nostro accounts. The solution leverages <a href=""http://www.iso20022.org/about_iso20022.page"" target=""_blank"">ISO 20022</a> standards<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> and <a href=""https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/global-financial-messaging/payments-cash-management/swift-gpi"" target=""_blank"">gpi</a> innovations<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> – including the unique end-to-end transaction reference (UETR) – and integrates intraday liquidity standards.</p>
<p>The PoC showed that <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> could deliver the business functionalities and data richness required to support automated real-time liquidity monitoring and reconciliation. It enabled real-time event handling, transaction status updates, full audit trails, visibility of expected and available balances, real-time simplified account entries confirmation, the identification of pending entries and potential related issues, and generated the data required to support regulatory reporting.</p>
<p>The PoC also demonstrated the significant progress <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> has made with regards to data confidentiality, governance, security, and identification frameworks, evidencing that the emergent technology, combined with SWIFT assets, provides the necessary foundation for financial multi-bank applications.</p>
<p>“The PoC went extremely well, proving the fantastic progress that has been made with <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> and the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 in particular”, said Damien Vanderveken, Head of Research and Development at SWIFT. “The <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> sandbox enabled us to control access, to define and enforce user privileges, to physically segregate confidential data and store it only with the relevant parties while supporting a strong identity framework by linking all participants to their BIC, and having all keys signed by a SWIFT certification authority”.</p>
<p>While successfully meeting all the business requirements set out, the PoC evidenced the considerable pre-requisites for industry adoption of such a solution – for instance, all account servicers would first need to migrate from batch to real-time liquidity reporting and processing, and back office applications would need to be upgraded to feed the platform with real-time updates.</p>
<p>“Although the PoC demonstrated <a href=""https://www.swift.com/your-needs/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt"" target=""_blank"">DLT</a> could improve Nostro liquidity management and reconciliation processes, it also revealed that the pre-requisites will have to be met before banks can enjoy the full benefits of switching to a DLT process”, added Vanderveken.</p>
<p>To facilitate improvements in the Nostro process, SWIFT will continue helping its community migrate towards real-time liquidity reporting and processing through <a href=""https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/global-financial-messaging/payments-cash-management/swift-gpi"" target=""_blank"">SWIFT gpi</a>, and establish a roll-out plan for the community-wide adoption of the UETR. Similarly, as the PoC underscored, the ISO 20022 data model is a pre-requisite to deliver the required structure and data richness to support real-time liquidity monitoring and reconciliation. SWIFT will also initiate an ISO 20022 consultation with its community to assess a timeline and a migration approach towards ISO 20022 as a potential means to reduce integration costs, and will continue to actively promote the re-use of ISO 20022 in the DLT context.</p>
<p>The PoC also showed that further progress is needed on the DLT technology itself before it will be ready to support production-grade applications in large-scale, mission-critical global infrastructures. For example, while 528 channels were required in the PoC to ensure Nostro accounts would only be stored on the nodes of their account servicers and owners, to productise the solution, more than 100,000 channels would need to be established and maintained, covering all existing Nostro relationships, presenting significant operational challenges.</p>
<p>“It is a strategic priority for SWIFT to work with new technologies like DLT and incorporate them into key solutions like <a href=""https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/global-financial-messaging/payments-cash-management/swift-gpi"" target=""_blank"">gpi</a>”, said Stephen Gilderdale, Chief Platform Officer, SWIFT. “We are already working on new PoCs and will continue our R&amp;D efforts to ensure that SWIFT customers will be able to leverage their existing SWIFT infrastructure and connectivity to benefit from blockchain services, whether offered by SWIFT or by third parties, on a secure and trusted platform.”</p>

<p>“We are seeing an uninterrupted upward trend in green bonds and expect the strong growth in issuance activity to continue. Through the increasing diversity of issuers, the market is maturing and has gained a broader foundation”, said Antonio Keglevich, Head of Green Bond Origination at UniCredit.</p>
<p>“At the same time, investors are increasingly seeking out sustainable assets. The fact that more than one in four dollars worldwide is now being invested on the basis of sustainability criteria is also adding impetus to the market”.</p>
<p>With regard to issuer classes, private banks as well as other private sector companies have developed into the most important market participants, with each group accounting for around a quarter of all green bond issuance. In October 2017, for example, the German energy company Innogy issued the first German benchmark green bond exceeding €850m. One of the biggest German green bonds in 2018 – worth €275m – was also issued by a private sector company: German wind turbine manufacturer Nordex. Now more than ever, companies are striving to address climate change through climate-friendly production methods, clean energy production and the promotion of biodiversity. This generally requires investments and, increasingly, ever-larger amounts of private capital.</p>
<p>By issuing a green bond, companies not only signal their commitment to green issues and ecology by financing projects with clear environmental benefits; “It is also evident that, by issuing green bonds, companies diversify their investor base, which can lead to higher demand. Green bonds are often more heavily oversubscribed than conventional placements. This may in turn be reflected in lower new issuance premiums for a company”, explains Keglevich.</p>
<p>Sovereign issues in the green bond segment are providing an avid boost to the market. After the first-ever issue of a sovereign green bond by Poland in 2016, followed the next year by France, sovereign issuers have continued to play an increasing role in the green bond market bonds in the current year, with new bonds placed by Poland and Belgium in February 2018.</p>

<h3>A new programme focusing on the suppliers most exposed to risks</h3>
<p>Since 2012, Schneider Electric has been assessing its most strategic suppliers with the help of EcoVadis, a specialized company in the Responsible sourcing space. This programme evaluates Suppliers practices against ISO 26000 standard on corporate social responsibility. To reinforce its commitment to the United Nations SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and guiding principles on human rights, as well as its own <a href=""https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/Human_Rights_Policy/"" target=""_blank"">human rights policy</a>, Schneider Electric now introduces a new programme. This new programme first enables to confirm suppliers that are most likely exposed to risks, due to their geographic situation and type of activity. Reflecting the importance of this programme, the number of suppliers having received an on-site audit will be introduced as a new indicator in the <a href=""https://www.schneider-electric.com/fr/about-us/sustainability/sustainable-performance/barometer.jsp"" target=""_blank"">2018-2020 Planet &amp; Society barometer</a>, which measures the Group’s sustainability performance. This new indicator comes with an ambitious objective of on-site auditing 300 higher-risks sites over the next three years (in addition to remote assessments such as through EcoVadis, and to Suppliers’ site due-diligence and continuous improvement interactions with Schneider Electric specialized teams).</p>
<h3>Using RBA methods and tools to reach an ambitious objective</h3>
<p>To reach this objective, Schneider Electric will use RBA methods and tools. The alliance has excellent credibility and its standards are recognized by organizations highly committed to Corporate Responsibility, including NGOs and companies. Schneider Electric teams will be able to use the Verisk Maplecroft mapping tool, the RBA self-assessment questionnaire and the RBA auditing protocol. In this way, 300 suppliers will be identified for an on-site audit. The Schneider Electric Procurement professionals, internal and external auditors leading the deployment of this programme will be trained specifically to carry out these audits. Demonstrating the company’s commitment to supply chain accountability, this new programme will be supervised by Gilles Vermot Desroches, Sustainability Senior Vice-president; DK Singh, Chief Procurement Officer, Xavier Houot, Senior Vice President Group Environment, Safety and Real Estate.</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank is the first international bank to have this type of agreement in place. As part of this MoU, Deutsche Bank and Sinosure will collaborate to identify new opportunities, streamline information flow and approval processes, provide best effort pricing and collaborate on risk management. The Sinosure guarantee can significantly improve the credit worthiness of a transaction and as a result, reduce dramatically the overall financing cost for companies.</p>
<p>China Export &amp; Credit Insurance Corporation, also known as Sinosure, is a state-funded policy-oriented insurance company. Through its insurance services, the company supports foreign trade and investment, thereby helping to promote economic growth, employment and the equilibrium of international payments.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank signed a general MoU with Sinosure in 2009 to start business cooperation and has since partnered with them on both short-term and mid to long-term financing transactions. For the guarantee business, Deutsche Bank has closed the most number of deals of all international banks to date with total financing amount reaching USD1bn.</p>
<p>Evert-Jan Zondag, APAC Head of Structured and Export Trade Finance at Deutsche Bank, said: “We are delighted to expand our cooperation with Sinosure. This marks another important milestone in our relationship, and will unlock future business potential.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank’s teams of experts work closely with Export Credit Agencies (ECAs). The advantages of an ECA covered transaction include availability of funding in situations where stand-alone financing would not be feasible; relative long repayment periods, including a grace period; security of payments for suppliers; significant country risk mitigation; and standardised documentation processes.</p>

<p>During the transaction, Credit Suisse and ING agreed to transfer legal ownership of Dutch and German government securities on the platform using HQLA<sup>X</sup> Digital Collateral Records (DCRs) while the underlying securities remained static within unique DCR-linked custody accounts held by Credit Suisse and ING at Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd.</p>
<p>The use of DCRs to effect transfers of securities can ultimately help enhance regulatory transparency, mitigate systemic risk, reduce operational risk, and help financial institutions manage capital more efficiently. This new milestone brings the HQLA<sup>X</sup> collateral lending application on Corda, known as a CorDapp, one step closer to production.</p>
<p>In a traditional settlement of a securities lending transaction, individual underlying securities are transferred between accounts. However, the intent of the operating model for the HQLA<sup>X</sup> collateral lending application is to achieve a legal title transfer of baskets of securities through the transfer of ownership of the unique DCR-linked accounts themselves. Clifford Chance were integral in helping to develop the legal architecture for transferring ownership of securities in this way using R3’s Corda blockchain platform.</p>
<p>Romain Dumas, Head of Rates Repo and Collateral Optimization at Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, said, “The success of this first live transaction speaks to the potential for blockchain technology to help improve collateral fluidity by creating a more efficient, transparent, and cost effective marketplace for liquidity transfers.”</p>
<p>Paolo Muzzarelli, Head of Transaction Banking Products within Financial Institutions at Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd., commented, “As a provider of Transaction Banking services, it is of paramount importance to engage in technological change to understand and anticipate the future needs of our sophisticated client base.”</p>
<p>Ivar Wiersma, Head of Wholesale Banking innovation at ING, commented, “This transaction proves the progress we are making towards deploying Distributed Ledger Technology for the benefit of our clients and society by making the financial industry more efficient and more resilient. With this strong group of participants, together with ING’s technical contribution, I’m confident about the path to production of the HQLA<sup>X</sup>platform.”</p>
<p>Guido Stroemer, CEO of HQLA<sup>X</sup>, commented, “HQLA<sup>X</sup> is very fortunate to have the strong support of the banks active in our platform design and build. In particular, I would like to thank Credit Suisse and ING for their enthusiastic participation in this meaningful pilot transaction, which is a significant step towards helping market participants exchange collateral more efficiently using the HQLA<sup>X</sup> platform.”</p>
<p>David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, commented, “Collateral lending is a great example of a process that can be revolutionised by blockchain technology, and this live trade between two major global banks marks a significant milestone for the market. We look forward to continuing our work with HQLA<sup>X</sup> and the banks to establish Corda as the de facto platform for high quality liquid asset management.”</p>
<p>Jeremy Walter, Partner, and Peter Chapman, Fintech Co-Lead, at Clifford Chance commented, “We have been delighted to help develop the HQLA<sup>X</sup> collateral lending solution and support the continued technological evolution of the securities lending market.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Since launching in September 2017, with BNP, Commerzbank and ING as core banks, the initiative has attracted significant interest from the global banking community, with additional banks including Standard Chartered, DNB, and OP Financial Group joining in recent months.</p>
<p>The Marco Polo initiative has developed a solution for post-shipment trade financing powered by the TiX platform from TradeIX and R3 Corda blockchain technology. It enables end-to-end, real-time, seamless connectivity between trade participants, eliminating the data silos which prevent free flow of information causing inefficiencies and discrepancies.</p>
<p>Initially the solution is focused on three distinct areas of trade finance: risk mitigation by provision of payment commitments based on the matching of trade data, payables finance, and receivables finance. It will be delivered via TradeIX’s TIX Platform, an open platform providing applications, technology tools and core infrastructure for the trade finance ecosystem.</p>
<p>The collective ambition is to expand the initiative in 2018 to include additional banks and third party service providers, such as credit insurers, ERP and logistics providers, leveraging the collaborative nature of the platform to create a fully interoperable open-sourced trade finance network.</p>
<p>“We see the proof-of-concept as an important milestone in this project. The fact that more banks have joined also illustrates the interest in this project and in the potential of DLT in supply chain finance solutions.” commented Jacques Levet, Head of Transaction Banking EMEA BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>""We are one of the first three banks to successfully perform the proof-of-concept acceptance tests which is a major achievement for us. We are pleased with how far the development has come in such a short timespan. Together we have proved, that blockchain technology will make trade finance faster and more transparent for all participants,” said Nikolaus Giesbert, Divisional Board Member, Fixed Income, Currencies &amp; Commodities and Trade Finance &amp; Cash Management, Commerzbank AG.</p>
<p>“The tests ING ran as part of the proof-of-concept enabled us to see the value this solution could deliver in three separate areas of trade financing. The technology ran fast and smoothly and the positive results showed us we are on the right track and ready to take the next step by entering into a pilot,” said Ivar Wiersma, Head of Innovation ING Wholesale Banking.</p>

The proof of concept was a success and now we are ready to plan a pilot,” said Sylwia Lisowska, Head of Product and Distribution at DNB Factoring.</p>
<p>“The successful acceptance tests were a powerful evidence that financing of the trade can and will become an integral part of supply network processes.

<p>The most notable feature of this transaction is that the interest rate applied takes into consideration not only MAPFRE's credit rating but also the performance of the company's sustainability parameters. As a result, the interest rate will be lowered if improvements are detected in sustainability evaluations, and to this end, an independent consultant, in this case Vigeo Eiris, will publish an annual report that analyzes MAPFRE’s performance in environmental, social and governance issues.</p>
<p>This novation reduces the cost of the current loan, which has been extended to mature in 2023, with the option of two subsequent extensions for one year each.</p>
<p>The loan was negotiated with a group of banks, with Santander, BBVA, Bankinter, Sabadell and Bankia acting as bookrunners, Santander as agent and BBVA as sustainability agent.</p>
<p>MAPFRE reaffirms its commitment to sustainability in all areas of the organization and strengthens its position as a company that is committed to social responsibility, the environment and society in general, as well as to reducing its financing expenses and extending financing maturity, while ensuring more advantageous conditions, taking into consideration the performance of the financial markets.</p>

<p>Enquiries that require human employee participation are also processed using robot-based technology in the form of a cognitive virtual assistant. The robot analyses the conversation between the operator and the client and automatically provides the former with additional information to help assist the client.</p>
<p>The pilot project saw an increase of client service speed in specific areas by 50%. Now clients spend an average of 3.5 minutes on the phone to the corporate client contract centre.</p>
<p>“We use artificial intelligence to carry out a diverse range of tasks. One of these is reducing the time it takes to service our clients by increasing the quality and convenience of service through robotising the contact centre,” commented Senior Vice President and Head of Sberbank’s Corporate Business Block Anatoly Popov. “Sberbank’s goals include significantly reducing the average time of servicing, increasing the share of first call resolutions, and robotising the system for processing all simple client enquiries in the next two years.</p>
<p>Around 40% of enquiries made to Sberbank’s corporate client contact centre involve information requests. Every day the centre’s operators process around 20,000 calls. Around two million major, medium-sized and small businesses account for Sberbank’s corporate clients.</p>

<p>Because today’s capital markets are highly globalized and interconnected, a ripple in one country can unleash massive waves elsewhere in the world. Banks and other financial institutions must navigate myriad regulatory and cost pressures, accelerate provisioning, and make important decisions based on enormous volumes of data in real-time. These new requirements are stretching the capabilities of most on-premises systems and open up possibilities to harness the cloud for competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Specifically, the relationship between Openlink and FWD View aims to realize the full benefits of cloud-based trading applications for FX and derivatives, as well as trade risk, analytics and reporting. Openlink’s Findur platform, available as a cloud offering since 2017, helps clients trade smarter, minimize risk, and streamline business processes.</p>
<p>From accessing powerful computing capability on demand to delivering new products and services, financial institutions are increasingly turning to cloud-based solutions to flexibly scale their businesses, quickly adapt to market shifts, and provide higher value to customers.</p>
<p>“Openlink is an industry leader and standout provider of choice to work with our team,” said Daniel Higgins, executive director at FWD View. “Together, we will advance a clear point of view about the business imperatives of cloud computing, with complementary cloud offerings and services such as Findur on Openlink Cloud, which leading financial institutions can rely on to drive important business outcomes.”</p>
<p>“The FWD View team has deep expertise in the implementation and management of trading applications and is an ideal collaborator to tap the potential of Openlink Cloud for financial institutions,” said Tasja Botha, sales director for Openlink in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). “With FWD view, we share a vision for the cloud as an essential element of operational excellence for our capital markets clients in the EMEA region and around the world.”</p>

<p>Together, SAMA and Ripple have created a pilot program to provide support to KSA banks to use xCurrent, Ripple’s enterprise software solution that enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking.</p>
<p>The first of its kind to be launched by a central bank, the pilot program will allow participating KSA banks to use xCurrent for cross-border payment payments. SAMA will support KSA banks with program management and training. With xCurrent, KSA banks can process cross-border payments in seconds, with end-to-end visibility over the journey of the payment, at a low cost.</p>
<p>Dilip Rao, global head of infrastructure innovation, Ripple, said: “Central banks around the world are leaning into blockchain technology in recognition of how it can transform cross-border payments, resulting in lower barriers to trade and commerce for both corporates and consumers.” Rao added, “SAMA is leading the charge as the first central bank to provide resources to domestic banks that want to enable instant payments using Ripple’s innovative blockchain solution.”</p>

With a full range of digital and mobile enabled platforms, tools and analytics, TTS continues to lead the way in delivering innovative and tailored solutions to Citi’s clients. It offers a comprehensive suite of Treasury and Trade solutions, including Cash Management, Payments, Receivables, Liquidity Management and Investment services, Working Capital solutions, Commercial Card programs, and Trade Finance services.</p>
<p>President Director of Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia Kadir Gunduz stated that working with the right partners is critical for CCAI’s transformation journey. “Our 10,000 employees are serving more than 830,000 customers and growing. It is important that we work with partners who understand the scale of our business and our future ambition.” Throughout 2017 alone, CCAI announced more than USD 110 million of investment in a form of a Mega Distribution Centre and several new production lines. “We know that Citi brings decades of experience, innovation, and cutting edge technology which—we believe—will add value to our plan to grow,” added Kadir.</p>
<p>Head of Global Subsidiaries Group of Citi Indonesia Riko Tasmaya said, “Citi has a long-standing global relationship with Coca-Cola Amatil in Australia and Indonesia across Treasury and Trade Solutions, Capital Markets, Risk Management and Corporate Finance. This mandate will further strengthen our close partnership, and we thank Coca-Cola Amatil for their continued trust in Citi. As their preferred bank and trusted advisor, we look forward to continue offering a unique value proposition, leveraging the power of our global network and state-of-the art digital innovation to support CCAI’s growth.”</p>

<p>Citi also implemented a Supplier Finance Program for CCAI, enabling CCAI to improve their Day Payable Outstanding and enhance their cash conversion cycle by extending payment terms. Simultaneously, it allows CCAI’s suppliers to finance their receivables at a more attractive rate than they would otherwise be able to achieve. This delivers a win-win outcome for both CCAI and suppliers.</p>
<p>Citi’s Cash Management and Trade Finance solutions are supported by efficient digital solutions that drive greater automation and autonomy in CCAI’s treasury operations, allowing CCAI to have unprecedented visibility over their treasury flows. The TTS business is committed to continuously harness innovation and digitization to help clients better adapt their operating models to shifting markets and business demands.</p>

Our relationship with Citi has been established for a long time, providing services such as Cash Management, Treasury and Trade Solutions, FX Solutions, and providing corporate credit cards for employees. Through this continuous collaboration, we hope that the new partnership will bring sustainable business growth for both CCAI and Citi Indonesia.”</p>

<p>Joint Electronic Teller Services Limited (“JETCO”) today announced the launch of JETCO Pay Merchant Payment service jointly with eight banks, including Bank of Communications (Hong Kong), Bank of East Asia, Chong Hing Bank, Dah Sing Bank, ICBC (Asia), OCBC Wing Hang Bank, Shanghai Commercial Bank and Wing Lung Bank. The service allows consumers to make in-store QR code payment easily, while in-app or online payments can be completed quickly and securely by inputting only their mobile phone number. The fact that the service is linked to the bank account also means that consumers do not have to worry about topping up.</p>
<p>Consumers can make in-store purchases with the bank JETCO Pay app by scanning the merchant’s paper or electronic QR code. The latter is generated in the JETCO Pay Cashier app provided to the merchant free of charge. Merchants enjoy significant benefits due to the zero-cost and simplicity to set up the service, and consumers can also enjoy more flexibility and security with cashless payment.</p>
<p>The in-app and online payment options allow consumers to check out with JETCO Pay when they make purchases on the merchant’s app or website. The key benefit of these two options is that all the user needs to do is to enter the mobile phone number, avoiding the hassle and risk of entering long and hard-to-remember account numbers.</p>
<p>Consumers can now use JETCO Pay merchant payment’s in-app feature to pay for parking through the “Park &amp; Dine” app offered by Link Asset Management Limited. The coming months will see the service rolling out across Hong Kong in the food and beverage sector, property management groups, entertainment venues and schools.</p>
<p>JETCO Chief Executive Officer Angus Choi said: “There is a large cash and cheque market in Hong Kong that is untapped. JETCO Pay Merchant Payment service aims to serve this market segment by providing a mobile payment solution that is low-cost and easy to set up. We are grateful for the support of the eight banks who will be gradually rolling out this service. We share with them the common goal of enlarging the mobile payment ecosystem and accelerating the pace of Hong Kong to become a cashless society, bringing benefits to everyone.”</p>
<p>“Our objective is to establish JETCO Pay as a major payment brand in Hong Kong offering consumers easy access to the service not only locally, but also when they travel overseas. We are working in collaboration with financial institutions in China and Taiwan and expect to roll out cross-border payment service in the Greater China region later this year,” said Mr. Choi.</p>
<p>Another major initiative in progress is the conversion of the 18 million JETCO debit cards in circulation to virtual cards, which will complement JETCO Pay to offer consumers a total solution for payment and fund transfer across all channels.</p>

<p>The Shyft Network’s blockchain-based system will let users securely obtain, store, inquire into, and work with compliance-satisfying data, helping them reduce costs and increase effectiveness while deepening consumer data security.</p>
<p>Shyft Chairman Joseph Weinberg said: “In recent years, financial technology has been evolving by leaps and bounds. Unfortunately, at the risk of disruption or even catastrophic failures like terrorist financing, industry players have been struggling to keep pace with the advancements. Financial institutions are facing an increasing number of compliance obligations with heightened complexity and rigor, where failure to comply can result in significant legal penalties and reputational damage. The current processes used by financial institutions to handle regulatory compliance are broken and highly ineffective in stopping money laundering. Identity is being looked at in an improper manner and the industry is ready for a seismic change.”</p>
<p>The Shyft Network aims to provide a new paradigm for digital identity — one focused on leveraging reputation as collateral and setting a new standard in the attestation process. Shyft is a reputation network that enables base layer identity anonymization and KYC data-anchoring. Shyft assigns individuals and businesses with Creditability scores, defining their reputation, plausibility, believability, and likelihood that they are creditable. On the Shyft Network, creditability or reputation becomes collateral and user identities act as anchors on which bridges and gateways are created into new data sets that enable reputational creditability.</p>
<p>A team of industry innovators and leaders advise and provide strategic direction to the Shyft project. Shyft’s board of advisors include Joseph Weinberg (Paycase CEO, Think Tank Specialist to the OECD, &amp; Shyft Chairman), Chris Forrester (Shyft CTO), Fredrico Nassire (Shyft COO), Advisor Anthony Di Iorio (CEO &amp; Founder at Jaxx &amp; Decentral, Co-Founder of Ethereum), Ben Gorlick (Previously Director &amp; Head of Product at Blockstream), Loretta Joseph (Chair of the Australian Digital Chamber of Commerce Advisory Council and OECD Think Tank Leader), Jeremy Bornstein (Senior Vice President &amp; Group Head at Mastercard in Canada), and Bruce Silcoff (Chairman of Fairlane Group).</p>
<p>Anthony Di Iorio, CEO &amp; Founder at Jaxx and Decentral, and Co-Founder of Ethereum said: “I have identified Shyft’s solution to KYC as the reform that many of my partners and the wider industry have been waiting for. Shyft’s underlying vision and the fact that it’s supported by a global network of KYC regulators is what sets this project apart from any other in the market. When I learned of Shyft’s vision to remove borders around personal identity using blockchain, I realized the full influence they will have on the entire global economy.”</p>
<p>Shyft Senior Advisor Bruce Silcoff adds: “A digital security epidemic is upon us. Billions of consumer identities have already been compromised. The Shyft Network will be pivotal in remedying a broken financial system and restoring consumer confidence.”</p>

<p>MAS requires FIs operating in Singapore to implement robust controls when onboarding new customers, e.g. when opening a bank account, to detect and deter money laundering or terrorism financing. MAS already allows FIs to carry out non-face-to-face (NFTF) verification of customer identity, provided adequate measures are in place to guard against impersonation. MAS has provided additional guidance that these measures could include biometric identification, real-time video conferencing, and secure digital signature using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based credentials<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>MAS will also allow the use of MyInfo<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> for NFTF customer identification and verification. MAS will not require FIs that have been given access to a customer’s MyInfo data to obtain additional documents to verify a customer’s identity. FIs using MyInfo will also not be required to separately obtain a photograph of the customer. The use of MyInfo will streamline customer due-diligence checks across the financial industry. It will improve the quality of risk management while saving time and costs.</p>
<p>Ms Ho Hern Shin, Assistant Managing Director (Banking &amp; Insurance), MAS, said, “MAS encourages FIs to use technology that helps to increase efficiency and improve the customer on-boarding experience while safeguarding against money laundering and terrorism financing risks. FinTech firms can also capitalise on the MyInfo platform, with customer consent, to develop innovative financial solutions for FIs to enhance customer experience.”</p>

<p>Xero, a global small business accounting platform, today announced the next phase of its partnership with Stripe, enabling Xero customers to accept Automated Clearing House (ACH) bank transfers via its integration with Stripe. With the availability of ACH payments, Xero’s more than 1.2 million subscribers have yet another way to get paid quickly, safely and securely.</p>
<p>“Our ultimate goal at Xero is to make sure small businesses are getting paid as quickly as possible, while making the experience from set up to reconciliation seamless,” said Craig Walker, Chief Technology Officer at Xero. “Building on our partnership with Stripe, this new feature gives our customers even more ways to get paid efficiently while keeping sensitive information safe.”</p>
<p>Enabling ACH in Xero is easy: from within Payment Services settings, Xero customers can login to their Stripe account to connect Stripe ACH bank transfers as a payment gateway. They can then connect this to an invoice theme, which will enable the “Pay Now” button on the invoices they send to their customers.</p>
<p>When the recipient of that invoice makes a payment with ACH, Stripe will generate and display unique bank account details for that specific invoice, keeping the sender’s bank details private. The recipient will then log into the bank of their choice, where they can initiate ACH payment using the bank details provided on the invoice.</p>
<p>Once the ACH payment has cleared, the money will be received into the Xero customer’s Stripe account, and the invoice will be automatically marked as paid. When Stripe transfers the money into the Xero customer’s bank account, Xero will match the payment and processing fee to the statement line for easy reconciliation.</p>
<p>“While ACH is one of the most efficient payment methods for businesses, it has been a traditionally cumbersome option to set up,” said Cristina Cordova, Head of Business Development at Stripe. “We’re thrilled to partner with Xero to make this payment method easily available to the millions of subscribers that rely on its software.”</p>
<p>Today’s news follows <a href=""https://www.xero.com/blog/2017/08/stripe-first-class-payment-experience/"" target=""_blank"">an announcement from Xero and Stripe last year</a>, introducing an expanded online payment solution with automated reconciliation. Added Walker, “With the introduction of Stripe ACH, we are extending the ways a business can get paid into their Stripe account while maintaining the integrity of the first-class experience we’ve built between Stripe and Xero.”</p>

<p>Previse, the AI supplier payments decision making company, today announces four high profile additions to its advisory board. They will help Previse as it rolls out its artificial intelligence technology which allows multinational buyers to ensure all their suppliers, including SMEs, can be paid immediately on receipt of invoice and end the scourge of late payments.</p>
<p>David Tyler has served as Chairman of Sainsbury’s since 2009. He brings his broad and extensive experience to Previse, following both executive and non-executive roles across the consumer, retail, business services and financial services sectors.  He has significant experience of advising companies with long supply chains having served as a Non-Executive Director on the boards of Burberry, Experian and multinational consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser.</p>
<p>He will be joined on the advisory board by Alexandra Prigent-Labeis, who advises CEOs and politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, on communication and leadership skills, and John Gildersleeve, chairman of leading property company British Land and deputy chairman of internet service provider TalkTalk.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of significant grant funding for Previse from the Scottish Government, the company is also announcing Gillian Docherty, CEO of The Data Lab, is joining the advisory board. Gillian is a leading voice in Scottish data science and will help Previse as it strengthens its connections to the country’s academic and business communities.</p>
<p>David Tyler said: “The length of time it can take for suppliers to be paid hurts not only them, but the large companies buying their products and services as well.</p>
<p>“By using cutting edge technology, the Previse team have found a way to streamline the payments process for multinationals so that suppliers are paid instantly on receipt of invoice. This will bring benefits to the entire supply chain and I am delighted to be an advisor to a company which I believe has a bright future.”</p>
<p>Lengthy payment terms and the prevalence of slow payments by large buyers, which affects three in five SME suppliers, cause 50,000 UK SMEs to close each year1. Previse’s artificial intelligence technology allows even very small suppliers to receive payment the day they issue their invoice by instantly identifying if an invoice is correct and allowing a funder to pay the supplier immediately based on this information.</p>
<p>John Gildersleeve, said: “The enemy here is process. For many businesses, it has simply been too hard to change the processes required to pay fast enough. Previse gives multinationals the tools and real incentives to pay all their suppliers, even the smallest, instantly.”</p>
<p>Alexandra Prigent-Labeis said: ‘For executives who need to increase revenue or reduce costs, Previse is a trade finance platform that maximises your programme revenue and supports your smallest suppliers. Previse creates and shares value from invoice data, using artificial intelligence, so that multinational buyers can benefit from having all their suppliers paid instantly.”</p>
<p>Paul Christensen, CEO of Previse, said: “I am proud to be able to welcome our new board members who represent incredible senior experience across such a wide range of industries with significant supply chains. I think this shows the deep understanding across industry that slow payments are a real problem, and confidence in our approach to tackling the problem.”</p>

<p>To create this first-of-its-kind fund, Humanity United teamed up with leading brands, foundations, and impact investors that share a commitment for more responsible supply chains. Working Capital operates on a shared vision of building scalable solutions to improve labor practices in the global operations and extended supply chains of multinational corporations. In addition to Humanity United, partners and supporters in the fund include: Walmart Foundation, C&amp;A Foundation, Stardust Equity, Open Society Foundations (Soros Economic Development Fund), The Ray and Dagmar Dolby Family Fund, and The Walt Disney Company. The unique structure of aligning with leading companies as funders helps leverage innovative solutions for sustainable impact in a way that is good for all – consumers, business, and society.</p>
<p>“There is a growing market demand for more transparent and responsible corporate supply chains,” said Ed Marcum, Managing Director at Working Capital. “We see an opportunity to invest in emerging solutions that will meet the demands of large multinational corporations while also benefiting millions of vulnerable workers at the bottom of the economic pyramid.”</p>
<p>The Fund will also leverage support from the UK’s Department for International Development in “sidecar” grant funding for pre-investment and seed-stage interventions.</p>
<p>Led by an experienced team from Humanity United, the Fund has already invested in promising portfolio companies, further demonstrating both the market opportunity for emerging entrepreneurs to develop more innovative solutions, and demand from leading brands to adopt these solutions. Current portfolio companies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://www.provenance.org/"" target=""_blank"">Provenance</a>, a technology platform that uses blockchain to enable brands, suppliers, and stakeholders to trace products along their journey from producer to consumer; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""http://ulula.com/"" target=""_blank"">Ulula</a>, a software and data analytics platform that allows organizations to engage with workers in real time to measure and monitor labor-related risks, creating more responsible global supply chains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Working Capital’s partners and supporters share the Fund’s commitment to reduce worker vulnerability and ensure greater transparency into working conditions.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to use our strengths in collaboration with others to transform the supply chain systems we rely on, and we are proud to be part of the Working Capital group of partners,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, President of the Walmart Foundation. “We believe in solutions that benefit everyone – from the workers who make the products to the consumers who purchase them, creating a shared value for business and society.”</p>
<p>“C&amp;A Foundation is proud to be an anchor investor in the Working Capital Fund. This unique partnership furthers our goal to end the worst forms of labour exploitation in the apparel industry, and promote accountability through innovative solutions and collaboration with industry players,” said Brandee Butler, Head of Gender Justice &amp; Human Rights of the C&amp;A Foundation. “We believe that gender justice is fundamental to improve conditions for workers and support the Fund’s commitment to gender lens investing to improve outcomes for women, and economic returns for investors.”</p>
<p>To better tackle the various transparency and ethical labor challenges associated with complex supply chains, the Fund focuses on product traceability, worker engagement, sourcing platforms, risk assessment, and ethical recruiting tools by investing in emerging technologies such as blockchain, machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital identity and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.</p>

<p>BNY Mellon is a leader in offering faster and improved payments solutions to its corporate and institutional clients, as well as in advocating for payments modernization within the industry. As a part of BNY Mellon’s payments modernization initiative, the bank launched two services leveraging VolPay Hub technology provided by Volante.</p>
<p>BNY Mellon’s first such initiative was to become the first bank to successfully originate a real-time payment over the The Clearing House’s new Real-Time Payments network. It has worked extensively with The Clearing House and other banks to define standards for clearing and settling payments in real-time.</p>
<p>BNY Mellon’s second initiative was to launch a new service, called ""BNY Mellon Tokenized Payments® – now available with Zelle®"", which will further accelerate the transition from paper to electronic payments for their clients.</p>
<p>In support of these initiatives, Volante developed its TCH RTP Processor Module in collaboration with BNY Mellon to process real-time payments  and to  allow a transaction to reach its recipient within 15 seconds or less.</p>
<p>“We are creating the building blocks for an integrated payments ecosystem both for today’s needs and for the next generation. This approach allowed us to be first to market with RTP and will also serve us well over the long term,” said Saket Sharma, Chief Information Officer for BNY Mellon Treasury Services. “Working closely with trusted and innovative fintech providers such as Volante and our own development resources helps us deliver sustainable value quickly.”</p>
<p>Vijay Oddiraju, CEO, Volante Technologies said, “Our collaboration with BNY Mellon on first-to-industry payments solutions further establishes our payments innovation capability. We are enormously proud to have played such a significant role in the historic moment of US real-time payments. Implementing the first RTP processing hub in the US is the perfect example of collaborative teamwork between BNY Mellon and Volante, bringing greater value to BNY Mellon’s clients.”</p>
<p>Oddiraju continued, “This successful deployment further reinforces our core principle of using automation to reduce implementation time and cost for our customers. Adding tokenized payments capability to BNY Mellon’s real-time payments technology platform is a further testament to how we continue to collaborate and help our customers build out their future payment capabilities.”</p>

<p>The facility will fund all existing developments within the group across both luxury brand Audley Villages and new mid-market provider Mayfield Villages, as well as new locations, covering the cost of land acquisition and development.</p>
<p>This news comes on the back of an additional £85m of equity raised in June 2017 by the Moorfield Audley Real Estate Fund (MAREF), taking the total equity raised to £285m. Moorfield Group, the UK real estate private equity fund manager, created MAREF to acquire Audley in December 2015.</p>
<p>As well as the 17 villages that sit under the Audley Villages brand, which when completed will provide at least 2,000 units nationwide, 500 units are currently planned at future Mayfield Villages sites, including the first location at Watford.</p>
<p>Jon Austen, Chief Financial Officer, Audley Group, said: “The Audley Group model is one of sourcing sites, achieving planning, then developing and operating the completed village, which will offer owners an independent lifestyle with restaurants, library, healthclub and on-site care if owners need it. Demand for our product is extremely high, driven by the increasing ageing of our population. This new facility allows us to execute our aggressive growth strategy and the backing of HSBC and Bank Leumi (UK) is a reflection of the quality of our business, our profitability and the strength of our balance sheet.</p>
<p>Hugh Taylor, Head of Housing, HSBC UK, said “Audley is a leading developer and operator of retirement villages and an early mover in the provision of this product in the UK. We are very pleased to support the growth of this first class business, which comes as part of our wider efforts to help addresss the current housing challenge. The retirement village sector is an important part of the solution as buyers of such homes are releasing family homes into the market, thus helping boost availability of much-needed stock.”</p>
<p>Richard Martin, Relationship Manager, Property Finance, Bank Leumi (UK), said “We have supported Audley Group for a number of years, firstly by providing bank finance to the Chalfont Dene village and most recently in financing the development of the latest village at Redwood in Bristol which opened in November 2017. Our desire to remain involved with Audley is borne out of our strong belief in its business model and excellent management team.”</p>
<p>The financing was led by Clare Brown, Senior Corporate Banking Manager, HSBC, with the lenders being advised by Burges Salmon, CBRE and Arcadis. Audley Group was advised by Eversheds and JCRA.</p>
<p>Audley’s brands serve two distinct audiences. Audley Villages is the luxury retirement brand, delivering a first class experience and award winning design to owners. Typically, heritage properties are adapted to incorporate existing features from the original buildings, bringing them back to life by turning them into modern, high specification houses, apartments and communal spaces, akin to a boutique hotel. Owners also benefit from access to luxurious Audley Club facilities which include a restaurant, bar/bistro, library, a health and wellbeing centre and swimming pool. All owners can also take advantage of the highest quality care in their own home.</p>
<p>Responding to customer demand, Audley last year launched Mayfield Villages, a mid-market proposition, with the first village to be part of the Watford Riverwell scheme. The premise behind Mayfield is to offer the same level of service as Audley Villages, with high living standards and excellent care, but at a lower price point. These will be larger villages, typically in urban/suburban environments.</p>

<p>Pelican, a global provider of payments and financial crime compliance systems for banks and corporates, has expanded its PelicanFast solution to cater for the real-time payments and compliance needs of the US market. PelicanFast, already internationally approved to work with other real-time payment schemes – including the pan-European SEPA Instant Payments scheme launched last year – now offers instant payments and real-time financial crime compliance capabilities for the North American market.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve and National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA) are actively promoting the adoption of instant payments to the American banking market. Implementing real-time payments can however be a highly complex process that challenges the technical and compliance capabilities of existing legacy environments designed for batch processing. PelicanFast will enable banks to capture the growth opportunities presented by real-time payments, without the traditional headaches of overhauling or replacing existing core-banking systems that are ill-suited to a real-time, 24/7 payments environment. This is achieved by providing value-add features which fill the void left by older core systems that are not always on-line and cannot respond to high volumes of requests in quick succession.</p>
<p>Parth Desai, founder and CEO of Pelican, commented: “While there is currently no regulatory obligation in the U.S. to adopt real-time payment capabilities, the need to innovate and enhance legacy batch capabilities for today’s dynamic digital market is very much an essential for banks who wish to retain market share and capture new customers.</p>
<p>“The new tech entrants with innovative real-time capabilities threaten to significantly disrupt the traditional slow-moving payments infrastructures and processes. American customers, both business and consumer, increasingly expect real-time banking and payments services. The PelicanFast real-time payments and financial crime compliance solution enables banks to innovate and deliver quick-to-market instant payments solutions while retaining their existing investment in internal legacy systems.”</p>
<p>PelicanFast combines both payments processing and fraud prevention services for the US market. It is unique in the way it uses the AI discipline of natural language processing to provide the highest levels of financial crime compliance, whilst still ensuring all validations are conducted within the strict processing time limits dictated by real-time schemes. Using PelicanFast, banks can remain confident of meeting their obligations, while gaining quick access to the liquidity and service benefits of real-time transactions.</p>
<p>PelicanFast is comprised of inter-operable modules for real-time payments processing and real-time financial crime compliance monitoring such as fraud detection, which are available individually or combined and are adaptable to suit the needs of multiple real-time payment schemes. The solution can be deployed on premise or provided as a secure hosted cloud service.</p>

<p>With an average of 28.14m messages a day SWIFT also recorded new peak traffic days in 2017, processing 32.84m FIN messages on 30<sup>th</sup> November – 8% above the 2016 peak of 30.4m messages. At the same time, SWIFT continued to deliver on its day-to-day mandate: operational availability performance during 2017 exceeded targets. SWIFT achieved 99.999% availability both for FIN and its SWIFTNet messaging services, against the backdrop of growing volumes and the completion of the FIN Renewal project – as well as the roll out of new products and services and the ongoing implementation of the <a href=""https://www.swift.com/myswift/customer-security-programme-csp"" target=""_blank"">Customer Security Programme</a>.</p>
<p>“Traffic growth, and payments traffic growth in particular, was exceptionally strong in 2017, reflecting the Community’s trust in the cooperative and the wider growth in the global economy”, said SWIFT CEO, Gottfried Leibbrandt. “SWIFT maintained the high security and reliability performance our community expects, while investing for the future, developing innovative new services, working to help the community reinforce its security through the Customer Security Programme, and continuing to return the benefits of its economies of scale to users.”</p>
<p>Growth in SWIFT’s payments traffic was strong across all regions as well as in domestic and cross-border segments, both of which experienced double-digit growth during the year. Momentum was partially driven by the go-live of SWIFT’s gpi service in January 2017, which already accounts for nearly 10% of cross border payment instructions carried on the network. A total of 100 country corridors are already live with gpi, including all the major country corridors such as the US-China route, where gpi payments already account for 25% of traffic. End-users are already seeing the significant impact of gpi: all gpi payments can be tracked end-to-end and most of them are already credited in a few hours or less.</p>
<p>“The success of gpi in 2017 exceeded expectations”, said SWIFT’s Chief Marketing Officer, Luc Meurant, “With more banks going live, additional banks signing up to the service, and fast-growing demand from corporates, volumes will continue to rise dramatically. Offering speed, transparency and safety, we expect gpi will become the new norm within the next two to three years. SWIFT has led the way in innovation, to provide our customers with an enhanced level of performance, and will continue to be at the forefront of introducing new technological solutions. The gpi service, combined with our <a href=""https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/compliance-and-shared-services/financial-crime-compliance"" target=""_blank"">Financial Crime Compliance suite</a> and the Customer Security Programme, will transform international payments.”</p>
<p>In SWIFT2020, SWIFT’s strategic five year plan, the cooperative committed to a new long-term, structural price reduction programme. In 2017 SWIFT made measurable progress in delivering on that commitment, reducing average message prices by 12% year-on-year. This resulted in an overall 20% price reduction just two years into the 5-year programme.</p>

<p>This streamlined and dynamic virtual card solution, known as BofA Merrill Virtual Payables, also leverages new capabilities to create single-use account numbers in real time.</p>
<p>Using API, a purchasing client can also initiate payments via batch file delivery from its accounts payable/enterprise resource planning system or via the user interface.</p>
<p>“We are excited to present to our clients, and the market, continued enhancements and innovations with our card payment methods,” said Hubert J.P. Jolly, global head of financing and channels for Global Transaction Services (GTS) at BofA Merrill. “We are proud to be the first issuer in North America to generate single-use virtual card accounts directly from our processor, resulting in the ultimate combination of flexibility and control.”</p>
<p>The enhanced Virtual Payables streamlines the payment process for both buyers and their suppliers. Each transaction has a unique card account number tied to it, improving reconciliation for both parties. For suppliers, there’s no need to store a card number on file as all card account information and payment details are provided via email and secure URL.

<p>The service will launch in early 2018 and allow participants to more efficiently trade, finance and margin their FX through BNY Mellon, a highly-rated counterparty that oversees more than $33.3trn<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> of assets under custody.</p>
<p>The initiative will add a new FX prime broker into the market, allowing clients to access a significant new source of FX liquidity while helping streamline and reduce operational expenses, including legal and onboarding costs, as well as generating substantial capital and netting gains.</p>
<p>Clients will be able to transact an extensive suite of FX products while also enjoying access to pre- and post-trade services and BNY Mellon’s market-leading collateral, funding and liquidity capabilities.</p>
<p>The introduction of the new service comes at a time when some clients are experiencing challenges in sourcing liquidity or are facing increased funding costs in a constrained market.</p>
<p>“We’re launching a traditional prime brokerage service with a twist. By leveraging BNY Mellon’s leadership in collateral management, funding and liquidity, clients will benefit from a fully-integrated and complete FX service,” said Jason Vitale, Chief Operating Officer, Foreign Exchange &amp; Head of Client Execution Services at BNY Mellon Markets.</p>
<p>“FXPB is just one of a number of new services BNY Mellon Markets is introducing that will enable our clients to more efficiently access global currency markets.”</p>
<p>“BNY Mellon’s new service benefits from the combination of a highly-rated counterparty with the capacity of a market-leading custodial bank. It opens up access to multiple new sources of liquidity for new and existing clients. FXPB is the ideal tool for those looking to balance the challenges of the uncleared margin regime with the need to deliver better execution on behalf of their clients,” said Michael Cooper, head of FXPB at BNY Mellon in London.</p>

<p>The DBS-Xero payment solution addresses payment problems among SMEs caused by finance-related concerns such as cash flow problems. This is an issue which plague more than 1 in 3 SMEs in Singapore<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The new payments solution is a straight-through one as it eliminates an SME’s administrative burden of having to manually enter payment details on multiple platforms, which could potentially lead to costly human errors during the process. With this API<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>-driven banking service, payments can be initiated on Xero and approved through the bank’s corporate internet banking platform, DBS IDEAL, all in a few clicks.</p>
<p>SMEs form the backbone of the Singapore economy. 99% of the companies incorporated in Singapore are SMEs, who in turn employ more than 80% of the workforce.</p>
<p>Joyce Tee, DBS Group Head of SME Banking said, “SMEs have so much on their plate, they grapple daily with challenges such as rising manpower costs, hiring difficulties and fast-changing market dynamics. And so, it is more important than ever that they manage their cashflow effectively. A payments solution like the one we are launching today means that SMEs can now have a real-time view of their cash position which in turn allows them to up their productivity and tap into the latest business opportunities.”</p>
<p>DBS and Xero’s new payments solution will be made available to existing DBS-Xero customers in Singapore at no cost. The bank also plans to introduce this solution to SMEs in Hong Kong by the end of the year. The launch of this solution also marks the next step in regional strategic partnership between DBS and Xero to enable SMEs to transform their businesses using technology.</p>
<p>Making payments are traditionally a tedious paper-intensive process that take up the bulk of SME owners’ time. “Small businesses all around the world, who adopt new technology and digitise the way they work to drive growth, can now expect to manage cash flow and access capital in entirely new ways,” commented Alex Campbell, Managing Director Asia at Xero. “With DBS, we have found the perfect partner for enabling small businesses to achieve exactly that across the Asia region. This new payment service is another milestone in building our financial network of trusted organisations and institutions sharing financial data securely with the purpose of helping our more than one million small business customers do business easier via Xero’s global platform and their banks.”</p>
<p>In recent years, DBS has helped many SMEs go digital, helping them save time and costs. In 2017, nine in ten new SME accounts were opened online.</p>
<p>This has led to a 2.5 times increase in customers using DBS IDEAL to make online payments to vendors and suppliers. DBS has also reduced the cost of making payments online by 90% so that SMEs benefit from cheaper online payments.</p>
<p>Mr Keyis Ng, CEO and Co-Founder of Cafebond.com said, “Being a business owner in Singapore is challenging, but having the right tools and partners makes it easier. I’m excited to try out the new online payment service by DBS and Xero. By getting rid of the administrative tedium and creating a more efficient invoicing, payments and collections process, I’ll have more time to focus on what we do best, which is sharing the love of specialty coffee with our customers across Asia.”</p>
<p>Cafebond.com was one of the start-ups that took part in DBS’ Hotspot Accelerator Programme in 2016, and received mentorship, access to investors as well as free workshops and skills enablement classes.</p>
<p>“As a bank that supports and finances over 60% of SMEs in Singapore, we are committed to empowering business owners by making banking simpler, faster and more convenient for them,” said Tee.</p>

<p>moneycorp has finalised the acquisition, which was signed in May 2017, successfully receiving change of licencing approval in each necessary state, gaining the approvals required to operate across the country.</p>
<p>Commonwealth FX was established in 1996 and offers foreign exchange and international payments services to corporate clients in the US. The business serves over 4,000 customers in the US, with a team of over 70 specialist foreign exchange professionals across five offices.</p>
<p>Commonwealth FX will be rebranded to moneycorp during Q2 2018, increasing visibility of the UK brand internationally. It will also give US customers access to moneycorp’s state-of-the-art international payments platform, which allows multi-bank pricing, a range of FX risk management solutions and is rich in-service features.</p>
<p>The completion of the acquisition is the latest move in moneycorp’s international expansion. It comes at the same time as the completion of a 42.5% shareholding of Brazil-based FX provider, Novo Mundo.</p>
<h5>Nick Haslehurst, CFOO at moneycorp said:</h5>
<p>“The completion of the Commonwealth FX acquisition is further testament to moneycorp’s continuing appetite for growth, particularly in new global markets.</p>
<p>“There is excellent potential to grow our corporate and personal business in the US.</p>
<p>“Our business is growing from strength to strength, as we strive to provide its personal and corporate clients across the globe the best international payments service.”</p>

<p>SWIFT and seven central securities depositories (CSDs) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to work together to demonstrate how distributed ledger technology could be implemented in post-trade scenarios, such as corporate actions processing, including voting and proxy-voting.  The group will investigate the types of new products that can be built using it, and how existing standards such as <a href=""https://www.swift.com/standards/iso-20022-harmonisation-programme"" target=""_blank"">ISO 20022</a> can support it.</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, Caja de Valores, Depósito Central de Valores, Nasdaq Market Technology AB, National Settlement Depository, SIX Securities Services and Strate Ltd are among the CSDs participating in the DLT project with SWIFT. Additional CSDs are expected to join in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Today, securities processing, particularly in areas requiring multi-party contact, involve extremely cumbersome manual processes that can carry significant inherent cost and risk. As a part of the MOU, SWIFT and the CSDs have defined the product requirements for an e-voting solution based on DLT that includes common standards (ISO 20022) and principles.</p>
<p>“To ensure interoperability and smooth migration, it is crucial that new technologies support existing common standards such as ISO 20022,” says Stephen Lindsay, Head of Standards at SWIFT. “The promise of the technology on paper is great, but it is currently missing a key component around standardisation. There is clear value in re-using established business definitions and facilitating interoperability amongst DLT implementations, which this project will demonstrate.”</p>
<p>Other aspects of the MOU include fostering collaboration amongst the CSD community in DLT research and development, helping define the role of financial market infrastructure providers in markets based on distributed ledgers and; identifying, defining and developing additional use cases for DLT in a CSD environment and the post-trade landscape, such as services for different kinds of DLT-based digital assets.</p>
<p>In addition, the group will focus on creating and adapting common standards and principles for the use of DLT amongst CSDs and the financial industry, and promoting the adoption of those standards and principles to other parties, including regulators.</p>
<p>Confirming the importance of the CSD Working Group on DLT, the <a href=""https://www.issanet.org/e/"" target=""_blank"">International Securities Services Association (ISSA)</a> recently endorsed the group and included it as part of a new work stream within the Association’s existing Working Group on DLT, giving this initiative greater industry visibility. As a part of ISSA, the <a href=""https://www.issanet.org/e/pdf/2017-12_Newsletter.pdf"" target=""_blank"">CSD Working Group on DLT</a> will initially focus on digital assets with a goal to establish a business framework for how these assets could be used in the post-trade space. The framework will identify key definitions, classifications, services and post trade service provider roles. Findings from the use case on digital assets are expected to be published in Q2.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to welcome the CSD Working Group on DLT into ISSA,” says Thomas Zeeb, CEO, SIX Securities Services and Chairman, ISSA. “There is a lot of potential for DLT in securities processing and the work being led by the CSD working group on DLT is tackling a key challenge related to emerging technologies, which is a clear lack of standards. As the industry evolves, DLT-specific standards such as ISO 20022, will provide a great foundation, in terms of both existing business content and approach.”</p>

<p>Money transfer companies allow people to send cross-border payments. Unfortunately, the current model requires money transfer companies to use pre-funded accounts across the globe to source liquidity for these payments. The process makes payments costly and slow, which causes headaches for both the companies and their customers.</p>
<p>To allow their customers to send and complete cross-border payments quicker and cheaper, MoneyGram — one of the world’s largest money transfer companies — will use <a href=""https://ripple.com/xrp/"" target=""_blank"">XRP</a> in their payment flows.</p>
<p>The use of XRP allows MoneyGram to solve the age-old liquidity issue most financial institutions face while saving time and money. Additionally, customers will have the ability to send funds real time, with transparency and certainty.</p>
<h3 id=""xrp-xrapid-help-source-on-demand-liquidity"">XRP, xRapid help source on-demand liquidity</h3>
<p>MoneyGram will access and use XRP, the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger, in their payment flows through xRapid, Ripple’s on-demand liquidity product.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: <a href=""https://ripple.com/solutions/source-liquidity/"" target=""_blank"">xRapid</a> enables real-time foreign exchange (FX) settlement through XRP, which gives financial institutions the ability to unlock liquidity and access multiple corridors with one pre-funded originating account.</p>
<p>What’s more, financial institutions will be able to send on-demand payments, reduce FX costs and fees, and customers will receive real-time insight into the status of their payments.</p>
<p>“Ripple is at the forefront of blockchain technology and we look forward to piloting xRapid,” said Alex Holmes, chief executive officer of MoneyGram, in a press release. “We’re hopeful it will increase efficiency and improve services to MoneyGram’s customers.”</p>
<h3 id=""ripple-strives-to-improve-cross-border-payments"">Ripple strives to improve cross-border payments</h3>
<p>Ripple is focused on fixing the inefficiencies and problems that exist in cross-border payments, regardless of whether those payments originate with a bank, corporate or another financial institution.</p>
<p>“The payments problem doesn’t just affect banks, it also affects companies like MoneyGram, which help people get money to the ones they care about,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. “By using a digital asset like XRP that settles in three seconds or less, our clients can move money as quickly as information.”</p>

<p>“A major criteria for selecting a <a href=""https://treasuryxpress.com/implementation/"" target=""_blank"">TMS solution</a> was our need for a customizable, scalable solution that could be deployed rapidly and without us being obliged to hire an outside consultant to run the project for us,” said Eyad Abdel Rahman, Group Treasurer at Ittihad. “After meeting the TreasuryXpress team and learning about the solution, we knew they were best positioned in the market to really harness the benefits of the Cloud and deliver our project with minimal human intervention thereby reducing our time-to-market and overall cost of automation.”</p>
<p>Ittihad’s business strategy is aimed at establishing and operating economically diversified portfolios either independently or in collaboration with leading companies. As a result, the management of multiple, specialized financial instruments and investments was adding a high degree of complexity to the firm’s <a href=""https://treasuryxpress.com/treasury-software-c2/"" target=""_blank"">treasury operations</a>.</p>
<p>“We have very specific loan and investment requirements that needed to be addressed,” continues Abdel Rahman. “TreasuryXpress listened to our needs, reviewed our unique specs and built the custom capabilities we required in under two weeks. Even more satisfying, TreasuryXpress was able to connect us to our 9 global banks giving us visibility to 70% of our cash in this same two-week timeframe. We are genuinely impressed with the team’s approach and leverage of technology to accelerate our project.”</p>
<p>“We hear from prospective clients almost daily that they are frustrated by the emerging business model of legacy TMS providers outsourcing 100% of their implementations to third parties,” said Anis Rahal, CEO and founder of TreasuryXpress. “This practice just exasperates the implementation project from a time and cost perspective. It is our strong belief that the answer to improving the implementation experience for treasury is to eliminate as much human-reliance as possible. At TreasuryXpress, we rely on technology to make the difference – to reduce project timelines and costs dramatically.”</p>
<p>TreasuryXpress’ <a href=""https://treasuryxpress.com/why-treasuryxpress/"" target=""_blank"">on-demand Treasury Management Solution (TMS)</a> model leverages modern Cloud technology and development practices to create repeatable best-practice implementation workflows. These workflows fully automate the bank connectivity process; thereby reducing time and effort spent on these tasks during traditional projects. Additionally, the TreasuryXpress approach to innovation offers a perpetual development and upgrade model that allows treasury professionals to implement, consume, and scale technology economically and rapidly.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe that it is technology and the intelligent use of modern innovations will transform the entire TMS experience for the treasury industry,” continues Rahal. “Long implementations are no longer viable or necessary. Our vision and strategy is to reduce as much human intervention during the implementation process as possible and rely more on automation. At TreasuryXpress, we have acquired the expertise and technology strategy to make this a reality.”</p>

<p>Under Basel III regulations, banks are no longer able to rely on clients’ ‘non-operational’ cash deposits for their liquidity tests, meaning investors will need to find new liquidity and capital preservation solutions to gain similar or better yields for their non-operational and other cash reserves.</p>
<p>“Both our regional treasury centre clients across Asia-Pacific and our Australian clients have commented on the lack of diversified cash management solutions for the Aussie dollar. The AUD fund will invest in a wider range of onshore and offshore assets than traditional Australian money market funds, giving investors a greater level of asset diversification,” said Michael Larsen, Asia-Pacific Head of Liquidity Product, HSBC Global Asset Management.</p>
<p>The Australian cash market is substantial at around AU$2.5trn<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>, of which AU$233bn<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> is held in money market funds. The HSBC Australian Dollar Liquidity Fund offers same-day liquidity and has an AAA rating from both Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s. The fund invests in low-risk, high-quality money market instruments such as bank deposits, commercial paper, certificate or paper and short-term debt instruments.</p>
<p>“Many investors, particularly those in Asia Pacific, see the Australian market and currency as a strong and stable investment option. This new AUD fund will provide a viable low-risk cash management solution for investors while still providing attractive money market yields,” Larsen said.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar fund is the eleventh liquidity fund currency offered by HSBC Global Asset Management.</p>
<p>HSBC Global Asset Management is one of the world’s largest money market fund managers and currently has US$64bn in liquidity assets under management (September 2017).</p>

<p>This figure has been the largest single-day value since the company was founded and it highlights the continued strong appetite for cash from businesses around the world. In December alone, the amount of spend accelerated through Taulia grew 150% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This achievement underscores the growth of financial technology companies like Taulia into the B2B financing mainstream as providers of easy-to-access, liquidity for all companies. Over 1.5m companies have chosen to join Taulia’s network with 94% of the Fortune 500 using Taulia platform to accelerate access to cash. Together, these companies have transacted in excess of US$1.2trn invoices through Taulia’s platform.</p>
<p>The success is down to the flexibility offered by Taulia, which allows suppliers of all spend amounts to participate and consequently gives greater surety and control over the supply chain. Buyers are additionally empowered by data-driven innovation which provides rich insight into the supplier behaviour facilitating strategic decision making. Cedric Bru, Taulia’s CEO, said “We cannot overstate the importance of this achievement. Early payment options are now firmly part of any working capital improvement program and reaching this milestone shows that working capital and the ready access to cash continue to be on the minds of all businesses.” He added, “It also highlights the advancements that Taulia has made over the past few years. Our easy-to-use platform, access to flexible funding and Artificial Intelligence engine, Polarissm are key to placing companies across the supply chain in control of their cash.”</p>
<p>Demand for cash isn’t just linked to small companies either as is traditionally thought to be the case. Taulia’s data reveals that companies of all sizes elected to get an early payment. Kathleen Nugent, Head of Working Capital Management at Taulia, said: “The single largest invoice accelerated was US$11m by an engine manufacturer, and the smallest, just US$12 by a locksmith. Regardless of company size or industry, cash continues to matter”.</p>

<p>The Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MOSF) just issued draft regulations reducing the shareholding ownership threshold at which capital gains tax (CGT) will be triggered for foreign investors from 25% to 5% on listed securities transactions. It is proposed to take effect from 1<sup>st</sup> July 2018. This follows on from an earlier announcement by the MOSF on 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2017 whereby they initially publicized their intent to lower the threshold at which the CGT will be imposed on shares traded on the Korea Exchange.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.asifma.org/"" target=""_blank"">ASIFMA</a> had expressed concerns on the earlier proposal and continues to be deeply concerned with the current development. Currently, if a foreign investor and its related parties collectively hold less than 25% of a company, capital gains are exempt from tax. The proposed change means that CGT is triggered when the foreign investor and its related parties collectively hold 5% or more of the company at the time of the sale or at any point in time over the past five years. The CGT is the lower of 22% of the capital gains or 11% of the sales proceeds.</p>
<p>This is a significant change that poses extremely challenging operational hurdles for securities companies and for the overall Korean market infrastructure for little or no additional tax revenue for the Korean Government. Securities companies have the obligation to deduct and remit CGT (if any) to the Korean Government. By law they are required to be withholding agents, and if they fail to comply with this obligation, they have liability for the uncollected CGT plus penalties (ie they have secondary tax liability).</p>
<p>For securities companies to comply with this obligation, they will need to (i) determine the collective ownership percentage of the foreign investor and its related parties at the time of sale and over the past five years, and (ii) determine the acquisition price of the shares being sold. Under the current market infrastructure system in Korea, however, there is no mechanism for securities companies to obtain such information. Thus, they are not able to determine whether CGT is due nor how much, yet will be exposed to significant unknown tax liability as a withholding agent. To avoid being exposed to the secondary tax liability, securities companies may treat everything as a gain and deduct 11% of the total sales proceeds, which will burden the foreign investor to directly seek a refund from the Korean Government. A 11% withholding on all sales proceeds will have a significant detrimental impact to foreign investors and a disastrous consequence for the Korean equities market.</p>
<p>ASIFMA cautions that the CGT concerns transactions of listed shares on the Korea Exchange where the average daily equity trading volume was US$3.4bn in 2017, with a high of US$8.6bn and settlement is done on a T+2 cycle. Foreign investors can and do trade across multiple securities companies. A robust common market infrastructure system needs to be developed to provide in a timely manner the requisite information for securities companies to comply with their obligations. The overwhelming majority of foreign investors hold less than 5% of the shares of a Korean company. As a result, little, if any, actual tax revenue will be raised by this measure, whilst requiring substantial investment in technology and process to enable compliance and causing major disruptions.</p>
<p>If the MOSF wishes to proceed with the lowering of the threshold, ASIFMA recommends that they provide a mechanism for securities companies to practically comply with their withholding obligation. Investment should be made to develop market infrastructure (eg at Korea Exchange or another platform) to track ownership percentages and weighted average acquisition costs to provide such information on a real time basis to securities companies. This type of market infrastructure project takes considerable time to develop, and implementation should be delayed until it is ready. The MOSF is inviting public comment on the draft regulation until 29<sup>th</sup>January. We strongly advise they take into account the operational hurdles and current market infrastructure limitations before proceeding.</p>

<p>Since 2009, BIDV has consistently ranked first in terms of readiness for IT implementation in the Vietnam ICT Index of the Ministry of Information and Communications of Vietnam and Vietnam Association for Information Processing (VAIP) among Vietnamese commercial banks.</p>
<p>The bank joins more than 120 of the world’s major transaction banks that are already committed to the largest change initiative that the world of cross border payments has seen in the last 30 years. Since the go live of SWIFT gpi in January 2017, the service has taken off very rapidly and over 5 million payments have already been exchanged between 34 banks live around the world. With SWIFT gpi, cross-border payments no longer take 2 to 3 days, in fact 50% of the payments are completed within 2 hours and one third of them are completed in less than 30 minutes. Future releases of SWIFT gpi will include the ability to stop and recall payments and SWIFT is also engaging the global FinTech community to build additional services over SWIFT gpi. In parallel, the initiative is also exploring the use of distributed ledger technology. With SWIFT gpi, banks in Vietnam are able to offer their clients an enhanced cross-border payments experience in the emerging and rapidly growing market of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Tran Phuong, Senior Executive Vice President, BIDV said: “SWIFT gpi is the answer to the growing needs of our corporate customers as it removes the friction that used to exist in correspondent banking. We trust SWIFT gpi is the new norm for cross-border payments and we look forward to providing our clients with the best services available to support their evolving needs”.</p>
<p>Sharon Toh, Head of ASEAN Region, SWIFT said: “By joining SWIFT gpi and with strong ambitions in banking digitalisation, BIDV confirms their commitment to offer the best services to their clients. As Vietnamese corporates are increasingly working at an international level, the speed of settlement, certainty, transparency and traceability are critical and we trust SWIFT gpi will strongly support their ambitions”.</p>
