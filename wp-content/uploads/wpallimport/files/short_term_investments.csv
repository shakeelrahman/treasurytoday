<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>Here also, we implement our policy on responsible business conduct<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>. This follows UN guidelines as well as our own guiding principles around investable sectors and those excluded from our portfolios.</p>
<p>Admittedly, stringent rules can curb the range of eligible investment opportunities and affect portfolio yield, but we believe making a positive impact avoiding controversial practices is an important priority.</p>
<h4 id=""responsible-business-conduct"">Responsible business conduct</h4>
<p>Under our <a href=""https://docfinder.bnpparibas-am.com/api/files/D8E2B165-C94F-413E-BE2E-154B83BD4E9B"" target=""_blank"">responsible business conduct policy</a>, we exclude issuers such as tobacco or coal companies, even if that would limit – and it actually does – the returns that can be earned on the portfolio.</p>
<p>Per our coal policy, we exclude companies generating 10% or more of their revenues from thermal coal – even if they have interesting yields. We should note that across the broad money market investment universe, there are still about 3,000 issuers that qualify for the ESG category.</p>
<p>Excluding issuers with controversies, such as health problems in the case of tobacco or stranded assets in the case of oil and gas, represents sound risk avoidance. We should point out that issuers in these sectors might have reduced credit ratings affecting portfolio eligibility. Their issuance might be less liquid, and thus less attractive to us, given an investor reluctance to invest in such sectors.</p>
<h4 id=""esg-and-sri-labelled-money-market-investing"">ESG and SRI-labelled money market investing</h4>
<p>Before we quantify the effect, we should clarify that our money market funds universe follows two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Money market funds integrating ESG criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money market funds using best-in-class selection (‘SRI-labelled funds’)<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All our money market funds are classified as Article 8 under SFDR<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup>, requiring a minimum extra-financial coverage at the portfolio level of 90% of issuers or the assets under management. They also target a better ESG score<sup id=""fnref:5""><a href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">5</a></sup> than that of their investment universe on a daily basis. Best-in-class funds have an added selection criterion: they exclude the 20% worst performers in terms of their ESG score.</p>
<p>What does that mean for the investment universe? For ESG money market funds, we have identified more than 550 issuers that are covered by in-house credit analysts. Some two-thirds – more than 380 – can be considered ‘high credit quality’ and are eligible for investment by all BNP Paribas Asset Management money market funds.</p>
<p>For SRI-labelled money market funds, the process chosen at BNP Paribas Asset Management involves the exclusion of issuers with a poor ESG score in each sector. That leaves 280 eligible issuers for SRI-labelled funds after excluding the ESG laggards (ie a reduction of about 100 issuers, or 25% on our internal buy-list). We have calculated the opportunity cost of this selectivity as being a negligible one basis point.</p>
<p>On top of this exclusion criterion, SRI-labelled funds aim to better the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint and the gender diversity of their investment universe.</p>
<h4 id=""exhibit-1"">Exhibit 1: Money market investing – a two-pronged approach</h4>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/2022-06-28-tt-00-ad__bnp-am__exhibit-01__money-market-investing-a-two-pronged-approach__1423x774.png?la=en&amp;hash=A0DC720FA2E14D6AB5E5492757A57331"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Exhibit 1: Money market investing – a two-pronged approach"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/2022-06-28-tt-00-ad__bnp-am__exhibit-01__money-market-investing-a-two-pronged-approach__1423x774.png?la=en&amp;hash=A0DC720FA2E14D6AB5E5492757A57331"" title=""Exhibit 1: Money market investing – a two-pronged approach"" width=""967""/></a></p>

<h4 id=""do-no-harm-with-esg-integration"">Do no harm with ESG integration</h4>
<p>This underscores our belief, as part of our sustainable investment approach, that ESG integration improves risk-adjusted returns, even if – as is the case for money market funds – there is a trade-off between the ESG score and the yield. A high ESG score means a lower yield, in most cases.</p>
<p>However, that stands to reason since a higher score reflects a lower risk, which means a higher credit rating on average. That in turn allows an issuer to borrow more cheaply in the market.</p>
<p>We have found that even with this inverse relationship, we have been able to earn yields that exceed those of the funds’ benchmarks, bringing home the point that ESG integration does not have to come at the expense of performance.</p>
<h4 id=""transparency-is-key"">Transparency is key</h4>
<p>We believe ESG integration<sup id=""fnref:6""><a href=""#fn:6"" rel=""footnote"">6</a></sup> creates value for clients, also when it comes to money market funds. Here too, we apply our stewardship philosophy<sup id=""fnref:7""><a href=""#fn:7"" rel=""footnote"">7</a></sup> through which we engage with issuers and seek to use our influence to advocate for a low-carbon, inclusive economy and encourage them to improve their practices. Out of the eligible corporate universe for money market funds we engaged with 80 issuers in 2021.</p>
<p>A key element is this approach to money market investing, and one that sets us apart, is being fully transparent on the exclusion policy and the thresholds set in our reporting to clients, on the quality and availability of data for our ESG analysis and scoring, on issuers’ ESG scores and how we act as stewards and engage with issuers.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Money market funds (MMFs) continue to be a valuable short-term investment vehicle for corporate treasurers. “When you look at money market funds, they are one of the most regulated financial products globally,” explains Paul Przybylski, Head of Product and Strategy – Global Liquidity at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “They are extremely liquid products, and have a very diversified investor base given the size of the funds. And when it comes to stability, the evidence indicates that money market funds are one of the least volatile types of collective investment schemes out there.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, however, the initial phase of the pandemic presented the first real test MMFs had faced since the introduction of new rules following the financial crisis. As a result of the dash for cash, precipitated by the pandemic and the subsequent economic shutdown, MMFs experienced a surge in demand for liquidity from investors.</p>
<p>“Short-term cash markets essentially came to a standstill,” Przybylski recalls. “There were very wide spreads between commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposits (CDs). The banks themselves had limited capacity to intermediate in short-term markets as well, as they sought to shore up liquidity and capital, driven by the regulations that followed the financial crisis of 2008. And investors obviously de-risked, with heavy redemptions across all asset classes.”</p>
<p>During the most volatile period of the crisis, Przybylski notes, redemptions on J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s platform reached around 30%. However, this was relatively short-lived: “By the summer, we saw a significant return of the assets into the same exact products, actually breaching highs prior to the crisis of 2020.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">MMF reform in the US and Europe</h2>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Following the financial crisis, regulators in the US and Europe took steps to increase the resilience of money market funds in the event of future market challenges.</p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) embarked on a programme of reform. The new rules, which came into effect in 2016, saw constant net asset value (CNAV) funds required to switch to a variable net asset value (VNAV) model. Other measures included the introduction of redemption gates to prevent redemptions if weekly liquid assets were to fall below 30% of the fund’s total assets, and a 1% redemption fee to be imposed if weekly liquidity falls below 10%.</p>
<p>Europe took a somewhat different direction with its own reforms, which came into effect in 2018-2019. The new rules included the introduction of a new low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) model, to sit alongside VNAV funds and public debt CNAV MMFs. Liquidity fees, redemption gates and suspension of redemptions can be imposed if liquidity falls below 30% and daily net redemptions exceed 10% of the fund’s total assets, with mandatory fees and gates applying if liquidity falls below 10%.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""challenges-today"">Challenges today</h4>
<p>Fast forward to 2022, and the landscape has evolved considerably. The conflict in Ukraine has provided another shock to financial markets, with a knock-on impact on the global economy.</p>
<p>“The conflict hasn’t had a direct impact on the types of instruments and high-quality issuers that a well-run money fund invests in,” says Hugo Parry-Wingfield, EMEA Head of Liquidity Investment Specialists at HSBC Asset Management. “But as with any times of disruption, it leads to some adjustments being made.” For example, he says, HSBC Asset Management’s funds are currently running with higher-than-normal levels of liquidity – “which is simply a prudent discipline to follow whenever there’s any market disruption.”</p>
<p>Other notable developments include the prospect of further interest rate hikes, as well as the challenges brought by rising inflation, notes Beccy Milchem, Managing Director – Head of EMEA Cash Management at BlackRock. In addition, she says, few conversations with clients do not touch on the topic of sustainability.</p>
<p>“It’s very topical, given the backdrop around the energy crisis that’s playing out in markets,” Milchem notes. “What we are starting to see is that as investment policies are written, sustainability is front and centre of mind. That goes all the way through from a treasury perspective to cash investing, and what more clients can be doing as short-term investors.”</p>
<h4 id=""return-of-regulatory-reform"">Return of regulatory reform?</h4>
<p>The performance of money market funds during the unprecedented stresses of the pandemic have been identified as evidence that the recent regulatory changes have succeeded in their goals. “In our opinion, the rules that money funds have to follow in Europe and elsewhere have generally worked well,” says Parry-Wingfield.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, regulatory attention is once again on the agenda. “There’s been a particular focus from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to look at how money funds managed the crisis,” Parry-Wingfield notes. “They’ve been considering whether there are any perceived weaknesses or areas where those rules could be further enhanced to improve the resilience of money funds.”</p>
<p>One particular focus is on the value of liquidity fees and redemption gates, which arguably incentivise investors to redeem pre-emptively during times of market stress, in order to avoid being subject to those fees and gates.</p>
<p>In the US, the SEC voted in December 2021 to <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-258"" target=""_blank"">propose a new round of changes</a>, with the goal of improving the resilience and transparency of MMFs, and reducing the likelihood of future runs on MMFs during periods of stress. The proposed changes include higher liquidity requirements, as well as the removal of liquidity fees and gates. Instead, funds would be required to implement swing pricing arrangements, under which redeeming investors would bear the liquidity costs of redemptions.</p>
<p>In Europe, meanwhile, the EC is already scheduled to review the adequacy of the structures introduced in the 2017 regulation by July 2022. In February, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) <a href=""https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma34-49-437_finalreportmmfreview.pdf"" target=""_blank"">issued a report</a> outlining its opinion on proposed reforms to the regulatory framework for EU MMFs. The proposed measures include decoupling regulatory thresholds from suspensions, gates and redemption fees, as well as other actions such as removing the possibility of using amortised costs for LVNAV MMFs.</p>
<h4 id=""impact-of-future-changes"">Impact of future changes</h4>
<p>The question is to what extent further regulatory changes will affect the appeal of money market funds for investors. Przybylski recalls the significant impact of the 2016 US reforms: “As a result of that action, US$1.1trn equivalent of prime assets shifted into government money market funds. The prime space has definitely shrunk – the overall industry is now about US$600bn, from a number that was close to US$1.3trn in the past. So the challenge is regulation that by design limits choice for investors.”</p>
<p>In Europe, likewise, industry players are looking closely at the impact of future changes on investors. “The ESMA proposal calls for the ability to round to one to be removed, which would effectively eliminate the LVNAV money market fund – instead, you would end up with a third variable NAV structure,” explains BlackRock’s Milchem.</p>
<p>She adds that it is only three years since investors spent a considerable amount of time and resources building policies, controls and oversight of the new product structures that were created under the 2017 policy framework. “So we think that corporate treasurers will share our position that a policy response eliminating this structure is not really appropriate, absent some clear evidence that the structure itself resulted in this vulnerability in March 2020 – which we think is hard to evidence.”</p>
<h4 id=""investor-voices"">Investor voices</h4>
<p>While the proposed changes could have significant repercussions if they come to pass, however, this could take some time to materialise. “In terms of where we are at this stage in Europe, it’s important for investors to be clear that no rule changes have yet been determined,” says Parry-Wingfield. “Secondly, it’s still not known when that would be, or what any implementation period would be.” He points out that during the previous reform, this was a process that took many years to complete. “So I think it’s very important for investors to keep up-to-date with what’s going on – but this isn’t something that’s about to happen in the next few months.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, says Parry-Wingfield, it is important that investors take part in the conversation so that their voices are heard – for example, by responding to the European Commission’s public consultation, which is open until 13th May.</p>
<p>Milchem, likewise, notes “there is still time to help shape that landscape, and the value placed on the utility of money market funds needs to be conveyed to policy makers. One aim that we at BlackRock have – and I know that the Institutional Money Market Funds Association (IMMFA) has as well – is around bringing investor voices to the table to help influence the debate.”</p>

</img></div>
<h4 style=""clear:both;"">How does Whitbread use MMFs?</h4>
<p>It’s part of the toolkit that we have for our surplus cash. At the moment, the options that we use are either bank deposits, savings accounts with the group of banks that provide us with a revolving credit facility, or MMFs. We have a small group of relationship banks, and we have a fairly restrictive treasury policy around how much we can invest with any given counterparty.</p>
<p>We like MMFs because they give us same-day access. We like the yield when we can get it, but it’s not our main focus – it really is about security and liquidity, and it enables us to diversify our investments far more than we could do on our own.</p>
<h4>How has your use of MMFs changed over the last couple of years?</h4>
<p>We’ve ended up with far more cash, mainly because of things we did to strengthen our balance sheet. In June 2020, the business raised approximately £1bn for a rights issue. Then in early 2021, we went through the bond markets and raised £550m. Some of that was used to retire existing debt, but it also added to the amount of cash on our balance sheet.</p>
<p>We heard about concerns at the time the pandemic started around the possibility of fund liquidity levels and demands on the funds, so we’ve always kept a close eye on assets under management and liquidity levels. But we haven’t used MMFs any differently.</p>
<h4>What do you see as the pros and cons of MMFs in today’s environment?</h4>
<p>The pros are same day liquidity, preservation of capital and diversification of risk. These funds are far better able to diversify the risks than we are – they are invested in several dozen different counterparties and types of instruments, which we wouldn’t have the infrastructure to do on our own. They are also very easy to use. When we started out, we were trading over the phone, but now we use the Goldman Sachs Mosaic platform, which is integrated with our treasury management system, Reval. I can’t think of any cons – we haven’t had any negative experiences with them.</p>
<h4>Is the prospect of further MMF regulation on your radar?</h4>
<p>Yes, I took part in a round table that one of our MMF providers arranged for corporates with the UK authorities last year. It seems like a long way off, and by that stage our cash balance might have come down considerably. But we are looking at alternatives – I imagine it would be hard for me to get sign-off to invest much, if any, of our cash in VNAV instruments.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Money market funds have seen significant changes in recent years – and more is to come. Following the introduction of regulatory reforms prompted by the financial crisis, the volatility caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has once again triggered calls for change, with various proposals currently under consideration. At the same time, money market funds are facing additional challenges as a result of continuing low interest rates – and the growing focus on incorporating ESG into the investment process is also shaping the development of the sector. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at how money markets have fared during the crisis, and the factors that are likely to affect the direction of travel going forward.</p>
<h4 id=""from-regulatory-reform-to-a-dash-for-cash"">From regulatory reform to a ‘dash for cash’</h4>
<p>Regulatory change has long been a theme in the world of money market funds. In the US, the 2008-2009 financial crisis saw the Reserve Primary Fund ‘breaking the buck’, with the resulting run on money market funds prompting significant regulatory change. In Europe, the focus of money market fund reform included replacing constant net asset value (CNAV) funds with low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) funds. In the US, meanwhile, CNAV funds were required to move to a variable net asset value (VNAV) model. In addition, both sides of the Atlantic introduced the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates if liquidity falls below a certain threshold.</p>
<p>These measures were intended to make money market funds more robust in the event of another crisis – a goal that was severely tested in early 2020, when the beginning of the pandemic brought considerable volatility. The US saw outflows of US$125bn from prime MMFs in March 2020, which prompted the Fed to step in with the creation of the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF). European funds, likewise, experienced significant outflow pressures.</p>
<p>Laurie Brignac, Chief Investment Officer and Head of Invesco Global Liquidity, recalls the uncertainty that arose during the critical timeframe from February to the end of April 2020: “As economies began shutting down, we saw a ‘dash for cash’ as people and corporations sought to hold as much cash as possible amid the uncertainty that reigned at that time.”</p>
<p>Initially, says Brignac, “we were wondering if we would see large inflows into money market funds since they are generally the ‘flight to quality’ vehicle of choice for many investors. By the time we started seeing outflows from money market funds and they sought to raise additional liquidity, dealer balance sheets were already quite clogged with other securities. It was a very tough time.” Following central bank interventions, she adds, “markets did start to function more normally as they gained confidence that the central banks stood ready to provide support as needed.”</p>
<h4 id=""gauging-the-next-steps"">Gauging the next steps</h4>
<p>In the wake of these challenges, regulators are once again reviewing existing money market fund regulations to explore whether further action is needed. For one thing, concerns have been raised that some of the measures introduced by recent reforms may have had unintended consequences, particularly the use of redemption gates and liquidity fees to prevent redemptions if weekly liquid assets (WLA) fall below 30% of the fund’s total assets. Preliminary research published by the Fed suggested that “the expectation that other investors will withdraw money and drive WLA below the 30% threshold may incentivise them to run pre-emptively before such liquidity restrictions are imposed.”</p>
<p>In December, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets in the US released a report on money market funds, exploring the impact of the crisis and setting out potential reform options – albeit without endorsing any particular course of action. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published a consultation report in June 2021, while the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) ran a consultation between 26th March and 30th June 2021 looking at potential areas of reform.</p>
<p>The types of reform under discussion are wide ranging. According to Invesco’s Brignac, potential money market reforms fall into four distinct categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The operation and structure of liquidity buffers.</strong> “For example, policy makers are considering removing the regulatory tie between portfolio liquidity and the potential application of fees and gates,” says Brignac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product changes.</strong> Brignac notes that one proposal under discussion is “requiring money market funds to adopt a floating net asset value (NAV) structure, versus a constant NAV, to remove perceived regulatory ‘bright lines’ for investors – such as the liquidity buffer – and to reduce a perceived ‘first-mover advantage’ for investors seeking to redeem at par during periods of market stress.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bank-like reforms.</strong> This could include introducing an additional capital buffer alongside existing liquidity buffers within funds, or mandating membership in a liquidity exchange bank. “We suggest policy makers reconsider the appropriateness of applying bank-like reforms to money market funds, not only because money market funds are not banks, but because they could undermine the vital role money market funds play in channelling liquidity to the real economy,” comments Brignac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sponsor support.</strong> Brignac says that in the EU, regulators are considering whether existing rules should be strengthened to ensure the prohibition of sponsor support is absolutely clear – “while in the US, policy makers are considering introducing a framework governing sponsor support to clarify the risks borne by money market funds and their sponsors.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whichever types of reform are ultimately chosen, it seems likely that money market funds will once again see significant changes in the coming years – and as Aidan Shevlin, Head International Liquidity Fund Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management notes, any period of change will create uncertainty. “Tighter guidelines should improve liquidity and security, but will also likely impact returns,” he comments. “Meanwhile, any accounting changes will require internal adjustments to accommodate.”</p>
<h4 id=""low-interest-rates"">Low interest rates</h4>
<p>Regulatory reform is not the only factor currently weighing on money market funds. Another challenge is the continuing issue of low interest rates, particularly given the high levels of cash currently held by many companies. “Following the outbreak of COVID-19, most companies significantly increased their cash balances,” says Jonathan Curry, Global CIO Liquidity at HSBC Asset Management. “While some sectors have had to use portions of that cash, many others continue to hold balances that are much higher than their previous levels.”</p>
<p>Low interest rates continue to present another challenge for investors when it comes to earning a return on that cash. “Globally, central banks have pinned base rates at record lows while markets are awash with liquidity, further depressing market driven yields,” comments Shevlin. “Returns on many money-market instruments remain close to zero (in the US, UK, Australia, etc) or below zero (in the EU). Meanwhile, banks and financial institutions, caught between excess liquidity and tighter rules, are reluctant to accept additional time deposits.” Shevlin notes that this has created significant challenges for corporate treasurers, who are still seeking to invest higher than average cash balances.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, Curry says he has seen increased interest from corporate treasurers for ultra-short duration fixed income investment strategies that take limited interest rate and credit risk to improve yield. “These strategies can be a useful tool for corporate treasurers in a range of global currencies, but it’s important to ensure that an investor weighs the risks against the opportunity for increased return,” he observes.</p>
<p>Shevlin adds that a combination of diversification and step out strategies “should allow corporate treasurers to get fully invested and achieve a more competitive yield, while retaining a focus on security and liquidity.” He also emphasises the value of good cash forecasting, which can allow cash to be segmented into operating, reserve and strategic cash categories – “allowing for different investment strategies to increase returns without significantly expanding risk.”</p>
<h4 id=""mmfs-and-esg"">MMFs and ESG</h4>
<p>Beyond the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the challenges associated with a low interest rate environment, a further factor affecting the development of money market funds is the growing focus on ESG and sustainability. As HSBC Asset Management’s Curry observes: “We have seen a sharp increase in interest from corporate treasurers seeking to align their investment activities with their company’s sustainability objectives.”</p>
<p>A number of factors are driving this focus on ESG and sustainability, as Shevlin points out. “ESG considerations have rapidly emerged as a crucial challenge, especially as extreme weather events and the growing importance of equality have heightened consumers’ and companies’ awareness of these issues,” he comments. “This implies that ESG factors are an increasingly important part of investing and the due diligence process.”</p>
<p>As such, Shevlin says that treasurers are progressively seeking to incorporate ESG into their cash management and liquidity fund selection process. “Regulators and central banks are also considering incorporating these factors, with the EU setting early standards through the introduction of SFDR Article 6 and 8 funds classification system, while the European Central Bank is planning to establish ESG rules and is tilting its purchases towards green investments,” he adds. “Across Asia, local regulators are also debating how to include and improve environment standards, with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan all recently announcing ESG-related rules.”</p>
<p>In this environment, Shevlin says a key focus for investors should be on understanding how ESG is incorporated into credit analysis and the security selection process. “If the credit analyst believes that the ESG factors are material and may impact issuer risks, the analysis will be reflected in the analyst’s credit opinion,” he says. “The ability to incorporate this analysis into the investment process and portfolio implementation is also important.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-way-forward"">The way forward?</h4>
<p>There’s no doubt that the crisis has brought some additional challenges for money market funds – and with regulatory reform once again on the horizon, treasurers will need to be prepared for any future changes. In the meantime, money market funds still fulfil a valuable function for treasurers seeking to manage their short-term investments. As Curry points out, “Money market funds continued to play an important role in helping companies around the world manage these elevated cash balances through challenging economic and interest rate environments in 2020 and 2021.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Challenges in APAC</h2>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In the APAC region, the post-pandemic environment poses significant challenges for corporate treasurers, says Jonathan Curry, Global CIO Liquidity at HSBC Asset Management.</p>
<p>“While the support measures put in place by Central Banks are fostering economic recovery, they are distorting liquidity and suppressing yields, making it difficult for treasurers to find value in short term investments,” he says. “Uncertainty around monetary policy also means that finding an appropriate investment for medium term and strategic cash is challenging, as investors look to limit their exposure to interest rate risk.”</p>
<p>With the added impact on domestic economies from renewed lockdown measures and tighter border restrictions, Curry says treasurers in the region are “holding increasing cash buffers and prioritising capital preservation and liquidity until the economic outlook is more certain.”</p></div>

<p>Treasurers are looking more closely than ever at sustainability – but the industry can be confusing to investors and issuers alike, not least because of the plethora of different terms and acronyms in use, and the different interpretations of what those terms mean.</p>
<p>When approaching the topic of responsible investment, understanding the terminology is a good place to start. As Joshua Kendall, Head of Responsible Investment Research and Stewardship at Insight Investment explains, key terms that treasurers should be aware of include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG).</strong> While the term ESG is well known, it means different things to different investors. Some may talk about ESG as the risk factors that are integrated into their decision-making processes, while others might cite ESG as the reason for screening companies from portfolios on ethical grounds.</p>

<h4 id=""what-does-responsible-investing-mean-for-treasurers"">What does responsible investing mean for treasurers?</h4>
<p>Where treasurers are concerned, Kendall says it is important to understand what this topic means for investors. “There is more emphasis than ever before on a company’s sustainability performance, isolating those companies that are potentially laggards in the management of sustainability-related risks,” he comments. And as Kendall notes, there is also more recognition that poor management of ESG issues can lead to credit risks, as well as the inability to borrow at a competitive rate.</p>
<p>In addition, the growing focus on this area means that companies are being held more accountable for sustainability issues – not least because any egregious developments can have a bearing on credit quality and the cost of capital. “This is perhaps an area which is new to some treasury teams,” Kendall notes. “It means getting more involved across the organisation to engage more directly with sustainability teams, hold them accountable for their actions, and ensure the treasury team has more visibility on what’s being done.”</p>
<p>What’s more, with issuers looking to introduce sustainability targets linked to the raising of debt and loans, there’s a growing need for treasury teams to consider how they can use sustainability within their everyday cash management activities.</p>
<h4 id=""catalysts-for-change"">Catalysts for change</h4>
<p>Responsible investing is an evolving topic, but different parts of the world are experiencing different pressures. In the EU and UK, for example, regulatory developments like SFDR and TCFD are a significant driver – but regulation to promote responsible investment is less evident in the US.</p>
<p>At the same time, awareness of issues like climate risks has been raised by the efforts of individuals like David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg – and of course, reputation is an important consideration for companies everywhere.</p>
<p>Alongside these factors, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue to define the investor landscape for years to come. “Sustainability has a greater purpose than ever before,” says Kendall. “It’s not just seen as a ‘nice to have’, but as a ‘must have’.”</p>
<h4 id=""market-drivers"">Market drivers</h4>
<p>Where market drivers are concerned, another point of interest is the development of impact bonds. “These are a conventional bond where the use of proceeds is carved out to invest in specific projects which might have an environmental or social purpose,” Kendall explains. “That’s increasingly relevant for us as an investor, because we have clients expecting us to allocate a small percentage of their portfolio towards green bonds – but the big challenge is that there are not enough green bonds.”</p>
<p>As Kendall points out, there is “strong evidence” that a green bond issued by a treasury department may create opportunities to borrow at a lower rate than a non-green bond – “and that financial incentive is one that should be explored in more detail by treasury departments.”</p>
<p>In addition, he notes that while responsible investment has historically focused on equities and, more recently, on corporate bonds, “we’re starting to see asset class is now expected to have a process where ESG factors and stewardship factors are incorporated into the investment decision-making process.”</p>
<p>As Kendall concludes, “responsible investment is something that treasury teams should be spending a lot of time thinking about. It doesn’t just impact investors – it impacts treasury teams and corporations too.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>If a week is a long time in politics, a year is a long time during a pandemic. Twelve months have passed since the world was first alerted to the discovery of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan – with the resulting crisis bringing unprecedented disruption for people and businesses around the world.</p>
<p>During this time, treasury teams have been affected in numerous ways. Alongside the surge in remote working, the crisis has also led to myriad challenges and changes, including supply chain disruption, currency volatility and rising levels of cybercrime. And above all, the crisis has led to a heightened focus on the importance of liquidity.</p>
<p>Aidan Shevlin, Head of Asian Liquidity Fund Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, notes that ensuring sufficient liquidity was a key priority early in the crisis, triggering a flight to cash in March and a jump in interest rate volatility. “Having ready access to liquid cash was critical – especially as secondary market liquidity disappeared and banks were increasingly reluctant to trade bonds or release deposits early,” he says.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Shevlin continues, treasurers were focused on having sufficient funds to weather extended periods of lockdown and lower revenue. “Raising cash in the bond markets or via bank loans was important to keep business operating during an uncertain future,” he says. “This meant that treasurers were managing significantly more cash than normal, much of which would be held for several months or even years.”</p>
<p>Beyond the focus on liquidity, the crisis has had other implications for short-term investments in the region:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Interest rate cuts.</h5>
<p>Venkat ES, head of Asia Treasury Product, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America, points out that a number of central banks cut policy rates to historic lows, causing low yields in many of the preferred investment currencies. “This resulted in a significant hit in the yield pick-up for short term investments,” he says. “Corporations are also concerned whether COVID-19 will trigger the credit downgrade of banks and investments that was witnessed in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. As such, there is a greater emphasis for companies on striking a good balance between security and liquidity vs yield when they decide on their investment policies and execution.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Operational changes.</h5>
<p>Operationally, Venkat explains, the arrival of lockdowns and extended work from home arrangements has led to an increased move towards digitalisation and the management of short-term investments using online methods. “Cybersecurity procedures and processes were also adopted and implemented in quick time to ensure investments are managed efficiently,” he adds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""stepping-up"">Stepping up</h3>
<p>Against this backdrop, treasurers have had to adapt rapidly to highly challenging conditions, while also keeping in mind the complexity of Asia’s diverse markets and regulatory considerations.</p>
<p>“The primary goal of treasurers is to ensure an institution’s cash is liquid and secure,” explains Shevlin. “Having immediate access to cash to pay bills and expenses as they fall due is critical.” He adds that ensuring cash is liquid – in other words, matures within one or two days – required several steps: “Treasurers sold more illiquid assets (or let them mature and did not roll them); they reduced risk in cash portfolios; and they increased the cash portfolio diversification across multiple different banks and products (including liquidity and money market funds).”</p>
<p>In addition, Shevlin says, treasurers have helped raise funds by issuing bonds or drawing down bank credit lines. “Lower interest rates and specific schemes by central banks have helped make this more affordable and easier for treasurers,” he notes.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""efficiency-and-consolidation"">Efficiency and consolidation</h3>
<p>Internal sources of liquidity have also been an important consideration for organisations across the region. Venkat says that treasurers have been focusing on internal efficiency and consolidating funds across departments, entities and geographies “to get better visibility and control on available funds, so they can utilise them for cash flow needs before considering any short-term investments.”</p>
<p>In addition, he says, they have reviewed their investment policies, risk frameworks and funding forecasts and have taken actions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing the frequency of review on financial institution credit ratings, credit limits and exposures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationalising relationship banks and streamlining accounts to core relationship banks and those that meet credit/counterparty policy requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving from long-term to medium or short-term forecasting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the weighted average maturity (WAM) of investment portfolios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carrying out more frequent reviews on how the investment strategy is performing, and making adjustments as required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""from-sustainability-to-digitisation"">From sustainability to digitisation</h3>
<p>Beyond the immediate focus on liquidity, the COVID-19 crisis has also affected short-term investments in other ways, driving a greater emphasis on the importance of sustainability and accelerating the adoption of automation tools.</p>
<p>“One specific observation to call out is that COVID has been the catalyst for many treasurers and corporate boards to review their sustainability commitments, given the increased amount people of spent working from home – making note of things that should not be taken for granted, like travel,” explains Lewis Sun, Head of Product, Asia Pacific, Global Liquidity and Cash Management at HSBC.</p>
<p>Sun adds that this introspection has translated into a more active search for financial products that are explicitly linked to a sustainability agenda. He cites HSBC’s Green Deposits solution which he says “has seen a strong pickup since its launch earlier in the year.”</p>
<p>In addition, Sun highlights the increasing need for digitisation as treasurers embark on treasury transformation projects, noting that automated investment of short-term liquidity is gaining popularity in the market. “In order to support investment decisions, corporates will demand real-time cash visibility and control to manage their short-term investments and adopt digital tools to meet their cash reconciliation, transparency and future cash flow objectives,” he says.</p>
<p>Venkat, meanwhile, predicts that innovative products being rolled out by banks and financial institutions, such as Virtual Account Management (VAM) and intelligent treasury and forecasting systems “will likely lead to a complete revamp of the traditional decision-making by treasurers on short-term investments.”</p>
<h3 id=""changing-landscape"">Changing landscape</h3>
<p>As the crisis continues, the short-term investment landscape in APAC is continuing to evolve. J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Shevlin observes that while markets have partially normalised, “the background to how treasurers manage an organisation’s cash has changed dramatically.”</p>
<p>For one thing, he says, lower interest rates are making it difficult to achieve a competitive return without assuming substantial duration and illiquidity risk. Also significant are changes to the range of issuers, instruments and counterparties.</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">

<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>“Banks need less funding (due to central bank lending programs and falling loan demand), while corporates are borrowing further out the yield curve,” says Shevlin. “Therefore treasurers need to be more cognisant of credit risk and diversification risk.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shevlin says, volatility remains higher than it as previously – “so treasurers cannot be as reliant on selling securities to ensure liquidity. Better to improve cash forecasting and ladder maturities to meet liquidity requirements.”</p>
<h3 id=""trends-to-watch-in-2021"">Trends to watch in 2021</h3>
<p>Where the year ahead is concerned, BofA’s Venkat highlights some key trends that are expected, including a preference for short-term or overnight investments due to the importance of maintaining higher liquidity levels as a buffer when cash flows are uncertain. He also predicts a reallocation from money market funds to other short-term investment products, “due to falling yield as well as increased focus on security and liquidity.”</p>
<p>When it comes to evaluating investments, he expects this will no longer be carried out through the metric of yield pick-up only. Instead, he says, it will be “a holistic proposition across available liquidity and real-time (or near real-time) access to funds, level of automation in placement and redemption, quality and frequency of reporting available (including new technologies like API) and market/counterparty risk exposures.”</p>
<p>Sun, meanwhile, predicts that as the interest rate environment remains challenging over the coming months, there will be a focus on innovation in terms of the types of solutions available. “We foresee that banks will develop and provide new ways for clients to invest that are aligned to sustainability and client ESG policies,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""navigating-short-term-investment-challenges"">Navigating short-term investment challenges</h3>
<p>For treasurers looking to manage their short-term investments effectively in APAC, there are some important considerations to bear in mind. As Shevlin notes, “While there are hopes that the global economy can normalise as vaccines are rolled out, this could take some time – meanwhile, second and third waves of the virus are causing additional challenges.”</p>
<p>In this uncertain climate, the focus for treasurers, as always, will be on balancing the need to preserve capital against their liquidity and yield requirements. At the same time, treasurers will need to ensure that their investment policies remain up-to-date and suited to their companies’ specific needs.</p>
<p>As Shevlin explains, “A well-written policy provides clarity, instils discipline, and allows the organisation to successfully navigate shifting markets, changing regulations and evolving business needs. Treasurers should also be defining short term investment objectives and the strategies for achieving them. In the post-COVID-19 world this can help establish acceptable levels of risk, identify permissible investments and detail relevant constraints.”</p>
<p>He also points out that segmenting cash allows organisations to optimise their investment choices by ensuring they have enough liquid cash available to meet their daily needs, while avoiding the opportunity costs associated with very high levels of liquidity and protecting the principal. “This is achieved by diversifying across different types of cash investment, depending on their level of liquidity, volatility and diversification,” he says.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, Venkat notes that treasurers should be cognisant of the need to build flexibility into their liquidity plans when weighing different short-term investment options. Meanwhile, he notes that there continues to be uncertainty around the direction of interest rates and inflationary trends, both regionally and globally. “While planning their investment policies and options, a key consideration should be risk diversification,” he says, adding that better rated banks and instruments will be under greater focus as treasurers decide how to invest their surplus cash.</p>
<p>Last but not least, he warns that treasurers should be prepared for the prospect of a negative interest rate environment as central banks around the world work to prevent a long-lasting recession. “The one compelling factor playing on the minds of the corporate treasurers is the likelihood of negative interest rates,” he comments. “Treasuries need to have a robust strategy and plan in place on how they will manage the investment of such currencies when interest rates turn negative, mainly US dollar.”</p></div>

<p>Negative interest rates are not a new concept, having been previously introduced by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2014. But could the UK adopt negative interest rates for sterling in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis? And what would this mean for UK money market funds?</p>
<h4 id=""live-policy-option"">Live policy option</h4>
<p>At this stage, negative sterling rates continue to be a more remote possibility. “Our central case remains that we don’t expect negative rates,” comments Paul Mueller, Senior Portfolio Manager at Invesco. “But seeing as the UK economy is being hit with a once-in-a-generation impact, not just with COVID-19 but also with Brexit, I think it’s certainly a non-negligible risk.”</p>
<p>Since the Bank of England cut rates to 10 basis points earlier this year, the focus of subsequent actions has been on increasing quantitative easing, says Mueller. “So that seems to be the preferred option at present – but we may get to the point where there could be operational issues, for example,  the bank  won’t want to distort the free float of gilts in the market.”</p>
<p>And with the Bank of England carrying out a full review of the possible impact of negative rates on banks, Mueller says it is clear this is a “live policy option”, in a way that it hasn’t been in the past. And while recent vaccine announcements have brought positive news, plenty of uncertainty remains where 2021 is concerned.</p>
<h4 id=""implications-of-yield"">Implications for yield</h4>
<p>For money market funds, the major question is what negative rates would mean for yield. As Natalie Cross, Senior Client Portfolio Manager at Invesco notes, money market funds are highly liquid, meaning that any changes in bank rates tend to filter through reasonably quickly – particularly at present, with funds holding more liquidity due to the uncertainty brought by the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the event of negative rates, Cross says the gross yield of funds would “certainly go down” – although she adds that most MMF providers are committed to waiving management fees in order to try to continue offering a positive yield. “Obviously it would depend on the level of the rate cut, the market reaction and the resulting impact on reinvestment levels,” she says.</p>
<p>Cross also points out that under current regulations, fund providers are not permitted to support money market funds – “so once the gross yield of a fund falls into negative territory, there’s nothing a fund provider can do to prop that fund up and keep it at zero or positive yielding return.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mueller notes that some issuers, especially at the front end of the curve, are already offering negative yields. “Yields are not just a function of rates, but also of credit spreads, and supply and demand,” he says. “So if there is an excess of demand versus supply of paper, that could also put downward pressure on yields, even without any movement in interest rates.”</p>
<h4 id=""other-impacts"">Other impacts</h4>
<p>Aside from yield, another consideration is that a negative yielding environment would affect the share classes that money market funds are able to offer. “As a result of the recent reform, negative yielding money market funds are no longer allowed to offer distribution share classes,” Cross explains. “For those funds, clients would only have the option of accumulation classes. These operate slightly differently from distribution classes, while still very much remaining part of the same fund, with identical fee levels.”</p>
<p>The key differences between the two are that accumulation classes do not transact at a price of 1.00, or distribute income on a monthly basis. “Instead, they roll the income into the price of the share class on a daily basis,” says Cross. “So that’s quite a significant impact in terms of how the product operates.”</p>
<h4 id=""ready-or-not"">Ready or not?</h4>


Given the significance that negative rates would have for money market funds, what should corporate treasurers be doing now to prepare for this possibility?


<p>For one thing, says Cross, treasurers should communicate with their money market fund providers to understand what the process will be if yields turn negative – “Will they move investors into new share classes? Will they convert existing share classes across to an accumulation version? Will clients need to submit an instruction in order for them to do that?”</p>
<p>Treasurers should also consider whether their existing treasury management strategy covers the possibility of negative yields – and if not, they should update their strategies as soon as possible, not least because negative rates would also likely affect bank deposits and other short-term investments. Similarly, treasurers should ensure that their treasury management systems can handle negative yields.</p>
<p>Of course, investors who held euro deposits or money market funds in 2014 will already have gone through this process. But Cross points out that things may be different this time. “For some banks, there was a waterfall effect, with investors that were holding larger balances seeing negative yields sooner than investors with smaller balances,” she says. “But now banks are much more prepared – so if rates do go negative on the sterling side, it will be a lot easier for them to switch over immediately, meaning there may not be the same staggered effect.”</p>

<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>The investing mantra for treasurers, ‘security, liquidity, yield (SLY)’, is an “oldie but a goodie” according to Serina Hourican, Head of Asia Pacific Commercial Sales, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America. In times of uncertainty, going back to this basic principle is important. However, a new balance of the mantra is needed in times of crisis – as discussed in this recent Treasury Today piece.</p>
<h4 id=""still-sly"">Still SLY?</h4>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, Hourican says keeping a focus on security is a given to ensure a company gets at least 100% of all deposits back. However, many companies also need to keep funds as liquid as possible in order to make sure that they can afford their day-to-day operational payments. “Given the pandemic, we’re seeing clients looking more at having access to turn their investments into cash very quickly – without having to pay any penalty fees,” she says.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to the globally low – and in some cases, negative – interest rates, many clients aren’t actually wanting to lock funds away in investments. Yield, meanwhile, is “at the back of the queue,” says Hourican. “Back in the day when interest rates were high, yield was important for treasurers because their KPIs would be focused on reducing fees and growing revenue,” she explains. “But now we’re in this pandemic situation, and yield has to be forgone to put a prudent risk management process and policy in place.” For treasurers in especially hard-hit industries, it’s even more important to keep more money as liquid as possible, she adds.</p>
<p>More recently, Hourican has been pleased to see that many treasurers are examining in more detail the policy and thresholds of the credit ratings of the banks and asset managers they’re placing funds with, and even the funds themselves. As many make a flight to quality, she is keen to emphasise the additional importance of diversifying investments: “Coupling the SLY approach with making sure you’ve got a well-diversified portfolio will help in these times of volatility.”</p>
<p>For Saurabh Chakravarty, Jt President, Finance at UltraTech Cement Ltd, the benefits of a well-diversified portfolio are simple: improve the risk-to-return ratio, and provide both minimal pains around losses and a simple and effective way to protect capital. He believes that diversifying funds acts as a natural hedge against volatility, and both he and Hourican agree that put simply, treasurers should not “keep all their eggs in one basket”.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that diversification stretches beyond just different industry sectors though. As Chakravarty points out, “diversification across asset classes, currencies, countries, intra-asset classes, tenors and styles” are all necessary. In short, assets shouldn’t correlate with one another.</p>
<h4 id=""how-long-do-you-want-it"">How long do you want it?</h4>
<p>Length of investments is also a factor in diversifying funds. For treasurers, achieving an optimum balance between short, medium or long-term investment strategies is essential for maintaining the necessary liquidity.</p>
<p>However, Hourican also notes that determining the length of investments a company should have is more nuanced than many think. “It depends on your company, the investment policy, the industry, where the company is in its life cycle. Is it just a growing company? How do you define what is medium and what is long-term?” she asks.</p>
<p>For some corporates, short-term is anything under one year, medium-term is one to three years, and long-term is over three years. “But I’ve seen more recently the reduction of those durations,” she says. Instead, short-term has been overnight to three months, medium-term is three months to one year, and long-term is over one year. She predicts that corporates will be rebalancing towards short and medium-term investments, especially considering the extremely low interest rates across the world. “Before, long-term meant more risks but more rewards. But with most global interest rates being so low, where is the risk – reward trade off?”</p>
<p>Chakravarty is of a similar view. “The two-fold responsibility of the treasurer – to maximise return and minimise risk – drives them to balance between tenors to optimise yields,” he says. As a result, he believes medium-term investments are generally the best placed for this, as it is easier to see beyond the uncertainties in the medium-term. “[Medium-term investments] are more conservative than the long-term and more risk tolerant than the short-term,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""keeping-afloat"">Keeping afloat</h4>
<p>Hourican says she is seeing an increasingly common trend of treasurers drawing down on liquidity in different ways, mainly to ensure that they have enough of a buffer in the event they can’t make sales or pay their suppliers. “We’ve seen a number of clients draw down on their lending facilities – for example, if they have a revolving credit facility (RCF), they’re just parking that cash into a current account so they know it’s there when they need it,” she explains.</p>
<p>Seeing the same trend, a BlackRock whitepaper, ‘Lessons from COVID-19: The Experience of European MMFs in Short-Term Markets’, noted that in the first weeks of the crisis, many corporates drew down on their RCFs. “When this happens en-masse, it creates a significant liquidity demand on banks,” the paper says.</p>
<p>“I think it’s just the uncertainty that’s making corporates and treasurers think that they have to keep funds liquid,” says Hourican. “And if they can afford to tie up funds, then they’re thinking ‘what’s the penalty fee?’, are they going to be able to break it? Are they going to be able to get their full investment back?”</p>
<p>Another trend that Hourican has seen is around M&amp;A, with smaller suppliers being bought by larger businesses in order to keep the supply chain operational. “We’ve seen some instances where corporates have bought their suppliers to keep the business going and essentially help themselves,” she explains. “But in order to do that, you need to make sure you have enough cash to do that.” Given the high value of many M&amp;As, Hourican believes this is where the role of the treasurer becomes even more important as they assess things such as the efficacy of working capital versus lending facility for funding a deal.</p>
<h4 id=""communication-is-key"">Communication is key</h4>
<p>While it may not sound very encouraging, “Most investment strategies fail,” says Chakravarty. But, he adds, they don’t fail because of inherent flaws within the strategy, but rather because of the human application. “Whilst having a strategy is very important, what’s more important is the process,” he says. The process should eliminate the influence of any cognitive bias when implementing the strategy. “At each level of the implementation of the strategy, it is extremely important to delineate the biases from the processes.”</p>
<p>To begin creating an investment strategy, Chakravarty suggests starting by defining the objectives, the timeframe, the asset allocation, the risk management plan, and accessing information and data. The job can become more difficult if treasurers don’t have clear visibility of the organisation’s plans.</p>
<p>For Hourican, a similar step is also a priority. “Talk to the company’s board of directors,” she says. “What is actually within your investment policy?” She adds that she has seen many companies now relooking at their investment policies and notes that the risk appetite has changed. The risk tolerance is key to determining an investment strategy, particularly in times of such geopolitical uncertainty. Local developments in different countries should also factor into a treasurer’s plans.</p>
<h4 id=""lean-on-partners"">Lean on partners</h4>
<p>Of course, no investment strategy would be complete without consulting experts, such as banking partners, asset managers or fund managers. Hourican notes that banks will always understand that treasurers have many banking relationships, and it’s important to utilise all the relevant ones. Treasurers can thereby acquire the knowledge they need about the solutions and products available, as well as any possible fees for withdrawing and the relevant credit ratings.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hourican believes that understanding the past is an excellent way to contribute to an investment strategy. “Are there any key learnings they can lift from the 2008 financial crash? How did a particular company get through that crisis?” However, she does note that from a tax and accounting perspective, it’s important to acknowledge the drastic changes to the landscape since then. Treasurers therefore also need to ensure they’re educated on the various tax implications of different investment strategies or products.</p>
<h4 id=""monitor-and-maintain"">Monitor and maintain</h4>
<p>As with implementing an investment strategy, Chakravarty holds no illusions of ease when it comes to maintaining one. “It’s extremely difficult to maintain an investment strategy,” he says. However, he notes that a simple strategy that is all-encompassing and understood by everyone can be timeless. “A simple investment strategy needs to answer simple questions – what to buy, when to buy, how much to buy and when to exit.” If the rules are clear and the parameters defined, it can be run by almost anyone, he adds. Conversely, “The more complex a strategy, the more errors there are.”</p>
<p>Agreeing that investment strategies aren’t easy to maintain at these times of extreme volatility, Hourican says it’s important to review the strategy regularly. “I know some corporates who, through this pandemic, have been reviewing their strategies on a monthly, if not weekly, basis – just to make sure that they were going to be able to meet their payment obligations,” she explains.</p>
<p>Along with reviewing the strategy, it’s also necessary to monitor it. Treasurers should be actively looking at how the strategy is performing, whether changes are needed and whether it continues to reflect the appetite of the Board of Directors and the investment policy.</p>
<p>Finally, treasurers need to ensure the strategy is still within the cash flow needs of the business. As such, Hourican says a robust and accurate cash flow forecast is also key, because that will help to determine how much cash is needed in the short, medium and long term. “Having good cash flow forecasting and a good monitoring process will help treasurers make sure that they know they’ve made the right investment strategy decisions,” she concludes.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>The mantra of ‘liquidity, security, yield’, when it comes to treasury investments, has always seemed like an unwritten rule, to be followed in order of appearance. Ensuring liquidity has always been part of the treasurer’s day job, capital preservation remains foremost, and senior executives often encourage investment optimisation. Whilst this three-part edict implies a defined ratio between them, with an expected formulaic outcome, Mark Stockley, Head of EMEA Treasury Sales and Strategy at Invesco says the reality for most exists in achieving the right balance between each.</p>
<p>With the events of the last few months having demonstrated how quickly the fundamentals of entire industries can be decimated in a truly short space of time, liquidity access for most has shifted front and centre: ‘right balance’ can thus be taken as a dynamic proposition, especially in the worst of times.</p>
<p>Greg Person, VP Sales and Account Management, UK&amp;I, Kyriba, refers to a ‘dash for cash’ as many US and European corporates pre-emptively drew down some US$130bn against their revolvers as their essential liquidity buffer. With that buffer having become in recent months “a competitive advantage” (reported, he says, in earnings calls and IR communications), it seems that the quest for yield is but a distant dream.</p>
<p>However, by judicious effort it is still possible to find the right balance between seemingly conflicting components. For Paul Baram, Director of Capital Markets and Treasury at treasury consultancy firm, Actualize, doing so in the prevailing environment is not so much a matter of avoiding taking a sophisticated stance on investments, as being conscious of the maturities of the investments being considered, and understanding the ability to mature them early if there becomes a need to repatriate investments at short notice.</p>
<p>“I don’t see that security has to be sacrificed for liquidity or yield,” he says, seeing liquidity as a “precursor to yield”. With the functionality available in treasury management systems (TMS), specifically bank statement integration, providing “a great basis for cash visibility”, when allied to robust processes for cash forecasting, treasurers nowadays he says “can feel ever more comfortable about liquidity”.</p>
<p>Indeed, Baram suggests that having a clear view on the timeframe of available funds can allow slightly longer-term investments to be made, thus potentially enhancing yield. The current climate has of course heightened the need for accurate forecasting, along with the ability to amend it as required. The amount of contingency to apply to those forecasts is, he concludes, a key factor in determining available liquidity.</p>
<p>For Stockley too, investment strategies need to be flexible, based upon how the corporate has structured or segmented its cash. Within this, it is essential to be able to differentiate between operational cash, where preservation of principal is vital, and longer-term strategic cash, where enhanced returns could be sought. “I don’t think there can be this equally balanced three-legged stool of liquidity, security and yield; it has to be about balancing security and liquidity first, and then looking at yield having segregated operational and longer-dated cash.”</p>
<h4 id=""unequal-access"">Unequal access</h4>
<p>For many treasurers, implementing a highly proactive, more sophisticated investment strategy is simply not feasible, notes Justin Meadows, non-executive Director at TreasurySpring and FXD Capital, and former academic economist. “They do not have enough resources, the required expertise or infrastructure, legal agreements or access to securities markets to make this happen.”</p>
<p>In many cases too, he notes there is a perception that there is no need for a dynamic and diversified approach. “If MMFs and deposits are good enough for the largest organisations, then they should be good enough for everyone, they reason. But the reality is actually very different from this.”</p>
<p>Meadows says the reality is well illustrated by an analysis of the cash holdings of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, who between them hold less than 10% of their cash in MMFs and bank deposits, compared to nearly 85% held in government and corporate bonds and the remainder in mortgage backed seecurities.</p>
<p>So perhaps the question should be that if these are good enough for the largest and most sophisticated treasuries, why doesn’t every organisation have a similar portfolio mix, Meadows muses. It is of course for all the reasons he mentions earlier: lack of resources, expertise, market access, infrastructure such as custody arrangements, and legal expertise to get the required and often complex agreements in place.</p>
<p>“The reality is that until recently, all but the largest organisations have been effectively excluded from the securities markets, and hence prevented from following a similar strategy to the largest players,” he explains. “Given the current environment, it is no surprise that the market has seen a number of emerging initiatives looking to ‘democratise’ access to new investment opportunities.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Treasury Today has looked at such initiatives, with TreasurySpring for example seeking to open up access to the bond and repo markets for organisations that could not do this for themselves simply because few have the infrastructure in place to execute their trade settlements.</p>
<h4 id=""under-pressure"">Under pressure</h4>
<p>With that balancing act in mind, in more normal times, when liquidity is not quite so front and centre, there will often be a healthy tension between the senior executive and investment committee desire for enhanced rates of return, and the treasurer’s need to explain the impact and risk dynamics of how cash can be invested. However, sometimes external circumstances play a key role in investment decision-taking.</p>
<p>Variations in interest rates, particularly by currency, are a case in point. When the ECB first moved interest rates into negative territory in June 2014, for quite some time many banks continued to offer a zero rate of return. Corporate investors were still able to ‘earn’ zero on their time deposits and call accounts, with the cost of the negative spread typically being offset by the banks against other revenue streams from their faithful corporate clients.</p>
<p>It appeared, for a while, that banks were taking a relationship management perspective by absorbing costs. In August 2019, the ECB cut rates again, from -40 to -50 basis points. This seemed to be a tipping point for banks, many revisiting their willingness to absorb negative spreads. Widespread action by banks followed as they sought to reduce balances on which they were offering that zero yield.</p>
<p>In turn, where corporates had been able to avoid having negative returns, many were forced to revisit their investment activities and consider alternatives. Whilst the majority continued to adhere to the key paradigm of ‘security and liquidity’ first, in euro at least, -50 basis points was effectively their new benchmark.</p>
<p>Most treasurers continued to invest in alignment with their guidelines and limits, using approved counterparties (including MMFs). But not all did, says Stockley. “Having been moved from zero into significantly negative territory, a number went looking for additional counterparties, increasing their banking relationships and leveraging opportunities where they could still achieve zero on cash balances.” Some, he observes, took to extending their investment strategies, looking at longer-dated investment profiles. A few headed for lower credit quality.</p>
<p>The inevitable downsides of increasing potential return in this way can include volatility, capital risk and reduced liquidity. As Stockley comments, pushing out and broadening an investment strategy by looking for other areas where higher levels of return are possible “can come at a price”.</p>
<p>If treasurers are to adopt a more sophisticated or creative stance on their investments, the exasperating reality is that they will always be tested most at the point where there is a problem (such as the current pandemic, and the global financial crisis of 2008).</p>
<p>Being a proactive and sophisticated investor is about being prepared. It means having the right policy and approach in place in good time, and not being forced into making retroactive and possibly suboptimal decisions when the real test begins. “Don’t be complacent,” warns Stockley. “If you’re at the point in a crisis where you have liquidity or capital preservation concerns, it’s already too late.”</p>
<h4 id=""trust-in-technology"">Trust in technology</h4>
<p>In the current pandemic, concerns have largely been about access to liquidity. This requires treasury to have a greater depth of understanding of elements such as changes in assets under management within specific funds, weekly liquidity availability, and the fund approach to portfolio structure. Of course, the longer the effects of the pandemic are felt, the more corporate cash flow will be stretched.</p>
<p>To date, notes Stockley, corporate treasurers have been largely “measured” in their approach to current risks. Where, for example, three or six month rolling deposits have been used, some have been shortening their investments, with an initial period of some dis-investment to ensure overnight cash in the bank, but generally he has not noted any wild shifts in their investment strategies and allocations.</p>
<p>‘Liquidity, security, yield’ can be revisited but being proactive is vital. Treasurers must take advantage of all the data and analysis that is available to them. Where this facilitates deeper cash visibility, more accurate forecasting follows. This leads to a more comfortable view of liquidity positions and better segmentation of cash into operational and strategic buckets. It follows that treasurers can better understand liquidity opportunities and risks, including taking informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>The key is a properly joined up treasury infrastructure, from end-to-end, that supports the full range of treasury processes within an organisation, says Meadows. “Full integration between cash flow forecasting, order management, trading, risk management, settlement, trade booking and reporting is essential as a more diversified landscape develops, and the need to react quickly and in an up to date informed way remains key,” he advises.</p>
<p>But, he adds, these processes should not just be internal but should also encompass external service providers, where these are necessary, to support access to the broadest possible portfolio. “The new world will take us well beyond the stage when we can manage effectively with spreadsheets,” he says.</p>
<p>Indeed, integrated technology, including using the latest APIs to create an active network of liquidity management, connecting multiple financial institutions to treasury via a single platform, is the “foundation” for this solid position, suggests Kyriba’s Person.</p>
<p>This, he says, should not only provide visibility over global cash balances, but also facilitate monitoring of the components that make up a corporate liquidity position, such as lines of credit, short and longer-term deposits, investment portfolios and inter-company funding.</p>
<p>He notes leading CFOs and treasury departments have been able to rely on real-time view of current liquidity within that framework, supplemented by analysis and insight of future liquidity positions, derived from various ‘stress-tested’ scenarios.</p>
<p>For many businesses impacted by the current pandemic, being able to understand, for example, the impact of slowing revenue streams on future liquidity positions, in terms of access to credit lines or money-fund redemptions, is proving to be a vital lifeline. As Person says, “a strong liquidity strategy is a competitive advantage”.</p>
<p>Indeed, his message is around a balanced liquidity structure that optimises sufficient funding today, whilst also ensuring business operations continue to operate smoothly in the future. Transparent and automated liquidity can provide CFOs with confidence to manage their businesses, whilst anticipating for up- and downturns, whilst minimising interest expense and optimising interest income through higher yield intelligent investment placements.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>With many more companies today holding significant cash balances, the quest for better yields in this ‘lower for longer’ interest rate environment has given the separately managed account (SMA) a new lease of life. Cerulli Associates research cited by Morgan Stanley showed that between 2010 and 2017, SMA uptake rocketed by 84%.</p>
<p>The key to the success of the SMA is that it takes a bespoke approach to cash investment (hence they are sometimes referred to as bespoke mandates). Unlike with mutual funds (such as money market funds), a SMA portfolio manager buys individual assets for its client’s investment guidelines unlike a pooled vehicle. The investor is thus not buying into a pool of assets, but buying – and owning – the individual assets. These assets may reflect the investor’s liquidity requirements, from the short to the long term, and, crucially, their unique investment guidelines.</p>
<p>SMAs are typically used by institutional investors (and some ultra-high net worth individuals), some of which may prefer direct ownership of the underlying assets rather than being in a pooled vehicle. “It affords them the ability to fine tune the risk and reward of their portfolio,” explains Tony Callcott, Head of Pan-European Liquidity Client Solutions, Aviva Investors.</p>
<p>To be effective as a portfolio, the right scalability of investment is needed. Assets under management for a client portfolio can start at around 200m currency equivalency, with no set ceiling. The bespoke nature of SMAs mean they can be more expensive to manage than pooled funds. Providers argue that the bespoke mandate and the broad segment of cash being invested (from short to long term), means increased scope for yield enhancement.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, says Dennis Gepp, Managing Director and CIO, Cash at Federated Investors (UK), “set-up costs will come down to the amount of hand-holding and personalisation required”. In any case, if the Cerulli Associates figures referred to earlier are accurate, it is seemingly worth the cost for an increasing number of investors.</p>
<p>By customising the portfolio according to individual financial goals, it enables the investor to better meet and manage their own guiding principles (such as risk appetite, need for liquidity or ESG drivers). In essence, says Gepp, SMAs are characterised by “flexibility, control and the transparency of owning selectable individual securities”.</p>
<h4 id=""kyc-know-your-cash-flows"">KYC (know your…cash flows)</h4>
<p>Treasurers with “significant but relatively well-known cash flows over an extended period” can leverage an SMA most effectively, says Gepp. For a corporate with a substantial purchase scheduled for a more or less predictable future date (an M&amp;A for example) it can be fruitful. Rather than locking-in cash for an extended period and running the risk of not being able to redeem on time (or tolerating very low returns for the duration in the short-term space), he argues that SMAs can help companies maximise returns on their overall cash pot and allow them to unlock it close to the required date.</p>
<p>Aiming that cash at what the client considers is likely to be happening at a future date, and then maximising investment opportunities around that, is what Gepp calls the “focused flexibility” of SMA portfolio management.</p>
<p>This might be easier for some to do than it is for others. Investors with well-defined cash flows have easier and more accurate forecasting at their disposal; this enables their cash to be invested with a higher degree of certainty across a range of tenors. However, for many, such predictability is a challenge, notes Caroline Hedges, CFA, Global Head of Liquidity Portfolio Management, Aviva Investors.</p>
<p>Indeed, investors whose cash flows are largely dependent on price-volatile commodities, such as oil, understand only too well how market movements can affect their performance. “It’s important for all businesses that do not have predictable cash flows to map what proportion of their cash flow is volatile, so they can optimise their portfolio to get the best return,” says Hedges.</p>
<p>For Gepp, this deeper level of understanding enables the treasurer to be in control of their portfolio from the outset. “The aim is never to be in a position of forced sales, because it nearly always takes place at the wrong time,” he warns. “We do not want to be taking unnecessary capital risks for the client so, at all times, the investment manager has to balance likely movements of the client’s cash with the overall look of the portfolio and the desired results.”</p>
<p>Structuring a portfolio always starts with a consideration of the investor’s goals over the longer term (say, five years), taking into account their known and anticipated cash needs within that timeframe. This way, the investment manager should be able to build-in sufficient liquidity, whilst still optimising returns.</p>
<p>Since 2018 (2019 for existing funds) in Europe, this has translated into a regulatory requirement to maintain a daily minimum of 10% overnight liquidity, and a weekly minimum of 30% liquidity (the US has slightly different rules). With an SMA, these liquidity rules (and thus their impact) are not applicable as the investor and provider have pre-agreed the investment guidelines and liquidity requirements for the mandate.</p>
<h4 id=""getting-started"">Getting started</h4>
<p>An SMA requires administrative work as part of the set-up. This may include the provision of a custody agent (a large treasury may already have one on board) and preparation of legal documentation, for example.</p>
<p>Callcott says Aviva Investors has been an established and diversified asset manager for a number of decades, and has a well-honed set of processes and experiences to deliver the expected outcomes from a bespoke mandate. Gepp similarly says Federated has comparable longevity and experience. Both say they are on hand for the duration to guide clients through the set-up (Callcott quoting a turnaround of “no more than eight weeks in total”, from initial approvals, via establishing guidelines, to taking it to market).</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Set-up process</h2>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Natalie Cross, Senior Client Portfolio Manager, Invesco, explains the SMA set-up process and some of its key considerations.</p>
<p>Scale is a key factor and unless it’s sufficient to enable the cash to be invested with adequate liquidity and diversification it may prevent a mandate from progressing. Management fees can also be lower compared to a pooled vehicle, especially if the scale of the mandate is significant, although additional fees, including custodian fees, will need to be considered. The timescale for the mandate is typically set for a minimum two- to three-year time period, whereas a pooled vehicle is open-ended and therefore the investment period can be much shorter.</p>
<p>However, the path of a segregated mandate is often a lengthy process as it involves engaging with many parties. This includes legal, custody, trading and operations, IT and compliance, covering aspects such as client onboarding and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, fund reporting, servicing and billing. The process, depending on the complexity of the investment mandate, can, from start to finish, easily take several months compared to a couple of weeks when investing in a pooled vehicle such as a money market fund.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>For illustrative purposes only. Image courtesy of Invesco.</em></p>
<h4 id=""so-where-do-you-start"">So where do you start?</h4>
<p>The process begins with the establishment of the Investment Management Agreement (IMA) which defines the investment objectives and guidelines. Typically, the client will provide their initial draft of the IMA for the investment manager to review.</p>
<p>The portfolio managers, compliance and legal teams will all participate in the review, negotiating the terms with the investor until both parties agree. The investment parameters need to be thoughtfully structured to ensure they are flexible and adaptive enough to cope, not only with changing markets, but also allow for active investment decisions to generate consistent performance in line with the client’s desired outcomes.</p>
<p>If guidelines are too detailed, they can often be counter-productive and not only lead to unforeseen increases in risk, but a detrimental impact to performance and limitations to the effectiveness of active investment management.</p>
<p>An equally key step is the appointment of a custodian who primarily will be responsible for safeguarding the assets being held and arranging settlement of any transactions, including the collection of income and payment of expenses.</p>
<p>Once a segregated mandate is established and funded, client reporting forms a large part of the ongoing communications as well as periodic reviews. Unlike with a pooled fund, where reports tend to be standardised, the reporting on segregated mandates is generally more flexible both in terms of format and frequency. An investment manager would work with their clients to understand the reporting needs and requirements in terms of portfolio reviews.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""building-a-portfolio"">Building a portfolio</h4>
<p>When it comes to portfolio building, even within similar industries, investor requirements can differ. Mandates will be driven by the selection of assets defined by investor liquidity needs as much as by cash optimisation. As such, the wholly bespoke nature of SMAs means there is no typical portfolio for a specific investor.</p>
<p>Callcott notes, some will focus on a relatively vanilla product range, whereas others are more prepared to chase yield, perhaps pushing out the duration and maybe looking to some fixed income and derivative assets. The point is that SMAs have the flexibility and optionality, in terms of asset class and duration, to meet most treasury investment criteria.</p>
<p>As such, if a treasurer is going to create a bespoke mandate, they should be seizing the opportunity to run different cash ‘buckets’ within that portfolio, leveraging the ability to access a component of it on a daily basis, and keeping a larger proportion wrapped up in suitable longer-term investments.</p>
<p>Regardless of approach, the use of highly-rated (often AAA), low volatility instruments in SMAs ensures investors are not taking additional credit risk by going down the credit curve, says Hedges. “To get that additional return, we’re taking advantage of the term-premium obtainable from investing in highly-rated issuers.”</p>
<h4 id=""environmental-social-and-governance-drivers-esg"">Environmental, social and governance drivers (ESG)</h4>
<p>The capacity of treasurers to set their own investment parameters is a good draw for corporate cash. “Clients today are more aware of credit risk, and diversification and concentration risk,” notes Hedges. Putting together a detailed investment management agreement for an SMA allows them to exclude certain counterparties or issuers where they have exposures elsewhere in the business and they don’t want to increase their concentration with that issuer, or they are driven by certain ESG factors.</p>
<p>Of the latter, investors may believe that the ethical pathway attracts a pricing premium but, states Gepp, “taking ESG and sustainable finance into account does not equate with a reduction in yield”. Where Federated takes a proactive ESG stance with target investee companies, he says it is “influencing by engaging” with them.</p>
<p>Helping these companies improve their sustainable finance and ESG deliverables has a positive impact, he claims, noting that “in the equities space, we have found that companies engaging with ESG have increased in value because the market judges them to be better-run businesses”.</p>
<p>Aviva Investors has the capacity to integrate ESG into SMA options. Hedges adds that “product sophistication” is now strongly in evidence as part of an ESG-optimisation approach by investors.</p>
<h4 id=""staying-ahead"">Staying ahead</h4>
<p>The level of cash forecasting within treasury is more refined than it was just few years ago. Whilst treasury is now well-positioned to manage the requirements of the SMA, these accounts do call for a hands-on approach, says Hedges. “But that one-to-one relationship and the building of a fund to the exact specifications that suit the investor, its risk appetite, and its return objectives, is very much a positive,” she comments. It’s also a two-way street.</p>
<p>The fund manager should be offering investors regular review meetings and reporting, above and beyond regular investment models. This may include monthly investment commentary and online portfolio updates, as well as face-to-face meetings, as required. As Callcott explains: “we need to develop that working relationship with the investor because with a bespoke mandate, we need to be rather more joined up in our approach.”</p>
<h4 id=""due-diligence"">Due diligence</h4>
<p>Few treasurers are in a position to be able to employ teams of credit analysts to manage their cash. By choosing SMAs, a treasurer should expect its provider to use its expertise and understanding of the markets to maintain portfolio performance. Thus, treasurers should choose managers they believe have good credit processes, sound underlying investment practices and, of course, sufficient demonstrable experience in this space.</p>
<p>Treasurers exploring SMAs for the first time may not know precisely what they want, nor what services may be available. Some may even have forged “unrealistic expectations”, notes Hedges. In every case, treasurers should be seeking an explanation from their prospective fund manager as to how their funds will be handled, in terms of investment strategies, portfolio composition and different risk and return profiles. Treasurers may also wish to explore any value-adding services offered, such as collaborative input from in-house credit and liquidity specialists.</p>
<p>Due diligence will help treasurers gain a more accurate idea as to where their comfort levels lie, and how the SMA can deliver the best outcome from their cash investments.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>About 20 years ago, Bank of Japan (BoJ) slashed its interest rate to 0% in an attempt to avoid deflation and to try to stabilise its fragile economy. For similar reasons, the so-called Zero Interest Rate Policy – or ZIRP – was adopted about ten years later by central banks in the US, the UK and Europe. In fact, the ECB went further and, as rates sank below zero (currently minus 0.5%), the acronym NIRP – for Negative Interest Rate Policy – surfaced.</p>
<p>In all these territories, it’s been this way ever since, and is likely to remain so until inflation starts hitting the ‘Goldilocks’ zone of 2% to 2.5%. In the key economies of the US, Japan, the UK and Europe, this looks like being some way off.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>So is the best investment policy just to accept the status quo, riding it out for however long it takes? Or is there a better way to optimise company cash that does not involve chasing yield regardless of risk?</p>
<p>Will Goldthwait, Vice President, Portfolio Strategist at State Street Global Advisors, believes that treasurers can build strategies capable of deflecting the impact of an ongoing ZIRP/NIRP environment.</p>
<h4 id=""reducing-rates"">Reducing rates</h4>
<p>For central banks like the Fed, BoJ, BoE and ECB, the notions of ZIRP and NIRP have been part of theoretical economic discussion for many years; they are not new phenomena. The objective of a central bank – and that might be managing inflation for the ECB, or employment and inflation for the Fed – will see the adoption of monetary policy tools such as these to try to boost their objectives.</p>
<p>Whether these policy tools work as well as expected is, to a degree, debateable says Goldthwait. With ZIRP/NIRP having been in situ for many years now, and counting, his inference is that they are not working. Central banks are still trying to stimulate their respective economies and all have at various points taken to using quantitative easing (QE) to direct-inject liquidity into the markets, using massive asset-buying programmes to try to stimulate that growth.</p>
<p>In the US, Goldthwait says this has worked to an extent, achieving low to zero rather than the ECB’s step beyond into negative rates. But then could it have been Fed intervention or a host of other variables that created this effect? It is, he notes, hard to say categorically if these specific rate policies work or not because, ultimately, there will be forces other than monetary policy impacting growth or inflation within an economy.</p>
<p>In Europe, the ECB has seen fit to revive QE, reinstating it in October 2019, after a ten-month gap, albeit at a slower pace than at its 2016-2017 peak. Others may follow, but can it really be sustained for long periods if all who are likely to will already have leveraged it? After all, Japan is a good example of QE longevity, its central bank having taken upwards of 50% of all Japanese Government Bonds (JGB)s out of the market, and even buying up certain equities.</p>
<p>But with Basel III’s post-2008 regulation on capital adequacy removing the concept of ‘too-big-to-fail’ for financial institutions (essentially, banks can more easily unwind instruments if they become stressed), Goldthwait sees central banks using QE to buoy-up a lot of debt in the market, potentially creating a new and unintended form of systemic risk.</p>
<p>When the Fed first tried to unwind QE, it created something of a repo market funding challenge back in September 2019. Its remedy was to implement a new purchase programme (it was not referred to as QE) to bring liquidity back to the market. Risk is evident if central banks want to unwind QE, notes Goldthwait. But, he adds, perhaps it is the new normal where central banks are “forced into being asset owners” because they cannot afford, when unwinding QE, to create another supply and demand mismatch.</p>
<h4 id=""investor-challenge"">Investor challenge</h4>
<p>The continuation of the ZIRP/NIRP environment creates difficulties for investors. This is especially the case for those seeking some sort of return; chasing yield attracts extra risk. There is evidence of investors putting “just a little bit more risk in their portfolios” to try to mitigate negative rates or add a bit more yield. This, says Goldthwait, creates a knock-on effect.</p>
<p>Investors who previously stuck by money market instruments have been seen heading into the short-term bond space, those already there are looking at slightly longer durations, and those in fixed income are now looking to the equity market and so on up the scale of risk.</p>
<p>“Within all of these different asset classes, there are stories of how investors are awash in cash and have money to put to work,” he notes. This is perhaps unhealthy in the circumstances. Indeed, with the investors chasing some of the so-called ‘Unicorns’ (private start-ups valued at over US$1bn), he says it is revealing how certain valuations are being distorted to justify investment in these firms. “From that standpoint, QE is having an effect, but it is adding risk to a system where investors are chasing returns.”</p>
<h4 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h4>
<p>Planning by treasurers operating in a ZIRP/NIRP environment is obviously challenging. ‘Lower for longer’ may not continue ad infinitum, but then in Europe for example, it’s unlikely at this juncture that the ECB is about to spot inflation and raise rates. It’s unlikely too that it will suddenly see NIRP causing more harm than good. These matters will be answered at some point, but it’s going to take a while, says Goldthwait.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whilst BoJ will maintain NIRP in the near-term, given how much and how hard it has tried to stimulate growth and inflation, he sees the demographics in Japan as more of a leading indicator. “Its ageing population is more conservative in its spending habits, and the cost of living is expensive, so it’s harder to see growth pushing interest rates higher,” he argues.</p>
<p>And the US has just concluded an easing cycle as an insurance against any downturn in economic growth. It cut rates three times by 25 basis points with the last cut happening in October. It also added liquidity to the money markets in order to stabilise repo funding yields. For Goldthwait, the chance of the four major central banks (Fed, BoJ, ECB, BoE) making any adjustment to monetary policy in the near term is low.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we are going to see any change in monetary policy from these institutions that will have any meaningful impact on negative interest rates in the near (one year) and medium (one-three years) term,” he comments.</p>
<p>The UK is slightly different. “It has done a good job in correcting some leverage issues in the market, and is balancing its budget better than some other developed markets,” notes Goldthwait. “If it wasn’t for the Brexit negotiations, I think interest rates there would be much higher.”</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""taking-action"">Taking action</h4>
<p>Brexit imponderables aside, the first and most important action treasurers can take is to look at what their cash flows are, and then segment that cash, suggests Goldthwait. So instead of investing all cash in same-day liquidity funds or vehicles, it may be beneficial to separate what is truly needed as liquid cash from what could work a little harder but would be slightly less liquid. “It’s all about looking at the cash flows and risks in your investments and then potentially bifurcating that investment pool.”</p>
<p>Of course, the idea of cash segmentation has been around for several decades, but Goldthwait detects a “new energy” around it in the current environment. He notes, “when cash was earning 4%, 5%, 6% there wasn’t the urgency to pick up an additional 20-50 basis points. Now 20 basis points can be the difference between a negative or positive yield”. Indeed, amidst this environment, certainly in Europe, treasurers should be exploring all opportunities to try to mitigate negative yields, reviewing ultra-short strategies, and stress-testing these to determine the degree to which their current draw-down (change in NAV or negative impact to return) is sustainable.</p>
<p>Another element that treasurers must be keeping an eye on, says Goldthwait, is innovation in cash management. He feels that there is a need to stay ahead of technologies that can, for example, help the business manage certain deadlines, settlement restrictions or currency challenges.</p>
<p>“When I think about some of the new technology that’s coming out, especially blockchain or DLT-based, I can see this space becoming a lot more interesting over the next couple of years as fund managers and cash managers seek ways to use these tools,” he predicts. “There’s a lot of disruption in the market right now and there can never be too much investment in technology; you just have to be careful about how that spend is allocated.”</p>
<p>With ZIPR/NIRP likely bedfellows with most investors for some time to come, it is clear that treasurers have options open to them that do not significantly extend their risk. It just requires a bit of extra effort. As Goldthwait says, “where it used to be a straightforward decision to invest in short-term instruments, as yields have gone negative, so investors have to look a little harder”.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>When it comes to investing short-term cash, there are many factors to consider – and while bank deposits and money market funds may account for most treasurers’ short-term investments, there may be other options worth exploring. Meanwhile, some forward-thinking companies are taking inspiration from banks as they seek a more sophisticated approach to this area.</em></p>
<p>Deciding where to invest cash is a key part of the treasurer’s role, but there are a number of competing goals and other factors to consider. While bank deposits may be an obvious choice, many companies also use money market funds very effectively – and beyond that, there may be further options for treasurers willing to take on additional risk.</p>
<p>So what are the key investment goals for treasurers in Asia, where are the most significant challenges – and what are the options for treasurers wishing to look further afield than bank deposits and money market funds?</p>
<h4 id=""security-liquidity-yield"">Security, liquidity, yield</h4>
<p>Aidan Shevlin, Head Global Liquidity Fund Management, Asia-Pacific, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, points out that understanding and clarifying investment goals is the critical first step for treasurers. “Typically, an organisation’s investment policy should provide a solid foundation for cash investment decision, defining objectives, acceptable levels of risk and return requirements,” he notes.</p>
<p>Where objectives are concerned, any investment decision requires the investor to weigh up the competing goals of security, liquidity, and yield. A highly liquid investment is unlikely to offer as attractive a yield as an investment with a longer maturity. And a high-yielding investment may not offer the security that is likely to be a top priority for treasurers. As Warren Buffet famously remarked, “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.”</p>
<p>That said, the importance of liquidity is not to be underestimated. “When it comes to investments, access and availability are key,” says Anton Abraham, head of International Advisory at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “If treasurers are going to place an investment, they need to know how easily they can get their cash back if they need it in a critical situation. Can that be done electronically or do they have to fill out forms? And are there any penalties around accessing that cash?”</p>
<p>Access to cash also needs to be weighed against the need for return on investment, which leads to something of a balancing act as treasurers aim to maximise yield while still having the desired level of liquidity.</p>
<p>“In the region I often see treasurers looking to banks to see if they can price their normal operating accounts with a higher rate of interest, comparable to what they might get in a one-week term deposit,” notes Abraham. “Obviously there is going to be a higher yield if they go for a longer tenor – but there has definitely been a move over the last few years to price operating accounts to a level where banks can still keep cash in those accounts. And that helps the treasurer with convenience.”</p>
<h4 id=""challenges-in-asia"">Challenges in Asia</h4>
<p>Security, liquidity and yield may be perennial goals. But market conditions are more of a moving target – meaning that it’s important to stay on top of current trends and developing opportunities. Treasurers also need to understand the specific challenges of Asia’s heterogeneous landscape, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulation.</strong> “Regulatory differences across Asian countries are one of the biggest challenges when managing short term investments in Asia,” comments Gordon Rodrigues, Director, Head of Asian Rates &amp; FX, HSBC Global Asset Management. He notes that in Asia, even if a treasury department has set up a regional treasury centre, “there are still cross-border sweeps, time zone differences, intercompany lending and various other factors that make getting to a reasonable final cash position by currency a challenging task.” Adding to this, he points out the potential multi-currency pooling complications of having one currency to place investments in, or the challenge of investing each currency individually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sell side challenges.</strong> Likewise, Rodrigues says the same challenges exist on the sell side, “where providers rarely have the same cash management toolkit available in every currency or market.” He explains that this makes it extremely challenging for a treasurer to have a consistent short-term investment approach across the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trapped cash.</strong> The issue of trapped cash can make it difficult to access balances in certain markets. “The main challenges are around some of the restricted countries and currencies,” says Abraham. “While you can still get optimised interest and put your cash into call deposits, or various products offered in different countries, the issue remains for treasurers that if cash is trapped, it’s trapped. So you might be able to get a return on your cash, but you still can’t get it out.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weighing up risk and return.</strong> As Shevlin explains, the range of money market instruments, issuers and structures available to investors across the Asia Pacific region has expanded rapidly in recent years. “This has given treasurers more choices than ever before, but with a major caveat – risk has also increased,” he adds. “Even in China where historically all fixed income instruments had an implicit government guarantee, the link between risk and return is strengthening as defaults increase and the government guaranteed fades.”</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body""><!-- BOXED -->
<h3 id=""cash-flow-forecasting"">Cash flow forecasting</h3>
<p>When it comes to investments, cash flow forecasting has a crucial role to play in giving the treasurer visibility over how much cash is actually available for investment. “It helps you to understand how much you can optimally invest, and for how long,” says Abraham. “If you don’t have the forecast, you may have the situation where you are breaking your deposits or need to call them back early. Or you may keep too much operating cash, which then impacts your ability to get a better return on excess cash.”</p>
<p>The benefits of effective forecasting are clear – and PwC’s 2019 Global Treasury Benchmarking Survey, Digital Treasury – It takes two to tango, found that cash flow forecasting was the top priority on the agenda for both treasurers and CFOs.</p>
<p>However, this is also an activity that many treasurers struggle to perfect. Obstacles to cash flow forecasting may include inefficient processes, inaccurate data, a lack of dedicated resources and a communication gap between the treasury and other teams that may need to provide data for the forecast.</p>
<p>That said, there is plenty that companies can do to forecast more accurately, from streamlining processes in-house to leveraging suitable technology. “Companies looking to improve their forecasting should aim to drive a cash culture within the organisation, which may be aligned to key performance indicators and incentives,” Abraham notes. “This, in turn, impacts the company’s ability to optimise short-term investments.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""from-bank-deposits-to-money-market-funds"">From bank deposits to money market funds</h4>
<p>For treasurers in Asia, bank deposits have long been the instrument of choice. “Historically, time deposits provided a simple method for local treasurers to invest cash balances,” says Shevlin. “Long-term, close relationships with banks and limited alternative options in certain countries meant that time deposits were often the only investment choice.”</p>
<p>But as Shevlin explains, a decline in high quality counterparties – together with the introduction of Basel III and the growth in corporate balances – has forced treasurers to look beyond bank offerings and diversify into other investment options.</p>
<p>Money market funds, or liquidity funds, can be an attractive alternative. Shevlin notes that liquidity funds are generally “an excellent option for corporate treasurers for placing short-term cash balances.” He adds, “Amid the recent complicated investment and economic environment, they offer an efficient investment solution that satisfies many of the risk and return requirements sought by cash investors – including excellent security, good liquidity and a competitive yield. In addition, the strict guidelines and oversight by regulators and rating agencies have greatly improved the liquidity, security and resiliency of these funds over the past decade.”</p>
<p>That said, corporate investment patterns can vary considerably from region to region. “In the US, about 20% of corporate cash ends up in money market funds,” says Rodrigues. “In Europe, that number is around 13-15%. Across Asia (excluding China), that number is less than 5%.”</p>
<p>In China, however, Rodrigues says it is a different story. “Historically there have been strict limits on the level of interest that could be paid on corporate deposits that were not tied to market rates,” he says. “Having significant amounts of cash onshore creates a supportive environment for the growth of money market funds.” Consequently, he points out that China is now the second largest money market fund market in the world, “with almost half of that coming from corporates and institutions, with the rest being retail.”</p>
<h4 id=""what-else-can-treasurers-use"">What else can treasurers use?</h4>
<p>While bank deposits and money market funds may account for most corporate short-term investments, some treasurers may be open to exploring other options – albeit while keeping a close eye on the company’s risk appetite, policies and corporate philosophy.</p>
<p>Key to this is the ability to segment cash balances in accordance with the company’s liquidity needs. “Obviously, operational cash – for day to day needs – must be liquid and secure,” says Shevlin. “But for reserve and strategic cash balances, which may not be required for several months, reducing the amount of liquidity held and broadening the range of money market instruments and credit ratings allowed can help boost the overall returns achieved.”</p>
<p>Rodrigues says that the investment options open to treasurers in APAC are expanding at an increasing pace. He notes that there has been more adoption of separately managed mandates for large pools of cash, with such arrangements allowing treasurers to create a specific set of investment guidelines that exactly match the company’s risk appetite, “and allow an asset manager to create and manage that portfolio on their behalf.”</p>
<p>He adds: “We are also seeing an increase in low and short duration vehicles that have a longer tenure than a money market fund but less than that of a bond fund in the main APAC currencies. These vehicles are being offered in both the traditional fund format and in ETFs.” According to Rodrigues, these vehicles can provide more interest to an investor than a money market fund or short-to-medium term time deposit.</p>
<p>“The most recent entrant to this space has been trade finance funds,” he adds, noting that while these funds can come in various options, “the principles remain the same.”</p>
<h4 id=""evaluating-opportunities"">Evaluating opportunities</h4>
<p>Naturally, treasurers need to pay close attention to the risks associated with any additional investment instruments. Rodrigues points out that all the new instruments coming to the market require the treasurer to have a more robust risk management approach, which might require different skillsets within the treasury, or investments in new technology to support the treasurer.</p>
<p>“These instruments are more for the strategic cash element of a portfolio where yield is more important,” he explains. “Whilst these may deliver more yield on average than the traditional cash products, the trade-off will be less certainty of capital preservation as they will not be AAA rated products.”</p>
<p>Shevlin, likewise, warns that care should be taken when tapping new opportunities to ensure they are within the framework provided by the organisation’s investment policy, and that the returns achieved are in line with the additional risk assumed. “Securities with longer maturities, lower ratings and more complicated structures will generally have lower or limited liquidity,” he notes. “Therefore investors should be comfortable with their ability to hold to maturity.”</p>
<p>Shevlin also highlights the importance of credit and counterparty research when it comes to longer tenor and lower rated securities, noting that this is needed to minimise the risk of selecting issuers or instruments that may face downgrade or default risk prior to maturity. “Across Asia’s less developed credit markets, monitoring liquidity and credit quality can be challenging; therefore, working with a trusted investment partner who has the necessary resources and experience is critical to avoiding these pitfalls,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""shift-in-mindset"">Shift in mindset</h4>
<p>Another notable trend is that some companies are taking a more ambitious approach to investments. As Shevlin observes, regional treasurers “are now more sophisticated and seek to emulate best investment practices of global multi-nationals in their cash investment policies.”</p>
<p>Abraham, meanwhile, says that the most sophisticated corporates are “starting to behave more like a bank”. He explains that some are increasingly using structures such as in-house banks and funding desks, adding that the latter is a way of “optimising funding from the group and for the group at the cheapest possible rates, while also leveraging the investments they may place their excess liquidity into.”</p>
<p>He adds that by centralising all group borrowing onto a single platform, a funding desk can thereby reduce the total cost of group funding, minimise third-party funding, reduce funding costs and ensure a mechanism is in place to transfer price working capital efficiently to the group.</p>
<p>“A great example would be if the organisation needs funding in Australian dollars, and doesn’t have Australian dollars in their accounts today, they may have access to draw down on a bank line in Australian dollars – but they may also have excess sterling sitting in London,” he says. “They can then make a decision at the funding desk: ‘Is it cheaper for us to draw down our line, or should we swap our sterling into Australian dollars and fund that way?’”</p>
<p>In order to deploy this model effectively, Abraham says companies need to have a robust technology infrastructure, as well as having transfer pricing arrangements in place and employing suitably qualified staff. “I see that as the next frontier in terms of liquidity funding and investment management – at least for more sophisticated corporates,” he adds.</p>
<p>Technology may also have a role to play in helping treasurers optimise liquidity management and enhance yield. “The next wave we are seeing is how this can be more digitalised,” says Abraham. “So how the use of APIs can help this process be more automated and digital from an end-to-end perspective.” He adds that while companies can already access plenty of capabilities via electronic banking, the next step is for APIs to bring greater sophistication in connecting treasury systems with banks, leading to a more dynamic process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while bank deposits and money market funds are likely to suit most corporations’ investment needs, there’s a growing trend for companies to adopt a more ambitious approach to short-term investments – whether that means adopting a funding desk approach, or taking advantage of nascent technology.</p>
<p>But whatever the chosen approach, it’s essential for treasurers to take a rigorous approach to managing their short-term investments, from weighing up risk and return to clearly defining the company’s investment goals.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""the-dash-for-yield"">The dash for yield</h4>
<p>Expectations for lower interest rates across the globe has sparked a grab for yield. At the same time, strong technicals in credit markets are supporting spreads despite the late cycle risks that are increasingly prevalent in the market. Even in Europe, where rates are already in negative territory, further easing is expected. In this environment, the yield drag for staying in cash is only likely to increase.</p>
<p>For many cash investors, maintaining an attractive yield means having to increase credit exposure at a time when market risk is greater than it has been in a long time. The question investors must ask themselves is how aggressively they wish to pursue their step-out strategy. In Europe, for example, a strategy designed to achieve a positive yield would require a portfolio that is 100% invested in credit with an average BBB rating out to five years.</p>
<p>But an average BBB rated portfolio obviously contains more risk than a AAA rated portfolio. Therefore, a blind focus on yield, as opposed to total return, could give some investors a wrong steer – particularly with credit risks increasing.</p>
<h4 id=""put-cash-in-its-place"">Put cash in its place</h4>
<p>Overstretching for yield in the current market environment could present serious hazards. Among the current known market risks – not all of which have been priced in – are ongoing trade disputes, Brexit uncertainty, falling interest rates, changing regulations, and an ageing credit cycle (to name but a few). To this list may be added the threat of one or more key markets slipping into recession in the next 24 months.</p>
<p>At the same time, credit risks are rising. Leverage in investment grade markets, for example, is higher than ever (particularly in the industrials sector). While falling interest rates may help these companies eke out cheaper refinancing, what happens if the major economies do go into recession? Furthermore, while investors would expect a higher yield for investing in BBB rated securities, greater demand for BBB assets is actually causing spreads to tighten.</p>
<h4 id=""find-the-sweet-spot"">Find the sweet spot</h4>
<p>For investors in the ultra-short space who seek yield in this volatile economic environment, there is a strategy that could help them. Segmenting cash and leveraging solutions across the full ultra-short spectrum can help investors target the cash sweet spot by maximising yields and helping them to prepare for lower rates, without taking on too much risk.</p>
<p>This strategy involves stepping out of the AAA “dead zone” just enough to boost yield, but with a laser-sharp focus on the credit fundamentals of every suitable asset, rather than relying for guidance on today’s market pricing, which is dangerously influenced by technical factors (where demand is outstripping supply) instead of a focus on fundamental value. Undertaking the right level of credit research helps to strip out unacceptable volatility and ensure that credit risks are managed in the portfolio.</p>
<p>For most treasurers – those without credit research resources – implementing a cash segmentation strategy that is backed by fundamental credit analysis will mean engaging with a specialist adviser. In today’s challenging environment, access to such specialised credit analysis is crucial, allowing investors to account for the kind of “known unknowns” being created by Brexit, for example, and helping them to get on the right side of any market fall-out.</p>
<h4 id=""a-proven-track-record"">A proven track record</h4>
<p>J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s active, liquid and diversified Managed Reserve investment model has a decade-plus track record that eschews a dangerous fixation with yield and instead looks to total return, with a deliberately low risk approach to BBB credit.</p>
<p>The focus is on short-term positions, and then only in names that are good enough to make it onto a well-researched buy list built for liquidity-style investors. The result is a credit selection process that is appropriately conservative for treasurers seeking yield in these uncertain times.</p>
<p>To quantify outcomes, J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Sterling Managed Reserves strategy, for example, aims to outperform a typical cash proxy (such as a money market fund) by 20 to 40 basis points (bps).</p>
<p>In a late cycle environment, where fundamentals are deteriorating, spreads are tightening and technical are driving the market, picking up 20 to 40 basis points in yield looks attractive – particularly when the new normal is for zero or negative rates.</p>
<p>For yield seekers aiming for principal preservation, hitting that ultra-short sweet spot is still possible with the right advice. It’s therefore time to put cash in its place.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>When money market fund (MMF) reform came into force for US and European markets (2016 and 2019 respectively), it was part of the ongoing response to the global financial crisis of 2007/08. In keeping with the perceived general need for systemic stability in financial services, banks have undergone a huge regulatory overhaul, notably around capitalisation. This is intended to help them withstand the worst effects of another crisis. It was natural that the reformers would focus next on the so-called ‘shadow-banking’ sector, of which money markets are a systemically important component.</p>
<p>A run on a MMF would create widespread contagion. Because Investors in a constant net asset value (CNAV) fund expected to get out that same £1 they put in, with interest; there was this inherent belief that the fund would be bailed out by its sponsor should there be a default. This bail-out was never guaranteed in writing. It seemed some parties on both sides of the agreement had forgotten that cash is not a risk-free asset. Regulators deemed this to be unacceptable and acted accordingly with reform.</p>
<p>The reform of money markets was lobbied for by key participants, including Aviva Investors. We had already changed our CNAV fund to VNAV (variable net asset value) in 2008, believing that CNAV was no longer a suitable model for our clients. Indeed, with assets fluctuating in value – floating rate notes were especially volatile during the financial crisis – the risk of realised losses (or even defaults) was real. Action was required.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the regulatory response is yet to be tested by market failure. However, a key element – the low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) fund, which saw Aviva Investors become the earliest adopter amongst established funds – incorporates a mechanism ensuring such funds remain open in times of extreme stress.</p>
<p>LVNAV funds have 20bps collar. If the fund moves up or down by more than this, it has to re-price and switch to a floating or variable net asset value. This is a conservative collar compared to CNAV’s 50bps. Even so, the simple facts speak for themselves: in the most stressed moments, a fund deviating by more than 20bps is incredibly rare. With LVNAV’s mechanism ensuring no closure is necessary, a run on a stressed fund is all but ruled out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regulators have established strict guidelines on managing money market liquidity risk. Similar to the banking sector’s rules on capital adequacy that ensure robustness even in a liquidity crisis, MMF rules ensure funds have sufficient daily and weekly liquidity to meet investor redemptions.</p>
<p>For investor comfort, this may have been over-engineered. For LVNAV funds, daily liquidity must be at least 10%, and weekly liquidity must be at least 30%. Most short-term MMFs operate with 20% daily liquidity and around 35% weekly liquidity. To put this into context, redemptions in MMFs above 5% are incredibly rare, even in times of stress. The global financial crisis saw depositors queuing outside Northern Rock to retrieve their savings. This loss of confidence didn’t happen to Money Market Funds, as diversified pools of cash.</p>
<h4 id=""positive-outcomes"">Positive outcomes</h4>
<p>That the regulations have thrown light on the money market sector should be seen as a positive outcome. Prompted by the changes, investors are now asking more probing questions. At Aviva Investors, we can help them better understand how the market works and, as a result, manage their own risks more judiciously.</p>
<p>We know that some potential investors are averse to credit risk, choosing to invest most of their cash directly with their banks. Whilst bank regulation reduces the chance of default for systemically important financial institutions, this model does not provide risk-informed diversification.</p>
<p>For investors wishing to diversify risk away from bank-concentrated cash placements, we can explain how MMFs are a comparable platform. Indeed, they provide same-day liquidity, with robust safety mechanisms, in much the same way a bank deposit does, and possibly with enhanced yields too.</p>
<p>Additionally, new MMF regulations stipulate strict criteria for investment managers in terms of their credit quality assessments, performed by an independent team of credit experts. Clients don’t always have the resources available to manage such deep market analysis. So MMFs effectively create an inexpensive way for investors to leverage the fund manager credit expertise and diversify away from the concentration risk associated with a bank deposit.</p>
<p>With Aviva Investors, and other fund managers, committed to integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes into our funds, there is a clear commitment to helping clients who may lack the resources to screen investments in this space too.</p>
<p>MMF regulations have come at a time when the financial sector needs more clarity and security. The market has responded positively, helping to build investor confidence in what was, frankly, already a robust proposition.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><strong>Even though the Federal Reserve (Fed) has indicated there will be no more tightening of policy for the foreseeable future, the effective fed funds rate, which targets the overnight level that banks charge each other for loans, has edged up to within just a few basis points of the top of the target range.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a state of affairs that for Kyongsoo Noh, Portfolio Manager for Managed Reserves Portfolios, Global Liquidity, J.P. Morgan Asset Management means we are near the Fed’s terminal rate. And being so close to the end of the monetary tightening cycle requires investors to begin reorienting their investment strategy and consider adding duration.</p>
<p>Every economic cycle is different but there are a number of factors to consider for late cycle investment, the timing of the downturn being among them. Noh anticipates it could materialise in late 2020 or 2021 so investors still have some time to act. However, while they do not need to be at maximum duration today, Noh believes investors should have more duration in their portfolios now than they did last year when the Fed was raising interest rates more aggressively.</p>
<p>Explaining further why investors have some time to act on duration before the next downturn, Noh first points out that in 2018 US GDP growth was about 2.8%, well above US trend growth of 2%. This above trend growth was due to a sizeable fiscal stimulus package implemented last year: “The stimulus is still in effect this year and while its effects are unlikely to be as strong as last year, it still means growth will probably be slightly above trend, maybe 2.25%. As such, the economic expansion in the US should remain intact for this year.”</p>
<p>Volatility is another issue to consider. After a turbulent 2018, volatility has eased considerably; with factors such as the Fed’s dramatic turn from hawkish last December to dovish just a month later and progress on the US-China trade talks, as being responsible for the decrease in overall volatility. Volatility is likely to remain low in the near term, but Noh believes investors could see volatility pick up again towards the fourth quarter as year-end effects take hold.</p>
<p>One way to add some downside protection to portfolio returns during volatile periods is to buy more government bonds.  As part of their late cycle investment strategy, ultra-short investors in USD portfolios should, over time, consider gaining more exposure to US treasuries: “They serve to lengthen duration of portfolios, are always liquid, and are important diversifiers against credit holdings.”</p>
<p>In the past when the Fed was raising rates more swiftly, Noh was focused on buying one-year treasuries but with the Fed near the terminal rate, he is looking to buy, going forwards, longer maturities, even out to two to three years.</p>
<p>With respect to credit risk, Noh favours financial corporate bonds, and particularly bank paper: “As a direct result of the financial crisis, regulatory pressure has encouraged banks to deleverage their balance sheets and reduce risk taking. The upshot today is a much stronger global banking system than before the crisis.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, in the years that followed the financial crisis, we have seen US industrials take advantage of near zero interest rates and increase their leverage.  That does not mean we should avoid US industrial corporates altogether, but it does mean that the sector warrants some caution.”</p>
<h4 id=""put-cash-in-its-place"">Put cash in its place</h4>
<p>In considering the broad framework for late cycle portfolios and adding duration, cash segmentation is key. The idea here is that investors can deploy risk into their portfolios more efficiently if they segment cash by the need to call on it. So, there will be cash treasurers need on a daily basis (operating cash); cash that might be called on once or twice a year (reserve cash); and cash required only once every one to two years (strategic cash).</p>
<p>Noh explains that by segmenting cash into these various “buckets”, increased duration risk can be taken with the longer-term cash. “One of the things we've seen our clients do is that with operational cash, they'll often go for deposits and/or money market funds.  With the once or twice a year cash they can implement ultra-short fixed income strategy. And for longer-term cash, we see some corporate treasurers investing into a short duration strategy.”</p>
<p>A wide range of investment vehicles can be leveraged for cash segmentation, ranging from money market funds to bond funds and, in some cases, exchange-traded funds. While investors may view allocation differently depending on their appetite for risk, Noh says the most important thing for treasurers in implementing cash segmentation “is to ensure they have a robust investment policy that allows for different investment types and different vehicles”.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>The financial crisis in 2008 triggered huge turmoil across money markets and led to deep concerns about the stability of the industry that culminated in it being subject to reforms in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>In Europe, the EU began implementing new rules for the sector last year, with new funds needing to be compliant from 21st July 2018. Existing funds were given until 21st January 2019 to submit their updated prospectus to their national competent authority, by 21st March these needed to be approved and to have the new provisions implemented in all the funds.</p>
<p>Philippe Renaudin, Money Market CIO, BNP Paribas Asset Management, explains that under the new EU regime, money market funds (MMFs) are categorised into two types of funds: short term and standard. Traditionally, both CNAV and VNAV funds have been offered by the European money market industry. The EU reform however restricts the use of CNAV funds to government portfolios and creates a whole new category for non-government funds, the low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) fund. All three are available in the short-term MMF category, while standard MMFs can only be managed under the VNAV format.</p>
<p>Gregory Chereau, Money Market Investment Specialist, BNP Paribas Asset Management, says liquidity is an important consideration in the reforms. CNAV and LVNAV funds will have to constitute minimum 10% daily and 30% weekly liquidity pockets. For VNAV products these thresholds are set at 7.5% and 15% respectively.</p>
<p>“The EU regulator has included very strict guidelines to enhance the liquidity profile of funds and avoid runs in case of extreme events in the industry. Portfolio managers will have to offer liquidity pockets that are sharply higher than these minimum thresholds in order to avoid any prospectus breach, especially on AAA-rated funds that are usually more volatile in terms of asset variations. Even before the reforms, minimum thresholds on BNPP AM’s products ranged from 22% to 25% of daily liquidity in the AAA-rated money market funds.”</p>
<p>Renaudin points to risk management issues as another major aspect of the reforms: “Asset managers now have to apply liquidity, rate and even credit spread stress tests on the different portfolios on a regular basis to be sure they are robust and that the liquidity is efficient.”</p>
<h4 id=""mark-to-market"">Mark-to-market</h4>
<p>On the valuation front, it was possible before the new rules to adopt an amortised cost approach on all instruments whatever their tenor. That is now banned: “We have to be full mark-to-market or mark-to-model on securities in the funds, with an option of an amortised cost approach for LVNAV instruments below 75 days. BNPP AM’s approach to managing LVNAV and VNAV funds is to have a single pricing policy (eg full mark-to-market/mark-to-model), as we believe that is in the interest of shareholders.”</p>
<p>The EU reform also aims to introduce greater transparency and rigour in MMF reporting: “Asset managers must publish threshold key indicators of their MMFs weekly – it used to be monthly. They also need to provide regulators with many indicators on the quarterly basis. That means the regulators can create a database on funds to ensure all comply with the new guidelines.”</p>
<p>Chereau stresses the continuing importance of MMFs for treasurers and investors generally, noting they have several advantages over other types of daily liquidity instruments or deposit instruments. They offer security because they only invest in very highly rated papers. Liquidity and diversification are further positives: “Whenever you wish to get your money back with MMFs, it is very easy to do so. And you can invest in a wide range of issuer types but also gain diversity in terms of geographies, business models, sub-sectors for corporates and so on.”</p>
<p>Active management of both credit and interest rate risk and even liquidity risk are further important attractions: “It delivers added value to investors because the managers can respond rapidly to different market environments.”</p>
<p>More broadly, Chereau says the overriding objective at BNPP AM is to help investors optimise their cash balance by offering a wide range of solutions. “They can have a short-term money market fund product if that suits their needs. Or if the intention is more strategic, with longer-term investment for instance being required, then they can choose from within our standard money market funds offering. It is important they have access to the full spectrum of solutions.”</p></div>

Money market fund reforms here have taken a slightly different course than in the United States, and fund managers have been working with regulators, vendors and clients over the past two years to adjust their product offerings to meet the new regulatory criteria.</em></p>
<p>As a result, some fund providers are converting their money fund range to the new structures this quarter and many others will follow in the beginning of January. By 21<sup>st</sup> January 2019, all existing European funds must be adapted to the new structures introduced by the legislation. Whether you are an existing money market fund investor – or might become one, you should acquaint yourself with what is changing and the types of funds being offered.</p>
<p>In this podcast, money fund experts from Morgan Stanley explain the types of funds that will be offered by Morgan Stanley and other fund managers.</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley experts explain some of the regulatory hurdles, do a deep dive into the new fund structures and discuss accounting concerns that have arisen.

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>With the short-term investment landscape in a period of flux, many treasurers are reviewing how they invest their company’s cash. Treasury Today investigates some of the trending options available to corporates.</em></p>
<p>The short-term investment landscape is in a period of flux. This is largely being driven by the arrival of several conflicting regulations. First, there is Basel III, which is seeing banks charging more for (or being unwilling to hold) non-operational deposits. Then there is the reform in the US and European money fund industry which is causing headaches for treasurers who use money market funds (MMFs) alongside, or as an alternative to, bank deposits.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, corporations around the world are holding more cash on the balance sheet than ever. As a result, finding a secure home for this cash becomes increasingly important. And that is before treasurers think about yield in this time of historically low interest rates.</p>
<p>These are certainly challenging times for the corporate short-term investor, but there is also an opportunity. It’s all too easy for short-term investors to follow the status quo and use less-than-optimal solutions. Treasurers, therefore, should ideally be looking to review their investment policy now, to ensure they are aligning their short-term investment objectives with their company’s goals. They should also be reviewing the products they are using and consider alternatives that might better help them meet their investment objectives.</p>
<p>Here are some of the latest trending short-term investment options.</p>
<h3 id=""mmfs"">MMFs</h3>
<p>MMFs are designed to preserve capital while providing liquidity and an attractive rate of income relative to short-term interest rates. These attributes make MMFs an important tool in many corporates’ short-term investment strategies.</p>
<p>MMFs offer numerous benefits to corporates, says Kim Hochfeld, Head of EMEA Liquidity Distribution at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “They provide corporates with a secure, diversified investment option,” she says. “This is especially important at critical times, such as year-end when banks are reluctant to take short-dated cash on the balance sheet. Beyond this, using MMFs rather than deposits also frees up credit capacity with relationship banks. Corporates can use this credit capacity for more complex transactions, such as derivatives, FX and lending activity.”</p>
<p>After some negative press and an incident during the financial crisis where the reserve fund “broke the buck”, MMFs were subject to heightened scrutiny by the US and European regulators. In the intervening years, US and European regulators have sought to strengthen MMFs and to increase transparency for investors, resulting in changes to how these funds operate.</p>
<p>Some of the most notable changes that the new regulations have brought about in the US and EMEA are the requirement for floating net asset values for certain fund types and the provision for liquidity fees and/or redemption gates based upon certain triggers for specific funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MMFs are designed to preserve capital while providing liquidity and an attractive rate of income relative to short-term interest rates. These attributes make MMFs an important tool in many corporates’ short-term investment strategies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the US, institutional prime and tax-exempt MMFs must transact at a floating NAV and have the potential for trigger-based fees and gates. Government MMFs can maintain a stable NAV and do not have fees/gates. Meanwhile, in Europe, there are three new fund structures – public debt CNAV, LVNAV and VNAV. Public Debt CNAV and LVNAV offer the closest operational utility to MMFs today, but are subject to trigger-based fees and gates and LVNAV funds must trade within certain collars to maintain the constant NAV. VNAV funds utilise market-based pricing and are not subject to trigger-based fees and gates.</p>
<p>In the US, the new rules, which were introduced last year, led to significant outflows from prime MMFs, with clients moving into government funds to avoid fees and gates. Money has since started to trickle back into prime funds as corporates have become more comfortable with the new product landscape.</p>
<p>In Europe, the new rules come into force in January 2019 for existing funds. And while industry experts don’t expect the impact to be quite as extreme as in the US, there is debate amongst the investor community around how money funds will be used going forward.</p>
<p>Investors in Europe shouldn’t be concerned, says Hochfeld. “The changes should enhance the appeal of MMFs,” she says. “The products will continue to provide daily liquidity, yield, diversification and outsourced credit analysis to corporate investors but with enhanced transparency and investor protection.”</p>
<p>Hochfeld adds that the new rules will also provide corporates with more choice. “There are short-term and standard VNAV funds for yield-driven investors and CNAV and LVNAV for those looking for operational simplicity and stable NAV. This will enable treasurers to pick a product that more closely matches their investment objectives.”</p>
<p>Hochfeld expects MMFs to remain a key investment option for corporates post-January 2019 due to these factors. “Many corporates rely on the utility offered by MMFs,” she says. “They will struggle to find alternative investments that provide the same credit diversification, capacity and liquidity.”</p>
<h3 id=""separately-managed-accounts"">Separately managed accounts</h3>
<p>Separately managed accounts (SMAs) can provide corporates with a personalised approach to investing. When using these products, a treasurer mandates a fund manager to buy and hold securities on the company’s behalf. This is unlike a MMF where a corporation is a shareholder of a fund which owns the securities.</p>
<p>First offered in the 1970s, SMAs were developed to accommodate the needs of investors whose objectives did not fit within the constrictions of a mutual fund investment. This remains the product’s primary function today. “SMAs are bespoke products built to meet the investment objectives of an individual corporate,” says Jim Fuell, Managing Director, Head of Global Liquidity Sales, International at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “They provide all the benefits of professional money management, combined with the flexibility, control and transparency of owning individual securities.”</p>
<p>They may also enable corporates to achieve greater returns. In fact, the desire to achieve greater returns is a key driver behind the growing corporate interest in SMAs. Fuell says SMAs are especially useful for those companies able to achieve good visibility over their cash, and segment it strategically. “They can then comfortably place some of this cash into an SMA to achieve greater returns, while taking a level of risk which is closely aligned to what is permitted in their own investment policy,” he says.</p>
<p>Corporates are also turning to SMAs because of Central Bank policy. Fuell explains that in Europe, many corporates are averse to negative rates. “Several companies are looking to overcome negative rates by taking on more risk,” he says. “This enables them to generate yield above zero. They are finding SMAs to be a vehicle that enables them to achieve this.”</p>
<p>The benefits offered by SMAs come at a cost, however. For instance, the bespoke nature of the product means that fund management fees may be higher than those in MMFs. There is also a minimum investment amount that fund managers request. This varies from fund manager to fund manager but typically is between US$25m to US$100m. Companies looking to use SMAs will need to appoint a custodian to hold the purchased securities and will also need to execute an investment management agreement with their asset manager.</p>
<p>Aside from the cost, setting up an SMA will typically require significantly more lead time to establish than an off the shelf fund offering. Fuell explains that it is crucial that the fund manager clearly understands the corporate’s investment objectives and risk parameters. “Doing this correctly takes time,” he says. “It’s also not a one-way street. The best fund managers will advise when the yield they are seeking is not in line with the risk appetite they have, for example. It is a true collaboration, and it’s important to get it right.”</p>
<h3 id=""exchange-traded-funds"">Exchange traded funds</h3>
<p>Unlike MMFs and SMAs which have existed for some time, exchange traded funds (ETFs) are an emerging tool that treasurers can use for their short-term investment needs. As the name implies, ETFs are investment funds traded on a stock exchange. These often track an index such as the S&amp;P 500 or FTSE 100 and hold a portfolio of assets such as stocks, bonds or commodities. Investors can buy or sell shares in an ETF to gain exposure to a particular index or market. Unlike mutual funds, which are priced once a day, ETFs can be traded intraday.</p>
<p>These products have become popular with investors in recent years, as cost and transparency have become a bigger consideration. ETF holdings are published every day and provide intra-day valuations with live pricing on exchange. ETFs also often carry lower fees than managed funds.</p>
<p>Despite their popularity, corporate treasurers are not typical users of ETFs. “Early adoption can take time as institutions become comfortable with a new product,” says Ashley Curtis, Head of iShares EMEA Fixed Income Markets and Sales at BlackRock. “Corporate treasuries are no different and incorporating new investment wrappers can help bring efficiencies that may not have been available before.”</p>
<p>Curtis is seeing mounting interest, however. “Corporate pension ETF usage has grown quickly,” he says. “Also, those corporates with more flexibility in their strategic cash buckets are considering investing in short duration and floating rate credit ETFs. These enable them to ease balance sheet pressures and potentially earn better returns in comparison to cash-like investments.”</p>
<p>Interest will only increase through education. “There is a need for treasurers to better understand the mechanics of ETFs,” says Curtis. “Doing so will allow them to find ETFs suitable for their cash management needs. This will naturally increase the usage of the product.”</p>
<p>The industry is also evolving to meet the needs of corporates. This includes the development of ETF products which provide shorter creation and redemption settlement than the standard T+2. “Because of this development, ETFs will provide a complementary tool to more traditional cash or short-term investment products,” says Curtis. “This will allow for more flexibility in different market environments.”</p>
<h3 id=""repurchase-agreements"">Repurchase agreements</h3>
<p>Another option for a company with surplus cash is to enter into a repurchase agreement (repo). Put succinctly, repos are financial instruments that enable a corporate treasurer to exchange overnight or short-term cash for high-quality security. The corporate holds this security until the original owner of the collateral repurchases it. More often than not, corporates will appoint a third party to manage the collateral. This structure is called a tri-party repo.</p>
<p>Although agreements between banks dominate the repo market, some corporates have found them to be a useful tool. A key reason for this is that corporates can adjust the ‘risk-and-return’ equation on their investment to match their internal investment policy. This is because corporates can decide on the spectrum of assets they wish to hold. Corporates can take high-quality relatively secure assets, such as German Bunds, and receive little return. Or they can generate a greater yield by taking corporate bonds or equities.</p>
<p>Repos are also a good tool for a corporate to use if it wishes to reduce its number of counterparties. By securing the investments with collateral, corporates do not have to worry about losing their investment if the bank collapses. This feature also means corporates can use repos to support strategic corporate actions, such as depositing a large amount of cash on the back of a sale.</p>
<p>However, there are high barriers to entry for corporates considering repos. One barrier is the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), which governs the repo market. Although defined as an ‘industry standard’, it requires lengthy negotiation with each counterparty to iron out the specifics within the agreement. Corporates with little knowledge of the secured financing world, legal capacity or expertise in the repo market, can find the process time-consuming and off-putting.</p>
<p>Like SMAs, repos also require corporates to commit a significant amount of cash to the transaction. This is because the banks are used to dealing with large amounts of cash on their side of the equation, so corporates need to match these levels. As a result, repos are largely the domain of the multinationals.</p>
<h3 id=""supplier-finance"">Supplier finance</h3>
<p>Investing in the supply chain is an alternative option for corporates wondering where to put their surplus cash. Whilst not a new concept, supplier finance, not to be confused with bank-offered supply chain finance, is capturing the attention of short-term investors. This is due to it being essentially risk-free and providing corporates with the opportunity to achieve a tidy return on their cash investment.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder, supplier finance is where a corporation uses its cash (or sometimes cash from a third party) to finance suppliers. It does so by paying approved invoices ahead of the due date in return for a discount. In theory, this creates a win-win; buyers save money on the goods purchased and suppliers can access a cheaper source of funding than they would from alternative sources. Supplier finance is generally regarded by suppliers as the easiest form of finance to access and it’s available to all businesses, regardless of size or geography, and with no cumbersome on-boarding process.</p>
<p>The discounts that corporate buyers can achieve using supplier financing – and thus the yield they gain on their cash investment – can be substantial. Colin Sharp, SVP EMEA at C2FO, says its clients are achieving between 7% and 8% APR return on their investments into the supply chain while at the same time reducing the cost of finance for their suppliers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anecdotally, many treasurers have or are considering updating investment policies and are looking at alternatives to bank deposits and CNAV MMFs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This is because suppliers, especially those down the mid- to long-end of the supply chain, need cash for working capital or to invest in the business,” he says. “Suppliers can offer a rate that’s appropriate to them (there is significant price elasticity) and C2FO’s market can blend these offers to achieve the target yield required by the corporate.”</p>
<p>Unlike other investment options, supplier financing also offers treasury the platform to act strategically within the organisation. “By working with procurement to offer supplier financing, treasury can help safeguard the supply chain,” he says. “It can also position the company as a preferred customer, enabling it to achieve exclusive deals and better pricing. It may also provide suppliers with the cash they need to innovate, thus resulting in your company receiving better products from them.”</p>
<p>Despite all the benefits that supplier financing can provide, it is arguably a more complex short-term investment solution than those already discussed. This is because, by its very nature, supplier financing is a cross-functional project that requires the buy-in of multiple stakeholders. This can be difficult to achieve in larger corporations, especially if treasury and procurement, for example, are working towards conflicting KPIs.</p>
<p>Sharp says ultimately the benefits are worth the effort, believing that supplier financing will only deliver more benefits as interest rates rise around the world. “As rates rise, companies will be forced to pay an even higher price for working capital,” says Sharp. “Corporate buyers can support their suppliers through this by providing supplier financing. At the same time, the corporate buyer will pick up enhanced yield on their own cash investment. It is a win-win.”</p>
<h3 id=""flexibility-is-key"">Flexibility is key</h3>
<p>As the short-term investment environment continues to evolve, the impetus for corporate treasurers to change their thinking around short-term investments grows ever greater. Ensuring the investment policy is flexible is crucial, and treasurers may wish to establish the ability to use a wide variety of different investment options – even if they do not plan on using them immediately.</p>
<p>This process of adaptation appears to be already well under way. Anecdotally, many treasurers have or are considering updating investment policies and are looking at alternatives to bank deposits and CNAV MMFs.</p>
<p>Treasurers are also focusing on achieving a more accurate cash forecast and prudently segmenting cash. Doing so enables them to be more strategic in how they allocate cash, allowing them to use a wider range of products to meet the company’s investment objectives.</p></div>

<p>
<br/><br/>Treasurers must start asking more questions of their fund providers if they are to optimise their cash investments. It’s a succinct message but one that carries much weight in today’s evolving short-term landscape.<br/></p>
<p>With the new money market fund (MMF) regulations, which must be implemented by managers by 21st January 2019, it will open up the category to include some products that could leave unwary investors short on their security or liquidity requirements. Investment decisions in this space may no longer be as obvious as they once were. Indeed, if short-term alternatives are also considered as part of the mix, finding a balance between the sometimes-conflicting treasury needs of security, liquidity and yield, demands a new level of treasury due diligence from the outset when choosing a fund.</p>
<h3 id=""time-is-of-the-essence"">Time is of the essence</h3>
<p>For most treasurers, especially those in the UK, a MMF is what the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) calls a short-term MMF. However, ESMA also use the term ‘money market fund’, intending to distinguish between the short-term variant and its longer weighted average maturity (WAM) counterpart.</p>
<p>Historically, the latter product has mostly been for continental consumption, and less focused on a treasury client base. Under the new regulation, both ESMA definitions disappear. Short- and longer-term products will now respectively be called ‘Short-term Money Market Funds’ and ‘Standard Money Market Funds’.</p>
<p>The clarity of distinction is somewhat nuanced to the point where it could be especially confusing for UK treasurers, many of whom will now be faced with an option, where (to all intents and purposes) one did not previously exist. “This creates the potential for an unpleasant surprise,” comments Kerrie Mitchener-Nissen, Head of Product Development, International, Global Liquidity, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. For the sake of liquidity, understanding product differences is now essential.</p>
<p>Previously, treasurers allocating cash for investment have used short-term MMFs, deposits and, depending on their level of sophistication and appetite for involvement, possibly repurchase agreements (repos) too. In a bid to optimise their investments, the last few years has seen an increasing appetite for segmenting cash.</p>
<p>Common definitions of its use include ‘operational’ or day-to-day cash; medium-term ‘reserve’ cash; and longer-term ‘strategic’ cash. Working backwards, each state requires increasing levels of liquidity. Under the new regulatory classifications, the subtle distinction between ‘short-term’ and ‘standard’ could mean the unaware treasurer runs the risk of making an inappropriate investment decision.</p>
<p>The ‘short-term MMF’ is still the fund that most corporate treasurers have in mind when investing their operating cash, says Mitchener-Nissen. The term ‘standard MMF’ is therefore potentially confusing. But it is a longer-dated product and is less liquid, sometimes holding instruments out to two years in a portfolio that has a WAM of six months, rather than the 60 days WAM of a short-term portfolio. The proportion of the standard MMF portfolio that matures within one day and one week may also be significantly lower than a treasury manager expects. “It is important for treasurers to be aware of the distinction, so they know what they are buying,” she states. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with the standard MMF as an asset class, it just needs to be used correctly.”</p>
<h3 id=""importance-of-segmentation"">Importance of segmentation</h3>
<p>In this light, it should be easy to see the importance of segmenting the highly liquid needs of working capital, and other cash segments that can be put further out on the curve. Segmenting can open up a discussion on the range of options for each cash-type, says Mitchener-Nissen.</p>
<p>A standard MMF carries less liquidity but may well be a desirable product if it fits the corporate’s cash segmentation profile. Indeed, few would willingly pay for unnecessary liquidity. However, it is vital to understand the new regulatory classifications of MMFs to avoid investing in a fund that unexpectedly adds risk (a fund that could, for example, be using derivatives, deploying leverage, or investing in a currency other than the one required by the investor, where that exposure has to be hedged back).</p>
<p>“It’s down to the treasurer to be specific about what they’re looking for,” says Mitchener-Nissen. This only comes from understanding of their own investment needs; an understanding derived largely from segmentation. “But they also need to look closely under the hood of every MMF they are thinking of investing in.”</p>
<h3 id=""research-required"">Research required</h3>
<p>An awareness of the risks that the new regulatory classifications can present – or rather, the risks that confusing the new terms can create – should lead to more attentive reading of the fund manager prospectuses. This should be done in conjunction with treasury’s own investment policy to fully understand what is acceptable.</p>
<p>“It’s important for treasurers to start thinking about this now,” says Mitchener-Nissen. Action should typically take the form of a review of investment policy, ensuring it is at the very least updated to take account of the options under the new rules. Ideally, revisions should be mindful not only of current needs, but also of incorporating sufficient flexibility to take advantage of an evolving short-term market.</p>
<h3 id=""wider-options"">Wider options</h3>
<p>The traditional stable or constant net asset value (CNAV) fund has been the go-to MMF for most treasurers. Under the new regulation this broadens out with the arrival of a low volatility net asset value (LVNAV), a variable net asset value (VNAV), and a public debt CNAV. LVNAV and public debt CNAV are short-term MMFs only but VNAVs offer short-term or standard options.</p>
<p>Which product is deemed most suitable will be dependent upon a number of variables such as investment objectives, business goals and the cash cycles to which a business is subject, says Mitchener-Nissen. But having the flexibility to be able to respond to liquidity requirements and being able, at a policy level, to invest in any of the new options will go some way to optimising corporate cash.</p>
<p>Whilst MMFs may be part of an investment plan, treasurers could also feasibly include alternatives such as short-duration fixed income funds, longer-dated deposits, or separately managed accounts (SMAs) if a bespoke investment policy is desired.</p>
<h3 id=""private-investigations"">Private investigations</h3>
<p>It should be apparent by now that understanding the new terminology plays an important role in making the right investment decisions. Standard and short term may be confusing but the use of historical terms attached to other fund types, such as ‘cash plus’ or ‘enhanced cash’, demands that treasurers fully investigate what these funds are doing and how performance is achieved.</p>
<p>The suggestion that a fund may deliver ‘extra’ return is perhaps an agreeable one for many investors. “But treasurers need to be aware of the incremental risk that they may have to take in order to generate that extra yield,” says Mitchener-Nissen. “Watching out for that terminology and understanding that there is no standardised definition for their use is important.” It’s not an issue of right or wrong, she adds, “it is simply one of being aware of what the underlying investment is”.</p>
<h3 id=""asking-questions"">Asking questions</h3>
<p>The new MMF regulation requires fund managers to be transparent with their clients about how their fund operates. On a weekly basis, for example, WAM and WAL and the fund’s top investments must be disclosed. “There is a lot of information available for investors now,” says Mitchener-Nissen. “We publish a lot of this on a daily basis including mark-to-market NAV and liquidity levels. This really helps clients understand their investments.”</p>

<p>With deadlines for the new regulation looming, J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity is working closely with clients to ensure they are regulation ready. In accessing the resource centre, clients can search for impartial guidance and papers on a number of related topics.</p>
<p>However, she reports that a number of treasurers are now asking for practical assistance with reviewing their investment policies and board presentational materials. Naturally, this is forthcoming, she says. “It’s all about ensuring that the client transition to the new MMF regulations is as smooth as possible.”</p>

</div>
<h4 style=""clear:both;"">Welcome all. Can we start with a brief overview of the key changes that are coming in the European money market fund (MMF) industry as a result of recent reform?</h4>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Laurie Brignac, Managing Director, Head of Global Liquidity Portfolio Management, Invesco:</span> The European MMF reforms focus on four primary areas: product structure, portfolio liquidity, portfolio credit and transparency. Whilst these are all important, what is crucial for investors is the different product structures that have been introduced.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Beccy Milchem, Head of International Cash Corporate Sales, BlackRock:</span> To expand on this, from 21<sup>st</sup> January 2019, asset managers will be able to offer clients different fund structures. There are three short-term MMFs: a government constant net asset value (CNAV) fund, a government low volatility NAV (LVNAV) fund, and prime and government variable net asset value (VNAV) funds. Then there is a separate VNAV fund type for standard MMFs.</p>
<p>What is disappearing is the prime CNAV fund structure that many corporates utilise today. Asset managers will be replacing these with either LVNAV or short-term VNAV products and we will all be deciding which in the next few months.</p>
</div>
<h4>So, the product that investors know and love is not going to exist any more?</h4>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Laurie Brignac, Invesco:</span> I think that’s a fair statement as prime CNAV funds will be no more, although once you scratch below the surface of LVNAV funds and look at how they will operate in practice, you can make a strong argument that the experience for investors using LVNAV products will be near identical to what they currently have using CNAV products. It is true, however, that the legal structure of the fund will be different.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Paul Przybylski, Head of Product Strategy and Development, Global Liquidity, J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM):</span> It is worth pointing out that LVNAV products will be managed tighter than the existing CNAV product, as the threshold (outside of which the fund must be mark-to-market) will be reducing from 50 basis points in the CNAV construct to 20 basis points in the LVNAV construct. I agree with Laurie on the whole though: the client experience investing in LVNAV funds should be very similar as investing in CNAV funds currently. Based on ongoing conversations with many of our clients, we anticipate to transition to this fund structure by the transition deadline.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Laurie Brignac, Invesco:</span> Paul makes a good point: LVNAV funds will be managed tighter because the reform is designed to make money funds more resilient. Although all of us at the table currently manage funds that are AAA rated, so to a certain extent we were already managing to tighter construct than the regulations prescribe today. In that sense, regulation is simply catching up with market best practice.</p>

<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Anthony Callcott, Head of Pan-European Liquidity, Aviva Investors:</span> True, but the new rules are putting less of an onus on the rating agencies and more of a focus on the fund managers. The way I see it is that it is a constructive, not destructive, move by the regulators. If we think back to why this is happening, it is ultimately to prevent another financial crisis. In addition, it is also aiming to increase transparency, improve liquidity and improve security.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Gunjan Chauhan, Senior Managing Director, Head of EMEA and APAC Cash Business, Global Cash, State Street Global Advisors (SSGA):</span> And that can only be helpful for the end investor. Everyone will benefit from greater transparency and more clarity in the market.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Laurie Brignac, Invesco:</span> Transparency is probably one of my favourite components of the reform. When we look and see what happened in the United States with its own recent reform, the increased transparency has made a huge difference in the way we interact with our clients. It also means that clients know exactly what they are investing in and are able to easily compare fund A with fund B.</p>
</div>
<h4>Can we now dive into the new product structures in a little more detail to ensure that the corporate investor understands the options? Most crucially, could you please explain the differences between an LVNAV and VNAV product?</h4>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM:</span> In an LVNAV fund, asset managers can use amortised cost accounting to price all instruments shorter than 75 days, and can round to two decimal places, so that the fund largely resembles current CNAV funds. VNAV funds are priced mark-to-market and rounded to four decimal places.</p>
<p>The other differences are around liquidity. In an LVNAV structure, the minimum liquid assets that the fund must hold are 10% and 30% respectively. This compares to 7.5% and 15% in a VNAV construct. That gives the portfolio managers a bit more flexibility managing the VNAV vis-a-vis the LVNAV fund. Theoretically, this means that VNAV funds may offer investors greater yield.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: I think the fact that VNAV funds are rounded to four decimal places, while LVNAV funds can be rounded to two decimal places, is important and something that investors need to be mindful of. This is because even under normal market conditions, that fourth decimal place may fluctuate. We have seen this in the US.</p>
</div>
<h4>You stopped your CNAV fund some time ago but are you going to introduce an LVNAV fund?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: Yes, we are. We are planning to launch the LVNAV fund on 1<sup>st</sup> September. Although in reality, we are just adding the ‘L’ to the marketing brochures of our government and short-term VNAV funds because there are minimal changes that we have to make.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out though that our euro fund will remain VNAV due to the difficulties in offering an LVNAV fund managing in a negative yield environment.</p>
</div>
<h4>Yes, we will come to that a little later.</h4>
<figure class=""portrait right"" style=""float: left; margin: 0.5em 2em 1em 0;""> <img alt=""Portrait of Beccy Milchem"" height=""225"" src=""/i/2018/07/2018-07and08-tt-06-ttf__beccy-milchem__0489__200x225.jpg"" title=""Beccy Milchem"" width=""200""/> <figcaption>
<h6>Beccy Milchem</h6>
</figcaption> </figure>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: VNAV can be a slightly confusing construct for investors, particularly because there are short-term VNAV funds and standard VNAV funds. Should a treasury department decide to invest in a VNAV product, they need to consider which category they are actually looking at for their policy purposes.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note just how important that AAA rating is for investors, especially when it comes to seeking board approval of their investment policy. Given this investor focus, I suspect that most fund managers will maintain a rating for their short-term MMF funds, whether they are VNAV or LVNAV. This will bring a certain degree of consistency into how these funds are managed and might mean that LVNAV and VNAV funds end up looking quite alike in many respects.</p>
</div>
<h4>Does this mean they will yield the same?</h4>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: There could be a marginal yield difference between an LVNAV fund and short-term VNAV fund. As Paul mentioned earlier, there is a different liquidity threshold, which could allow for some extra yield pick up to be generated. However, the need to meet the requirements of an external rating agency may reduce the difference due to the more conservative liquidity requirements of the rating agencies. It remains to be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: Another item to mention here is gates and fees. These exist in LVNAV funds and may be triggered if the level of weekly liquid assets falls below 30% and net redemptions from the fund exceed 10% in one day. Given this trigger point, most LVNAV funds will be running north of 30% when it comes to liquid assets, so I think you will see an additional yield pick up when using a VNAV product – even when you consider the external rating.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: To add to this point, in the US, product managers were running their funds with a much higher level of liquid assets than necessary prior to the reform – some were running at almost 100% in the weekly cash because they knew significant outflows were coming in anticipation of the US reform conversion date. This is one of the key statistics for clients and they will react if a fund is lower than 40% because it is below industry average.</p>
<p>I expect that we will see the same behaviour in Europe and liquidity will be increased in excess of the 30% threshold. This is going to be a detractor of the yield differential because even though the reform lets you go down to 15%, the reality is that that number is going to be north of that. This will compress the spread between LVNAV and VNAV funds.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>We’re hearing from clients that LVNAV is the closest thing to what they have today and that is probably where many of them will be heading. But their due diligence is to assess their investment policies and ensure they are flexible and able to change quickly if need be.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4>Every single survey I have seen says that investors don’t like fees and gates. What is your view on this?</h4>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: Fees and gates are not a new concept in the international space; clients have been investing in products with fees and gates for a long period of time. What is new is that the reform has defined when these mechanisms will be activated – before it was at the discretion of the fund manager and the fund’s board. We are currently spending a lot of time talking to our clients about this to ensure they are comfortable and understand the fees and gates triggers because, as you rightly said, there is some concern in the market about fees and gates.</p>
</div>
<h4>Is this because we never talked about fees and gates before?</h4>
<figure class=""portrait right"" style=""float: right; margin: 0 0em 2em 2em;""> <img alt=""Portrait of Paul Przybylski"" height=""225"" src=""/i/2018/07/2018-07and08-tt-06-ttf__paul-przybylski__0639__200x225.jpg"" title=""Paul Przybylski"" width=""200""/> <figcaption>
<h6>Paul Przybylski</h6>
</figcaption> </figure>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: Previously the use of fees and gates was essentially the same as ‘breaking the buck’ (fund no longer able to redeem at par) so hopefully we will never have to use them.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: Hopefully going forward none of us will have to use them either!</p>
<p>One element of the reform that is very interesting is that the regulators have said that fund managers can transact a stable NAV until they go out of the 20 basis point collar. When this happens, the fund can convert to VNAV and round to four decimal places and then revert to LVNAV once the market has calmed down.</p>
<p>Yet despite this, I think if your transactional NAV moves from two decimal places stable to a four decimal place variable, you really probably ought to consider putting up gates, because I have a feeling clients are not going to forgive you and allow you the opportunity to go back to two decimal places. It might just be my personal opinion, but I don’t see that really happening.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: I think those investors who are going into a stable NAV investment on day one, are going in expecting a stable NAV investment.</p>
</div>

<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: Ultimately, the purpose of fees and gates are to protect the end investor and to ensure we are all acting as a fiduciary by treating investors fairly.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: Yes, that point is not emphasised enough. As we have said, fees and gates exist today. The new rules simply provide additional clarity on when fees and gates around liquidity or redemptions may well come into play.</p>
<p>And in stressed market conditions, if any of those factors or triggers do get breached where redemptional liquidity fees or gates need to be imposed, it’s again transparent and clear for any investor in that fund to understand what is happening and what is going on. So, it really is actually a helpful mechanism for them in a stressed market environment.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><h4>OK. So LVNAV provides that stability that corporates are looking for – albeit with gates and fees. Why then would I as an investor use VNAV? Is it just to pick up that bit more yield?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: There is a growing trend for corporates to want to make their cash work harder for them. There is also a growing acceptance that if you are chasing that yield, there might be a little bit more volatility.</p>
</div>
<h4>You might not ever see that volatility though, correct?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: Correct, but investors need to understand that it could exist. Because of this, many large corporates take a blended approach, looking for low volatility investment options for their day-to-day operational cash and liquidity requirements and then investing some stickier cash in products that make it work a bit harder.</p>

<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: True, but we have talked to some large global corporates that you would have thought might be aggressive with their investment options who still don’t want to see that NAV move at all. They want two decimal places and certainty.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: Yes, it depends on whether the investment policy dictates that you can’t book any losses on your money fund investments.</p>
<p>This is where we suggest that corporates do their due diligence because each decision will be unique. We’re hearing from clients that LVNAV is the closest thing to what they have today and that is probably where many of them will be heading. But their due diligence is to assess their investment policies and ensure they are flexible and able to change quickly if need be.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: I think the majority of investors in this space have changed policies now or are very close to doing so. That’s certainly been happening for quite some time, but I think in the last six months we’re seeing it more and more. Treasurers are getting themselves ready.</p>
</div>
<h4>And they are adopting LVNAV?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: Yes, on the whole. Some of our European investors that have US parent companies are more interested in government CNAV funds because that’s what their investment policies in the US dictate they can invest in. But the European investors and the UK investors are ready for the change to either LVNAV or VNAV or both.</p>
<p>Our job is really to make sure that we are fully educating investors, making sure we are transparent about our plans and meeting our clients face to face, and giving them that comfort. It is about trust: that is the one thing you must have from your client base.</p>
</div>
<h4>Now, if I am going to think about VNAV in addition to LVNAV, what do I need to think about? We’ve got the regulatory differences but is there anything else I should be considering?</h4>
<figure class=""portrait left"" style=""float: left; margin: 0.5em 2em 0em 0;""> <img alt=""Portrait of Gunjan Chauhan"" height=""225"" src=""/i/2018/07/2018-07and08-tt-06-ttf__gunjan-chauhan__0561__200x225.jpg"" title=""Gunjan Chauhan"" width=""200""/> <figcaption>
<h6>Gunjan Chauhan</h6>
</figcaption> </figure>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: Absolutely. I would suggest you carefully consider your investment objectives. As touched upon earlier there are two types of VNAV fund structure: there is the short-term VNAV, which is considerably shorter in duration, and I would argue would have a portfolio make up similar to an LVNAV fund. And then you have standard VNAV where you are potentially exposing yourself to additional duration risk, but then also may well see a pick up in yield for doing so. Corporates will need to decide which of these they are comfortable with.</p>
<p>It is actually quite exciting for investors to be able to take a fresh look at their investment guidelines, ensuring that their systems are fit for purpose to be able to handle the various scenarios. We would like to hope everything always remains under normal market conditions, but experience tells us that it is prudent to plan for the unexpected.</p>
</div>
<h4>Are you all transitioning your funds at the same time?</h4>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: No and I think the dates of conversion are going to be an interesting storyline to follow when it comes to the reform in Europe. This is because in the US everyone converted within a two-week period, whereas in Europe we are all going at different times. For example, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management we are transitioning over the weekend that starts after the funds close on Friday 30<sup>th</sup> November. Spacing between managers converting will allow clients to see how the industry shapes and provide insight to client behaviour that could influence their own.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: We’re moving in January 2019.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: It will be interesting to see how clients behave as a result. And that’s something we can’t predict because they don’t really know what the fund sizes and structures will look like in the future and I think they’re going to pay attention to that. Clients do ask what size funds they should expect and we do provide estimates on our own fund line-up.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: But if you choose to stay in an LVNAV and your CNAV fund is converting into an LVNAV, really for all intents and purposes it shouldn’t matter.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: Yes, but if you are the first fund to transition you need to get it right because if you convert and your systems don’t work, that’s not going to be a good experience for clients. This is a really big risk for whatever fund manager makes the move first.</p>

<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: You’re bringing up a good point. I know we mentioned earlier that a lot of treasurers use different investment platforms. So, something else to highlight is to make sure that they are talking to their platform provider and making sure that they’re going to be ready. I know it shouldn’t be as big of an issue here, depending on how the funds transition and what they’re converting into, but I know in the US, being forced into a floating NAV was prohibitive for certain platforms. I would encourage treasurers to make sure that how they transact today will be the same in the post-reform world.</p>
</div>
<h4>Is it important that I get into the investment policies of the fund manager as an investor? If so, how far do I have to dig?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: I think you dig all the way. Choosing your fund provider is an important decision and you have to ensure that they fit your criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: In terms of approving an investment manager, most corporates that I work with will not only look at whether the fund has external ratings, but also have a look through into the individual holdings of the funds and make sure that the manager’s investment process sits comfortably with them.</p>
<p>Our clients have a long list of questions for us. Quite frequently, we hold due diligence days with our investors to walk them through exactly how we manage the portfolio, how our credit process works and how our risk process works. This homework certainly needs to be done by the investment community.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: Most definitely. As we know, a big part of the reform is to remove the reliance on the credit rating agencies. Therefore, even though our funds are externally rated, investors should still have their own robust credit processes. The transparency created by the regulation is going to help greatly here because investors will be able to quite easily compare two funds side by side.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: We are seeing the same thing. Investors want to know the details of our funds, they want to understand our internal processes and risk and credit appetite. The fact they are asking for this level of detail evidences that they are carrying out diligent analysis to ensure that they make the right investment decision between one money fund and another. They are looking beyond just the ratings as the regulators hoped they would.</p>

<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: Some investors are even insisting on meeting the credit analysts themselves. This is something that is happening more and more.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: That is a tremendous change. I think pre-financial crisis, all money funds were deemed to be exactly the same, and we always knew there were differences. And that is why it’s so critical to make sure that our products are being properly sold and that the clients know what they’re buying. That is where the additional transparency is going to make a really big difference.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: I would add that it is about scale; the size of your fund matters as much as everything we just talked about here. To investors, a percentage allocation of the fund that they represent matters, and they will not feel comfortable if their investment is north of 10% of the total fund’s values. This is something that we are thinking about carefully when constructing our future fund line-up.</p>
</div>
<h4>On the subject of transparency, how easy is it for corporates to get a report of the fund’s holdings?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: When I look back to some years ago in a meeting with a client and I said, ‘What are you most nervous about in these products?’ He said, ‘I’m nervous because I can’t see what I’m in, and the information is never accurate, and I’m nervous my CFO’s going to tap me on the shoulder one day and ask what we are exposed to – and I won’t be able to tell him.’</p>
<p>Now corporates can get all that information very easily. There are many different portals that customers are using which aggregate information and have reporting tools that allow treasurers to drill down into the geographical locations of investments and asset classes. The information is all there at the press of a button.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: If we compare Europe to the US, I believe that the US has a more transparent system when it comes to reporting. Fund managers in the US are subject to monthly and quarterly reporting of the complete underlying portfolio of investments mandated by the regulator. In Europe, policy makers have started to move towards this by introducing requirements to make a weekly disclosure of the top ten holdings in the portfolio, the credit profile and the maturity profile.</p>
<p>The timing of the data is the critical component. For example, currently in Europe, one fund house might report on a monthly lag versus a weekly lag or bi-weekly lag, so the information the treasury has might not be current or accurate. With more information being disclosed weekly, this should improve under the new rules.</p>
</div></div>

<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">

<div class=""copy__body""><div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: Although the regulations in Europe don’t require us to report in the same way as the US, many of our clients are invested in both European and US funds and they want consistency. To that end, we have ensured that we are offering the same level of transparency to European investors as we do to US investors.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: At J.P. Morgan Asset Management, currently our reporting on our website is consistent on a monthly basis. This means that in Europe, we provide a greater deal of information versus most of our peers, simply because our clients require consistency when they invest here and in the US. This is crucial when you are dealing with multinationals.</p>
</div>
<h4>Let’s talk about negative interest rates, which obviously operate particularly in the euro at the moment. I wanted to understand how you deal with that now and how that might change in the future under the reform.</h4>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: We are sort of in our ‘new normal’ when it comes to negative interest rates. Initially, there was a lot of fear of the unknown and everybody was asking, ‘Who’s going to go negative first? How is this going to work?’ Now that we’re comfortably negative I think it’s a more normalised environment – it’s just negative from an investment perspective.</p>
</div>
<h4>How does it work today if I am invested in a euro fund with a negative return?</h4>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: There are a few different options. If you’re in a distributing share class, then there is a technique called share cancellation. This is when an investor’s shareholdings in the fund are reduced the longer they are invested in the fund to reflect the negative interest rates.</p>
<p>Or investors can use an accumulating share class fund. This will see the investor’s number of shares stay the same, but the price is going to change every day. It’s effectively the same as VNAV. You’ll see that price slowly drop to reflect the negative interest rate.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: It was also a challenge to manage clients’ expectations through the process of going negative. But the narrative has certainly now shifted from treasurers saying, ‘How dare you charge me for looking after my money?’ to accepting that it has to be this way and being proactive and working with it.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: From my experience, corporates were quite taken aback when we started to charge them for investments. But once the banks started as well, the conversations changed as our negative rate looks a little bit better than the banks’ negative rate.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: That is a really important point. Negative interest rates are not unique to the money fund industry.</p>
</div>
<h4>And is there a predominance of the way it is treated, is it generally treated by the cancellation of shares or is it generally treated by changing the value of the shares?</h4>
<figure class=""portrait right"" style=""float: right; margin: 0 0em 1em 2em;""> <img alt=""Portrait of Beccy Milchem"" height=""225"" src=""/i/2018/07/2018-07and08-tt-06-ttf__beccy-milchem__0423__200x225.jpg"" title=""Beccy Milchem"" width=""200""/> <figcaption>
<h6>Beccy Milchem</h6>
</figcaption> </figure>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: If you are running a constant euro NAV fund today, the majority of investors, particularly corporates, are in the distributing share class that Laurie mentioned, using share class cancellation, otherwise known as reverse distribution. And so yes, we’re predominantly using reverse distribution which is the reverse of the positive income distribution process, whereby shareholdings are reduced to reflect the negative income distribution.</p>
<p>You do also have VNAV products where the share price moves to account for the negative rate.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: Which is how we run our euro funds.</p>
</div>
<h4 class=""clear"">And going forward?</h4>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: There is still a considerable amount of discussion across the industry, as well as with the regulators, around the treatment of the reverse distribution mechanism that essentially enables fund managers to maintain a stable NAV for a euro investor today. So that’s still out there being discussed, and we are all eagerly anticipating clarity around that point.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: Without clarity from regulators over how they view reverse distribution, it’s difficult to say exactly what solutions might be possible moving forward, and therefore, what the impact on product offerings in euro might be.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: The main point here is that euro investors looking to achieve a stable NAV must be mindful. As mentioned, without the ability to cancel shares it will not be possible to achieve a stable NAV in a negative interest rate environment. For investors that don’t have that flexibility in their policy, it will become very challenging for them to find suitable products to invest in.</p>
</div></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><div class=""person n2"">
<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: I would add that euro investors have gotten used to negative rates on the whole. We have been in this situation for quite some time now and they have become used to the way that the reverse distribution mechanism works. Perhaps further education around how it will work in a VNAV world with that daily adjustment in the NAV is still needed.</p>
<p>It comes back to the point: where does the money go? There won’t be other options and as Laurie mentioned, euro MMFs are often the best option out there these days. Banks tend to have threshold limits for euros, particularly with the corporates: they might allow them to put five million in their deposit account before they start going deeply, deeply negative – but the negative yields available from the banks are often much worse than the money funds.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: And I would argue the added benefit of money funds – whichever format you decide is appropriate for you – is that they are a sustainable solution that provides same-day access to cash.

<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: Of course, there remains some uncertainty around this topic, but I think that no matter what the outcome is, we need to be working with our clients to make sure they are drafting flexibility into their policies. We don’t want them to say they can only invest in a stable NAV and then have them forced into investing in a product that doesn’t suit them.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: Corporates have the opportunity to affect change now and they need to get to work on this. And when they do it, they need to ensure that they can use LVNAV and VNAV funds going forward.</p>
</div>
<h4>Is there still competition in fees? There was a time when very large investors were getting fee reimbursements. What’s happening to fees today?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: It is competitive. It will continue to be competitive. We all charge fees, because we need to earn money. We’re not in this to give a free service. Customers understand that.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: I would argue that in the money funds space, management fees are incredibly transparent for end investors. This isn’t the case if you are investing in any other short duration instrument where the pricing can maybe be more ambiguous.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: Compression of fees is inevitable. We have seen it for years; this is happening more and more across not only liquidity products but more broadly across the mutual fund industry.</p>
</div>
<h4>Are you expecting further consolidation of fund managers in the industry?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: There has been consolidation and there will always be consolidation. The desire to acquire will continue going forward. But I think what we can look forward to is good growth in this business over the coming three to five years.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: Yes, if you look at the league tables, ten names account for approximately 80% of the market today; it’s already fairly consolidated at the top. Regulatory reforms are going to push more players out, simply because of the cost. It’s quite expensive to build the infrastructure for regulatory reform. So, we’ll probably see smaller players consolidated a bit further down, but you probably won’t expect the top ten to start merging together, at least not yet.</p>

But again, until you get clarity around what the final rules are, it’s hard to know, and that’s at least part of it. Even with reform, it’s hard to navigate something when you don’t have clarity.</p>

</div>
<h4>The issue is selling what will be a European regulated product into the UK market – that’s the major area of potential impact, is it?</h4>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p>Paul Przybylski, JPMAM: Correct. We may have to set up a brand-new construct of products. But as Gunjan said, the devil will be in the detail. Another component is how much time we will have to implement. That’s going to be a huge factor in deciding what we can actually bring to our clients.</p>
<p>Because you can imagine the body of work that would be required to launch a sterling product – we have clients that would like to see euros and dollars in the same space – so you’re talking about potentially duplicating our offering. As mentioned before, that will take time and effort – and costs will again be part of that equation.</p>

<p>As a result, when we speak to our clients about these trends, their eyes glaze over. But there is not a lot of time left, and we implore that treasurers push one last time and ensure they are ready to invest in the new regulatory landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p>Anthony Callcott, Aviva Investors: I think you’re right, there is fatigue on the client side. I had a client recently that I booked a meeting with who said, ‘You can come and see me – but if you mention reform, you’re leaving!’</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: It means that more than ever, investors should be very close to their investment managers and vice versa, uncertainty calls for partnerships, and guiding our clients through all these changes is a responsibility that we take incredibly seriously.</p>
<p>We should be mindful of the priority list that our investors have. One of the reasons why investors in the US really were not indicating what they were going to be doing until the eleventh hour may be a reflection of where it’s stacked in their priority list. Sometimes investors or clients will not do anything until they absolutely have to. So, I think that’s where you need to just be ready to support them when they start working on it.</p>

structures to build a policy that will enable them to achieve this. Plan
accordingly within their organisations with respect to the new product
offerings and act when the time comes by selecting the products that
best suit their needs by the defined conversion dates.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p>Beccy Milchem, BlackRock: Like Anthony and Paul, I also agree that
the reforms are positive, bringing in a lot more transparency and choice
for investors.</p>
<p>I would also encourage treasurers to look at their investment
policies sooner rather than later. Top of mind should be creating
something that is future proof. It is about being a bit more open-minded
about what tools you can use now and ensure this is reflected in the
policy.</p>

<p>Laurie Brignac, Invesco: I would echo all these points. I would also
encourage treasurers to be close to their fund managers and know exactly
when they are transitioning. We’re all going to be transitioning at
different times, in different timescales. So it’s probably time to start
gathering that information and asking when the conversion dates are, so
you can work your way back if you haven’t updated your investment
guidelines already.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, SSGA: My advice for investors is to take the time to
stay close to your investment managers and ensure that you are getting
up to speed with what the different product choices will be post-reform.
And take the time to take it one step further and actually look at the
operational mechanisms around how each of those product types will
function.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Regulatory changes such as Basel III have affected the way that banks view operational and non-operational deposits, while low interest rates and the rise of money market funds are also impacting treasurers’ short-term investment decisions. What are treasurers looking for in the current market – and how important is it to review existing policies?</em></p>
<p>Central to the treasurer’s role is the task of ensuring that short-term cash is invested effectively – but what that looks like can vary from company to company, for a number of reasons. For one thing, regulatory developments such as Basel III are continuing to affect the way in which banks view deposits. Meanwhile, the types of product on offer are not set in stone – and treasurers’ investment goals can change over time as a result of evolving market conditions as well as changes to their business models.</p>
<h3 id=""challenging-investment-landscape"">Challenging investment landscape</h3>
<p>For treasurers, the current short-term investment landscape presents certain challenges. The low interest rate environment has made it increasingly difficult for treasurers to achieve any meaningful yield from their short-term investments. At the same time, regulatory change – most notably the arrival of Basel III – has had an impact on the value that banks place on certain types of corporate deposit.</p>
<p>“The effects of Basel III regulation continue to be felt in money markets across developed countries,” comments Gordon Rodrigues, Fund Manager at HSBC Australia Liquidity Fund. “Basel III introduced new requirements to the way banks assess their funding sources from a liquidity (ability to withstand severe illiquidity for 30 days) and ALM/stability of funding (asset and liability tenor mismatch) point of view. The implementation of these rules is expected to be completed by 2019.”</p>
<p>Rodrigues notes that the impact on markets and investors has included a continued reduction in banks’ appetite for short-dated deposits as implementation progresses. “Investors are being asked by their banking partners to clearly define what is operational cash (versus non-operational), and different rules are applied to each, depending on the depositor category you fall into,” he says.</p>
<p>As such, Basel III has given rise to a more pronounced distinction between deposits which are used for daily operations and non-operational deposits. In many cases, the new rules make it unattractive for banks to accept the latter, as there is a greater risk that non-operational cash could be withdrawn if a liquidity crisis were to take place.</p>
<p>Treasurers in Asia also face additional complexity where short-term investments are concerned. “Asia’s short-term investment market is far from uniform,” says Aidan Shevlin, Head of Asian Liquidity Fund Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “Each country is at a different stage of development, with its own regulatory environment, market practices and investment instruments. And with the vast majority of multinational corporations operating in more than one of these markets, this complexity is something that treasurers cannot avoid.”</p>
<h3 id=""priorities-priorities"">Priorities, priorities</h3>
<p>In practice, bank deposits continue to be the product of choice for treasurers across Asia. “Most of the corporates in Asia prefer to invest their short-term cash in bank deposit products,” comments E-May Neoh, Asia Head of Liquidity and Balance Sheet, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “This is because it is a safe investment and it is simple to understand and explain.”</p>
<p>Where investment priorities are concerned, Neoh observes that “all treasurers want their investments to be secure, liquid and with high returns, typically in this order.” As a result, she says that most treasurers in Asia are content with placing short-term cash with their relationship banks as the three criteria are met. “We often see local or regional banks in Asia offer highly competitive rates for bank deposit products, which provide less incentive for corporate treasurers to look for alternative investment tools,” Neoh adds.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the pressures brought by Basel III are being felt around the world, it’s worth noting that corporates may face less pressure to move their cash deposits off balance sheet in Asia than in other regions. The 2017 J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerViewSM survey found that only 17% of respondents in Asia Pacific had been encouraged to move their cash deposits off their balance sheets as a result of factors such as Basel III – compared to 55% of respondents in Europe and 36% of those in the Americas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some banks in the region may offer solutions enabling treasurers to achieve higher interest rates than would otherwise be available. Neoh notes that most large multinational corporates have one or two key cash management banks in the region to manage their day-to-day operations, which are also likely to act as liquidity management providers. “Due to the regulatory landscape in Asia, excess cash in some of the restricted markets can only be invested onshore,” she says. “Some banks do offer interest optimisation solutions, where the bank will agree to pay a higher interest rate in each market based on a pre-agreed aggregated balance level.” </p></div>

<img alt=""General Mills"" class=""logo org"" height=""37"" src=""/i/logo/general-mills-logo-2017-90x37.png"" title=""General Mills"" width=""90""/>
<h5> <br/><br/></h5>
<h5>Could you give me an overview of your role and your team in Asia?</h5>
<p>The treasury department at General Mills in Asia is quite new. I’ve been involved for six months and I’m building up the treasury team – I’ve got people in India and China at the moment, but in Singapore it’s just me. We’re currently focusing on cash management and putting the policies in. I previously spent ten years with ABB running treasury first in Africa and then in Asia, here in Singapore.</p>
<h5>What is your strategy in the area of short-term investments?</h5>
<p>We didn’t have a strategy up to six months ago – our strategy was pretty much to keep the money in the bank, although we were using money market accounts in China and Hong Kong for any overflow of liquidity.</p>
<p>Working with the treasury departments in Europe, we’ve now put a new policy in place – we’ve changed our investment focus to try and get a return on investment and have a more structured approach to what we do with our excess cash. We’re an American company, so a lot of our cash now goes back to the United States, but any excess cash is now going into an investment portfolio and we’re looking for the best returns now.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a bit of time with the banks trying to understand how the landscape is changing and where we can get the best return, considering that interest rates in the region are so low. It’s not like it used to be ten or 15 years ago when you could earn a really good rate of return, but you still want to be in a favourable growth position and get something back.</p>
<h5>How is the short-term investment landscape in Asia Pacific changing?</h5>
<p>The short-term investment landscape is definitely changing – there are far more opportunities for good investments and the banks are starting to make far better offers and have new product offerings in the region. In particular, we’re starting to see more products come to market in Hong Kong and China – we have a lot of excess cash sitting in China at the moment, so that’s given us opportunities to invest there.</p>
<h5>Are you facing any particular challenges where short-term investments are concerned?</h5>
<p>Yes – I think the biggest issue at the moment is regulation. In Asia there’s always the worry that you will go through various stages and outline a plan, and then six months down the line the regulations will change. But I think it’s become far more stable recently. Everything else is pretty straightforward.</p>
<h5>How often do you plan to review your short-term investment policy?</h5>
<p>We have just updated our investment policy – the policy we had was about ten years old, so we’ve totally rewritten it to take in as much of the newer landscape and the newer regulations as possible. We will continue to update it every three to six months as the landscape changes. The goal will be to update the policy when regulatory changes take place and make sure that it remains relevant, rather than necessarily aiming for broad strategy changes.</p>
<h5>Are factors such as Basel III and in-country regulatory change prompting you to adjust your short-term investment policy and goals? If so, how?</h5>
<p>Yes, there has been a lot of conversation around the changes and the impact to our strategy – it’s just made us more proactive and made us have a vested interest in our strategy as the changes come into play, both from a regulatory and an in-country perspective – especially in markets where we have liquid cash that can be utilised.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""weighing-up-money-market-funds"">Weighing up money market funds</h3>
<p>While bank deposits are still the most common short-term investment 
option for corporates in Asia, money market funds have become a more 
attractive option in recent years. “Money market funds (MMFs) have 
increasingly been looked at as an alternative,” comments Neoh. “However,
 the size of the MMF for some of the Asian currencies continue to be 
more for retail investors rather than institutional investors.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, MMFs are playing an increasingly important role for 
many treasurers in Asia Pacific. “One of the key changes in Asia 
Pacific’s short-term investment landscape over recent years has been the
 growing internationalization of the region’s money market fund 
industry,” says J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Shevlin. He notes that 
traditionally, the options treasurers had for investing surplus 
liquidity would have been of a very small number, limited mainly to bank
 deposits. “Global treasurers new to the region typically chose to work 
with the largest banks in each country because the financial systems in 
Asian markets were not very sophisticated,” he adds.</p>
<p>However, Shevlin says that with MMFs boasting increased liquidity and
 size, the short-term investment options available to treasurers have 
increased significantly. “The range of products and instruments 
available has grown and developed, while the level of market flexibility
 has increased; this makes money market funds a very valuable tool for 
corporate investors in the region,” he says. “MNCs have the comfort of a
 product that they are familiar with, while local corporates can move 
more in line with global standards.”</p>
<p>The market for MMFs is experiencing considerable growth in China. In 
December 2014, AUM stood at RMB1.96trn. By November 2017 this had 
reached RMB6.8trn, according to figures published by the Asset 
Management Association of China (AMAC). Shevlin observes that the 
popularity of money market funds in China is “quite unique”: “When 
compared with returns on other investment options such as equities and 
fixed income, which have been quite volatile, money markets have posted 
fairly solid returns in China, with rates averaging between 4% to 7%,” 
he comments.</p>
<h3 id=""updating-the-investment-policy"">Updating the investment policy</h3>
<p>In light of this changing landscape, treasurers may take the 
opportunity to review their short-term investments and consider what 
they are looking to achieve. This may include updating the company’s 
investment policy, which sets out clear investment goals as well as 
stipulating which investment instruments and counterparties are 
approved.</p>
<p>Shevlin points out that many corporates which are fairly new to the 
region follow an investment strategy which is guided by a policy drafted
 at the company’s headquarters in the US or Europe. “Although this 
strategy can work to a certain degree, especially in the region’s more 
developed markets like Singapore and Australia, ultimately it is not 
viable in the long-term and may see the business exposed to unnecessary 
risk, resulting in missed opportunities,” says Shevlin. “A similar issue
 arises around credit ratings. The development nature of the markets in 
Asia means that many countries are not rated this highly – China’s 
rating, for instance, is AA.”</p>
<p>He also notes that companies may expand the range of short-term 
investment vehicles that they use over time, explaining that most 
corporates in Asia tend to start investing cautiously in the region, 
primarily using time deposits with safe banks. “As they become more 
comfortable with the region and its rules and regulations, they 
eventually start branching out and use other instruments,” he says.</p>
<p>A company’s investment policy may not be set in stone – but changing 
that policy is not always straightforward. Indeed, J.P. Morgan’s 2017 
PeerViewSM survey found that changing the investment policy is 
considerably more difficult in Asia Pacific than in the other regions 
surveyed. According to the report, 47% of respondents in Asia Pacific 
reported the level of effort required to change the investment policy as
 ‘significant’, compared to 21% in the Americas and 20% in Europe. 
Nevertheless, it seems that more investors may be considering changing 
their investment policies than in the past. The 2017 survey found that a
 third of respondents in Asia Pacific were considering changes to their 
investment policy, up from 26% in the 2015 survey.</p>
<p>While treasurers do not typically make significant changes to their 
investment policies on a regular basis, it is nevertheless important to 
keep policies up to date with market changes. This might include both 
scheduled reviews and ad-hoc adjustments in light of regulatory changes 
and market changes such as interest rate movements. Likewise, the 
introduction of new products could prompt companies to include these in 
their investment policy – even if they may not use those products until 
further down the line.</p>
<p>In conclusion, as the short-term investment landscape in Asia 
continues to evolve, the challenges and complexities are being 
accompanied by new opportunities. In order to take advantage of these, 
treasurers need to remain up-to-date with developments in the market, 
while making sure that their investment policies continue to reflect 
both their investment goals and the evolving market conditions.</p></div>

<p> </p>
<p>After nearly a decade of discussion and deliberation, the new rules governing European money market funds (MMFs) have come into effect, and managers will have until 21<sup>st</sup> January 2019 to comply. Designed to strengthen and bring more transparency to the money market fund industry, the new rules require asset managers to make changes to the funds they offer and how they operate. Although these changes are not as radical as many first anticipated, they will impact many corporate investors in European MMFs.</p>
<h4 id=""take-your-pick"">Take your pick</h4>
<p>The first task at hand for corporate investors working through the impact of European MMF regulations on their short-term investments is understanding how it will affect the investment products they use. Those corporates invested in prime Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) funds will be most impacted – CNAV funds are permissible in investment policies of 88% of European companies investment, according to the latest J.P. Morgan Asset Management PeerView<sup>SM</sup> survey. This is because, under the new regulations, the traditional CNAV structure will be replaced with new Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) or Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) products.</p>
<p>“Many corporate treasurers currently invested in prime funds will likely find LVNAV funds to be the most natural replacement,” says Mitchener-Nissen. “This is because LVNAV funds will operate in a very similar way to current CNAV funds.”</p>
<p>That being said, the advice for all treasurers is to take the time to review the new range of funds asset managers will offer under the new regulatory regime. “The new regulations make available a variety of different short-term investment products, so treasurers are likely to find a product to suit their company’s requirements,” Mitchener-Nissen says. “To help decide, treasurers should ask themselves what type of exposure the company is comfortable with and whether they should invest in a stable or variable NAV product.”</p>

<h4 id=""ask-the-right-questions"">Ask the right questions</h4>
<p>When evaluating the incoming fund range, Mitchener-Nissen suggests that treasurers engage directly with their asset managers to find out how their preferred funds will be managed under the new regulations. This is especially true for treasurers considering VNAV funds as the new rules are a little less prescriptive, giving more freedom for managers to generate yield in different ways. “Treasurers need to understand how yield is being generated by the fund manager and ensure they are comfortable with the risk exposure,” she says.</p>
<p>Treasurers also need to understand exactly when their existing investments will transition into the new fund range: whilst 21<sup>st</sup> January 2019 is the deadline, some fund managers may choose to transition earlier. J.P. Morgan Asset Management, for example, will transition its funds on 30<sup>th</sup> November 2018, subject to regulatory approval. “We will be writing to our clients after the summer to lay out their options and what steps they need to take,” says Mitchener-Nissen.</p>
<p>As treasurers work through this process with their asset managers, they should also engage tax and accounting advisors. This is because much like the current MMF regulations, the new rules are silent when it comes to cash and cash equivalents treatment. And whilst Mitchener-Nissen expects there to be no change under the new regulations – especially for AAA-rated funds like J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s funds – she advises that treasurers do ask whether this is the case. “All the information about the new fund structures is freely available, so this can be something that treasurers start doing right away,” she says.</p>

<h4 id=""questions-to-consider-when-updating-the-investment-policy"">Questions to consider when updating the investment policy:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are the liquidity features and risk characteristics of the policy’s permissible investments understood by the treasury organisation, investment committee and board of directors?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a security falls out of compliance with the investment policy, what happens? Are there procedures that outline who must be notified? What drives the decision to keep the security or sell it? Who makes the ultimate decision? If the security is kept, how is it tracked and monitored going forward?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the policy allow for fluctuation in principal in its money market investments?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the policy allow for the possibility of liquidity fees and redemption gates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is portfolio duration tracked? (Interest rate duration is a measure of risk that is typically defined as the price sensitivity of the portfolio to a given change in interest rates.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the organisation’s reporting provide the necessary data to update financial reports and senior management on a regular basis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is diversification among different security types addressed within the portfolio?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are pooled investment vehicles, such as money market mutual funds, evaluated?</p>

</div>
<h4 id=""be-flexible"">Be flexible</h4>
<p>Treasurers investing in MMFs under the new regulatory regime may also need to make some changes to the company’s investment policy before the rules come into effect. “These will likely be just tweaks rather than wholesale changes,” says Mitchener-Nissen. “However, treasurers will need to check that their chosen investment structures are permitted under their investment policies and amend if not.”</p>
<p>One area in particular that treasurers may need to pay attention to is whether the policy allows for investments to be made in funds that operate liquidity fees and redemption gates. “This has been an area of concern for a handful of clients,” notes Mitchener-Nissen. “However, these mechanisms are not new: they are a key protection for investors, and funds have always included provisions for fees and gates in their terms and conditions. The new regulations simply enhance these rules and put more structure around their usage.”</p>
<p>Whilst updating the policy should not be a laborious exercise, Mitchener-Nissen advises that corporates should not wait until the last minute, especially if approval from the CFO or board is needed. Treasurers can also reach out to J.P. Morgan Asset Management for assistance with this process. “We have produced a paper to help corporates update their investment policy,” she says. “Some clients have also asked us to review draft policies and we are more than happy to offer advice and guidance.”</p>
<p>Away from the investment policy, treasurers should review the operational procedures surrounding their short-term investment processes. “This could range from how their treasury workstation deals in and out of funds to their authorised signatory list,” says Mitchener-Nissen. “A shift in regulation provides a good opportunity to refresh processes and ensure everything is aligned with best practice.”</p>
<h4 id=""countdown-to-transition"">Countdown to transition</h4>
<p>With this preparation complete, treasuries should be well positioned to transition seamlessly into their selected funds. However, Mitchener-Nissen recommends that treasurers remain engaged in the process as the transition deadline approaches. “We suggest that treasurers stay in close contact with their fund managers to ensure they are fully aware of when their investments will transition,” she says. “Treasurers should also ensure that there is no additional paperwork that needs to be signed to ensure a smooth transition.”</p>
<h4 id=""ahead-of-the-game"">Ahead of the game</h4>
<p>European money reform is coming – and it is clearly time for treasurers to think, plan, and act so that they can get ahead of the game and be ready to invest under the new regulatory paradigm. And whilst the next few months will require some extra work to be done by asset managers and treasurers alike, Mitchener-Nissen expects it to be a smooth process overall. “Yes, there are changes that are coming, but these are not radical,” she concludes. “It is our main aim to make this whole process as simple and seamless as possible for our clients and ensure that they meet their investment objectives for the years to come.”</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>With Europe’s money market fund reform now under way, fund managers have plenty to do this year as they adjust their offerings in line with the new rules. Meanwhile, treasurers should take the opportunity to review the new fund structures, update their investment policies and check that their cash and treasury management systems are able to cater for the changes.</em></p>
<p> Europe’s money market fund reform has been in the pipeline for so many years that few are likely to be taken by surprise by the upcoming changes. With existing MMFs required to comply by 21<sup>st</sup> January 2019 – and new funds launched after 21<sup>st</sup> July 2017 already subject to the new rules – the time to act is now.</p>
<p>For fund managers, the new rules should not present undue challenges. “As MMF regulation has been a topic discussed within our industry for nearly a decade, I think there has been ample time to align the required resources and prepare for the forthcoming year,” comments James Finch, Head of Liquidity Management, EMEA at UBS.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty of work for both fund managers and treasurers to do over the course of 2018. “We are getting ready operationally,” says Kerrie Mitchener-Nissen, Head of Product Development, International for Global Liquidity, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “We’re also staying closely connected with our clients, ensuring they are aware of the options open to them and have updated their investment policies, looked at any changes required to their treasury workstations and trading portals, reviewed their reporting capabilities, and consulted with their tax and accounting advisers. Corporate treasurers have just under a year to get ready, but that time will pass quickly.”</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""the-new-rules"">The new rules</h3>
<p>European money market fund reform was first proposed by the European Commission in September 2013, with the final rules agreed by the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council on 14<sup>th</sup> November 2016.</p>
<p>Three types of short-term money market fund will be available under the new rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VNAV MMFs calculate NAV using mark-to-market or mark-to-model prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public debt CNAV MMFs will be required to invest at least 99.5% of their assets in public debt, while maintaining a constant NAV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LVNAV funds, seen as the successor to existing CNAV funds, will use amortised cost accounting for assets with a residual maturity of up to 75 days. They will be required to maintain minimum weekly liquidity of 30%, with liquidity fees and redemption gates applicable if liquidity drops below 30% and daily net redemptions rise above 10% of the fund’s total assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The new rules also include one category for standard MMFs, the Standard VNAV MMF.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""what-fund-managers-are-doing"">What fund managers are doing</h3>
<p>For fund managers, this year will see considerable activity as providers work to convert existing CNAV funds to the LVNAV model. Hugo Parry-Wingfield, EMEA Head of Liquidity Product, HSBC Global Asset Management, outlines three key areas of change that fund managers should be focusing on: structuring the project, developing the new fund range and communicating with clients.</p>
<h4 id=""structuring-the-project"">Structuring the project</h4>
<p>Where the project structure is concerned, Parry-Wingfield points out that fund managers are accustomed to carrying out major formal regulatory change projects and as such are likely to have the right resources already in place.</p>
<p>“We launched a formal project last year specifically for this regulatory change,” he explains. “We have a dedicated project manager and team around them, and accountable executives across the different functions of the business that are responsible for the various elements within that project plan.”</p>
<p>Finch, meanwhile, explains that UBS has a dedicated regulatory team which “has been working closely with our Global Liquidity Management business to prepare for this year and ensure the project is scoped and resourced correctly”. He adds, “Work streams on the various reform components are already in progress and we are working towards making all our existing MMFs fully compliant with the new rules.”</p>
<h4 id=""developing-the-fund-range"">Developing the fund range</h4>
<p>For HSBC Global Asset Management, Parry-Wingfield says the key focus on the product side is the conversion of the bank’s current CNAV money market fund to the new LVNAV product. “Consistent with most providers, we believe that the LVNAV product is the most credible alternative to what investors use today,” he comments. “We also believe that is where most clients will have their preference after the rules come into place.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Parry-Wingfield says that HSBC Global Asset Management will be prepared for having other options available – such as CNAV government-only funds and VNAV funds. “Whilst not our base case, we would respond if there was increased demand for some of those alternatives which may be shelf-registered in the meantime,” he notes.</p>
<h4 id=""communicating-with-clients"">Communicating with clients</h4>
<p>Also crucial for fund managers is the need to communicate the implications of the changes to investors. “I think corporate treasurers are probably as informed about the new MMF rules as the asset managers!” says Finch. “Given treasurers have always been significant users of MMFs, often using a number of providers, they have no doubt received multiple updates from each provider along the way. In addition, the rating agencies, Institutional Money Market Funds Association (IMMFA) and the press have all played their part in helping ensure that MMF reform is in focus.”</p>
<h3 id=""what-treasurers-should-be-doing"">What treasurers should be doing</h3>
<p>For corporate treasurers, likewise, there is plenty to do to prepare for the changes, from understanding the changes to reviewing investment policies and systems.</p>
<h4 id=""engage-with-providers"">Engage with providers</h4>
<p>Firstly, treasurers should engage with fund managers in order to gauge how prepared their fund providers are for the changes and what approach they are planning to take. “We are speaking to our funds and understanding what changes they will make and how this will affect our return,” says Auna Dunlevy, Head of Liquidity and Investments at Royal Mail. “It seems like most of the funds we deal with as CNAV will become LVNAV, although we haven’t got ‘official’ confirmation yet. It also seems that as the funds we deal with are at the high end of the quality scale, the impact should not be significant.”</p>
<h4 id=""review-available-fund-structures"">Review available fund structures</h4>
<p>Likewise, treasurers should take the time to understand the types of structure available under the new rules. “The new regulation offers great optionality for cash investors,” says Jim Fuell, Head of Global Liquidity Sales, International, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “But to minimise any disruption, corporate treasurers will need to look closely at the fund structures available to them, and carefully consider the implications of each option.” Fuell notes that certain fund structures have the ability to offer a more attractive return – “but what level of risk are those managers taking in order to deliver additional yield?”</p>
<h4 id=""review-investment-policies"">Review investment policies</h4>
<p>Treasurers will also need to review and update their investment policies and risk policies. “Obviously a lot of these policies get approved by boards and have to fit into the relevant approval cycles, so this should not be left to the last minute,” says Parry-Wingfield. “Corporates should be thinking about timings and working backwards from when they need to submit papers or make decisions.”</p>
<p>François Masquelier, Vice Chairman of EACT agrees that it may be useful for treasurers to revisit their asset management policies to make sure they are compliant with the reform. “Furthermore, it is important to get validated by treasury committees the types of products we will be authorised to invest in,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""update-systems"">Update systems</h4>
<p>Technology is another consideration. Parry-Wingfield points out that treasurers may need to update their cash and treasury management systems and processes. “Treasurers need to ensure that whatever systems they are using, including investment platforms and portals, cater for any new features in the products and any changes that will take place,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""engage-with-auditors"">Engage with auditors</h4>
<p>Treasurers will also need to engage with their auditors about the treatment of LVNAV funds from a cash equivalent point of view. “We expect the new LVNAV product to continue to be cash and cash equivalent from an auditor’s point of view in most cases – however, it’s for individual auditors to evaluate that and give the relevant advice,” says Parry-Wingfield. “And like everything else, the sooner the better.”</p>
<h3 id=""bigger-picture"">Bigger picture</h3>
<p>Aside from these practical considerations, treasurers may be asking whether they should take the opportunity to consider other investment options. “I feel this is a good opportunity to look again at the wider range of MMF solutions available, understanding if in addition to LVNAV MMFs, Variable NAV MMFs could also be used as part of a tiered liquidity management strategy,” says Finch.</p>
<p>However, Finch adds that he doesn’t really see the new rules fundamentally changing the way that corporate treasurers use MMFs. “Over the years, treasurers have become very familiar with the use of MMFs, valuing their liquidity, security, yield and operational simplicity and I don’t believe the new rules fundamentally alter any of these benefits,” he explains. “In addition, with banks continually looking to reduce the amount of short term deposits they take onto the balance sheet, traditional alternatives are become more limited.”</p>
<p>Parry-Wingfield says that the new rules are designed to improve the security and consistency of the products concerned. “We believe that the fundamental reasons why corporates have used money funds as a short-term cash product in the past will not change specifically because of these new regulations,” he says. “Coupled with our confidence that LVNAV is a very credible alternative to the existing CNAV product, it’s reasonable to think investors will continue to value these kinds of products. Investors may separately evaluate alternatives – but should not lose focus on the fundamental benefits money market funds can provide for the element of the cash that is short-term in nature.”</p>
<h4 id=""interest-rates"">Interest rates</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that the regulatory reform is not the only issue affecting money market funds in Europe. Masquelier comments, “I am more worried about the potential longer-term period of negative EURIBOR rates than the reform itself.” He adds that treasurers may be tempted to propose other longer duration products to their CFOs in order to avoid booking losses with negative returns, or to mitigate negative impacts on the P&amp;L: “It is a perfect opportunity to at least try to suggest to management to open doors to alternative products with higher volatility, longer time horizon but potentially better return,” he says.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, Masquelier says that the current situation could push MMF providers towards another stage of consolidation in the industry. “I would not be surprised to see fewer players but at a larger scale,” he says. “We could end up with few very large players, and small specific boutiques, like the French funds.”</p>
<p>In light of these changes, Masquelier predicts that corporates will “adapt their strategies, slice their excess cash into layers with different time horizons in order to adjust product to each bucket and all-in try to limit as far as possible negative impacts/results”.</p>
<h4 id=""mmfs-in-switzerland"">MMFs in Switzerland</h4>
<p>Finch argues that the domestic Swiss cash market will be interesting for MMFs going forward. “Historically, there has been a preference for Swiss treasurers to use bank deposits for cash management, with MMFs not gaining significant market share,” he says. “However, given low and negative interest rates, combined with the pressure on banks to reduce their short-term deposit books, off-balance sheet alternatives such as MMF are starting to gain traction with corporate treasurers.”</p>
<p>Finch says there are currently a limited number of Swiss domiciled MMFs focused on institutional investors (he notes that investing in a Lux or Irish domiciled MMFs can attract a stamp tax for Swiss investors). However, he adds, “we expect this to change and are actively working on developing and expanding our existing range of Swiss domestic MMFs to cater for an institutional client base.”</p>
<p>He notes that from a regulatory perspective, Swiss domiciled MMFs are not directly impacted by the new EU rules. “But we could see the Swiss regulator look to adopt certain, if not all of the new EU MMF rules.”</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With the new rules already coming into effect, treasurers should expect to see plenty of communications from their fund providers over the course of this year. However, it’s important to note that fund providers aren’t the only ones who will need to make changes. From updating investment policies to engaging with auditors, treasurers will also need to make sure they are ready for the new funds – while keeping an eye on the impact of wider market conditions on this type of investment.</p>

<h5> </h5>
<h5>What steps will you be taking this year to prepare for the new MMF regulations?</h5>
<p>The protracted discussions on European MMF Reform and the associated uncertainty led us to make a number of changes to our investment policy ahead of the Final Regulation being published. We challenged ourselves to segment our cash more, and diversify our cash investments to include other investments, such as tri-party repos. It is our continued intention to use MMFs for our core liquidity needs. In order to prepare specifically for the new MMF regulations, we will seek approval from the Risk Committee to invest in the LVNAV.</p>
<h5>Are there any particular challenges that you will need to overcome?</h5>
<p>We will write a detailed paper outlining the key changes, including the need for the NAV to be within 20 basis points, and the potential for fee and redemption gates. We expect to be challenged on how such funds would behave under times of market stress, and therefore will need to present back testing on how a CNAV and their shadow funds would have performed during the 2008/09 financial crisis. It will be important to highlight the subtle differences between a CNAV and LVNAV that should reduce the LVNAV’s volatility.</p>
<p>We are also aware that a LVNAV may not be viable in a negative yield environment, but fortunately we currently only invest in USD funds. Determining whether a LVNAV will be classified as cash and cash equivalents will be an important consideration, particularly as we are looking to use LVNAVs for our core liquidity. As we currently hold investment grade securities directly, our investment policy already allows us to invest in securities that need to be marked-to-market.</p>
<h5>Do you expect to replace CNAV funds with LVNAV funds, or will you be considering other options?</h5>
<p>We expect to be investing into LVNAV funds so long as the back testing analysis and investment profile seems in line with expectations. As mentioned above, our investment policy and current infrastructure has enabled us to switch into alternatives if required. We have in the past used government-only MMFs, and will continue to have this as our risk-averse option. We acknowledge that the regulations surrounding the percentage of overnight and one-week paper on LVNAVs may lower the yield compared to previously, but these still earn in excess of the CNAV government funds.</p>
<h5>How effectively are fund managers communicating with you about the new rules?</h5>
<p>All our managers maintain a good line of communication with us, particularly when there are any developments surrounding the reforms. We have started to see some back-testing analysis now, with accompanying seminars and workshops on the issues.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The pace of change in the cash markets is not set to slow down in 2018. This is partially due to the introduction of new US tax rules, which became effective as of 1<sup>st</sup> January this year. These rules are expected to generate wholesale changes in how multinational corporations use US dollar denominated cash management products.</p>
<p>Designed to make the United States more competitive with other countries, support economic growth and reduce complexity, the tax bill brings in several key changes. Most notably it has slashed the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It has also mandated a one-time deemed repatriation rate on tax-deferred foreign earnings held offshore, set at 15.5% for liquid or cash assets and 8% for illiquid assets. This will impact as much as US$3trn of assets held overseas by US corporations.</p>
<p>“It is important to note that this contrasts with the voluntary repatriation tax holiday of 2004,” says Tom Kolimago, Cash Management, Head of Credit and Investment Research at BlackRock. “The tax is mandatory and all companies will be taxed on their overseas earnings; they don’t have to bring them back to the US if they don’t want to.”</p>
<p>That being the case, will there be a mass exodus of cash to the US from Asia Pacific? Crystina Hickey, Institutional Cash Sales Asia at BlackRock, does not think so. But there is some activity expected. “We are still in the early days and the signs are that corporates are not planning to send significant amounts of cash back to the US,” she says. “But some clients have already begun to make changes to their portfolios. These include the shortening of positions to allow cash to be moved back to the US if required.”</p>
<p>The main reason that corporates are looking to move cash back to the US is to pay down debt, explains Hickey. “However, some are looking to pursue various M&amp;A opportunities within the US,” she adds.</p>
<p>If, and then how quickly, corporations send cash back to the US, will have a big role in dictating the impact US tax reform has on the short-term funding markets. But the effect cannot be analysed in a vacuum, warns Kolimago. He cites the normalisation of interest rates by the Fed, with three hikes expected in 2018, as one key macro event that corporate investors need to watch out for.</p>
<p>This creates some interesting opportunities for cash investors in Asia Pacific. “The rate hikes that we have seen throughout 2016 and 2017 have definitely made for some more attractive investment opportunities for corporates in the region using the US dollar,” says Hickey. “As a result, we have started to see many treasury teams expand the types of investments that they are using to manage their cash.”</p>
<p>Hickey notes that prudent cash segmentation is required for corporates looking to optimise their overall cash investment portfolio. “It ensures that they have the flexibility within their guidelines not only to seize on investment opportunities but to do so without taking on undue risk,” she explains. This is especially true for emerging Asian companies that may not have well-detailed treasury policies in place. “In these instances, we advise that they work in partnership with a trusted asset manager to understand best practice and put in place an investment strategy that caters for their needs.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>China’s money market fund industry has grown exponentially in a relatively short space of time. Today, total assets under management (AUM) stand at around RMB6.5trn<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. Because of this, the Chinese government has marked it as ‘systemically important’ to the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>As a result of its status, the regulators have begun to pay more attention to money market funds. Recently, the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) brought in a host of new measures. These have been designed to strengthen the money fund industry by more closely aligning the rules that govern it with international standards, forcing some funds to de-risk. It is a move that Shevlin calls “a hugely positive step for the money fund industry in China”.</p>
<h4 id=""a-unique-ecosystem"">A unique ecosystem</h4>
<p>A large part of the growth in China’s money fund industry has come from retail investors. After years of being limited to investing in unattractive Central Bank controlled time deposits, many were buoyed by the chance to invest in different and higher returning products. Money market funds (MMFs) have proven to be especially attractive. Today, they account for roughly 60%<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> of all assets invested in mutual funds in China. MMFs are also continuing to grow at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 70%<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> over the past five years.</p>
<p>“The popularity of MMFs in China is quite unique,” says Shevlin. “There are various reasons that the market has developed in this way. When compared with returns on other investment options such as equities and fixed income, which have been quite volatile, money markets have posted fairly solid returns in China, with rates averaging between 4% to 7%.” The influence of Alibaba’s innovative Yu’E Bao fund<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup>, the world’s largest with RMB1.4trn AUM, also cannot be overlooked, he adds.</p>
<p>Institutional investors have also taken advantage of the new range of investment opportunities. “There is a lot of corporate cash in China that needs a home,” notes Shevlin. “With corporates wanting to make sure it is invested in diversified and safe products, MMFs, especially AAA-rated funds, have become increasingly attractive investment vehicles.”</p>
<h4 id=""emerging-risks"">Emerging risks</h4>
<p>Robust growth of MMFs in China has created plenty of competition. There are now over 400 funds<sup id=""fnref:5""><a href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">5</a></sup>, mainly retail focussed, competing for investors cash. This level of competition has brought with it a less than welcomed phenomenon. “In China, local investors primarily focus on yield over security and liquidity,” explains Shevlin. “As a result, fund managers in China have increasingly sought to offer investors higher returns to differentiate themselves.” This is driving some fund managers to adopt very aggressive investment strategies. Many funds have high duration profiles and have also increasingly been buying less liquid bonds, which can be difficult to sell at times of stress.</p>
<p>Moreover, some funds have been looking lower down the credit quality spectrum in their hunt for yield. This is a risky strategy, given the cash flow problems of weaker issuers and the increasing number of corporate defaults in China.</p>
<p>Finally, some fund managers have also been using leverage via repurchase agreements (repos) – where securities are lent out and the cash received from this reinvested – to boost overall returns on the fund. In a stable interest rate environment, managing a fund in this way can significantly boost its overall returns. Issues arise if there is unexpected volatility, especially at the short end of the curve, which can reduce returns, pushing yields lower, triggering outflows and creating significant issues for the fund.</p>
<p>“The authorities are very aware of these risks. They realise that if a fund was to ‘break the buck’, it could create a contagion effect, potentially impacting confidence in the entire financial system and broader Chinese economy,” says Shevlin. “Because of the importance of money market funds and potential systemic risk, the regulators have realised that they need to install safeguards and curb the instincts of retail fund managers to boost yields without considering the risks involved.”</p>
<h4 id=""tighter-oversight"">Tighter oversight</h4>
<p>The key objectives of the latest tranche of rules brought in by the CSRC in September last year are to create a stronger link between risk and return. They impose tighter limits to reduce concentration risk, strengthen rules that limit a fund’s exposures to any single borrower, and reduce investments in assets with lower credit ratings.</p>
<p>Under the new regime, funds cannot hold assets (such as cash deposits or bonds) from a single bank if that holding represents more than 10% of that bank’s net assets. Also, rules further state that funds may hold a maximum of 2% of its assets from a single institution with credit ratings below AAA and cumulatively a maximum of 10% in such lower rated issuers.</p>
<p>In addition, the CSRC has clamped down on money funds’ use of illiquid assets. It has clearly defined what it considers illiquid and liquid assets, and states that funds must hold at least 10% of its assets in liquid instruments and a maximum of 10% in illiquid assets.</p>
<p>Finally, the CSRC is attempting to limit investor concentration. Shevlin explains that in China, funds with only one or two dominant investors create substantial liquidity risks: “If these investors were to redeem their investments, for any reason, it would have a significantly detrimental impact on the integrity of that fund that may send shockwaves through the rest of the market.” As a result, he says the CSRC is forcing funds with high investor concentration to shift, to hold even higher levels of liquidity and substantially lower durations. Meanwhile, new money market funds with high investor concentration cannot use amortised cost accounting.</p>
<h4 id=""investor-impact"">Investor impact</h4>
<p>The bad news for retail investors is that because of the new CSRC’s rules, the days of very high returns on their investments are over, says Shevlin. “The rules have brought down the average range of yields within retail funds, creating a lot less variability and a lot less opportunity for fund managers to manipulate the yield to look attractive.” This he believes “makes the industry as a whole more stable”.</p>
<p>On the institutional side, there is less impact. Corporates in China largely invest in AAA-rated funds which already abide by tighter rules than those outlined by the CSRC. “That being said, corporates are largely positive about the broader impact these changes will have on the money fund industry,” says Shevlin. “They are also encouraged that it is being more closely aligned with how the industry works in other developed markets. This gives them the comfort to increase their usage of these products and diversify their investment portfolio in China.”</p>
<p>In addition to the CSRC’s rules, Shevlin also comments on the Chinese central bank’s rules issued in November which prohibit asset managers from promising investors a guaranteed rate of return. “This is more good news for the financial development in China,” he says. “It dispels a myth that all financial investments are guaranteed by the government; they are not. Investors, particularly domestic corporates who are growing in sophistication and aiming to operate in similar ways to their Western peers, will need to do more research into their investment options. This too is pushing the market in the right direction, aligning it more with international standards.”</p>
<h4 id=""broader-context"">Broader context</h4>
<p>Overall, Shevlin sees the new rules as a positive step for the industry, enabling the money fund industry in China to expand in a controlled and secure manner. “The industry is still growing and there is lots of potential for fund managers like ourselves, so you don’t want an event occurring that will disrupt this growth or destroy the industry,” he says. “More broadly, these new rules closely align with China’s economic ambitions over the coming five years. These focus on quality and controlled growth as the country continues to pivot away from a low cost manufacturing hub towards a hi-tech service-based economy with a strong and vibrant middle class.”</p>

<br/>
<p style=""clear:both;"">In Europe and the US, the investment environment is changing. A combination of rising interest rates and regulatory reform are creating a new investment paradigm that is offering both new opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p>In the US, regulatory reform has seen huge outflows from prime funds into constant net asset value (CNAV) ‘govie’ funds. Whilst the expectation is that this shift won’t happen to such an extent in Europe, corporate investors need to be aware of how the regulatory changes here will impact their investment activities.</p>
<p>For clients of BNY Mellon, the way its funds are managed means impending regulatory changes will create little in the way of impact. However, for most investors, there is a pressing need to be able to make informed decisions on what funds they want to invest in going forward: CNAV funds with government collateral, variable net asset value (VNAV) funds or the new low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) funds?</p>
<p>For the rare beast that is the cautious yield-hunter, with the gradual rising interest-rate environment creating opportunities for corporates to obtain some incremental yield pick-up, BNY Mellon is guiding investors’ gaze towards a more global outlook. Here, it says opportunities exist in the Dollar Bloc markets, such as New Zealand or Canada, where higher returns than would be available in Europe are possible without taking on extra risk.</p>
<p>But have treasurers generally got too used to a yield-free environment and become too risk-averse? A straw-poll of the audience revealed that, for the most part, corporates are still focused on security and liquidity above yield when it comes to their investment decisioning, with only 30% citing yield as the most important factor.</p>
<p>The likelihood of such an investment philosophy changing in the short-term is doubtful. A second poll of the audience – asking how they feel about their current investment policies – found that 50% were indeed either ‘cautious’ or ‘risk-averse’. A similar percentage remain concerned about negative interest rates or worried about counterparty risk exposures. Not one person said they felt optimistic.</p>
<h3 id=""danger-signs"">Danger signs</h3>
<p>The lack of audience optimism is indicative of a market-aware (and perhaps wary) audience. But BNY Mellon sees a wider band of market participants behaving almost bullishly. It cited as evidence the muted response to geopolitical issues, and the euro’s continuing appreciation in the face of negative media reporting. This, the panel felt, is an indication that some investors are so focused on achieving yield that they are prepared to shrug off the kind of issues that in the past would have triggered an immediate flight to safety.</p>
<figure class=""center"">

<p>This lack of judiciousness should be a concern for all stakeholders. The panel referred to recent comments about the reappearance of excessive risk-taking and the potential for bubbles to form in the markets. This suggests that whilst central banks are currently trying to instil calm in the markets, there is potential for significant volatility to return, especially if a policy mistake is made. Investors chasing yield should pay heed and start exercising caution.</p>
<h3 id=""takeaway"">Takeaway</h3>
<p>Change is coming, albeit slowly. The wise investor should take time to reassess their risk appetite, recognise what their funds are doing and understand the processes that drive those funds. The opportunities are out there, but so are the risks.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><h4>For professional clients and qualified/institutional investors only</h4>
<p>For treasurers, it is time to prepare for European Money Market Fund (MMF) reform. The European Commission’s proposals now have an implementation date for new funds of mid-2018, with existing funds on a 19<sup>th</sup> January 2019 deadline. However, the new rules may have an earlier impact on the existing major European sectors of variable and constant net asset value MMFs (VNAVs and CNAVs).</p>
<p>Whilst most corporate investors can expect minimal short-term impact from the changes, industry consensus says the wise investor will begin working with their asset managers now on forming a clear response. “With the two dates in mind, we are using this period to educate all of our clients,” confirms Beccy Milchem, Head of Corporate Sales, BlackRock. “We are cautioning that although we have a 2019 final implementation date, we think a lot of funds will migrate before then. It is worth being prepared ahead of that.”</p>
<h3 id=""start-now"">Start now</h3>
<p>BlackRock believes it is prudent to plan a transition to the new rules during Q4 2018. It is being mindful that not only is the final date right at the start of 2019, but also that this date is sufficiently close to year-end as to apply an unnecessary challenge to managing liquidity.</p>
<p>The aim of this preparatory period for corporates should be to confirm full awareness of LVNAV’s features, and to ensure investment policies and all stakeholders are ready for the changes when they come into effect, says Milchem. This means kicking-off internal conversations with investment committees and Boards, around updating investment policies.</p>
<p>Mindful of the fact that these often only get looked at once a year, they should certainly be tabled for the next available review. But Milchem adds that investors should also start dialogue with external auditors and other stakeholders who might have input on the choice of response, both to the possible changing shape of their funds, and to any operational impact this might have. “Have these conversations sooner rather than later so that if you do unearth any questions, you have time to address them.”</p>
<h3 id=""market-impasse-the-same-but-different"">Market impasse – the same but different</h3>
<p>The US$2.7trn US domiciled MMF market faced up to its ‘2a-7 reforms’ back in October 2016. This saw a shift away from a prime fund’s ability to maintain its investment value at US$1 a share, towards a price that moves with the market. Government funds in the US have been allowed to maintain their constant net asset value pricing.</p>
<p>US and EU reforms bear some similarities but European reform for MMFs domiciled predominantly in Ireland and Luxembourg will see the introduction of Low Volatility NAV (LVNAV) funds. These, Milchem explains, are a “hybrid” composition that nestle between CNAV Government funds, priced to two decimal places, and the VNAV funds that deploy mark-to-market or mark-to-model pricing to four decimal places. The aim of LVNAV funds is to provide many of the attributes that make CNAV attractive to corporate investors, in particular the utility of a constant net asset value as long as certain tolerances are met, but with the added safety net sought by the EU lawmakers. Hiatt believes that the addition of the LVNAV category will see a more uniform migration rather than the shift in investor preferences we witnessed during the US reforms.</p>
<p>“We think LVNAV are a good compromise strategy,” Milchem comments. “In the US, there were two ends of the spectrum, which is why we saw that huge shift; in Europe, we will have more structural uniformity in terms of where the asset flow goes because LVNAV is similar to what investors have been used to.”</p>
<p>The rate environment in Europe may also help frame investor decisions, says Eric Hiatt, Director, Portfolio Manager at BlackRock. It is unclear to what extent this may take place but, in the US, there is an ongoing conversation around what spread differential is required for a Government fund investor to consider a move back to prime. The difference in USD is currently around 35bps and BlackRock has seen some assets return to Prime as a result, however with short-term EUR Government rates deeply negative and GBP Government funds currently close to zero, investors in these currencies are likely to be more mindful of the gap. The proposition around reform is different in the EU but Hiatt says fund managers will be paying particularly close attention to client considerations in their discussions around the ‘fund structure versus income’ debate.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the birth of LVNAV was in part informed by the close involvement of the corporate community, says Milchem. Being consulted around regulatory reform, and offering feedback on what was highly prized in today’s products, has paid dividends. But the regulators were also, to a degree, conscious of the impact of ongoing Basel III changes on banks and their attitude to the short-term investment space.</p>
<p>In pushing corporates off the bank balance-sheet, it created an environment where there was almost nowhere for corporates to place their day-to-day cash. “Regulators wanted to create something that still had the usability factor that was present in the CNAV world, along with much more transparency around the risk, so that end-users can really understand what they are getting into,” says Milchem.</p>
<h3 id=""us-better-than-eu"">US better than EU?</h3>
<p>Is one set of reforms better than the other? It is not easy to make a relative comparison, says Hiatt. “That’s why we are focused on providing attractive solutions, no matter the operating environment. The European landscape certainly offers more choice and we plan to have a full spectrum of products available so that clients can choose the best money market fund for their needs.”</p>
<p>Away from fund reform, US policy-makers have moved target rates up from zero in the past two years. This has been helpful to USD cash investors. At the same time, there has been a steady demand for USD funding by international banks, helping to augment dollar-issuance and thus also helping USD investors, irrespective of US 2a-7 or EU structural change.</p>
<p>However, there are “cross-currents” that should be highlighted, notes Hiatt. Chief amongst these are the liquidity and capital standards for banks that arise from the aforementioned Basel III. “This has fundamentally altered the supply environment for short credit, with banks rationalising exposure to short-term wholesale funding,” he notes, reiterating Milchem’s earlier observation that corporate non-operating deposits are being bounced off bank balance-sheets.</p>
<p>As such, Milchem believes that MMFs of any form – whether the predominant Government funds in the US or Europe’s new LVNAV – will continue to provide “an attractive solution for short-term investing for corporates”, representing an “easy tool for quick diversification of credit and day-to-day liquidity with reasonable yield”.</p>

<h3 id=""two-approaches-one-platform"">Two approaches, one platform</h3>
<p>The US market, having already reformed, has seen US asset managers with platforms on both sides of the Atlantic leveraging the experience. The operational architecture that sits behind the new 2a-7 reforms can be used in Europe for LVNAV and the short-term VNAV product and BlackRock is currently in close dialogue with the Irish regulator around the appropriate ways to handle multiple NAV strikes, which were developed for the US Prime funds, for the new fund structure in Europe.</p>
<p>Indeed, BlackRock’s single, global ‘Aladdin’ platform is an operating system for investment managers that supports the entire process, including trading, portfolio management, risk analytics and compliance. Hiatt explains that whilst there are nuances unique to EU reform, BlackRock has spent time planning for and implementing the changes around 2a-7 reform that “lend themselves very well to reform in Europe”.</p>
<p>Within Aladdin, portfolio managers are able to analyse liquidity metrics in real-time. This can run scenario analyses based on shareholder subscriptions and redemptions. The platform also offers enhanced analytic capability, extending to NAV per-share impacts and asset value per-share impacts on portfolio transactions, shareholder activity and security price movements.</p>
<p>Despite BlackRock’s US 2a-7 experience, and the system’s easy translation to European reform, Milchem does not see the sets of portfolios fundamentally being run differently. “This is very much us continuing with the risk management and credit management approach that we have always worked to, but adhering to extra rules and procedures which we have now embedded in our systems.”</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-preparations"">Corporate preparations</h3>
<p>The changes likely to be seen are therefore not far-removed from what treasurers might experience today, it is simply a new concept that all must now get used to. First and foremost, as mentioned, this requires taking action now, at least discussing ‘new world’ plans, appetite and policy approach.</p>
<p>As part of this programme, securing data from funds could prove essential in making the right decision. Treasurers looking at an LVNAV strategy, for example, should seek data on the liquidity level and the shadow net asset value of the fund. These are the critical data points that allow LVNAV funds to price to ‘one’, explains Milchem. It is also the kind of information that should now start to become available through the MMF portals – it is certainly information that BlackRock is already publishing live to its website in a bid to make sure its clients become familiarised with it in good time.</p>
<p>Investors that are comfortable with the composition of risks in today’s prime funds will find familiarity with the LVNAV structure, notes Hiatt. “It’s also important to recognise that a lot of the conditions that regulators are placing around the new fund structures will see enhanced transparency, which will benefit shareholders, and if a fund chooses to add a rating, investors will also still be able to rely on the independent scrutiny of the rating agencies.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-useful-way-to-think-about-regulation"">A useful way to think about regulation</h3>
<p>Ultimately, says Hiatt, think of LVNAV as “retaining the investor utility of CNAV but with the capability to round the NAV to ‘one’”. Where in the old CNAV environment, the ‘breaking the buck’ point was 99.50, LVNAV takes that concept and tightens that broad collar to 20bps. As long as a fund stays within a 20bps margin of a stable NAV pricing, rounding it to ‘one’ is fine and a 20bps threshold is tolerable from a portfolio management perspective</p>
<p>And on the matter of fending off runs on a fund – rare though they are – the new formalised rules around gates and fees (they are already in place in European UCITS funds) should be seen as measures designed to protect investors in a stressed environment.</p>
<p>The key differences in new fund guidelines are thus really around the increase in the requisite levels of liquidity, and the revision of diversification and concentration limits that will apply at either the product or institutional level. If there is any yield differential with LVNAV from CNAV Prime funds today, it will be a function of those liquidity standards, and even then, in most circumstances, “not be very meaningful”, notes Hiatt.</p>
<p>Indeed, on a day-to-day basis, the reasons for a corporate using a money market fund will not be subject to drastic change, adds Milchem. However, she continues, one outcome we may see as a result of far wider-ranging market reforms in financial services, is the client becoming more adept at segmenting their cash for different use cases.</p>
<p>If MMF reform does indeed encourage treasurers to look at their investment policies and have a more open view on it, this is an opportunity for them to investigate some of the other solutions available, maybe taking on Standard MMFs with more duration. Having better oversight of cash flow forecasting and being able to segment more effectively has seen BlackRock engage in many more conversations with clients in the US about bespoke investments, she notes.</p>
<p>The wider regulatory environment is making investors become more aware of their needs and the challenges they now face for investing day-to-day cash. As they draw the veil from many more investment solutions, where they previously may have relied heavily upon their banking relationships, they may now see fit to explore a far wider portfolio of possibilities. Some may even outsource credit expertise to an asset manager with substantial resources, leaving treasurers to get on with being treasurers.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Offering security, liquidity and yield, money market funds (MMFs) have much to recommend them – and as such they are widely used by corporate treasurers around the world.</p>
<p>“Treasurers are focused on capital preservation, liquidity and yield,” explains Simon Bourke, Director of Institutional Business for Liquidity at HSBC Global Asset Management. “A money market fund is a product that allows a treasurer to outsource cash management to a professional asset manager who focuses on optimising these factors.”</p>
<p>As Bourke points out, MMFs are run by asset managers with specific core competencies in managing credit, liquidity and interest rate risk for a lower cost than a treasurer replicating the same portfolio themselves while providing money market yields. “This allows the treasurer to run a leaner team and focus on other value-added activities,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""driving-growth"">Driving growth</h3>
<p>While MMFs are well established in markets like the US and Europe, they are a more recent arrival in Asia Pacific. Nevertheless, the market for MMFs is growing rapidly in the region – particularly in China, where AUM for MMFs increased from RMB 1.96trn in December 2014 to RMB 5.86trn in July 2017, according to figures published by the Asset Management Association of China.</p>
<p>“While it is regularly said that the MMF industry in Asia is still in its infancy, or perhaps now early teens, it has already grown significantly in a relatively short space of time,” observes Bourke. He explains that most treasurers of sophisticated institutional businesses and multinational corporations are to some extent engaged with money market funds – “if they are not already investing directly, they are certainly contemplating the approach”. Large corporates are a little further behind in terms of adoption, but he notes that there is a growing appetite for alternatives to standard current accounts and time deposits.</p>
<p>Much of this can be attributed to the rising USD interest environment which, as Bourke says, is “driving up the opportunity costs of earning zero on cash”. Other drivers of growth include increased familiarity with MMFs, as well as overall growth in Asian businesses generating more free cash flow that needs to be managed.</p>
<p>The impact of Basel III on the cost of bank deposits is also a consideration, although this trend may be less of a factor in Asia than in other regions. J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s 2017 PeerView<sup>SM</sup> Survey found that while 55% of respondents in Europe said their banks had encouraged them to move their cash deposits off balance sheet as a result of Basel III or other factors, only 17% of those in Asia Pacific reported the same.</p>
<p>Furthermore, treasurers may use MMFs in order to meet other specific needs. “PMC does not advise on investments, but we have seen increased use of such funds from large corporates holding excess liquidity who are looking at potential acquisitions or have other potential short-term needs,” comments Gavin Da Cunha, PMC Treasury’s Managing Director in Asia.</p>
<h3 id=""the-money-market-fund-landscape-in-asia"">The money market fund landscape in Asia</h3>
<p>Bourke notes that Singapore and, to a lesser extent, Hong Kong have emerged as regional and international treasury centres for US and EMEA MNCs, as well as becoming large financial centres in their own right. “This has led to significant demand for money market instruments as decision makers are increasingly present in Asia,” he says. “While the strongest demand has been in USD, the larger developed Asian-based currencies such as AUD, HKD and RMB are growing as well.”</p>
<p>One notable development in recent years has been the rise of Chinese fund Yu’E Bao, which is sold on mobile payment platform Alipay. The fund, which was launched in 2013, now has over RMB 1.4trn of assets under management and is the world’s largest money market fund. While the fund is aimed at retail investors, its rapid success has done much to boost the profile of MMFs in the region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bourke points out that the RMB space has become the second largest MMF domicile in the world, according to figures published by Fitch Ratings earlier this year. “This has been primarily due to retail participants’ adoption of MMFs via technological innovation, and institutional demand driven by corporate outsourcing of asset management, capital controls and guidelines limiting bank payouts on deposits,” he adds.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""mmf-reform-in-the-us-and-europe"">MMF reform in the US and Europe</h3>
<p>Last year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced new rules stipulating that money market funds must operate on a variable net asset value (VNAV) model, instead of keeping the cost of a share at a constant NAV of US$1. The rules also included the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates if the percentage of a fund’s assets that can be liquidated within a week drops below 30%.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Atlantic, European regulators are likewise in the process of implementing new money market fund rules, although they are taking a somewhat different approach. The European regulation, published in June, introduces a new category of money market fund, the low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) MMF, which uses amortised cost accounting for assets which have a residual maturity of up to 75 days. The new rules also include VNAV MMFs and public debt CNAV MMFs.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""regulatory-change"">Regulatory change</h3>
<p>At a global level, MMFs have been subject to significant regulatory scrutiny since the financial crisis. This has resulted in regulatory changes in both the US and Europe, with particular focus on the constant net asset value (CNAV) model of MMF.</p>
<p>How closely are regulators in Asia following these developments? “I would say that the China regulator is very focused on the risks that it sees in China,” says Ben Ford, Executive Director at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Singapore. “While they are willing to talk to global leaders like ourselves and understand our priorities, I think they are focused on controlling what they can in their own country.”</p>
<p>Past market events had led to the introduction of new rules by China’s Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) limiting the exposure that MMFs can have both to single borrowers and to lower rated assets. In October this year, new regulations rom CSRC have focused on concentration and liquidity. “As a retail or institutional investor I would want to know that I’m not in a fund that has a large concentration with one individual investor,” explains Ford. “However, CSRC’s new guidelines introduce additional rules for funds with investors at over 50% concentration, which seems very high – for example, in our funds you wouldn’t hold more than 5% – but there is a realisation that concentration is an issue that needs to be regulated, and this is a first step in that direction.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the region, Ford notes that regulators tend to have a “lighter touch” on money market funds than they do on their banking rules. “That said, regulation is still there. In Hong Kong and Singapore, regulations are fairly wide and encompass a wide range of investors,” says Ford.</p>
<p>Overall, though, it would appear that corporate investors in Asia Pacific are less affected by regulatory change than those in other regions. J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s PeerView<sup>SM</sup> Survey found that only 33% of participants from Asia Pacific were planning to change their investment policies in light of the current regulatory environment, compared to 58% of European respondents and 46% of those in the Americas. The report notes that this “could be reflective of attractive USD bank deposit rates and fewer regulatory pressures in the region in comparison with Europe and the Americas”.</p>
<h3 id=""barriers-to-adoption"">Barriers to adoption</h3>
<p>While the market is growing, there are still many companies in the region that do not use MMFs. David Blair, Managing Director of Acarate Consulting, points out that money market funds are less popular in Asia than in the US for a number of reasons. For one thing, he says that corporates in the region traditionally have tighter bank relationships – while another consideration is “plain old resistance to change”.</p>
<p>Ford points out that while there is a high level of familiarity with money market funds in the US and Europe, Asia is at an earlier stage of adoption. “While multinational treasurers are more familiar with a range of investment products, for local corporates the bank is often driving the relationship and promoting its own products,” he says. Ford notes that where banks are lending heavily to some sectors such as real estate, the corporate cash will likely be held mainly with the lending bank. “Sectors such as pharma and tech tend to have more cash and are therefore more likely to use off-balance sheet/non-bank products,” he adds.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ford says that the lack of familiarity with money market funds can result in a “bigger uphill battle” when seeking to introduce the product – not least because companies’ investment policies may not specify whether money market funds can be used. “Investment policy is another area that we work on with clients,” he adds.</p>
<p>Regulation is another consideration, although Ford does not regard this as a barrier to adoption overall. “We see it as a very good thing in the long-term because it helps investors get more comfortable and understand what these products are for – although in the early stages clients get concerned about what the regulator has highlighted, and it takes time for things to settle down.”</p>
<h3 id=""advice-for-treasurers"">Advice for treasurers</h3>
<p>For treasurers using money market funds for the first time, Bourke says the first step is to review current investment guidelines and see if MMFs are even allowed. “Secondly they should develop a framework to evaluate, select and monitor providers or decide if they want to outsource that process as well,” he says. “Also it is important that a treasurer understand the various channels available to invest in the fund, be it via fax, sweep or online portals, and the pros and cons of each.” Bourke notes that it is important to think strategically about a liquidity provider to partner with to ensure the investment and credit approach are in line with the treasurers goals.</p>
<p>When seeking a money market funds provider, there are many different considerations to take into account. The size of the sponsor is crucial, as is its level of experience. As Ford explains, “It’s important to look for a fund that has a sponsor which has been running these products for a significant amount of time, and that has a credit team in place to make sure they are looking at counterparties in the right way. You also want experienced managers who can think about the liquidity and types of risk in the portfolio.”</p>
<p>When companies undertake further due diligence, Ford says they should consider who the regulator is, whether the fund is rated and whether the fund has ever restricted withdrawals. “You should also look at the basic features, such as cut-off times of funds and whether the fund has client service in the region – but the overriding theme is the sponsor of the fund and its track record.”</p>
<h3 id=""future-developments"">Future developments</h3>
<p>Looking forward, Bourke says that the market will become “bigger faster and more transparent” in the coming years. “As the market matures the adoption rates across the institutional and retail space should increase to edge closer to the US/EMEA levels, which is about 15-20% of the deposit base,” he says. “There will probably be a convergence of the regulatory approach and an increase of pan Asian mutual fund recognition schemes.”</p>
<p>Bourke also predicts that the investing process will become more automated via online portals and tools that will improve ease of investment and transparency of reporting. “Crypto currency and block chain impacts are hard to predict but could be huge disrupters in this space as well,” he adds.</p>
<p>Ford says developments in China’s money market fund industry are likely to have a considerable impact on developments across the region as a whole. He adds, “As regulators get more sophisticated, clients and investors likewise become more sophisticated, which is exciting for us – we would like to see a greater understanding of money market funds across the region.”</p>
<p>Outside of China, Ford says that the market in Japan is more problematic due to negative rates. “Once we move out of a negative rate environment, we will probably see the market for yen MMFs grow,” he says. “Meanwhile, the Australian market is being driven by both retail and institutional investors, and there are certainly corporates who are looking at using money market funds.” In smaller countries, however, Ford says it is currently less clear where growth will come from.</p>
<h4 id=""bucketing-cash"">Bucketing cash</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, the practice of ‘bucketing’ cash balances into shorter and longer-term balances is becoming increasingly widespread in Asia. By dividing cash into different tranches, treasurers can invest short term balances into same-day settlement solutions such as money market funds, while investing longer-term and strategic cash into products with a longer investment horizon.</p>
<h4 id=""impact-of-basel-iii"">Impact of Basel III</h4>
<p>Ford notes that to a certain extent, treasurers’ investment choices are being driven by regulatory developments such as Basel III. “We have heard that some banks have created products where you have, for example, a one-month term deposit that converts into a certificate of deposit which could then be sold,” he explains. “So banks are becoming more innovative in order to create evergreen structures that can be viewed by regulators as stable bank deposits.”</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Money market funds have gained considerable ground across Asia in the last couple of years. As the market matures, it is likely that more companies will explore the opportunities provided by this type of product. In order to take advantage of MMFs, treasurers should take the time to understand the differences between providers and the impact of the evolving regulatory environment.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Corporate treasurers have long used money market funds (MMFs) as a short-term investment vehicle. Alex Fiott, Head of Front Office, Treasury at AstraZeneca, explains that like many companies, AstraZeneca has been reliant on MMFs for a number of years. “They continue to serve us well as an investment vehicle,” he comments. “The attractive features have been the AAA credit rating status, liquidity, and the diversification benefits of investing in such funds.”</p>
<p>GasLog, which owns, operates and manages liquefied natural gas carriers, is another company which makes use of MMFs, as Yannis Lefas, Assistant Treasurer – Banking &amp; Operations, explains. “MMFs provide daily liquidity, and the immediate availability of funds gives extra flexibility in times of unpredictable cash flows,” he says. “Further to that, no bank can provide you an AAA rating, which is achievable using MMFs. The various asset management companies have several instruments which provide extra security or yield, and that has made MMFs rather useful to treasurers.”</p>
<p>As such, Lefas says that GasLog has adopted a set of conservative MMFs as an alternative to cash balances and traditional time deposits, focusing on the company’s mandate for capital preservation. “MMFs allow us a better yield than our current accounts, but also the flexibility of daily liquidity that time deposits lack,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""mmf-reform"">MMF reform</h3>
<p>But despite their popularity, MMFs have been the subject of considerable scrutiny in the last ten years. The financial crisis notably triggered the collapse of the Reserve Primary Fund in the US, resulting in a run on money market funds. In the intervening years, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have sought to strengthen MMFs, resulting in significant changes to how MMFs operate. Particular attention has been focused on the constant net asset value (CNAV) model, where funds maintain a constant share price of £1, €1 or US$1.</p>
<p>In the US, where funds are now required to adopt a variable net asset value (VNAV) model, the reform has resulted in significant outflows from this once-popular instrument – and many treasurers have no plans to reverse this decision. Indeed, the 2017 AFP Liquidity Survey found that 41% of respondents who had stopped investing in prime funds following the reform do not intend to resume investing in prime funds in the future.</p>
<p>In Europe, the upcoming reforms have taken a somewhat different direction. Regulators are replacing CNAV funds with two new categories: the Public Debt CNAV fund and the low volatility NAV (LVNAV) fund. According to research published in July by Moody’s, LVNAV MMFs are expected to attract most of the assets currently invested in prime CNAV MMFs, with the majority of MMF managers intending to offer LVNAV funds to their investors.</p>
<p>After years of discussion about the final outcome of the European reform, the reaction from many corporate treasurers has been one of relief. “The proposed European MMF Reforms appear a good balance between the regulators’ desire to highlight the inherent risks of a MMF while not forcing all non-government funds to automatically become VNAV Funds after a set date,” comments Fiott.</p>
<p>“I believe that it was eventually good news to get an MMF reform in Europe,” adds François Masquelier, Chairman of ATEL (the Association of Corporate Treasurers in Luxembourg). “In my view, the European solution, with a new category of funds (ie LVNAV), was a good and acceptable compromise to match recommendations from G20 and expectations from fund managers.”</p>
<p>The possibility that all funds would need to convert to VNAV was not the only potential concern: treasurers had also been worried that MMFs would be prevented from obtaining an external fund rating. “Practically speaking for investment policies that have a reliance on credit ratings to distinguish investments, the allowance that MMFs can still be rated is welcomed,” says Fiott.</p>
<h3 id=""reviewing-the-investment-policy"">Reviewing the investment policy</h3>
<p>Masquelier notes that treasurers will need to inform their treasury and audit committees that it may be necessary to amend investment policy in order to comply with the new reform and to adapt the relevant reporting and revaluation tools. “The good news is that we have some time,” he adds. “As interest rates will remain low or negative in Europe for a while it is better to make sure that treasury can on-board several types of investment products.”</p>
<p>Where AstraZeneca is concerned, Fiott says that the pending money market reform – together with changes to bank regulation and continuing low and negative yields – have provided a catalyst for the company to review and update its investment policy. “It appears that cash and liquidity will increasingly require the treasurer’s focus and attention over the coming years,” he comments.</p>
<p>In some cases, Masquelier says that treasurers may consider adapting their strategies by segregating their cash and “allocating more appropriate tenors to the different buckets in order to extract more yield (or at least to generate and book less losses),” he says. However, Masquelier adds that he does not expect to see any major changes in companies’ investment strategies.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""time-to-consider-vnav"">Time to consider VNAV?</h3>
<p>While much attention has focused on the new LVNAV model, some treasurers may also wish to look at the possibilities offered by another type of fund which is already available: the VNAV fund.</p>
<p>Auna Dunlevy, Head of Liquidity and Investments at Royal Mail, has already taken the plunge: she currently uses a combination of CNAV and VNAV funds. “We started looking at VNAV funds because there was a lot of talk that CNAV funds would be subject to significant changes – for example, there were initial proposals that funds would no longer be rated and this would prove problematic in terms of our investment policy,” she explains. “What we found was that VNAV funds are not as scary as we thought. We also found that there is quite a range of funds with slightly different strategies, whereas sometimes CNAV funds all seem to be investing in the same thing.”</p>
<p>After conducting thorough research, Dunlevy began investing a small amount in VNAV funds and has continued to use them – albeit for specific purposes. “This is not money that we use for everyday liquidity,” she clarifies. “We like to make sure that we can leave the funds there for three months or six months.” This is possible because the organisation’s cash flows are highly cyclical: in the run-up to Christmas, the increased postal revenue generates an increase in cash within the company.</p>
<p>Dividends are paid out in January and July, which gives the company an opportunity to invest that cash on a three to six month basis. VNAV funds are used for the portion of this cash which is regarded as long-term cash – so, as Dunlevy notes, “we have the longest window of opportunity so that if there is any volatility within the funds, we can hopefully ride it out over that period of time rather than to have a daily call on these funds”. Dunlevy is satisfied with the results, noting that VNAV funds tend to provide “an extra pick up in terms of return”. She adds, “We do feel that if we have the money available, it is in the best interest of the business that we achieve an appropriate return on the funds.”</p>
<h4 id=""using-vnav"">Using VNAV</h4>
<p>When using VNAV funds, Dunlevy explains that Royal Mail has historically chosen fund providers with whom the business is already familiar. “It would tend to be someone we’ve identified as a good name over the door,” she says. “We will speak to them about the fund, their investment strategy and risk management.” She adds that they have found varying strategies amongst the VNAV funds – some funds are very similar to CNAV funds, albeit with a slightly longer duration, whereas others may have a lot of asset-backed paper. “As long as we’re happy with the underlying assets and strategy, we are generally pretty happy – although obviously we do know that this type of fund may lead to higher volatility.”</p>
<p>Another difference between CNAV and VNAV funds is the nature of Royal Mail’s relationship with the provider. Despite having used VNAV funds for a number of years, there is more internal scrutiny of the funds and their return: understanding the risk and return is important. “We like to keep the provider close to us,” Dunlevy emphasises. Yields are monitored daily and might involve discussions with the manager around significant movements. More detailed consultations happen each year before reinvesting.</p>
<p>However, choosing a money market fund isn’t necessarily an all-or-nothing decision. Dunlevy has continued to use CNAV funds for the most part – and looking ahead, she has also been familiarising herself with the new LVNAV and, indeed, public debt CNAV funds. “We’re broadly happy with the idea of LVNAV because you’ve still got that 20 basis point movement before they have to mark to market and it is a product which we will use to manage our daily liquidity,” she says. “The public debt CNAV funds may be very low in terms of their return, but there may be some funds out there which are able to give a slightly better return, depending on their strategy.”</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""weighing-the-impact"">Weighing the impact</h3>
<p>Once the new rules come into effect, how will corporate treasurers proceed? For many it is too early to say until finer details emerge of how the new funds will operate. Dunlevy says that of the fund providers she has spoken to, “Information is slowly coming out on this – and a few of the funds we deal with have indicated that they are going to be LVNAV – but we haven’t heard from everybody yet.” She adds, “The working assumption seems to be that most providers will switch their CNAV funds to LVANV.”</p>
<p>The impact of the changes may vary depending on a company’s business model. GasLog’s Lefas points out that the EU reform will affect all money market funds domiciled, managed and marketed throughout the EU. “For us, a shipping company which is not registered in any EU country, the impact will be indirect,” he says. “We could be affected by changes in the structure, investment strategy or jurisdiction of the funds we’ve elected to use.” Consequently, Lefas says, the company needs to ensure that the MMFs used continue to serve the required purpose. “Our treasury team is therefore in close co-operation with our relationship managers and has an overview of the forthcoming changes.”</p>
<p>It will be some time before the full impact of the reform is understood. Indeed, the 2017 J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerViewSM survey found that 44% of respondents needed more time and/or information before making a decision about how they will use money market fund structures under the new rules. But in the meantime, many treasurers are optimistic about their future use of MMFs. As Masquelier concludes, “At the end of the day, I think it should not be a major issue – and we have time to prepare ourselves accordingly.”</p></div>

<p>From regulatory changes to high liquidity costs, current market conditions present many challenges for corporate investors. For one thing, interest rates continue to be historically low in most of the major currencies. But with rates already rising in the US – which has seen three increases since December 2016 – the days of near-zero rates may be coming to an end. Europe and the UK have yet to follow suit, but expectations of future increases have driven the benefit of investing for longer maturities higher than it was 12-18 months ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, regulatory developments such as the arrival of Basel III have made liquidity more expensive. As a result, if treasurers build too much liquidity into their investments, this may result in the loss of potential yield benefits. Treasurers may therefore wish to consider any opportunities that enable them to invest in higher-yielding, longer-dated investment products.</p>
<p>First, though, they will need to review their investment policies and make sure these continue to be fit for purpose.</p>
<h3 id=""reviewing-the-investment-policy"">Reviewing the investment policy</h3>
<p>Choosing when to review the investment policy involves striking a balance. Making meaningful changes to a policy takes considerable internal effort, so the policy should not be updated too frequently – but nor should it become too stale.</p>
<p>In practice, treasurers may review their investment policies for a number of different reasons. For one thing, scheduled reviews will be carried out on a regular basis, typically annually. However, market changes, such as interest rate developments, can also prompt a review, as can developments in the credit market.</p>
<p>Regulatory change is another common trigger, as illustrated by our recent <strong>2017 Investment PeerView Survey<sup>SM</sup></strong>. The research found that in light of the current regulatory environment, 46% of respondents plan to change their investment policies in the coming six-12 months, up from 38% in 2015.</p>
<h3 id=""should-you-consider-lower-quality-investments"">Should you consider lower quality investments?</h3>
<p>Following a review, treasurers may choose to make some changes to the policy – and this may include widening the range of permitted products. In some cases, this could mean looking at lower-rated investment products, for example by reducing the minimum acceptable credit rating from A to BBB. This won’t always be appropriate – but in the current market, with interest rates on the rise and credit health appearing to be at historical highs, lower quality investment solutions may be attractive to some companies.</p>
<p>Treasurers may encounter some internal resistance to such a move, but there can be a strong argument for considering this approach, depending on the type of investment. Where banks are concerned, a lower credit rating simply means that their cost of borrowing will increase, which can negatively affect profitability. But companies which are rated BBB are often solid industrial and utility businesses which are happy with the amount of debt they have on their balance sheets and are therefore comfortable with their BBB ratings.</p>
<p>Of course, corporate investors will still have some types of investment that they will not consider – and for most, dropping from BBB to BB is out of the question. Sub investment grade or high-yield investments are more likely to attract speculative investors and are therefore unlikely to be suitable for risk-averse investors such as corporate treasurers.</p>
<p>It is important to note that if treasurers do opt to invest in lower-rated products, the investment policy still needs to be flexible enough to react to any market changes so that treasurers can revisit the position if needed.</p>
<h3 id=""the-benefits-of-cash-segmentation"">The benefits of cash segmentation</h3>
<p>When reviewing their investment policies, treasurers may also build in the ability to segment cash – in other words, divide cash into different ‘buckets’ depending on how soon that cash will be needed. These balances can then be invested in accordance with suitable investment horizons, giving the company the opportunity to invest in high-yielding, longer-dated investment products.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that more companies are segmenting their cash compared to a few years ago. In light of new money market fund regulation in the US – and the upcoming changes in Europe – companies have access to a greater range of investment products than in the past. We are certainly seeing companies take advantage of that greater choice and put more segmentation in place.</p>
<p>Typically, companies adopting this approach will divide cash into three tranches as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Operating cash.</h5>
<p>For the company’s working capital, treasurers tend to use same day investment solutions such as money market funds, liquidity funds, overnight deposits or overnight repo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reserve cash.</h5>
<p>The next portion of cash relates to funds which may not be needed for three months or longer – for example, cash which is earmarked for M&amp;A activity or capital expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Strategic cash.</h5>
<p>The longer-term tranche includes cash balances with an investment horizon of one year or more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While companies which segment their cash broadly follow this approach, different treasurers may define their investment horizons in different ways. Some will broadly match the maturity of a particular investment to the investment horizon, whereas others may think about how long they will need to invest for in order to expect a positive return.</p>
<p>For example, some treasurers would equate a tranche of cash with a three-month investment horizon with a three-month bank deposit. But where asset management solutions are concerned – such as longer-term bond funds – it may be more appropriate to ask how long you need to invest before you get a positive return. The underlying investments within that product may be much longer, but on average, when you look at the fund or portfolio as a whole, the expected gain will take at least around three months.</p>
<h3 id=""flexibility-and-planning"">Flexibility and planning</h3>
<p>Above all, investment policies need to be flexible. If a company’s situation changes, its need for cash – and its chosen investment solutions – may vary considerably from one quarter to the next. Flexibility is important for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Taking advantage of new products.</h5>
<p>Where new products are concerned, the types of product available will be affected by the investment solutions that are offered by different banks or asset managers, as well as by changes in regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The company’s changing circumstances.</h5>
<p>Changes in circumstance can have an impact on its ability to implement cash segmentation and forecasting successfully. Corporates’ ability to forecast cash does change over time – sometimes future flows will be much more certain, and sometimes less certain. Market developments such as interest rate rises and changes to the creditworthiness of issuers may also require flexibility in the investment policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Market developments.</h5>
<p>When reviewing the investment policy, forward planning is also important as this can give treasurers the ability to move more quickly when needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What does flexibility look like in practice? One example is that a treasurer might decide to approve a new type of investment solution before the company needs to use it. The process of opening a new account or carrying out the due diligence on a new solution can take some time – so there is a clear argument for doing the groundwork, getting a new type of investment approved and then waiting until the right moment before actually using it.</p>
<p>In practice, time-strapped treasurers often do not start doing the necessary groundwork and due diligence until a solution is needed, which can mean that the process is more rushed than it would otherwise be. By planning ahead, treasurers can give themselves the flexibility needed to seize opportunities as they arise.</p>
<h3 id=""supporting-change"">Supporting change</h3>
<p>With considerable regulatory and market changes under way, it is more important than ever for treasurers to keep their investment policies up to date. By doing so, treasurers can achieve the flexibility needed to segment their cash effectively and take advantage of different products and investment horizons when opportunities arise.</p>
<p>However, the demands of this task should not be underestimated: more than three quarters of respondents to our <strong>2017 Investment PeerView Survey<sup>SM</sup></strong> mentioned that implementing a change would take moderate or considerable effort. Treasurers should therefore seek support from a trusted partner who is able to provide guidance about market developments and assist with the creation of a suitable investment policy.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>An end is in sight for European money market fund (MMF) reform, with the regulation set to enter into force in the coming weeks. While funds will not be required to comply with the new rules until late 2018 or early 2019, fund providers are preparing to adopt the new structures. So what do treasurers need to know about the types of fund that will be available in the future?</p>
<h3 id=""history-of-mmf-reform"">History of MMF reform</h3>
<p>The impetus for the new regulation dates back to the financial crisis. The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 resulted in the Reserve Primary Fund ‘breaking the buck’, meaning that the fund’s net asset value fell below US$1 per share. This prompted a run on US money market funds – and, in the longer term, a regulatory drive to make money market funds on both sides of the Atlantic more robust.</p>
<p>In the US, this resulted in a programme of reform led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The new rules, which came into effect on 14th October 2016, require funds to adopt a variable net asset value (VNAV) model, meaning that the value of the investment fluctuates with market conditions rather than being fixed at US$1 per share.</p>
<p>Other changes include the ability to funds to impose liquidity fees and/or redemption gates during times of stress, thereby discouraging or preventing investors from making redemptions at such times:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Liquidity fees</strong> of up to 2% can be imposed at the discretion of the board if the percentage of a fund’s assets that can be liquidated within one week falls below 30%. If the fund’s weekly liquidity falls below 10%, the board is required to impose a 1% redemption fee, unless the board votes otherwise in the fund’s best interests. Liquidity fees are automatically lifted if weekly liquidity reaches or exceeds 30%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redemption gates</strong> are also being introduced which can temporarily prevent redemptions for up to ten business days in a 90-day period if weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of the fund’s total assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, US prime funds are required to disclose certain information on their websites, including their daily and weekly liquid assets as well as details of any fees and gates that have been imposed.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the new rules, significant outflows took place in the US, with US$1trn reportedly flowing out of prime money market funds and into government funds. This was backed up by the 2017 J.P. Morgan Asset Management 2017 Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup> survey, which found that only 37% of US-based investors were invested in a prime money market fund, compared to 63% in 2015.</p>
<p>However, as investors have become familiar with the new rules there are signs that cash has begun to return to prime funds. Half of the US-based investors surveyed by J.P. Morgan Asset Management said that their comfort level with floating NAV funds and fees/gates would be the most important factor affecting their decision to move assets back into prime funds.</p>
<h3 id=""mmf-reform-in-europe"">MMF reform in Europe</h3>
<p>While the same events may have set in motion money market fund reform in both the US and Europe, there are some important differences between the approaches taken by regulators.</p>
<h4 id=""the-story-so-far"">The story so far</h4>
<p>The European Commission issued a proposal for new money market fund regulation as long ago as September 2013. Lengthy negotiations followed, and the final rules were agreed by the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council on 14th November 2016.</p>
<p>The text of the regulation is expected to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in the coming weeks. The regulation will enter into force 20 days later and will apply 12 months after the date of entry into force. The European Commission will then review the regulation within five years after the regulation enters into force and will, among other things, evaluate the impact of the regulation on investors.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the European Securities and Markets Authorities (ESMA) has published a consultation paper on the new regulation, covering areas such as draft technical advice, draft implementing technical standards and guidelines. Stakeholders have been asked to provide feedback on the proposals by 7th August.</p>
<h4 id=""whats-changing"">What’s changing?</h4>
<p>“Whilst all MMFs will, under the new regulation, face some change, the most significant element for corporate treasurers will be the changes occurring to existing Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) money market funds,” observes James Finch, Head of Liquidity Management, EMEA at UBS. “This category of money market fund has in recent years seen significant usage by corporate treasurers as a cash management tool. Under the new regulation, it will be replaced by two new categories, defined as Public Debt CNAV and Low Volatility NAV (LVNAV) MMFs.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At this stage, LVNAV is expected to be a likely choice for many clients and is being viewed by investors as the option most akin to short-term CNAV money market funds.”</p>
<p><cite>Jim Fuell, Managing Director, Head of Global Liquidity Sales, International, J.P. Morgan Asset Management</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the new rules, three types of short-term money market fund will be available in Europe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VNAV MMFs, which calculate NAV using mark-to-market or mark-to-model prices. At least 15% of a fund’s assets will need to consist of weekly maturing assets, and 7.5% will need to consist of daily maturing assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public debt CNAV MMFs, which maintain a constant NAV and must invest at least 99.5% of their assets in public debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) MMFs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there will be one category for standard MMFs, the Standard VNAV MMF.</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-lvnav"">Understanding LVNAV</h4>
<p>As Jim Fuell, Managing Director, Head of Global Liquidity Sales, International at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, notes, “At this stage, LVNAV is expected to be a likely choice for many clients and is being viewed by investors as the option most akin to short-term CNAV money market funds.”</p>
<p>LVNAV funds will be able to use amortised cost accounting for assets which have a residual maturity of up to 75 days, with mark-to-market or mark-to-model valuations required for longer dated instruments. Funds can issue shares at a price equal to the fund’s CNAV per unit or share as long as the constant NAV does not deviate from the actual NAV by more than 20 basis points.</p>
<p>At the same time, funds will be required to maintain minimum weekly liquidity of 30%. If liquidity falls below 30% and daily net redemptions exceed 10% of the fund’s total assets, measures may be put in place including liquidity fees, redemption gates and suspension of redemptions. If weekly liquidity falls below 10%, mandatory fees and gates will apply. As with the other categories of MMF, sponsor support is prohibited under the new rules.</p>
<h3 id=""response-from-fund-providers"">Response from fund providers</h3>
<p>Fund providers have welcomed the changes. “It has taken a long time to get to this point, but the reforms are generally prudent and sensible,” says Jonathan Curry, Global Chief Investment Officer, Liquidity at HSBC Global Asset Management. “From the outset, we’ve had some very clear views on what we thought the reform should focus on, and a decent number of those have made it into the final reform in Europe, such as the prohibition on sponsor support and the use of liquidity fees and redemption gates.”</p>
<p>Fuell is similarly positive about the new regulation. “While the finalisation of the rules is still in progress, there’s been a degree of greater certainty,” he says, noting that the greater certainty sheds light on two important elements of the new regulations. “For one thing, the proposed new regulations offer new optionality which will allow money market funds to continue offering investors the advantages they already enjoy,” he observes.</p>
<p>“In addition, the new regulations bring together elements of oversight which have previously been afforded not just by the previous regulations, but also by industry codes of practice, rating agency requirements and prudent practices within individual asset management firms. The new regulations we think therefore provide clarity, consistency and more certainty for investors.”</p>
<p>A key question is whether the new rules could result in an exodus of cash similar to that seen in the US. As Finch points out, “Whenever change is introduced to a product that not only has a loyal following but some would argue didn’t require significant amendment, the initial view is often that the outcome will be sub-optimal.” However, he points out that since many of the reforms are already in use within existing CNAV MMFs through UCITS and ESMA guidelines, external rating agency restrictions and adherence to the Institutional Money Market Fund Associations (IMMFA) code of practice, “I don’t see why the new regulation will make MMFs less attractive.”</p>
<p>The difference in approach between US and European regulators may be key when it comes to the impact on investor behaviour. “Europe hasn’t followed the approach that the United States took, which was to require prime CNAV funds to convert to VNAV,” says Curry. “That’s likely to lead to quite different outcomes to what we’ve seen in the US, where a significant majority of investors in prime CNAV funds have switched to government CNAV funds and treasury CNAV funds.”</p>
<p>Fuell concurs: “We are not expecting to see the same significant movement of money market fund flows that we saw in the US following their regulatory reform.”</p>
<h3 id=""adopting-the-new-rules"">Adopting the new rules</h3>
<p>For fund providers, a key question will be whether to create new funds or convert existing CNAV funds to the new models. In the first instance, it is likely that many will opt for the latter. “We will look to convert our existing funds,” says Natalie Cross, Client Portfolio Manager at Invesco. “Looking forwards, once the regulations go live, as clients get more comfortable with the different fund types we will then look to see if there is room in the market to consider different products.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We will need to do some back testing and scenario testing to find out what sort of situation would lead you to invoke the 20 basis point collar. But to be honest, we’re already operating under a similar regime on our S&amp;P rated fund(s) where, to be consistent with a AAA rating, the fund NAV should not deviate by more than an amount quite similar to the proposed new regulations.”</p>
<p><cite>Paul Mueller, Senior Portfolio Manager, Invesco Fixed Income</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that in practice, many fund providers already follow many of the guidelines that will be formalised under the new regulation. “We will need to do some back testing and scenario testing to find out what sort of situation would lead you to invoke the 20 basis point collar,” says Paul Mueller, Senior Portfolio Manager at Invesco Fixed Income. “But to be honest, we’re already operating under a similar regime on our S&amp;P rated fund(s) where, to be consistent with a AAA rating, the fund NAV should not deviate by more than an amount quite similar to the proposed new regulations.”</p>
<p>Other areas of the regulation are likewise in line with the practices already used by some providers. As Mueller explains, “The new rules put in different guidelines on liquidity, but we already operate under those liquidity requirements. There are slight differences in that you can only hold a certain amount of government securities in your liquidity bucket, but I don’t think that will impact us. There is also more formalisation with fees and gates, which is slightly different – but again, we already have discretion within our prospectus to impose a gate, and many prospectuses have the same. So there isn’t much that is new, but some things are being highlighted more formally.”</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""impact-on-investment-policies"">Impact on investment policies</h3>
<p>The 2017 J.P. Morgan Asset Management 2017 Investment PeerViewSM survey found that 58% of respondents in Europe were considering making changes to their investment policies in the next six to 12 months in light of regulatory changes.</p>
<p>The survey also asked respondents about their preference in terms of the different money market fund structures which will be available in Europe under the new regulation. Twenty nine percent of respondents favoured LVNAV funds compared to 24% who cited VNAV funds. However, 44% stated that they needed more time and/or information before making a decision.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h3>
<p>For treasurers, there is still some time before the new funds will become available. “It will be the beginning of 2019 before existing funds need to comply with the new regulation, and there will be a 12-month implementation process for any new funds, taking the date for these funds to comply to June 2018,” says Curry. “That said, we are encouraging investors not to leave this to the last minute – we recognise that treasury teams are very busy, but we are encouraging clients to start formulating their views as soon as possible and start the necessary approval processes. In this way, treasurers can ensure they are in a position to respond as and when new funds are created.”</p>
<p>As such, fund managers are taking steps to keep their investors up to date about the new regulations. Fuell says that J.P. Morgan Asset Management is taking a proactive approach in communicating with investors. “We’re taking the discussion to them,” he explains. “We have a dedicated reform resource centre on our website where we have posted various articles and insight pieces. Meanwhile, our sales team is actively talking to clients about the regulatory reform.”</p>
<p>Curry notes that HSBC Global Asset Management has been very active for the last seven years in terms of keeping investors informed about the debate in Europe. “Since we’ve had more certainty about what the final reforms are going to be, we’ve had a process of engagement with our investors in a number of different formats, including one-to-one meetings, conferences and client events,” he adds.</p>
<p>While much attention has been focused on the new LVNAV funds, it is worth noting that treasurers may choose to explore the opportunities presented by other categories of money market fund under the new rules. “What I do anticipate is corporate treasurers taking a closer look at VNAV MMFs, looking to use these in combination with the new LVNAV MMFs to create a blended portfolio,” says UBS’ Finch. “Whilst this approach has often been discussed, it’s not really been widely implemented among treasures. One of the reason being that providers with a large corporate client base have focused more heavily on the CNAV category with limited VNAV fund options.”</p>
<p>Given the new reforms, Finch says he wouldn’t be surprised to see those providers launching new VNAV MMFs. “At UBS AM, we have managed both CNAV and VNAV MMFs in multiple currencies for many years and we see this as a particular advantage in light of the new regulations,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""the-big-picture"">The big picture</h3>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that the new rules are being introduced at a time when other factors are also affecting the short-term investment landscape, such as low/negative interest rates and the impact of Basel III on banks deposits. As such, any decisions about investment strategies will need to be made with the big picture in mind.</p>
<p>“Treasurers have seen the evolution of banking regulation and the impact of what banks are able to offer compared to several years ago,” says Fuell. “They will be factoring this into the decisions they will have to make in a couple of years’ time.”</p>
<p>With that in mind, providers remain optimistic that money market funds will continue to meet treasurers’ needs once the new structures come into effect. “While the changes may seem quite dramatic on paper, what the regulations have brought about is a coping mechanism for funds to be able to continue operating in times of market stress,” concludes Invesco’s Cross. “Those going down the LVNAV route should continue to operate in a similar manner as they currently do as they used to, which means there will hopefully not be too much disruption to the industry.”</p></div>

<p>MMFs have long been used by corporate treasurers to manage short-term cash, making it vital to understand the regulatory changes currently in the pipeline, and the steps that treasurers should be taking as a result.</p>
<h3 id=""state-of-play"">State of play</h3>
<p>MMF reform in Europe has now entered its implementation stage. On Friday 30th June 2017, the regulation was published into the Official Journal, with the regulation coming into force on 21st July 2017. All existing MMFs will then have 18 months to comply with the new rules – in other words, a deadline of January 2019. New funds must be in compliance by 21st July 2018.</p>
<p>The new regulation features many components that are not necessarily new, but which have been in place through other existing regulation, including broad fund regulation, industry codes of practice and rating agency requirements. The regulations bring more clarity and consistency to the MMF landscape by drawing together these elements into one consolidated regulation.</p>
<h3 id=""whats-changing"">What’s changing?</h3>
<p>At a high level, there are currently two broad categories of MMFs: short-term MMFs and standard MMFs. Under existing regulations, the standard MMF can only be run as a variable net asset value (VNAV) fund, while the short-term MMF can be run as either a constant net asset value (CNAV) or VNAV fund.</p>
<p>The new regulations introduce a couple of changes to the short-term MMF category. Until now, these have included government style funds and credit style funds (referred to as “prime” funds in the US). The new regulation provides optionality for investors, allowing for three new successor structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A CNAV fund option, which will be permitted for “public debt” or government style funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A VNAV fund option, which could be a government fund or a credit fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A low-volatility NAV (LVNAV) fund, which delivers a stable NAV and is also available for credit-style offerings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a manager, we see the developments that have come out of the regulatory process as an opportunity. The changes will give us more flexibility to deliver different options to clients, based on their specific needs.</p>
<h3 id=""considerations-for-investors"">Considerations for investors</h3>
<p>For treasurers, it is important to understand the various structures and the underlying characteristics of those products. The topic of fees and gates is certainly sparking interest among treasurers, particularly in light of the regulatory changes that were introduced in the US, where we saw a fairly significant dislocation, with assets moving from prime or credit-style funds over to government style funds.</p>
<p>But in Europe, the reaction from clients to fees and gates has been very different. Given that investors in European funds tend to be familiar with fees and gates, they are simply keen to understand how the concepts will be embedded into the regulation. As a result, we are not expecting to see the same sort of dislocation in the European MMF landscape. Indeed, we are now beginning to see some of that money shift back into prime MMFs in the US.</p>
<p>Another important consideration for investors is whether their funds will be considered as cash and cash equivalent. It is up to each treasurer’s audit firm to determine this point, but from our perspective, very little has changed in terms of how the fund relates to the rules. In fact, the investment restrictions embedded in these regulations are a little tighter than before, so there is no reason to believe that a fund would not continue to be considered as cash and cash equivalent going forward. By the same token, our expectation is that funds will still be accessible on a T+0 basis, and that they will continue to benefit from external credit ratings.</p>
<p>Of course, treasurers shouldn’t look at the reforms in isolation. The investment landscape is changing, and investors have to look at all of these developments together when understanding the regulatory changes affecting MMFs. A number of other factors are influencing the short-term investment landscape, such as central bank monetary policy, which has moved rates to zero or even negative in certain currencies, as well as Basel III and its impact on banks’ appetite for liability balances.</p>
<h3 id=""adapting-investment-policy"">Adapting investment policy</h3>
<p>Our clients are actively talking to us about the changes they will need to make to their investment policies and are seeking our guidance and advice on how to structure those new investment policies. Indeed, our <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/mod/themes/ins/2017-peerview-survey?utm_source=treasurytoday&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jpmorgancomliquiditypeerview&amp;utm_content=blog"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Investment PeerView 2017 survey</a> found that more than half of European liquidity investors (58%) are considering changing their investment policies to meet the evolving regulatory environment. The survey, which gathered the views of treasurers, chief investment officers and senior cash decision-makers, also found that among those considering new structures, 43% ranked the risk of gating or a liquidity fee as the most important factor in their decision-making process.</p>
<p>When changes are required to the investment policy, these can take some time to work through. With an 18-month implementation period, clients will have plenty of time to consider their options and review their investment policies. That said, it’s important that clients think ahead about how they can prepare for the implementation of the new regulation in 18 months’ time. Corporate treasurers do not routinely change their investment policies every six months or every year. Ideally, a policy should have enough flexibility to navigate changing times without making wholesale changes. In the current market, however, it is essential to review the investment policy – not only because of European MMF reform, but because of wider market developments.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, many treasurers simply parked their money in a bank deposit account. More recently, Basel III has made this less feasible. A bank might have an appetite for operating balances, but non-operating balances are firmly off the agenda. It may also have a cap on the level of operating balances that it can take.</p>
<p>As a result, treasurers’ capacity to manage their short-term cash using bank deposits is now more constrained, motivating them to explore alternative solutions. At the same time, they are looking for ways to navigate away from negative yield in light of negative interest rates in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Faced with this perfect storm of factors, prudent treasurers are seeking to implement an investment policy that focuses on their highest-priority requirements — typically including capital preservation and the need for liquidity on demand. However, treasurers also need to incorporate a level of flexibility into their revised investment policy.</p>
<h3 id=""keeping-treasurers-informed-and-engaged"">Keeping treasurers informed and engaged</h3>
<p>In light of these changes, we are focused on ensuring that our clients are fully aware of the nature of the regulations. For clients, this means gaining a clear understanding of what the similarities and differences will be between the funds they are currently investing in and the funds that they will use going forward.</p>
<p>As a result, we are talking to treasurers about the changing landscape, the challenges that this brings and the likelihood that MMFs will continue to play a core role in helping our investors manage their short-term investments. While returns aren’t necessarily on top of the agenda for corporate treasurers, we are also talking about the challenges that these changes will bring on our ability to generate the returns they are targeting. At the same time, we are discussing the increasing importance of cash segmentation and are explaining how treasurers can generate incremental return by gaining more transparency over their investment horizons.</p>
<p>To support these communications, we have developed the <a href=""https://am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/gim/liq/liquidity-insights/european-money-market-fund-reform-resource-centre"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">European MMF Reform Resource Centre</a>, which clients can access via our Global Liquidity web page. This includes a number of resources for clients and prospective customers. We also hold annual global liquidity investment forums around the world where existing and prospective clients can gain a clearer understanding of the changing environment by hearing from our market strategists, portfolio managers, credit and risk professionals and product development professionals.</p>
<h3 id=""with-change-comes-opportunity"">With change comes opportunity</h3>
<p>With the new regulation moving into implementation, we remain positive both about MMFs in general, and about the broader environment for MMFs. We expect that MMFs will remain a core component of the solutions that corporate investors use to manage their cash, in part due to the other changes affecting short-term investors, such as Basel III. Above all, we see regulatory reform as a positive catalyst for the evolution of this vibrant market, particularly when it comes to increasing awareness of the benefits of cash segmentation among corporate investors.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Corporates in Asia Pacific are placing their short-term cash holdings in a multitude of investments, with constant net asset value (CNAV) money market funds (MMFs) and structured deposits representing the most popular choices outside of traditional bank deposits, according to the latest J.P. Morgan Asset Management Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup> survey.</p>
<h3 id=""the-growing-appeal-of-mmfs"">The growing appeal of MMFs</h3>
<p>MMFs are still the most popular short-term cash option for Asia Pacific corporate investors, with survey respondents in Asia holding 42% of their cash holdings in this category. This is no surprise, given that the primary goals of MMFs are to preserve capital, offer a high degree of liquidity and diversify investment risk – all priorities that are shared by corporate treasurers – while offering a competitive yield. In addition, 35% of respondents to the study in Asia have also anticipated increasing the allocation of CNAV MMFs within their investment portfolio, based on the future market outlook and interest rate forecast.</p>
<p>The flexibility and liquidity of MMFs are helping treasurers in Asia to meet their unpredictable cash flows. This is particularly useful as only 30% of our survey respondents in Asia can accurately forecast their cash flows quarterly or beyond, compared with 60% of respondents in the US.</p>
<p>In addition, MMFs offer global investment diversification to Chinese financial institutions for their offshore US dollar liquidity management, reducing their reliance on tight domestic funding conditions and limited domestic counterparties.</p>
<h3 id=""tailored-liquidity-solutions"">Tailored liquidity solutions</h3>
<p>Ultra-short duration fixed income strategies catered for reserve cash with a six month to one year investment horizon are also becoming increasingly popular. These strategies typically outperform MMFs in terms of total return, whilst minimising potential negative interest-rate sensitivity compared to longer duration strategies.</p>
<p>As Asian corporates tend to have a home country bias with respect to credit exposure, having a customised separately managed portfolio which invests in Asia-focused US dollar investment-grade issuers not only accommodates this bias, but also presents yield-enhancing opportunities.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>We have seen increased interest in alternatives to bank deposits, primarily driven by concerns about low rates on deposits and recognition that deposits are not risk-free due to counterparty exposure to the bank. We see two main trends among corporate treasurers looking to address these concerns.</p>
<p>First, money market funds have become more popular as a short-term cash investment option. Many companies have implemented investment policies for short-term cash that limit counterparty exposure and set minimum credit rating requirements for deposit-taking institutions or funds. High quality money market funds offer a convenient way to comply with these requirements since they are ring-fenced investment vehicles with high degrees of diversification, AAA ratings and intraday liquidity.</p>
<p>In addition, online investment portals provide a simple and easy subscription and redemption process for money market funds, with added risk management tools and significant operational efficiencies. Finally, in a rising rate environment, banks may not be able to pass higher rates on to depositors as quickly as money market funds can to investors.</p>
<p>The second trend we’ve seen is that some of the more sophisticated corporates with sizeable cash balances are starting to think of their balance sheet cash in two timeframes: operational capital for day-to-day needs and strategic cash that can have a specific, longer-term duration. By identifying their cash requirements across different timeframes, they can then choose the most appropriate product for each bucket.</p>
<p>Investing strategic cash in a portfolio of highly rated securities with a slightly longer duration compared to money market funds could improve the diversification and risk-return profile of the overall cash balance. The portfolio can be constructed within the parameters of their investment policy, and could allow for a significant amount of customisation depending on whether it is structured as a separately managed account or in a fund format.</p>
<p>Historically, corporates in Asia have relied on single product strategies for managing cash, however a diversified portfolio approach to cash management is the best practice and most optimal way for corporate liquidity management, as different cash management products are complementary to each other.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>It is a unique time for corporate cash investors in Asia Pacific. Historically, most corporates have kept their cash in bank deposit products. More recently however, the convergence of two dynamics are encouraging these investors to seek alternatives to traditional on-balance sheet solutions. On the one hand, globalisation and growth are generating growing cash stockpiles held by in-region multinational and locally headquartered corporates alike. On the other side of the equation however, new regulations such as Basel III and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio are reducing the appetite for client deposits at many global and some regional banks.</p>
<p>As a result, many corporate cash investors are seeking to manage their cash more actively. MMFs are gaining particular popularity as a viable off-balance sheet alternative for this excess cash. For some clients, MMFs have been used to supplement time deposits for some time, but for many the product is new.</p>
<p>MMFs are a logical next step for those who have traditionally used banking products because like time deposits, MMFs’ primary objectives are firstly, to seek to preserve principal, and secondly to provide liquidity to meet a client’s needs. Thirdly, MMFs aim to provide competitive yield, without sacrificing the first two objectives.</p>
<p>Risk of principal loss has always been the critical concern of cash investors. As growth in Asia Pacific continues, and cash pools increase in size, it becomes ever harder to achieve the necessary diversification to help insulate a portfolio against credit and counterparty risks. Appropriately diversifying against these risks through laddered time deposits across local banks can be time-consuming and difficult. MMFs can provide an easy way to achieve this because they are governed by strict diversification and credit quality requirements.</p>
<p>Operationally, same day dealing in MMFs allows an investor on-demand access to their cash when needed, under normal circumstances. Active portfolio management and transparency also benefit the liquidity profiles of MMFs, as they are continually adjusted to keep pace with changing market dynamics.</p>
<p>As the Asia Pacific region continues to grow, corporate cash investors will benefit from flexibility to manage large pools of cash efficiently across various businesses, jurisdictions, currencies and needs. This is particularly true for small treasury departments at local corporates or local branches of MNCs. The standardisation and global applicability of a money market fund can provide familiarity, ease of use and consistency in an otherwise complex environment. It’s important to work with a globally experienced asset manager, ideally one which benefits from scale, diversification, a robust credit research team dedicated to short-term investments and meaningful market presence across currencies.</p>
<p>As the landscape in the region continues to change, MMFs can represent a valuable tool for corporate cash investors, but there are other products emerging as well. Separately managed accounts have not yet been fully adopted in the region, but over time could provide corporate treasurers in the region with bespoke off-balance sheet solutions tailored to meet their individual requirements, particularly for those with unique currency needs. Additionally, certain exchange-traded funds are working to meet the settlement needs of cash investors.</p>
<p>As adoption of other off-balance sheet products gathers momentum, MMFs seem poised to continue gaining favour and providing benefits for corporate investors seeking alternatives and enhancements to traditional banking products.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Today’s liquidity management landscape continues to present corporate treasurers with considerable challenges. Despite the US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise the base rate from 0.75% to 1% in March, interest rates around the world remain low or, in some cases, negative. Meanwhile, regulatory developments such as Basel III have resulted in some banks having a more limited appetite for liquidity than in the past.</p>
<p>This challenging liquidity environment has prompted corporate treasurers to think differently about the cash they need on a daily basis, and to ask how they can make their cash work harder. In many cases, this is leading to more conversations about the strategic use of cash, with corporates looking to segment their cash into different buckets based on their short-, medium- and long-term needs.</p>
<p>While many corporate treasurers have historically met their investment needs using bank deposits and money market funds (MMFs), these challenges have prompted some to look further afield. In certain cases, treasurers are taking a closer look at the opportunities presented by exchange traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>“When corporates segment their cash, the strategic bucket tends to have a bit more flexibility in terms of the investment guidelines and the tolerance to risk,” explains Ashley Fagan, Head of the UK Institutional Team for iShares at BlackRock. “So because of that, there’s a broader range of short duration solutions that they will consider. ETFs sit nicely as a solution within that, as well as broader tailored liquidity solutions that can encompass ETFs, or a combination of ETFs and traditional money market fund (MMF) instruments.”</p>
<h3 id=""overview-of-etfs"">Overview of ETFs</h3>
<p>As the name implies, exchange traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds which are traded on a stock exchange. ETFs typically track an index such as the S&amp;P 500 or FTSE 100 and hold a portfolio of assets such as stocks, bonds or commodities. Investors can buy or sell shares in an ETF in order to gain exposure to a particular index or market. Unlike mutual funds, which are priced once a day, ETFs may be traded intraday.</p>
<p>The first ETFs were launched in the late 1980s and 1990s. Since then, ETFs have grown to become a popular investment vehicle for individual and institutional investors alike. Worldwide ETF assets were worth around US$715bn in 2008, but growth in the intervening years has been considerable. As of August 2016, the ETF industry was overseeing assets under management of US$3.4trn, according to EY’s Global ETF Survey 2016, following “a decade of growth averaging 21.5% per annum”. The EY report predicted that AuM will reach US$6trn by 2020.</p>
<p>Bill Donahue, Managing Director in Asset Management and one of the leads of PwC’s ETF practice, notes that, “ETFs continue to experience significant inflows, including a record US$133bn for the three months ended 31st March 2017.” According to Donahue, there continues to be a lot of interest in smart beta ETFs and fixed income ETFs, with ETFs continuing to benefit from the trend towards passive, low cost investment products.</p>
<figure class=""center"" id=""infographic-01"">
<img alt=""Infographic 1: US$3.4trn assets under management"" height=""93"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/20170506tt04ininfographic01usd34trnassetsundermanagementt300x93.png?la=en&amp;hash=BC49E575554A4455D24A76113ACB6113"" width=""300""> </img></figure>
<p>At the same time, a number of different factors are affecting the direction in which the market is developing. “At the macro level we have a more robust regulatory environment putting pressure on traditional commission-driven financial product sales, coupled with the age of the internet shining the light of transparency on the asset management industry,” comments Will Rhind, CEO and Founder of ETF sponsor GraniteShares. “As a result, investors are becoming more educated and are actually seeking out low-cost, transparent and liquid investments. Those are ETFs.”</p>
<p>André Horovitz, Lecturer at London Financial Studies, says that the ETF segment “seems to be blooming as investors tend to be increasingly concerned about the high cost of traditional investment vehicles with historically proven suboptimal delivery of expected returns – especially after costs, commissions etc.” As such, Horovitz says that many investors – both individual and institutional – have pursued a “change of heart strategy” as they migrate towards passive investment vehicles. “Indeed, Vanguard, Dimensional and iShares have recently gained a higher than expected share of the overall investment pie, and this trend seems to continue,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""benefits-for-institutional-investors"">Benefits for institutional investors</h3>
<p>ETFs have much to offer institutional investors in the current climate. Rhind explains that ETFs offer the same benefits that are true for all investors: “low cost, transparent, liquid investment funds that provide exposure to a multitude of investment themes.”</p>
<p>“ETFs provide the institutional investor price discovery and tighter bid-ask spreads in the fixed income market that has eclipsed that of the bonds themselves that make up the fixed income ETF,” adds Geoffry S. Eliason, Chief Operations Officer and Head of Distribution at Peak Capital Management LLC. “Further, ETFs offer a level of agility that will become imperative as the economy dictates a rotation out of risk assets during a correction or recession.”</p>
<p>Donahue says that ETFs can be used by institutional investors in various ways, including cash management, transition management, rebalancing investments, accessing new sectors and markets, portfolio completion, for hedging purposes and tactical adjustments, and as an alternative to using derivatives. He also notes that ETFs can provide a way of accessing various industries, sectors and geographies. According to Donahue, corporate treasurers are using ETFs for many of these reasons, although some investment strategies are preferred over others depending on market conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a report published by Greenwich Associates in Q1 2017, ETFs: Dynamic Tools for Institutional Portfolios, highlighted some trends in terms of how institutional investors are using ETFs. According to the report, 45% of institutional ETF investors are now using ETFs for liquidity management, up from 36% in 2015. Other key uses of ETFs cited by the survey’s respondents included tactical adjustments (73%), international diversification (57%), core allocation (55%) and risk management/overlay management (36%).</p>
<h3 id=""treasurers-and-etfs"">Treasurers and ETFs</h3>
<p>While ETFs might not have traditionally formed part of the investment toolbox for all corporate treasurers, there are a number of reasons why treasurers might consider looking at ETFs in the current environment. “Corporate treasurers recognise that ETFs offer liquidity across various asset classes, a viable solution for cash management, and an effective hedging mechanism,” notes Eliason.</p>
<figure class=""center"" id=""infographic-02"">
<img alt=""Infographic 2: 45% of institutional ETF investors use ETFs for liquidity management"" height=""120"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/20170506tt04ininfographic0245pcofinstitutionaletfinvestorsuseetfsforliquiditymanagementt300x120.png?la=en&amp;hash=9284B1CB9BA4FDAD841260F110D15869"" width=""300""/> </figure>
<p>Indeed, the benefits of ETFs for corporate treasurers include the ability to access a range of different risk return profiles. “Another benefit is the transparency they offer,” says BlackRock’s Fagan. “Full portfolio holdings are published on our website on a daily basis, so they have full transparency into what the underlying investments are on an ongoing basis.”</p>
<p>GraniteShares’ Rhind observes that in the US, corporate treasurers, and corporations more generally, have been increasingly attracted to ETFs. “The money market fund debacle of 2008 and subsequent regulatory reform has led in some cases to situations where banks can no longer – or are no longer – willing to take corporate cash as they are holding too much of it and can’t make a return,” he says. “This has led to more interest in short-term government securities and short-term government bond ETFs.”</p>
<p>Recent market conditions have also played a part in underlining the potential benefits of ETFs for corporate treasurers. “There’s more volatility in the market,” says Fagan. “And where returns are concerned, we’ve got the negative interest rate environment with German government bonds yielding -85 basis points in the three-month space, for example.”</p>
<p>These factors have a knock-on effect for corporate treasurers, who may decide to look into alternative investment vehicles as a result. Fagan says that one of BlackRock’s corporate treasurer clients recently reported that they were being charged up to 2% on their USD deposits, even though the US has not adopted negative interest rates. “That just shows you the lessening appetite that banks have to hold these cash balances,” she comments.</p>
<h3 id=""how-to-use-etfs"">How to use ETFs</h3>
<p>According to Fagan, when using ETFs corporate treasurers tend to segment their cash balances so that money market funds continue to be used for the core ‘bucket’ while ETFs can be used for strategic cash. In practice, clients might look for tailored solutions such as a combination of different ETFs, or a combination of ETFs and money market funds to suit their investment criteria or guidelines.</p>
<p>While ETFs can provide a number of benefits, there are also some considerations that treasurers should bear in mind when looking at this type of investment vehicle. For one thing, not all treasurers have their own brokerage accounts set up. “It may be obvious, but the first and most important thing to note is that ETFs are exchange traded and are bought and sold like stocks,” says Rhind. “Many companies do not have the ability to trade in or buy stocks especially private companies.”</p>
<p>However, companies which do not have brokerage accounts may still be able to access ETF. Fagan says that while treasurers in this position may be challenged in terms of how they buy ETFs, “we’ve got over that by offering an implementation service for ETFs, so that’s something we’ve dealt with and been able to help corporate treasurers with.”</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-the-risk-return-characteristics"">Understanding the risk-return characteristics</h4>
<p>It is also important to be aware that unlike many money market funds, ETFs do not offer a stable net asset value, and to understand the risk-return characteristics of this type of investment. “You are potentially increasing duration compared to money market funds, and potentially adding credit risk as well,” Fagan explains.</p>
<p>Tom Byrne, Director of Fixed Income at Wealth Strategies &amp; Management, points out that with rare exceptions, ETFs have no final maturity. “Depending on what the ETF holds, the ETF could be worth less than for what it was purchased,” he explains. “The same with alternatives. Nothing can provide the certainty than an actual bond or bill (treasury, sovereign or corporate) can provide. If a vehicle promises more than bonds are offering, then there is probably greater risk to principal.”</p>
<h4 id=""not-all-etfs-are-equal"">Not all ETFs are equal</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, Eliason says that treasurers should be aware that not all ETFs are created equal. “Tremendous time should be spent understanding the ETF provider, their commitment to maintaining their ETF line-up, the trading and liquidity nuances of the respective ETF, and comparing the underlying holdings of the ETF versus its respective ETF peers,” he explains.</p>
<p>Rhind adds that as with any investment, treasurers should do their homework on what an ETF is invested in and whether they are getting the exposure they want. “Index ETFs just track an underlying index, so knowing what the index is and how it performs is most important,” he comments.</p>
<h4 id=""understand-the-risks-and-rewards"">Understand the risks and rewards</h4>
<p>Last but not least, Donahue notes that treasurers should make sure that they fully understand ETFs before embarking on this type of investment. “There are a lot of misconceptions on ETFs, including risks, impact on the markets, etc,” he explains. “It is important that treasurers perform their own due diligence to understand the potential risks and rewards with respect to investing in ETFs.”</p>
<p>Where the fine detail is concerned, Eliason says that treasurers should have a deep understanding of the index methodology the ETF represents. In particular, they should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be clear on how the index behaves under various market conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop confidence in the ETF company and their commitment to not closing an ETF down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be familiar with the underlying holdings of the ETF and their liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how the ETF trades throughout the day, particularly international exposure. Different asset classes trade uniquely at different parts of the trading day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""evolution-of-etfs"">Evolution of ETFs</h3>
<p>With the ETF market growing steadily, considerable developments are taking place in terms of the range of products available. Eliason notes that the ETF universe “continues to grow exponentially, offering cash alternatives, unique ways to carve out the fixed income market, and innovative ways of indexing that may offer more attractive risk-adjusted returns versus traditional market cap weighted indexes.”</p>
<figure class=""center"" id=""infographic-03"">
<img alt=""Infographic 3: 21.5% annual growth over the last decade"" height=""188"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/20170506tt04ininfographic03215pcannualgrowthoverthelastdecadet300x188.png?la=en&amp;hash=5CDC33A9DB06E114B0ED45990C98D6F3"" width=""300""/> </figure>
<p>Donahue says that the range of ETFs across asset classes is continuing to expand, adding that “fixed income, international equity and multi-asset allocation ETFs were the top three asset classes considered to have the most potential based on our 2016 ETF survey, which will be published in the second quarter of 2017.” He notes that a lot of discussions are taking place about active ETFs, which currently comprise approximately 1% of the US ETF market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s more volatility in the market. And where returns are concerned, we’ve got the negative interest rate environment with German government bonds yielding -85 basis points in the three-month space, for example.”</p>
<p>Ashley Fagan, Head of the UK Institutional Team for iShares, BlackRock</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhind says that the biggest trend currently is ‘smart beta’, which involves “inventing new indices primarily in the equity space that have different weighting methodologies to traditional ‘market capitalisation’ indices such as S&amp;P 500 or FTSE 100 where the largest companies, regardless of fundamentals, represent the largest holdings.” He adds, “the Trump presidency is also causing a renewed interest in inflation motivated investments. Commodities, for example, are seeing a lot of renewed interest as a result.”</p>
<p>Fagan says that BlackRock provides a broad range of ETF products, including an ultra-short duration bond ETF which has grown 430% in the last 12 months. She cites the example of a large European corporate which is in the process of reassessing its bank credit risk with banks across the region. “In the past, they would just have considered bank deposit risk as very low risk,” she explains. “Now that’s evolving, and they are looking at ways to reduce concentration risk and increase diversification, which includes looking at strategic cash balances which were historically held in bank deposits.” In light of current negative deposit rates, Fagan says the client has asked BlackRock to look at look at alternative solutions, including a range of short-duration ETFs.</p>
<p>Looking forward, PwC’s publication <a href=""http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/financial-services/asset-management/publications/etfroadmap.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ETFs: a roadmap to growth</a> found that a number of investor segments are set to drive demand over the next five years, including financial advisors, online platforms, retail investors, ETF strategists, insurance companies and private banks/wealth management platforms. “We are seeing each of these investor segments continue to drive ETF growth in 2017,” says Donahue.</p>
<p>As development continues, Donahue says that many more ETF issuers are expected to come to market over the next 12 to 18 months. “Thus there will continue to be challenges for ETF sponsors to differentiate themselves in an increasingly crowded market.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, ETFs may not be seen as an obvious choice of investment for corporate treasurers. However, in today’s challenging liquidity environment there may be benefits to keeping an open mind to a broader range of possibilities. That said, corporate treasurers considering using ETFs should take the time to understand the risks and returns associated with this type of instrument.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Currently in the process of being implemented, Basel III has considerable implications for banks – and, by extension, for their corporate customers. In light of the changes, treasurers need to have a clear understanding of how the new regulation may affect their bank deposits, and whether alternative investment vehicles might be worthy of investigation. As such, treasurers should assess whether any changes are needed to their short-term investment instruments and policies.</em></p>
<p>Deciding where to invest short-term cash is one of the core responsibilities of the corporate treasury. In recent years, however, this task has become considerably more challenging. Whereas short-term investments used to be placed on the basis of a company’s requirements for security, liquidity and yield, more recently the low interest rate environment has meant that companies can expect little yield from their short-term investments. At the same time, regulatory changes aimed primarily at financial institutions – such as Basel III – are having a knock-on effect for corporations around the world as banks re-evaluate the value of different types of corporate deposit.</p>
<p>While Basel III is aimed at the financial services industry, the new regulation also has considerable implications for corporate treasurers. “Basel III is a financial services industry event with material rippling effects to corporates,” comments Mario Tombazzi, Group Product Management Head, Liquidity Management and Account Services, Global Transaction Services, DBS Bank. He points out that Basel III requires banks “to adopt industry-wide measures to improve capital adequacy, reduce liquidity risk and enhance liquid asset quality and funding structure.”</p>
<p>For corporate customers, the implications of Basel III include increased lending costs as banks face a higher cost of capital and funding. Meanwhile, the operational deposit framework means that certain types of deposit are becoming more attractive to banks than others. An important distinction is made between operational deposits – ie deposits which are used for daily operations, such as cash management, securities settlement and payment remittance – and non-operational deposits, such as surplus cash, which may be more likely to be withdrawn in the event of a liquidity crisis.</p>
<p>For banks, the implications of this distinction are considerable. “Basel III liquidity and capital norms will make it increasingly complex for corporates and often un-economical for banks to accept deposits that are not directly tied to operating business flows from clients,” comments Gourang Shah, Head of Treasury Services Solutions for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan.</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">

<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Ong Shiwei, Global Head, Cash Liquidity Management Products, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered, notes that Basel III has dramatically changed the way banks view deposits, adding that one of the biggest components is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) framework which lays out how deposits should be valued by banks. “Operational deposits from corporates are the new liquid gold to all banks, whereas we hear that some banks are simply shying away from deposits that do not meet their definition of “operational” or tenor requirements to be qualified as LCR friendly,” Ong adds.</p>
<p>Philippe Jaccard, Head of Liquidity &amp; Balance Sheet Management, Transaction Banking at ANZ expands on the difference between the different types of deposit: “Banks value more retail and corporate operating account deposits because of their greater risk-weighted-asset (RWA) funding value and they may pay a premium for them,” he says. “Meanwhile, deposits from other financial institutions and short-term fixed deposits have lower funding value.”</p>
<p>Jaccard points out that this type of cash can no longer be used to fund RWA. As a result, “It creates excess cash invested in very short-term instruments that attracts an expensive capital allocation, or is left with central banks at very low yield. Sometimes it even has a negative yield, hence why these products are no longer as attractive to banks and may even carry a discount.”</p>
<p>Where companies’ operational deposits are concerned, Basel III has prompted some banks to develop solutions specifically aimed at these types of deposit. Ong says that with this new focus, banks are actively providing more value-added solutions to improve companies’ visibility and control of their operational balances, as well as comprehensive treasury advisory services on their end-to-end cash management. At the same time, however, the evolving liquidity climate presents corporations with a number of challenges when it comes to the area of short-term investments.</p>
<h3 id=""challenges-for-corporations"">Challenges for corporations</h3>
<p>While Basel III is aimed at banks rather than corporations, the new regulation does have consequences for companies around the world – and treasurers need to understand the implications for their businesses. According to Ong, “The biggest challenge for corporate treasurers is probably the uncertainty, which is still the case for the implications on certain bank offerings such as notional pooling.” Indeed, there has been some discussion about whether notional pooling will continue to be a viable solution under Basel III.</p>
<p>Treasurers should also assess the impact of the new regulations on their existing bank relationships. “The first challenge to corporate treasurers is to understand how their key bank relationships are impacted by the adoption of the Basel III requirements in the locations where they manage their liquidity pools from,” says Tombazzi. “Regional and global banks with extensive small business and retail customer bases have a solid and Basel III efficient funding base, which allows them to reduce some of the impacts to corporates.” By now, Tombazzi says that the dialogue with banks should have armed treasurers with a pretty good understanding of the banking landscape – and that corporations need to be as proactive as their banks in order to understand these dynamics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body"">
<h3 id=""basel-iii"">Basel III</h3>
<p>Building on the measures introduced by Basel I in 1988 and Basel II in 1999, Basel III was developed following the financial crisis of 2007-2008.</p>
<p>Developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Basel III is a set of measures which are intended to make the banking sector more robust. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the goals of these measures are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve risk management and governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen banks’ transparency and disclosures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basel III’s requirements include minimum capital requirements and a minimum leverage ratio. Where liquidity is concerned, Basel III includes the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is intended to make sure that banks have enough assets to cover cash outflows over 30 days. Meanwhile, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requires banks to hold a minimum level of stable funding over a one year horizon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In addition, Tombazzi notes that since non-operational deposits carry less value than in the past, there will be periods of excess liquidity in the market which banks will not be able to intermediate effectively. “Corporations might not be able to achieve expected returns on short dated tenors, or may experience challenges to allocate deposits in accordance with internal policies (counterparty risk, concentration thresholds, etc),” he says.</p>
<p>Harjeet Kohli, CFO of Bharti Enterprises, notes that as banks adapt to Basel III, it is increasingly important for organisations to assess – or reassess – their liquidity and cash flow solutions, as well as the durability of these solutions and their ability to project surpluses accurately. “Treasurers/CFOs then need to be able to think how they invest to be able to manage the yields on investments, as regulations require banks to assess stability and quality of deposits as well under the new norms,” he adds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jaccard argues that the impact of Basel III actually simplifies the work of corporate treasurers, who no longer need to place short-term fixed deposits in order to maximise cash yield and balance investment counterparty risk. “The focus can be on the counterparty risk of the operating banks,” he explains. “If the operating bank can operate sweeps across multiple banks, the entire process of managing counterparty risk can be further automated.”</p>
<h3 id=""weighing-up-the-alternatives"">Weighing up the alternatives</h3>
<p>Given the yield pressure placed by Basel III on wholesale deposits, treasurers may wish to consider other investment vehicles for their short-term cash. However, for companies in Asia this may be something of a challenge. “In Asia there are very few alternatives,” Jaccard points out. “Bank deposits are the overwhelming choice of companies.”</p>
<p>Ong adds that while bank deposits are still favoured by treasurers, “for strategic cash that may not qualify as operational deposit, corporate treasurers are having open discussions with their partner banks for term deposits of 31 days (or longer), or automated solutions to proportion their strategic cash in MMFs.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>
<p>An investment policy is unlikely to be updated very frequently – but market changes may prompt treasurers to revisit their policies to make sure that they remain relevant both for the company’s needs and for the prevailing market conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In some cases, there may be opportunities for companies to explore other short-term investment products such as money market funds (MMFs) and high-rated short-term debt. “Alternative instruments exist today, both on- and off-balance sheet, from a bank’s perspective,” says Tombazzi. “These include notice deposits, notice accounts and flexible term deposits (on-balance sheet) and liquidity/money market funds and fixed income securities (off-balance sheet).” He adds that while take up of these alternatives is low at this stage, “they are increasing in popularity and we expect the demand to increase materially starting from this year.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the use of money market funds is becoming more widespread in Asia. Money market funds are relatively new to the region in comparison to the more established industry in the US and Europe. However, Asia’s MMFs have grown considerably over the last year: China’s MMFs now represent 12.6% of the global market according to ICI data.</p>
<h3 id=""mmf-regulation"">MMF regulation</h3>
<p>Bank deposits are not the only short-term investment vehicle to be affected by regulatory change: money market funds are also undergoing a period of considerable change in the US and Europe. During the financial crisis, the Reserve Primary Fund ‘broke the buck’, meaning that its Net Asset Value (NAV) fell below US$1. An investor run ensued and the fund collapsed. The MMF industry has subsequently been the focus of increased regulatory scrutiny, paving the way for significant changes.</p>
<p>The money market fund reforms recently introduced in the US required funds to move away from the previous model whereby investments usually had a constant net asset value (CNAV) of US$1 a share, with certain funds now required to adopt a variable NAV instead. Other changes include the introduction of liquidity fees and redemption gates in certain situations. As a result of the changes, which came into effect in October, the industry has seen outflows of around US$1 trillion over the last year, with many investors moving cash from prime funds to government money funds.</p>
<p>Change is also on its way in Europe, following years of negotiation. In November 2016, an agreement was reached between the European Parliament, Council and Commission on the draft regulation. The proposed rules include the introduction of a new category of funds: Low Volatility NAV (LVNAV) funds. The new rules are not expected to come into effect before the end of 2018.</p>
<h3 id=""reviewing-investment-policies"">Reviewing investment policies</h3>
<p>When seeking to respond to the challenges brought by Basel III, it is important to have the right policy in place for short-term investments. An investment policy should reflect the company’s investment goals and risk appetite and should set out guidelines covering approved investment instruments and counterparties, as well as currencies and maturity limits for investment instruments.</p>
<p>“A corporate’s short term investment policy is fundamentally about managing risk, including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and more,” says Ong. “In Asia, developing countries have stringent regulations on capital outflow and currency control, liquidity risk stands out even more for regional or global corporate treasurers to take into account when setting investment policies for such restricted countries.”</p>
<p>An investment policy is unlikely to be updated very frequently – but market changes may prompt treasurers to revisit their policies to make sure that they remain relevant both for the company’s needs and for the prevailing market conditions. While companies in Asia continue to favour bank deposits, the challenges brought by Basel III may therefore act as an impetus to revisit existing policies and consider whether alternative investment products might be suitable.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing or amending an investment policy, there are a number of factors to consider. Jaccard points out that an investment policy should include the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Long and short-term credit rating of banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tenor and ability to break funds on very short notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underlying liquidity risk if investment is in securities other than bank deposits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency transferability and convertibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withholding tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash flow forecasting accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounting treatment, eg mark-to-market of securities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, not all treasurers will choose to revisit their investment policies in light of Basel III – and treasurers in Asia may be less likely to do so than treasurers in other regions. Ong says, “We observe that most corporate treasurers are risk averse and not taking drastic steps to change their short-term investment policy or rejig their portfolio mix of safe and liquid investment options.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">

</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Indeed, J.P. Morgan’s Global Liquidity Investment PeerViewSM 2015 study found that while 38% of all respondents were planning to make changes to their investment policies in light of regulatory and interest rate considerations, only 26% of respondents based in Asia Pacific were planning to do so. Similarly, respondents who were planning to reduce their investment in bank deposits were asked if their banks had encouraged them to move non-operating deposits off their balance sheet as a result of Basel III regulations or other factors. This was reported to be the case for 47% of respondents in total, but for only 11% of respondents in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, treasurers should take the opportunity to understand how regulatory developments affect their investments – and whether changes to the investment policy could be beneficial. Shah says that companies “should review their investment policy to ensure enough flexibility to allow for alternative investment options for deploying their non-operating cash.” He adds, “This should also drive a closer alignment of cash management and investment policy for companies, as they look to consolidate their cash management flows (ie payments and collection) and liquidity balances with fewer banks with global footprint in order to drive efficiency and optimise investment capacity.”</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The climate for short-term investments is certainly challenging. Aside from the implications of Basel III and other regulatory changes, other factors may also prompt treasurers to revisit their investments. According to Ong, these may include volatility in the interest rate environment – “ie USD rate hikes in contrast to the drop in most Asia Pacific currencies and negative yielding European currencies” – as well as the growing trend for countries to adopt a protectionist stance.</p>
<p>While different strategies are available to treasurers looking to overcome the challenges of the new liquidity environment, it is also important to recognise that these may not be foolproof. With the Basel III measures still in the process of being implemented, the full impact of the changes is yet to be fully understood. As Tombazzi points out, this uncertainty “causes differing behaviours from banks in the offering and pricing of similar deposit products, which are not easy to reconcile.”</p>
<p>Treasurers should therefore aim to gain a clear understanding of the current climate for short-term investments, as well as making any necessary adjustments. As Ong concludes, treasurers in Asia “should emphasise monitoring and gaining better visibility of their local currency exposures, and keeping their short-term investment policy agile to adjust to the continuously changing regulatory landscape.”</p></div>

<p>It is clear from these examples that a cash investment policy built for the US and Europe has to be adapted to fit Asia, especially if the policy limits options too narrowly or exposes the organisation to unnecessary risks. But what precisely needs to be changed and how can treasurers go about this?</p>
<p>There, of course, is no silver bullet; policies will have to be drafted differently from company to company. Interestingly though, Ben Ford, Head of Global Liquidity Sales, ASEAN and Australia at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, notes that the devil is not necessarily always in the detail. “Most multinational companies will have a comprehensive policy already in place,” he says. “These will clearly define the objectives of the organisation and provide guidance around risk tolerance, for example. The temptation when adjusting this policy for the Asian market can simply be to add in more detail, highlighting precisely what can and can’t be done in each market the company is operating in.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>The policy should therefore be drafted in such a way that it maintains the investment philosophy of the company’s headquarters, aligns with the regional office’s strategy, and accounts for local practice.</blockquote>

</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>This may be ill-advised. Ford notes that some changes will, of course, need to be made to the document to accommodate local market nuances and ensure that the business is not exposed to excessive risks by using products that are not fully understood. However, he notes that whilst these changes should be well-detailed, they should not be limiting: “Ultimately the policy needs to empower local teams and enable them to operate efficiently and invest fully.”</p>
<p>The policy should therefore be drafted in such a way that it maintains the investment philosophy of the company’s headquarters, aligns with the regional office’s strategy, and accounts for local practice. “The only way to do this,” notes Ford, “is to take a holistic approach when drafting the policy; marrying together the local knowledge of the teams on the ground with the headquarter’s overall investment objectives. Approaching the drafting of the policy in this way will also provide uniformity across the region and ensure that the locals are comfortable with what they are doing, empowering autonomous decision making.”</p>
<h3 id=""dont-delay"">Don’t delay</h3>
<p>Making changes to an investment policy, no matter how minor, requires a significant degree of effort. Indeed, according to the latest J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerViewSM survey, 82% of those planning to amend their policies stated this would require moderate or significant effort.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same study also highlighted that only 26% of companies in Asia Pacific were considering making changes to their policies. When compared to the 39% in the Americas and 46% in Europe that said they were, this indicates that policy change is not top of mind for treasurers in Asia at present.</p>
<p>There is a logical reason for these findings, as the study also revealed that only 11% of corporates operating in Asia Pacific had been encouraged by their banks to move non-operating deposits off its balance sheet as a result of Basel III. And with a plethora of other challenges currently being dealt with by treasurers in the region it is understandable that their efforts are being focused elsewhere at present. But with the Basel III regulations increasingly beginning to bite, Shevlin encourages treasurers to start thinking in more detail about their investment policy.</p>
<p>“Bank deposits continue to be the investment tool of choice for corporates, but this will soon change as the banks in the region begin to conform with the Basel standards,” he says. “Once these changes are fully implemented, corporates will be forced to diversify their investments and think more proactively about what they are doing. Those companies that go through the short-term pain and create a robust and flexible policy will reap advantages in the long term.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-trusted-partner"">A trusted partner</h3>
<p>Ford observes that corporates embarking on this journey away from bank deposits do not tend to start using complex products right away. Indeed, he notes that the journey for corporates is typically slow and considered.</p>
<p>“Most corporates in Asia tend to start investing cautiously in the region, primarily using time deposits with safe banks,” he says. “As they become more comfortable with the region and its rules and regulations, they eventually start branching out and use other instruments.”</p>
<p>As one of the region’s longest standing asset managers, Shevlin notes that J.P. Morgan Asset Management is there to support its clients at every stage of this journey. “Having offered short-term cash investment solutions to corporate clients in Asia for over ten years, we have built up a wealth of knowledge and experience,” says Shevlin. “Our clients can tap into this at any time and we are constantly acting as thought leaders to ensure our clients stay abreast of any changes that might impact their operations, or provide new opportunities.”</p>
<p>For Shevlin, investing with J.P. Morgan Asset Management ultimately gives treasurers reassurance. “Asia can seem complex and confusing,” he says. “There are lots of headlines about risks in the region but there are also lots of opportunities; having a fit for purpose investment policy suited to the region is the first step treasurers need to make in order to take advantage of such opportunities and stay one step ahead of their industry peers.”</p></div>

<p>A robust cash investment framework provides a way to make informed investment decisions and brings about stronger governance in this area. It also helps drive transparency and accountability throughout the investment process.</p>
<p>This is clearly of value to Rio Tinto and in particular to the team of front-office dealers making investment decisions. The framework quantifies market conditions and volatility to determine when and where to invest in order to generate higher yield, within a pre-approved list of options that may include treasury funds, liquidity funds, and bank deposits. This is done without detriment to the principles of preservation of capital and liquidity and within the Group’s defined risk tolerance.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">How often do you review/make changes to the investment policy, especially in order for it to fit the various markets in Asia Pacific?</h5>
<p>The investment framework is approved by the Board, is revisited periodically, and is meant to apply to the global cash investments of the Group.</p>
<p>In making the framework prescriptive, but not restrictive, we have been able to seamlessly move the management of our investments from London to Singapore without making any significant changes to our policy. That being said, we spend a lot of time keeping abreast of the regulatory developments in the markets across Asia Pacific, Europe and North America, and ensure our framework and investments stay fully compliant with regulation and aligned with markets evolution. We use expert judgement to how we apply our framework and have a process to review our risk environment and investments on a weekly basis.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">How does your investment framework define what you are looking for in an asset manager and why did you choose to work with J.P. Morgan Asset Management?</h5>
<p>J.P. Morgan Asset Management is one of our key partners. In choosing our partners, we wanted to work with asset managers who understand the principles our investment framework, who have the right products for us to invest in, which J.P. Morgan Asset Management, as a well-established and global provider of short-term cash investment solutions certainly has.</p>
<p>It is also important that our asset manager be more than just an investment vehicle for our cash but also a business partner at large. Global coverage and local knowledge really help, as J.P. Morgan Asset Management are able to guide us on the market trends and regulatory developments across different regions, as well as highlighting the challenges and opportunities that exist. In an uncertain environment, where markets are a little bit more difficult to read, this type of partnership certainly adds value to us.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4>Why should corporate treasurers in Asia Pacific consider using money market funds?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> Typically corporate treasurers are attracted to money market funds because of the safety and liquidity they offer. Unlike bank deposits, where depositors are exposed to counterparty risk with a single counterparty, money market funds are usually invested in a diverse pool of high-rated assets. Money market funds can also offer convenient same day or next day liquidity.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> In the past, corporate treasurers did not have many options when it came to cash management in Asia as they were very dependent on working with local banks. Global treasurers new to the region typically chose to work with the largest banks in each country because the financial systems in Asian markets were not very sophisticated.</p>
<p>That is now changing, particularly where money market funds are concerned. Asia’s money market fund industry is relatively young – less than ten years old, compared to 40 or 50 years in the US – so relative speaking, these types of funds are not as well-known in Asia. However, the range of products and instruments available has grown and developed, while the level of market flexibility has increased; this makes money market funds a very valuable tool for corporate investors in the region. Multinational corporations (MNCs) have the comfort of a product that they are familiar with, while local corporates can move more in line with global standards.</p>
</div>
<h4>What advantages do money market funds offer over bank deposits?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> One corporate treasurer recently shared with me that he had previously only used bank deposits. This was very cumbersome as it involved calling multiple banks to check on rates, as well as taking into account counterparty exposure limits with each bank when placing deposits. When he started using money market funds to park cash, the treasurer found that he only needed to manage individual counterparty limits – which resulted in more time dedicated to investment decision making.</p>
<p>Money market funds also offer a yield based on very transparent market rates, with dividend yields accruing daily. It is also important to manage the tenor for bank deposits as there may be a risk of being penalised for early termination.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> Chasing deposits can be time consuming with considerable resources required to help analyse counterparties and determine the exposure to certain institutions. However, regional treasury departments tend to be quite small for both MNCs and local corporates. By using money market funds – especially big providers with a dedicated credit research team on hand to do this work – you can take a lot of weight off the treasury department.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> As money market funds become more prevalent in Asia, we are also seeing greater automation and straight through processing. For example, our J.P. Morgan Global Cash Portal online trading platform allows users based in different locations around the world to conveniently transact and manage their liquidity investments across multiple currencies. Auto-transfer services can also be used to automate investments and redemptions based on a client’s pre-set limits, which can be beneficial for short-staffed treasury departments.</p>
</div>
<h4>How well are money market funds understood in Asia? Are there any myths that need to be dispelled?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> Money market funds are still a developing product in Asia and a number of local corporates are not so familiar with the concept. Some might be used to retail type money market funds, while some banks use their own internal bank products as money market funds, which is not in line with global practices.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> In the US and Europe, funds are very similar to each other – but across Asia, each market is individual, with its own regulator and its own set of rules. The characteristics and risks of money market funds can vary substantially. Corporate treasurers need to make sure they understand the differences between money market funds and how they operate in each market.</p>
<p>That said, the market is developing rapidly and China in particular has seen spectacular growth in the last few years. Our range of funds is growing across the region as demand from both local corporates and MNCs increases.</p>
</div>
<h4>How much variation is there across the region in terms of the funds available or how MMFs are used?</h4>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> Standards are quite wide locally, but we are seeing a gradual move towards international best practices. For example, Australia previously had its own set of AAA guidelines, but is now moving to adopt international guidelines. In China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has recently tightened guidelines to increase liquidity and improve security at the expense of yield, which has moved Chinese regulations closer to international best practice than they were previously. We expect this trend to continue over time.</p>
</div>
<h4>What should investors be looking out for when selecting a fund in Asia and what questions should they be asking?</h4>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> Unfortunately, publicly available information relating to money market funds may be quite restricted. Companies should not necessarily opt for the largest fund with the best yield, but consider a fund which has a good track record, has been in the market a long time, in addition to having the required resources in place to provide thorough portfolio management and quality credit research.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> Where investor priorities are concerned, our 2015 Global Liquidity Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup> report found that performance and risk adjusted returns were the top reasons for choosing an asset manager in Asia Pacific, cited by 61% of respondents in the region<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. This contrasts with the Americas, where the top consideration was deemed to be firm relationships.</p>
</div>
<h4>How are macroeconomic trends and regulatory developments impacting money market funds in Asia?</h4>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> Local regulators – and indeed local corporates – are looking on with interest at the regulatory changes in the US and Europe, where the industry is moving to a variable net asset value (NAV) model. We haven’t had similar developments in Asia just yet, so funds across the region continue to offer stable NAV. Regulators here can take their time and see how things develop in the US and Europe before looking at similar changes here.</p>
<p>The future direction of regulation is likely to focus on further tightening fund guidelines and giving investors better protection. Low interest rates are obviously affecting the region – yields were higher in the past and the low rate environment is affecting everyone. This means that treasurers are searching out every basis point of yield and squeezing every dollar to make the best returns they can. That said, while maximising yield is important, investors should still prioritise liquidity and security when considering investment options.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> Quite a number of local corporates are in the process of becoming multinational corporations, so they are starting to have exposures in different regions as well. By dealing with a global asset manager, they can understand what’s happening in different regions and how these trends impact their business in Asia and beyond.</p>
</div>
<h4>What other advantages can a global MMF provider such as J.P. Morgan Asset Management offer treasurers?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> We have a comprehensive footprint across different regions, countries and currencies. We are able to support local corporates from China or other countries in Asia as they step out into different regions, as well as MNCs coming into Asia. As one of the largest cash investment solutions providers in the world, we have a very strong commitment to this business. One of the key things is to have liquidity experts on the ground who can give investors the right level of guidance and support, as well as sharing information about the latest developments in both local and global markets.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> I see two benefits. The first is expertise: given that we are a global provider, we have a global credit team and global financial team behind us. We are not just buying local issuers as we believe that treasurers should aim to have their funds widely diversified, rather than concentrated in a specific country or region.</p>
<p>Secondly, our breadth and depth of experience in the US and Europe gives us a strong foundation to cope with any changes in the markets in Asia. We are already experienced in dealing with extremely low yields in Europe and we have experience in dealing with money market funds moving to a variable NAV in the US – both of which places us in a good position to cope with regional changes in the future.</p>
</div>
<h4>How do you see money market funds developing in Asia over the coming years?</h4>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><strong>KLC:</strong> We’ve experienced strong growth in the past few years and see tremendous opportunities for growth in Asia as markets continue to open up. Our global research shows that Asia is still some way behind other regions in terms of adoption, so there are huge opportunities going forward.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><strong>AS:</strong> The industry is continuing to develop across the region, with more issuers in Asia now issuing at the short end of the market. We are seeing more brokers dealing with issuers as well. So the overall market is growing and developing along with us.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Companies that depend upon money market funds (MMFs) for cash management may need to overhaul their approach once new regulation has been agreed by the European Union. Although the final rules are still to be decided, industry experts have highlighted a number of consequential trends that could become key talking points should we get the regulation many people are anticipating.</em></p>
<p>After much wrangling, it would appear a regulatory saga that has now dragged on for three years is finally drawing to an end. Under a plan agreed by European Union (EU) finance ministers in June this year, constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs would, like in the US, be able to continue to operate only by investing in public debt. Alternatively, funds could – as proposed by the European Parliament (EP) – convert to a new product named the low volatility (LVNAV) MMF, which can retain a constant share price as long as shares do not deviate from the actual NAV by more than 20 basis points.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers anxious for final clarity over the new rules will have to wait just a little bit longer, however. The policy process has now entered the ‘trialogue’ stage in which the EU ministers’ proposals will be negotiated with the other two parties in this, the European Commission (EC) and the EP, and it would be mistaken to conclude that, just because aspects of the Council’s proposal line up with the EP text, those proposals will be included in the final text negotiated in trialogue.</p>
<p>After all, a common agreement still needs to be found between the three positions. The elephant in the room is that the EP wants a five-year sunset clause applied to LVNAV MMFs, a provision opposed by much of the asset management industry. And as Carey Evans, Director, Public Policy at BlackRock, explains, that raises the question of what the EP will receive in order to give up that position. “If you started this discussion on the premise that you did not want CNAV MMFs persisting, then ruling out government CNAV MMFs altogether might seem like a more politically-attractive trade,” he says. “Whereas our opinion would be that a workable government CNAV MMF should be off limits in the discussion on the LVNAV.”</p>
<p>There is still very much everything to play for then. Whatever the eventual outcome of the regulatory process, though, we can be fairly certain that there are some big changes for MMFs just around the corner. Here we look at five developments industry experts expect to be key talking points in the year ahead.</p>
<h3 id=""brexit-uncertainty"">Brexit uncertainty</h3>
<p>The final outcome of the regulatory negotiations could very well be contingent upon how the politics of Brexit play out. For example, Nina Gill, the lawmaker responsible for overseeing the regulation in the EP is a UK MEP. Understandably, this has raised a few questions in Brussels in the wake of the EU referendum result in the UK.</p>
<p>“The politics of Brexit will almost certainly come into play somehow,” says BlackRock’s Evans. “The UK has been a very strong voice at the negotiating table to date, and the loss of influence will undoubtedly be felt. Equally, UK MEPs have played a very central role, and prolonged uncertainty over their position in the Parliament and within their political groups may change the dynamic of the trilogue’s discussions considerably.” Some in Brussels have predicted that legislative negotiations featuring so-called ‘third country issues’ (access to the Single Market by firms in non-EU countries) could become politically-charged and difficult to progress until the direction of the Brexit negotiations become clearer. While the MMF regulation does not have obvious third country issues, the concept of a government CNAV MMF, as it is constituted in the EP text, is restricted to only EU currencies – a classification that may not capture sterling in the future. While this restriction is not present in the Council text, it could become more politically charged depending on the political dynamics of Brexit.</p>
<p>The pivotal moment could come when the UK finally triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, thereby officially beginning exit negotiations with the EU. At that point, there would obviously be legitimate reasons to ask UK MEPs like Gill to stand down from negotiation, given that they would be negotiating rules that, in theory, the UK would not itself be implementing.</p>
<h3 id=""more-consolidation"">More consolidation</h3>
<p>The new rules that do eventually come out of these politically charged negotiations are going to – regardless of their form – almost certainly bring their associated compliance costs. These costs combined with the negative interest rate environment, will in all likelihood cause further consolidation in an already concentrated industry.</p>
<p>Fund managers will have to bolster their credit research and compliance oversight capabilities, and new investment will be required to comply with new operational, portfolio stress testing and disclosure requirements. All this favours scaled players that are better positioned to stomach increasing costs and can leverage the liquidity business as part of a broader strategy.</p>
<p>We have already seen a reduction in the number of funds, both in the US and Europe. Part of this decline can be attributed to large asset managers consolidating existing offerings, but a significant chunk has also come through acquisitions. In the past few years we have seen Federated Investors agree to acquire $1.1bn in assets from Huntington Asset Advisors, Aberdeen Asset Management purchase Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) from Lloyds and RBS selling its MMF business to Goldman Sachs. Now in the US, the number of providers offering CNAV funds has fallen to 70 from 133 in 2008; in Europe, meanwhile, 38 fund complexes offering CNAV products have been reduced to 25 over the same period.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Once the EU has agreed the new rules, we could see more money fund-managers decide to exit the business rather than make the expensive adjustments required to their offerings. “Regulation is a key factor,” Vanessa Robert, VP, Senior Credit Officer, Moody’s says. “It is weighing heavily on the already challenging landscape for money funds and it might accelerate this trend. The ability for mid-tier sponsors to thrive has been materially reduced.”</p>
<h3 id=""product-innovation"">Product innovation</h3>
<p>At the same time as corporate investors’ choice of asset manager becomes narrower, the range of short-term investment products they have to choose from may be about to get a lot bigger. First of all, a number of asset managers have already stated for the record their interest in establishing LVNAV MMFs, should the final regulation include these products as an option, of course.</p>
<p>“That is something we might be interested in adding to our product portfolio,” Paul Mueller, Senior Portfolio Manager, Sterling and Euro MMFs at Invesco, said in a recent interview with Treasury Today. “In principle, it could have a lot of appeal to clients, not least because of the fact it can still trade at a share price of one. But there are some practical operational details that could have a meaningful impact on how viable this product might ultimately be, for example, what investment securities will be allowable in the liquidity bucket. Also it is crucial that the five-year ‘sunset clause’ set-out in the EP’s proposal is not in the final text because we do not think that this product would be viable if that were to be included.”</p>
<p>Applying similar caveats, J.P. Morgan Asset Management also expects to see an evolution in its portfolio of funds once the new rules have been implemented. “When we finally see the details of the forthcoming regulatory changes in Europe it is very likely that we will need to look again at the funds we offer to investors in the region. That could include the proposed LVNAV MMF. Should LVNAV MMFs indeed become a reality, we could look at launching or even converting our existing funds to be able to offer the product.”</p>
<p>The changes are unlikely to stop with the introduction of LVNAV MMFs either. Even now, while the new rules are still being negotiated, we are seeing an ongoing evolution in asset managers’ portfolio of products, driven by the negative interest rate environment and clients searching for additional yield. Both Invesco and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, for instance, note a growing interest in products with longer investment relative to MMFs, such as managed reserve funds (MRFs) and, especially, separately managed accounts (SMAs).</p>
<h3 id=""new-policies"">New policies</h3>
<p>Given the likely emergence of more new investment products in the coming years, evaluating and updating existing investment policies to better reflect such market trends might be a necessary exercise. In fact, such exercises are already on the agenda for many treasurers. Last year’s, J.P. Morgan Global Investment PeerViewSM survey, for example, found that just under half (46%) of the treasurers surveyed in Europe plan to make changes to their investment policies, an unsurprising finding given that the same survey also discovered that only 44% of the same group of companies allowing for the use of variable net asset value (VNAV) MMFs.</p>
<p>“Upcoming US MMF reforms and eventual updates in Europe are prompting many corporate clients to review their investment policies,” says Beccy Milchem, Director, BlackRock Cash Management, noting the growing demand for alternatives to MMFs amongst the client base. “Those that are able to bucket stickier portions of operational and core cash balances have looked for additional solutions to add to their investment toolkit.”</p>
<p>Treasurers need to work closely with the Board to build an updated policy document detailing a full list of permissible instruments and counterparties. This could mean minor tweaks or a total revamp, depending obviously on the nature of the existing policy and the investment objectives of the corporate in question. For most companies, though, the undertaking would appear to be closer to the latter. Of those respondents in J.P. Morgan’s PeerViewSM survey that said they were planning changes to investment policies, only 18% said the changes would require a minimal level of effort. Meanwhile, 82% described the effort involved in making the necessary policy amendments as ‘moderate’ or ‘significant’.</p>
<h3 id=""time-on-your-side"">Time on your side</h3>
<p>Given the time consuming nature of identifying the changes that need to be made and then seeking board level approval, it is therefore advisable that treasurers – especially those at corporates that rely heavily on MMFs – to begin the process of review at the earliest opportune moment.</p>
<p>Many treasurers may, of course, want to wait until a final agreement is reached by European policymakers on the future regulation of MMFs before setting anything in stone. That would mean holding off until early 2017, at the earliest and, after the point of agreement, there should be an interim period (anywhere between six months and two years, based on the current proposals). However, it might be sensible to work ahead of that schedule. Indeed, many corporate treasurers have, sensing the general direction of regulation in both Europe and the US, already made the necessary policy changes in order that they can begin familiarising themselves with the new products gradually and at their own pace. That way, once this protracted regulatory saga is eventually concluded – which it surely will be in the coming months – they will be as prepared as they possibly can be.</p>

<p>All of a company’s investments should be governed by pre-determined criteria, designed to balance risk and return in a way which meets the company’s risk appetite: in other words, by an investment policy.</p>
<p>The investment policy sets out who has permissions to carry out certain investments, which funds, banks and other counterparties are permissible and in what amounts (percentage limits can be set), the credit ratings, returns and maturity lengths which are acceptable and how the policy may be updated in future as the company’s risk profile changes, new investment products become available or counterparties change. Rules like Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and IFRS place responsibility for internal controls on the senior management team. In line with this, the board, CFO or a specially constituted treasury committee may have roles in determining the investment policy and keeping it up-to-date. It is generally approved at a senior or board level.</p>
<p>If a treasury investment policy has not recently changed to reflect the ‘new normal’ of regulatory reform, market volatility and low interest rates, then it will almost certainly need to in the near future. There are three areas treasurers may wish to focus on when revising policy, says Hugo Parry-Wingfield, EMEA Head of Liquidity Product at HSBC Global Asset Management. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are policies still fit for purpose? Companies should not simply adjust their criteria downward in response to ratings agencies reviewing – and downgrading – banks, says Parry-Wingfield. “Rather there should be a deep analysis to decide whether they have the right – and sufficient – counterparties.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are new investment instruments needed? If the ability to place some short-term deposits with banks is becoming limited, then perhaps treasury needs to explore if other instruments are needed, such as those listed above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much liquidity is needed to run the business? In light of Basel III and the introduction of the LCR, corporates should also be thinking about how their investment policies define their liquidity profile. “The treasurer should now be reviewing what liquidity they really need to run the business. There is always an opportunity cost to holding too much liquidity but we believe that is going to be accentuated in the months to come,” says Parry-Wingfield.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>History is littered with examples of the transformational power of commodities. The Californian Gold Rush of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, for example, converted a handful of small frontier settlements on the US West Coast into big cities as hundreds of thousands of people travelled from around the world to make their fortune.</em></p>
<p>Today, crude oil, nicknamed ‘black gold’, is the world’s most prominent commodity. Oil is the commodity of the modern age and plays a vital role in every part of an industrialised economy. It can be used to generate heat, fuel vehicles and manufacture nearly all chemical products. As such, its transformational power has surpassed that of gold and any other commodity before it.</p>
<p>Oil and gold fit perfectly into the dictionary definition of a commodity: a raw material that can be bought or sold, at any time, anywhere in the world. As a rule, commodities are uniform in nature – in other words, you should not easily be able to tell who or where it has come from by its look, taste, feel or smell. A product (made out of commodities) on the other hand can usually be identified as being created by a certain company.</p>
<p>Commodities are big business, and so is financing them. To the point where the market has developed its own nuanced ways of financing players in the commodities market.</p>
<h3 id=""heavy-users"">Heavy users</h3>
<p>In some way, all companies are users of commodities, either directly or indirectly. But not all companies are users of commodities finance, because although they might purchase commodities such as fuel, they do not then produce something from this which is a commodity. By using the fuel to power an airplane or oil tanker the commodity is being transformed into a product or a service. Once the commodity is in the hands of these companies, who are end-consumers, it can no longer be banked as a commodity and this is where commodities finance slips away.</p>
<p>The traditional target market for commodities finance can therefore be broken down into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Commodity trading firms such as Vitol, Glencore and Cargill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producers of commodities, for example: Saudi Aramco, Adecoagro and BHP Billiton.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processing companies, such as: Reliance Industries, Sinopec and ArcelorMittal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""built-to-fit"">Built to fit</h3>
<p>The unique nature of the commodities market, in respect to the size of the deals, the need to often raise financing quickly, the risk levels and its cross-border nature, has seen it develop its own nuanced approach to financing. This is commonly referred to as structured financing.</p>
<p>Structured financing is different from traditional trade financing because the lender takes security (this can vary from the commodity itself, to contracts, shipping documents etc) in return for the cash. In doing so, the credit risk is removed for companies along the supply chain, because the lender (often a bank) is the trusted entity in the transaction who will guarantee payment to the producer/seller.</p>
<p>This is important in the commodities business because many of the companies involved are not rated in their own right, or are operating in countries with below average ratings, and therefore find it difficult to access affordable financing. Other advantages of this arrangement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working capital is freed up – this benefits the entire supply chain and allows the flow of commodities and cash to continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commodities are very liquid and banks are therefore willing to lend against unprocessed goods because they can be liquidated should need be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the scope of structured finance there are several different key methods of financing during the commodities lifecycle (see <a href=""#chart-1"">Chart 1</a>). And many of the products that are used in these methods of financing are those typically found in traditional trade finance.</p>

<h4 id=""pre-export-finance"">Pre-export finance</h4>
<p>Pre-export finance is often raised against the producer’s projected future export revenues, but it can also be based on existing orders along with the buyer’s payment risk. In most cases, these deals are short-to-medium term, with a tenor between one and five years and can be amended or restarted during this period.</p>
<p>In a typical pre-export finance agreement, the funds will be provided by an individual lender or a syndicate for all manner of working capital reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purchase of raw materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manufacturing and production costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation and storage costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales and admin expenses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a pre-export structure, the loan is secured by a security assignment of the relevant delivery contracts between the producer and ‘offtakers’, and the receivables generated under those contracts following the delivery and sale of the relevant goods. Also, there will be a charge over a collection account (belonging to the producer) into which the proceeds of the sale are paid. After deductions for debt service, excess funds are made available to the producer. It is worth noting that there a number of ways a structure can be enhanced, including introducing hedging products to protect against commodity price fluctuations and interest rates.</p>
<p>The overall benefits of using a pre-export financing solution include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to enhance liquidity and produce goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower interest rates in different countries can be leveraged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solution is resilient to country default or capital controls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body"">
<h3 id=""commodities-financing-a-short-history"">Commodities financing: a short history</h3>
<p>Just like any corporate, commodity producers, processors and traders require financing to ensure that the tools which help build and maintain industrialised economies keep coming. This vital function is, on the whole, provided by the banks, primarily the large European, Japanese and American banks, who have been active in the commodities market for centuries.</p>
<p>But it is an evolving relationship. Original financiers of commodities would have done so by issuing letters of credit to the commodities firms which were secured against the commodity. This relationship largely existed unchanged until the 1980s, and the deregulation of the financial services industry. This provided the banks with an opportunity to explore new avenues of revenue – primarily becoming brokers and market makers in the world’s largest commodities exchanges. In the 1990s, the relationship further changed, as commercial banks expanded into the commodities trading business as a way to capitalise and meet new regulatory requirements, going in direct competition with the companies they had been financing.</p>
<p>While this proved a prosperous adventure for the banks, the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 and the regulatory changes since, have again reversed the banks’ relationship with the commodities world. A large number of banks around the globe, such as Barclays and J.P. Morgan, have sold off their commodities trading businesses and returned to their original remit of providing financing for the commodities sector.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4 id=""prepayment-financing"">Prepayment financing</h4>
<p>Prepayment financing is similar to pre-export financing in many aspects. However, in these arrangements the producer receives the cash directly from an offtaker as an advance payment under the export contract. Lenders can fund the offtaker and share the risk of non-performance by the producer.</p>
<p>The typical tenor of such a facility can vary between a few months and up to five years for the strongest producers. In regard to the security used during the deal, this includes a security assignment by the offtaker of its rights under the export contract with the producer, including the right to have the prepayment advance repaid.</p>
<p>In the case of pre-export or prepayment finance, the primary risk is placed in the producer’s ability to deliver the commodity. To the extent lenders are comfortable with the performance risk of the producer, the offtaker who is extending the finance, can account for this line of credit as ‘credit limit neutral’.</p>
<p>Aside from this, other benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability for the producer to access credit from lenders that do not bank the producer directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buyers can negotiate term supply contacts in return for the provision of finance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mitigation of transfer risk as funds are paid into an offshore account as shipments are made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legally resilient against country default.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""borrowing-base-financing"">Borrowing base financing</h4>
<p>The final key financing structure related to commodities is borrowing base financing. This is a structure unique to commodities and is used primarily by traders and processing companies. In these arrangements the borrower’s assets – typically accounts receivables or commodity type inventories – are used as security. Once the security is in place, the solution is flexible, an upper credit limit will be agreed from the onset, but the actual amount of financing will be directly correlated to the value of the pledged commodities or receivables. Borrowers can therefore access more financing as commodity prices increase and their needs change. These facilities are revolving in tenor and typically exist for one to two years, after which they are extended at the discretion of the lenders.</p>
<p>To calculate the financing that can be offered to a borrower against their collateral, the lender will carry out the following calculation: the net value of the accounts receivable (accounts receivable less deductions such as those which are overdue, doubtful, or which can be contested) plus the net value of the goods (goods less deductions such as trade payables). This represents the total collateral value against which haircuts will be applied to determine the amount available for funding.</p>
<p>The benefits of such an agreement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuity of a credit line that fluctuates with the commodity price and hence the financing requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced cost and better access to funding through collateral cover.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""is-the-well-running-dry"">Is the well running dry?</h3>
<p>There are some commentators in the commodities space who argue that traditional commodities finance provided by major global banks is dying. It is an understandable argument when we look at the major banks’ relationship with commodities post-crisis. As mentioned, many have pulled the plug on their commodities trading business, and following the crisis banks reduced their lending quotas because of their reduced access to dollar funding and the scarcity of balance sheet assets.</p>
<p>Since the crisis, regulatory pressure from Basel III has further added to the argument. Banks are having to focus more and more on risk weighted assets and ensuring that these are used efficiently. We are also seeing some of the world’s global banks realign and pull out of countries and regions where they don’t have material presence and scale. Finally, many commodity financiers have become slow to react to the needs of the market in respect to extending finance as the internal process around approving these is now more complicated.</p>
<p>The stats also make a compelling argument. According to the Bank for International Settlements, which published a report which stated that before the crisis, 80% of global commodities trade financing was provided by banks, and primarily those in Europe. But more recently this number has shrunk to 50%.</p>
<p>As a result of these changes, many firms in the commodities world have already seen their costs of financing increase.</p>
<p>There is some relief, however, provided by the cyclical nature of the commodities business. In times when commodities prices are low, as we have seen with oil this year, there is less for banks to finance. In fact there was almost 50% less oil business to finance since the summer of 2014, but on the whole, lines of credit were unchanged. This means banks have to process double the amount of transactions to make the same revenues, which puts popular borrowers in a stronger position when looking to achieve financing.</p>
<p>Despite this, there is a shortage of bank financing for some commodities players, especially for mid-sized commodities firms in emerging markets. In many cases, the deals being made by these companies are too small and also the ‘know your customer’ processes are often so heavy that it makes it more challenging for the bank to onboard the client.</p>
<p>There is some relief for those companies that are struggling to find financing in the post-crisis world, namely smaller regional and local banks. Over recent years a number of banks from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America have begun to be active in the market as both providers of short-term financing and as part of RCFs. The caveat is that these banks are primarily looking to support firms that are providing growth to their country or region, a bank in Brazil for example will offer financing to top firms only in Europe, but may look to help smaller firms in its own country – something which has been called the regionalisation of trade finance. These firms are also in the business of cross-selling off the back of their financing.</p>
<p>Since the crisis, commodities firms have also looked to diversify their funding sources themselves and reduce their reliance on traditional bank financing. Some of these firms have, for example, further delved into the capital markets. A handful have taken this even further and established their own asset management business as a way to take advantage of the different types of investors looking to pump liquidity into the market.</p>
<p>There are other sources that commodities firms can tap, such as private equity firms who are looking to provide financing in areas that have always been out of the scope for banks – agriculture in emerging markets, for example. Yet, these firms normally have a high cost of capital and demand higher yields to justify their involvement.</p>
<p>Whether these developments point to traditional trade financing dying remains a topic up for debate, and this may just be the argument used by those no longer able to compete in the space. But one thing that does seem certain is that post-crisis commodities financing has changed for good.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><h4>What are the key objectives of Basel III and what does this mean for how banks will manage their balance sheets going forward?</h4>
<p>Basel III is a set of reform measures developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It is focused primarily on the liabilities that the banks hold – building on the framework set out under Basel I and Basel II, which were more interested in the asset side of the balance sheet. Ultimately the goal of the regulation is to strengthen capital adequacy and bolster banking supervision by setting the standards for bank capital, liquidity and leverage.</p>
<p>As the centrepiece of the Basel III liquidity framework, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) aims to ensure banks are able to meet their liquidity needs in times of serious stress. More precisely, banks are required to hold a sufficient stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash within one-day – without a decrease in value – to meet banks’ needs in a 30-day stress scenario.</p>
<p>The LCR is changing how a bank views a clients’ deposits. The LCR rules reflect assumptions around what liabilities will leave the bank in times of stress, and a run-off factor applied to all deposits. Those that are deemed to be more likely to leave first – unsecured wholesale funding by a financial services company under the US interpretation for example – attracting a 100% run-off rate. Operational deposits, cash used for payments and the day-to-day running of the businesses, are seen as least likely to leave in a stress scenario and so receive the lowest run-off rate.</p>
<p>For the 30 banks deemed global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs), there are additional requirements. All banks with the G-SIFI label are required to provide even more stability in times of market stress. As a result, on top of the requirements all banks must meet under the LCR, these institutions are also required to hold an additional 1% to 2.5% depending on the size of the bank. Consequently, non-operational deposits are becoming less profitable – and over time the banks are likely to seek to minimise this type of deposit.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>With the cash stockpiles of multinationals in Asia continuing to expand and Basel III changing how a bank views its client’s deposits, there is a growing level of interest from corporate investors in what Asia’s nascent money market fund industry has to offer. We take a look at the prospects for funds in some of the region’s key markets in the years ahead.</em></p>
<p>Never before have Asia’s multinationals had so much cash on the balance sheet – and right at a time when certain deposits are becoming less attractive to banks. But will it be the region’s money market funds (MMFs) that emerge as the big winners if corporates are forced to look for alternatives to holding all their cash with banks?</p>
<p>The MMF industry in Asia has already undergone an astonishingly rapid growth over recent years. At the heart of this trend has been China, where the MMF industry is but a decade old. Total assets held by funds in China surged six-fold to RMB 2.2trn between July 2013 and December 2015, according to a recent research note by Fitch Ratings. In 2010, the industry in China accounted for a mere 1% of total MMF assets. Today the figure stands at 10%. The development of Asian capital markets has facilitated this development. A growth in the range and volume of assets available to invest in has allowed for larger and more diversified funds to emerge.</p>
<p>Now asset managers believe MMFs could be on the brink of a second burst of growth. Amid a dearth of capital investment opportunities, the cash stockpile of corporate China now stands at a whopping $1.2trn, having increased by 18% in the last quarter alone. In South Korea, meanwhile, companies have around $270bn idle on the balance sheet, and publicly traded companies in Japan are said to have amassed reserves of some $828bn. That represents a lot of cash that may soon have to find a new home.</p>
<p>Under the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) banks must hold reserves of as much as 40% against some corporate deposits deemed likely to flee during times of crisis. In the US and Europe, we are already seeing banks taking steps to discourage such deposits. But the impact of the LCR in APAC has so far been rather muted, relative to other regions. J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Global Liquidity PeerView study, for instance, found that treasurers in APAC are significantly less likely to have been encouraged to move non-operating deposits off their banks’ balance sheets compared with peers in the Americas or Europe.</p>
<p>But some believe it is only a matter of time before more treasurers in the region start having those conversations with their banking partners. “We expect to see more growth in assets under management (AUM) over the next couple of years,” says Simon Bourke, Director, Institutional Business Liquidity, Hong Kong, HSBC Asset Management. “Some of this growth will be driven by regulatory changes such as Basel III; developments which we expect to support the growth of in funds like our HKD fund targeted at institutional clients.”</p>
<p>Aidan Shevlin, Head of Asia Pacific Liquidity Fund Management, J.P. Morgan Asset Management shares the view that interest in institutional MMF products could grow further as the banks begin to treat deposits differently under the new Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. “This year we have definitely seen a change in tone from the banks,” he says. “It’s been evident that clients are starting to become more aware of the changes, and they are starting to ask us questions about them. It definitely could be a good tail wind to the MMF industry in the years ahead.”</p>
<h3 id=""growing-sophistication"">Growing sophistication</h3>
<p>Adding to the optimism of asset managers is the growing acceptance of the money fund product beyond its traditional customer-base. Originally, institutional MMFs sprung up in Asia mainly to meet the demand of western international companies that used the products in their home markets and sought something similar as they expanded into Asia. But now companies domiciled in Asia are showing interest too. “What we have seen recently is the growing sophistication of local investors,” says Shevlin. “They are no longer satisfied with time deposits or local standards. So there is definitely growing demand in that area.”</p>
<p>The trend is perhaps a natural consequence of the steady internationalisation of corporates domiciled in China. As KL Cheah, Head of J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Global Liquidity Sales, Greater China explains, as the mainland has opened up, many Chinese companies have hired treasury personnel from other international markets. Exposed to new ways of thinking about short-term investments, these companies have begun look beyond deposits to think about the credit diversification benefits of MMFs, and developed their investment policies accordingly.</p>
<h3 id=""resilient-relationships"">Resilient relationships</h3>
<p>The question is whether the continued growth in interest asset managers expect to see in the MMFs in Asia will one day see the product become as well established as in the US and Europe. That will most likely depend on how a number of limiting factors play out over the coming years.</p>
<p>Firstly, relationship considerations may deter banks from encouraging their corporate clients to move non-operating cash balances off the balance sheet. There are cultural explanations for why this is the case. Large balance sheets continue to be a focus for many local banks in APAC; indeed, some Chinese bank managers are even compensated on the basis of balance sheet size. Moreover, with the enduring popularity of informal banking groups such as keiretsu and chaebol, in countries like Japan and Korea it is not uncommon for a bank to form part of a conglomerate’s core operations.</p>
<p>“There continue to be very close relationships between banks and corporates in APAC,” says Shevlin, adding that cross-selling opportunities might make non-operational deposits an acceptable trade-off for some banks. “Banks can offer multiple services and some may use deposits as a loss leader as a way to get in and sell those services. That relationship will only change slowly.”</p>
<h4 id=""chart-1"">Chart 1: Chinese MMFs are gaining importance in global market</h4>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/2016-09-10-tta-10-cm-chart-01-chinese-mmfs-are-gaining-importance-in-global-market-t.png?la=en&amp;hash=988C4B1D0A96381D93E0D2AE164152A4"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Chart 1: Chinese MMFs are gaining importance in global market"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/short-term-investments/2016-09-10-tta-10-cm-chart-01-chinese-mmfs-are-gaining-importance-in-global-market-t.png?la=en&amp;hash=988C4B1D0A96381D93E0D2AE164152A4"" width=""967""/></a></p>
<p class=""source""><em>Source: ICI, Wind, Fitch</em></p>
<p>Secondly, MMFs are far from being the only short-term investment alternative to bank deposits. In China, for example, commercial banks frequently introduce new products such as structured deposits – which can allow corporate investors to obtain yields significantly higher than either bank deposits or MMFs. While Shevlin warns that treasurers’ approach to these products should be firmly based on the caveat emptor (buyer beware) principle, he admits some clients might be tempted. “We are seeing a range of new products beyond MMFs, some of which have yields that are optically very attractive to clients,” he says. “But it is important for clients to understand the genuine risk and returns of these products – I think some of the attractiveness of these vehicles may fade as clients become more aware of the risks.”</p>
<p>A final limiting factor is APAC’s highly heterogeneous regulatory and market environment. Just how attractive an MMF product is to any given corporate investor may depend on the jurisdiction of the fund. Cheah makes the point, for example, that an institutional investor in Taiwan might be discouraged by the requirement to report any investments made; which includes MMFs above $10m, to the regulator. Chinese institutional investors for example will also face difficulty in freely accessing offshore investment options unless they have special approvals or investment quotas like the QDII. Enormous interest rate disparities also exist between markets, which undoubtedly influences the relative attractiveness of MMFs over bank deposits. “There are different restrictions affecting MMFs across markets in APAC, and differences in terms of rates,” he says, “and this does have an impact on the popularity and availability of MMFs in those different jurisdictions.”</p>
<h3 id=""another-liquidity-tool"">Another liquidity tool</h3>
<p>Taking all these factors into consideration, there would appear to be a strong likelihood that any shift away from bank deposits to MMFs will not be an especially rapid one. But gradual though it may be, asset managers are convinced that Basel III will drive cash balances out of bank accounts and alternative investment vehicles like MMFs will be the main beneficiaries. Increasingly, they say, treasurers of locally domiciled companies in countries like China are learning to appreciate the level of diversification MMFs can provide for their short-term investments, and the added flexibility they give them to manage cash more efficiently across the businesses. And at a time when companies have so much cash on the balance sheet, having other investment options cannot be a bad thing.</p>
<p>“I think we will see clients adding MMFs as another tool in their toolbox,” adds Shevlin. “There is still a huge opportunity, to educate the market and to attract a whole new breed of clients that wouldn’t have considered MMFs before. Treasurers are not going to switch completely to something else, but they will surely want an additional option.”</p>

<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body"">
<h3 id=""mmfs-things-to-consider"">MMFs: Things to consider</h3>
<p>For a corporate treasurer looking to invest in MMFs in Asia, HSBC’s Bourke says there are a number of factors that should be kept in mind.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the region’s industry is incredibly diverse. But differences in MMF products across jurisdictions may not always be reflected clearly in the ratings. “Depending on the currency of the fund the absolute level of credit risk can be very different between different currency options within Asia,” says Bourke. “So whilst a money market fund in India may have ‘AAA’ rating, that money market fund rating is for the India market, and the absolute level of credit risk is very different to a fund with ‘AAA’ money market fund rating in Europe for example. Investors should understand the norms in each market – from credit risk, to cut-off times, to settlement cycles: each market has its own characteristics.”</p>
<p>One should also be conscious that because asset managers manage their funds relative to local regulation, products may differ from what a US or European corporate might be used to in its domestic market. “Many multinational companies will look to invest with providers that they use or work with in another jurisdiction,” says Bourke. “So it is important to understand how that asset manager manages its investments for MMFs in different regulatory environments, as well as the governance around those products. Different structures employed in different jurisdictions, and the level of oversight is different between providers.”</p>
<p>But irrespective of these differences, Bourke believes the value proposition for corporate investors remains consistent across the globe. “The benefits MMFs bring to institutional investors do not differ between different domiciles,” he says. “Most of the features, in terms of credit diversification, portfolio management, and a high degree of liquidity and transparency are the same whatever the market. We expect clients to continue to see value in those features and continue to use MMFS and as we ramp up resources focused on Asia, we expect to see commensurate growth in AUM across the region as well.” HSBC Asset Management’s Bourke agrees, adding that he expects this broadening of the client base to drive further increases in AUM for HSBC’s China funds over the coming years. “In the past it has principally been US and European multinationals, but I think that is beginning to change. We are now beginning to see interest from China domiciled corporates as well and because of that we are confident we will be able to continue to grow our funds in the way that we run them today.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4>What does J.P. Morgan’s Global Liquidity Investment PeerView Survey tell us about the way in which corporate investment portfolios have been changing over recent years? How are your corporate clients adjusting in the face of recent regulatory and market changes?</h4>
<p>One of the most telling responses we had in the Global Liquidity PeerView Survey came when we asked what changes respondents are likely to make to their investment portfolio in the next year. For each type of cash investment made by corporate treasurers, we saw a high number of increases and decreases in the cash that treasurers plan to invest. Significantly, that includes bank deposits and stable Net Asset Value (CNAV) MMFs, which are obviously important instruments for European treasurers in particular.</p>
<p>So treasurers are evidently thinking about their investment policies; thinking about what to add and what to remove, much more than they have ever done in the past. I think that is a positive development. Given that there is so much happening at the moment, in the market and around regulation and the emergence of new investment products, I would recommend that investors look at and review their policies on an annual basis at the very least. They should not be updated too often, of course, but we are seeing some large corporates updating their policies more frequently in reaction to deteriorating credit ratings, particularly in the financial sector.</p>
<h4>What alternatives to MMFs are treasurers now showing greater interest in?</h4>
<p>The use of separately managed accounts (SMAs) is definitely on the increase. If we look again at the survey responses, nearly a quarter of respondents with considerable cash on balance sheet are considering an increased use of SMAs in the next year. The growing appetite for SMAs is really a reflection of the fact that investors are searching for yield. They are giving more attention to cash segmentation, so that a portion of their cash can be allocated to products – like SMAs – with longer investment horizons. This ensures that they are not paying for liquidity they do not need.</p>
<p>As an investment vehicle, SMAs represent a good first step beyond MMFs. I think the trend also demonstrates the fact that investors are becoming more sophisticated. After all, SMAs do require a higher level of understanding of the risk-return relationship and the different types of individual investment within a given portfolio. That requires thinking about what specific guidelines make sense. As investors become more accustomed to those investment types they can then take a view on what they feel is appropriate for their own portfolio.</p>
<h4>How is J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s own product portfolio evolving to meet the needs of investors in this new short-term investment environment?</h4>
<p>Our aim is to offer our clients a range of investment products that sit across the risk and return spectrum. In addition to SMAs, we offer products such as Managed Reserve Funds (MRF) that can work for clients as they continue to move out of MMFs in the search for additional yield.</p>
<p>And our portfolio of products is constantly evolving. For example, in August we launched a new Sterling MRF<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>; this is a bond fund which will invest exclusively in short-term investment grade sterling securities. So for sterling investors the launch of this product really comes at quite an opportune time, given that post-Brexit we are now facing the prospect of lower interest rates in the UK. We will certainly be continuing to talk to our clients about alternatives like MRFs and help them better understand what it means to move into such products away from more familiar instruments like MMFs.</p>
<p>We also expect to see an evolution in our portfolio of MMF products. When we finally see the details of the forthcoming regulatory changes in Europe it is very likely that we will need to look again at the funds we offer to investors in the region. That could include the proposed Low Volatility (LVNAV) MMF. Should LVNAV MMFs indeed become a reality, we could look at launching or even converting our existing funds to be able to offer the product.</p>
<p>The short-term universe is certainly growing and it is not just the European and US regulatory changes driving this – it is also factors like Basel III and interest rate environment. Of course, this means greater choice for the investor, but the downside is that investors will need to pay more attention to due diligence when using some of these new products as there will be marked differences between them. MMFs are heavily regulated and mostly AAA-rated, so the differences between them from a portfolio standpoint are typically quite small. But when we look at ultra-short bond funds, for example, we see much larger differences between providers, and for investors who wish to use these products it is absolutely necessary for them to understand precisely how they differ.</p>
<h4>So what should a treasurer do differently when evaluating potential alternative investment products relative to how they would traditionally go about evaluating a MMF investment?</h4>
<p>I think it is important to look at the history of the provider, the resources that are available to the firm and the management of the particular product, including portfolio managers, traders and, perhaps most importantly, credit analysts (who, after all, are responsible for managing the most important type of risk within these products, the credit risk). A good RFP questionnaire, will request information around the track record of the fund, the ability of the team, and the approach to risk management.</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>Although the key objectives of preservation of principle, liquidity and then yield remain intact – and rightly so – we feel that the realities of today’s short-term investment environment require some new thinking around what these objectives should mean.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>With respect to evaluating track records, it is important to look at how different funds have reacted in times of stress. That is often a key differentiator: how a fund manager acted in times when the effective management of risk is critical. When the markets are calm, there will be only a slight difference in returns between managers, but when the markets become more volatile, that is when differences in performance become more apparent. Whether changes were made to the portfolio to avoid credit or liquidity issues is an item that should be of particular interest. Even though one should not simply extrapolate past performance and expect it going forward, it is certainly informative to look at how managers have reacted to different market conditions throughout the interest rate and credit cycle. This sort of analysis can also be performed before investing in SMAs, with investors looking at a composite that represents all the portfolios managed to a particular investment strategy.</p>
<p>Investors should also be cognisant of differences in the way alternative products are treated by the ratings agencies. The rating on a MMF is unique as there is a liquidity component. Ratings agencies will look at some aspects of the fund such as shareholder concentration and the amount of overnight liquidity. That is different to a bond fund rating, which has a much larger subjective or qualitative component. For bond funds, the ratings agencies consider factors such as the stability of the team, the resources and the credit research track record. So it is important to understand how the ratings differ. Typically, MMFs will have a AAA-rating, whilst ultra-short bond funds, like the AA-rated sterling MRF we recently launched, will have a rating based on slightly different criteria.</p>
<h4>Outside of the asset management industry, what other short-term investments are being considered by treasurers? What would you say are the main attractions for investors of these products?</h4>
<p>One of the investment vehicles treasurers with very large cash balances are taking a lot more interest in lately is reverse repurchase agreements or repo. The first benefit of trading repo is that, because it is not a security or a fund, the accounting of the value of the investment can be stable. There is no need to mark-to-market repo, as the value does not change from one day to the next. That makes life a bit easier for treasurers, from an accounting perspective. The treasurer can simply book the investment and book the interest or yield received at maturity.</p>
<p>There are a number of drawbacks to trading repo for corporate treasurers though. Firstly, they will not normally be offered overnight repo since most counterparties would prefer longer-term deposits. In the post-Basel III world, less than three months is not especially attractive to banks. A second disadvantage is the ever diminishing availability of high quality collateral. Even though central banks around the world have been issuing more debt, the demand for sovereign debt has increased to the extent that the availability of those securities for repo has reduced significantly. Consequently, what tends to happen is treasurers will be offered other types of collateral instead, such as corporate bonds, or what we would call ‘non-traditional’ collateral.</p>

<p>Direct investment into securities, meanwhile, is less in vogue. Five years or so ago, perhaps, it was fairly common to see treasurers buying commercial paper directly themselves. But our Global Liquidity PeerView Survey shows that respondents expect to be reducing, rather than increasing, the use of these instruments. In the current environment, where credit events do occur, that is becoming less popular.</p>
<h4>What are asset managers such as J.P. Morgan doing to help clients better understand alternative short-term investment products – what advice would you give treasurers around using such products?</h4>
<p>One of the things we do at J.P. Morgan Asset Management to help our clients better understand the differences between various investment products is provide discussions around how each vehicle performs in different market conditions. We demonstrate how the products have performed during periods of market stress, for example, or in an environment where interest rates are rising. And on top of that we provide forward looking analysis to discuss with the client how we believe different products will perform going forward in different market outlooks.</p>
<p>Supplementing that, we also provide a large amount of educational material detailing the different investment types particular funds make. It is not always obvious to cash investors what particular investments a cash fund makes, and therefore such material can be very useful in terms of helping the investor understand why we believe that type of investment is suitable for a low-risk fund.</p>
<p>Finally, in our conversations with clients we are encouraging them to rethink how they define their investment objectives. Although the key objectives of preservation of principle, liquidity and then yield remain intact – and rightly so – we feel that the realities of today’s short-term investment environment require some new thinking around what these objectives should mean. Take, for example, the objective of preserving principle. Should that mean preserving principle from one day to the next or, perhaps, over one week or one month? Similarly, when thinking about liquidity, treasurers might wish to consider whether they require liquidity on any given day or over a period of, say, one month.</p>
<p>This approach allows the treasurer to alter those two measures of risk, to drive the level of yield that they feel is appropriate. That is something we are seeing more of and it is an approach we would certainly urge our clients to consider taking.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""a-difficult-backdrop"">A difficult backdrop</h3>
<p>It has now been over seven years since the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut rates to the current historic low of 0.5%, and despite low unemployment and recruitment surveys indicating a tightening of the labour market, since early 2016 forward rates have been suggesting an unchanged or lower UK base rate for a further three years.</p>
<p>Sterling cash managers have been spared negative rates (for the time being at least), but they have nevertheless had to deal with the equivalent economic effect, as deposit rates have failed to compensate for the erosion of inflation. Furthermore, changes to bank regulation discouraging reliance on short-term funding, as well as an overall reduction of short-term wholesale funding needs, mean that even when policy rates begin to rise, the return available on short-term cash will be structurally lower.</p>
<p>It is little surprise then that many corporate treasurers have been keen to explore how they can generate improved returns on their cash. How should the corporate treasurer interpret the interest rate outlook, and what options are available to mitigate the low return environment?</p>
<h3 id=""the-macro-picture"">The macro picture</h3>
<p>Our view is that growth and inflation (and therefore interest rates) will struggle to rebound. This is based on what we call the ‘four Ds’ – namely debt, deficits, demographics and deflation – which we expect to dominate the macro backdrop, keeping base rates and government bond yields subdued for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h4 id=""figure-01"">Figure 1: Short-dated government bond yields remain low</h4>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: LGIM, Bloomberg, based on generic two-year government yields since January 2008</em></p>
<p>The first D is debt. If the ratio of debt to economic activity (GDP) rises for a prolonged period of time – as it has for some three decades in the case of the US – then the assets have not been able to generate the return to pay for the debt. In other words, capital has been misallocated, weighing on growth, discouraging future investment and sowing the seeds of social inequality.</p>
<p>The second D is the typical government response to a perceived cyclical downturn in the hope that growth will eventually improve deficits. Governments are promising their populations all sorts of future benefits, but have very little chance of following through on all of these commitments. In the meantime, they run deficits, thereby building up more debt and crowding out potentially more productive private sector activity.</p>
<p>Debt and deficits are real problems that are ultimately fixable by policymakers. However, the third D, demographics, is harder to influence. The problems faced by many developed countries are well known, particularly Japan and a number of ageing European countries. But perhaps the most important country in terms of global growth is China, and here the one child policy will weigh on demographics for a number of years to come.</p>
<p>It must be a great surprise to many people, notably the global central banking community, that despite seven years of zero interest rates and trillions of dollars of quantitative easing (QE), our final D, deflation, continues to threaten a number of countries. We believe the cause of this to be the structural problems outlined earlier.</p>
<h3 id=""the-regulatory-picture"">The regulatory picture</h3>
<p>Regulatory changes that have their roots in the financial crisis are also depressing returns for cash investors. In short, regulators wanted to make the banking system more secure by reducing its reliance on short-term funding.</p>
<p>As a result, Basel III regulations therefore state that banks taking in large deposits (such as those from large money market investors or corporate treasurers) must hold high quality liquid assets – typically central bank reserves or government bonds. In effect, this makes short-term wholesale funding more expensive for banks, reducing the return they offer for this type of financing.</p>
<h3 id=""the-alternatives"">The alternatives</h3>
<p>Typical approaches to generating an increased return on cash include:</p>
<h5>Direct investing</h5>
<p>Corporate treasurers can look to manage a portfolio of these assets where they have the appropriate internal credit research and trading resource available. A higher return can be generated, but potentially at the expense of capital preservation should the anticipated investment horizon change at short notice.</p>
<h5>Liquidity plus or ultra-short bond funds</h5>
<p>The more developed US money market saw significant allocations into ultra-short or liquidity plus funds in the years immediately following the implementation of ultra-low policy rates. There has been significant interest in these products in the UK as well, despite the bumpy performance of some funds during the financial crisis.</p>
<h5>Separate accounts</h5>
<p>Separate accounts enable investors to have a professionally managed portfolio tailored to their specific return requirements and risk appetite. In practice however, separately managed account guidelines often deviate little from standard pooled funds (eg AAA short-term money market fund), and therefore do not offer much in terms of increased return while sacrificing the efficiency of liquidity associated with a pooled fund. Separate accounts are useful where investors have particular risk and return profiles and where cash flows are predictable, or the investor is willing to sacrifice some return to meet unexpected cash requirements.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: IMMFA, based on 30 day gross returns at year end</em></p>
<h3 id=""a-closer-look-at-liquidity-plus"">A closer look at liquidity plus</h3>
<p>We believe that the AAA short-term money market fund provides the best return outcome when also wanting to meet the principle objectives of daily stability of capital and same-day access.</p>
<p>For longer-term cash allocations however, where price stability may be a six or 12 month objective, the liquidity plus fund can be a useful addition to the cash management tool kit. That said, while the AAA short-term money market fund product is well established and understood, there can be significant differences between the liquidity plus, ultra-short and short-term bond options available.</p>
<p>Different approaches will suit different investment horizons and risk appetites. We believe that there are five key considerations for corporate treasurers when evaluating ultra-short or liquidity plus funds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The investment horizon, and how the fund is designed to target capital preservation within that context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fund rating. While the bond fund rating assigned to a liquidity plus fund is less prescriptive than a short-term money market fund rating, these can provide a guide of overall credit quality and sensitivity to market risk. A bond fund rating will typically consist of a credit and market sensitivity component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The investment capability of the provider, including credit research resource, and where the product fits within a range of investment products offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The underlying investments within the fund, particularly important with regard to structured finance, where the maturities of underlying loans can be very long dated (for instance mortgages) and perhaps therefore not consistent with a shorter-term investment horizon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How return is generated. A short-term money market fund (ie liquidity fund) generates return over cash through a combination of credit and duration risk, albeit in a very controlled way (eg maximum 60 day weighted average maturity and 90 day weighted average life). A liquidity plus fund has more flexibility, so you should be comfortable with how risk is allocated and managed.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>The regulation of money market funds (MMFs) is already changing in the US, and Europe is not too far behind. But some corporate investors are not waiting until the new rules arrive before testing out new short-term investment products.</em></p>
<p>“Never test the depth of the river with both feet,” the legendary real-estate investor Warren Buffett once cautioned. It is pertinent advice, perhaps, for those treasurers now acquainting themselves with new money fund products ahead of the coming regulatory shake-up.</p>
<p>One corporate cash investor that has been familiarising themselves with something new recently is the treasury department at UK postal company Royal Mail. Last year treasury tentatively began using funds with a floating (VNAV) rather than a fixed (CNAV) net asset value.</p>
<p>“I guess you could say we tip-toed into it,” says Auna Dunlevy, Head of Liquidity and Investments at Royal Mail. “We had a limit on how much we can do to begin with, and the first VNAV funds we looked at were the ones that were more similar to CNAV.”</p>
<p>Many of Dunlevy’s treasury peers, on both sides of the Atlantic, are also likely to be looking to acquaint themselves with the VNAV MMF product too in the coming months. The trouble is that ever since the term ‘shadow banking’ began to enter the vernacular of central bankers and other financial regulators, the CNAV MMF’s days have seemed to be numbered. Citing the need to prevent run-risk, regulators in both the US and Europe indicated, post-crisis, their support for a mandatory conversion of all funds to VNAV.</p>
<p>Now after years of consultation and argument and counterargument, the much debated reforms to the regulation of money market funds is beginning to take effect. In the US, new SEC rules mean that since April 2016 funds, are now required to disclose daily and weekly asset levels, market based net asset values (NAVs), net shareholder flows and the occurrence of sponsor support. More structural changes will come into effect later this year, including a requirement for all prime institutional funds to switch to VNAV. Similar regulation is expected to be introduced in Europe in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>For treasurers investing short-term liquidity in MMFs, the rules around disclosure of information US MMFs are now subject to are particularly significant, since they now have access to new data with which to assess the risk of their investments. But asset managers argue that the disclosures might also help treasurers decide where they will invest once institutional prime MMFs are mandated to convert to VNAV. Even those treasurers not actively experimenting with VNAV now have, with the additional data at their fingertips, a means to “test the depth of the river” without fully taking the plunge.</p>
<h3 id=""analysing-vnav"">Analysing VNAV</h3>
<p>“It has been clear from our conversations with investors over recent weeks that they think the release of this information is going to help them decide what they will do in the future,” says Barry Harbison, North American Head of Liquidity Product, HSBC Global Asset Management. Being able to see “how much that NAV is likely to move” over the next six months, adds Harbison, should assure treasurers concerned about the volatility of the VNAV structures prime MMFs have to apply.</p>
<p>HSBC recently carried out its own study to better understand how the NAV of a MMF might behave over time. Analysing market data from January 2001 through to January 2016, the bank considered how the NAVs of four hypothetical MMF portfolios with different strategies might move. What the bank found was that both the magnitude of movement in NAVs and the time taken to recover was closely linked to maturity of the portfolio. But even in funds with more aggressive risk parameters, there were only negligible declines in the NAVs of the four hypothetical portfolios.</p>
<p>“Our analysis shows that the NAV is not likely to move as much as some previously considered,” he says. “Even in that worst-case scenario, in which we considered taking the maximum duration permitted across the entire period we analysed, the average price fall was still around a basis point.”</p>
<h3 id=""moving-to-govies"">Moving to govies</h3>
<p>So where does this leave the value proposition of prime institutional MMF products once the implementation of the new rules is completed in October? Will there still be the big exodus from prime MMFs into the government funds that can still apply CNAV?</p>
<p>Analysts at the ratings agency Moody’s have said previously it may not be a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’ such a shift in assets from prime funds to government takes place. They note that market pundits estimate that between $400bn and $800bn of the $1.2trn in US prime fund assets could flow out before October 2016; a migration driven by both existing prime funds converting to government status and, additionally, investors switching to avoid the new rules. The latter, they add, could account for in excess of 25% of total institutional prime assets under management (AUM).</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management say the flight from prime to government MMFs has already begun, albeit driven more so far from prime retail funds converting, like the Fidelity Cash Reserves Fund, than investors making the transition themselves.</p>
<p>“There will be a number of clients for whom the path of least resistance will be switching to government funds,” says David Fishman, Managing Director; Co-Head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Global Liquidity Management Business.</p>
<p>Fishman adds that the yield differential between prime and government since the rate lift off could be the factor keeping some investors in prime funds, for now. “Our Government funds today are yielding roughly 20 bps, while our prime funds offer around 40 bps,” he says. “Right now investors are staying to capture those extra 20 bps, but expect some of them to move prior to conversion.”</p>
<p>But most asset managers in the US market believe that institutional prime MMFs will continue to be a valuable tool for liquidity management. Treasurers should be careful not to get too distracted by what happens to AUM around the time of the switch, since such shifts might not necessarily be reflecting the sentiment of their peers.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of investors would agree with the idea that we are putting forward that there is still value in these products,” says Harbison. “There has been a transition from retail and some other institutional investors from prime to government funds, and the risk is that leads corporate investors to think that this flow is being driven solely by other treasurers so they need to go along with it.”</p>
<p>Harbison is not the only person in the asset management world who thinks that many investors will continue to use MMFs that switch to VNAV. “We have not seen a large scale shift into government funds yet,” says Tom Callahan, Head of Global Cash Management at BlackRock. “Through our conversations with clients we know there are certainly a number who may switch to government funds in the first instance as they assess the new landscape but we at Blackrock remain bullish on the value of prime MMFs for corporate investors in the longer term.”</p>

<h3 id=""european-mmf-regulation-the-latest"">European MMF regulation: the latest</h3>
<p>While the US is already advancing with the implementation of its amendments to rule 2-a7, new MMF regulation is still some way from being settled on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>“There are quite a number of people involved in the EU legislative process” explains a top institutional global liquidity asset manager. “There are multiple legislative institutions that play a part in writing this legislation, whereas in the US, there is just one body that writes and enforces the rules. This can sometimes slow down the rule-making process in Europe.”</p>
<p>As it stands, we await the input of the EU’s Council of Ministers, having now heard proposals from both the European Commission and the European Parliament. Aspects of the latest version of the rules from the European Parliament, published in March 2015, were welcomed by the asset management industry. Like in the US, retail and government constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs would continue to operate under the proposals. In addition, an entirely new category of fund would be established subject to a five year ‘sunset clause’: Low Volatility (LVNAV) MMFs that would be required to publish their mark-to-market daily and remain within a 20 bps range.</p>
<p>“There are some positive elements to the Parliament’s proposal, including the concept of LVNAV,” says Tom Callahan, Head of Global Cash Management at BlackRock. But as is often the case with such things, the devil will be in the detail. “Theoretically, the structure could deliver some of the key CNAV features that investors value – such as same day liquidity, intraday liquidity and a stable net asset value. But the technical details of the structure, including the sunset clause, trigger threshold and NAV calculation, are still under debate and will ultimately determine whether an LVNAV product is operationally feasible.”</p>
<p>How much of the European Parliament’s proposed changes will make it into the final version of the rules remains to be seen. First, EU Member States in the Council will offer their suggestions, and then the legislation will enter the so-called ‘trialogue’, stage in which the EC, EP and Council come together to agree a compromise. The Council rotates its presidency every six months. Currently the Dutch hold the Council Presidency; the next two Presidencies reside with Slovakia and Malta.</p>
<p>“If the Dutch Presidency manages to reach an agreement between Member States in the Council by July then a trialogue agreement by the end of the year is a possibility,” says the manager.</p>

<p>Those treasurers who, making use of the new information funds have to disclose, to analyse how those NAVs behave may reach a different conclusion from those who move into government funds. But with the much talked about changes now becoming a reality, treasurers need to decide soon.</p>
<p>“Some investors probably feel there is a lot of time before October 2016,” says Fishman. “I will tell you that there is not.” Treasurers need to begin thinking now about what their investments will look like after the changes come into effect. Systems may have to be updated to be able to account for a variable NAV; investment policies may have to be amended. “If they are able to handle those things then there will be an incremental yield in prime MMFs that investors can capture,” says Fishman. “If they can’t then they will need to prepare to move to a government fund.”</p>
<p>HSBC’s Harbison agrees that now is the time to act: “We think now is the right time to start thinking about this. Investors still have time between now and October to figure out what their investment line-up is going to look like after the regulation has been fully implemented. Now, at least, they have all the available information to make that decision.”</p>
<p>So while VNAV was initially perceived as a ‘show-stopper’ by many corporate investors, asset managers seem confident that comfort levels will increase over time. Further, as treasurers become acquainted with the new product – either through experience or simply by monitoring the published NAVs of their funds – they too should become more comfortable.</p>
<p>Getting used to how such funds behave is undoubtedly a critical exercise for MMF users. Large companies will often invest cash in a wide, diversified portfolio of assets and instruments: from treasury bills to commercial paper and short-dated corporate bonds. But for daily liquidity, that cash put aside for day-to-day operational needs, MMFs continue to be the favoured instrument for many treasurers. In both the US and Europe, regulation is coming that is going to change the MMF landscape drastically. Now is the time to prepare.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>If a treasury investment policy has not changed to reflect the ‘new normal’ of regulatory reform, market volatility and struggling interest rates, then something is very wrong. Taking lessons from Europe and the US, Treasury Today Group looks at the processes involved in establishing an investment policy that is fit for purpose.</em></p>
<p>With regulatory reforms in the money market fund (MMF) space and the far-reaching implications of Basel III making their mark on the financial community, corporate investments are facing the kind of pressures now that warrant very close attention. This attention must inevitably extend to investment policy as treasurers struggle with an unprecedented period of low interest rates across the major currencies that shows little sign of lifting anytime soon.</p>
<p>“It’s clearly an extremely challenging environment,” says Roger Merritt, Managing Director, Fitch Ratings. “I cannot think of a time, certainly in the past 25 years, that treasurers have faced so many different challenges at the same time with regards to how they can effectively manage their liquidity.”</p>
<p>Back in April 2015, Fitch Ratings published a report suggesting that if treasurers are not already looking at a policy review in this context, then they really should be. The report said that it is high time for “a proactive, strategic update of investment guidelines” and that corporate investors should give particular thought to future changes in cash management products and ratings coverage. “If the world of cash management is changing and the products that you are used to investing in are not available any more – or perhaps not available to the same degree – then flexibility with regard to the type of products that fit with your investment guidelines is important,” Merritt explains.</p>
<p>The balance of yield versus liquidity versus the inevitable cost of carry that holding cash incurs is an unenviable task. It is thus the role of an appropriate investment policy, in the words of the UK’s Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT) Handbook, to “encapsulate how a company’s risk appetite translates into practical objectives and rules.” This appetite will be determined by a number of factors including the nature of the industry within which it operates, the strategic direction of the company itself and the resources available to manage risk (both in terms of skill and experience of its personnel, and its ability to absorb any losses).</p>
<h3 id=""think-again"">Think again</h3>
<p>There are three areas treasurers may wish to focus on when revising policy, says Hugo Parry-Wingfield, EMEA Head of Liquidity Product at HSBC Global Asset Management. First, as ratings agencies continue to review and in some cases downgrade banks, corporates should be thinking about whether polices do indeed remain ‘fit for purpose’. “Companies should not simply adjust their criteria downward in response,” says Parry-Wingfield, “rather there should be a deep analysis to decide whether they have the right – and sufficient – counterparties.”</p>
<p>The second area for consideration is the investment products referenced in an investment policy. If the ability to place some short-term deposits with banks is becoming limited, then perhaps treasury needs to explore if other instruments are needed, such as MMFs or direct securities (see the section ‘Trying something new’, opposite).</p>
<p>Finally, in light of Basel III and the introduction of the LCR, corporates should also be thinking about how their investment policies define their liquidity profile. “The treasurer should now be reviewing what liquidity they really need to run the business. There is always an opportunity cost to holding too much liquidity but we believe that is going to be accentuated in the months to come,” adds Parry-Wingfield.</p>
<p>As part of its Treasury Leadership series of videos, J.P. Morgan’s ‘Is Your Investment Policy Holding You Back?’ provided viewers with some thoughts on structuring an appropriate investment policy. Jose Franco, J.P. Morgan Liquidity Solutions, EMEA Regional Executive, considered the realities of investing in the current environment, commenting that the negative rates seen in some European countries (and now Japan) means treasurers “could be breaching the company’s investment policy as negative yield erodes capital”.</p>
<p>The J.P. Morgan take on this situation is that treasurers can either adopt the view that, in time, interest rates will rise above zero (whilst realising that their current investment policy is not adequately structured to deal with a negative rate scenario) or alternatively, they can help re-write the investment policy to address the risks associated with these unusual market conditions. In the latter, the suggestion is to consider reducing reliance on overnight balances by extending the yield curve. This strategy, it advises (in concurrence with HSBC’s Parry-Wingfield), must be balanced against liquidity requirements and risk appetite, since some businesses may feel that sacrificing liquidity will not compensate for a longer-term investment’s potential returns.</p>
<h3 id=""the-changing-face-of-policy"">The changing face of policy</h3>
<p>The purpose of an investment policy has necessarily changed in recent times, notes Steve Baseby, Associate Policy and Technical Director, at the UK’s ACT. The emphasis since 2008 has been more about return of capital than return on capital, and counterparty exposure management has risen to the fore. With the availability of funding now in question for some borrowers, he feels that policy will also tend to lean towards depositing surplus cash with relationship banks, “as a reward for offering credit facilities”, although the demands of Basel III are making short-term cash deposits less attractive for banks.</p>
<p>And when it comes to steering policy in the right direction, Baseby notes a current tendency to be far more reactive. “Prior to the 2008 banking crisis, a treasury policy might have remained almost static for years on end; now there is usually a requirement to change it in the period between regular reviews.” Often there will be provision for ‘emergency changes’ to be effected. With improved communication and awareness within business, counterparty exposure for cash holdings is something that he sees as “high on the list of things most executives and non-executives will monitor”.</p>
<p>Aside from changes in the risk of target counterparties, bringing policy into line with current needs requires that a number of other key elements be considered when establishing or re-visiting an investment policy.</p>
<p>Treasurers are still thinking in terms of what can be done if they need to access their money quickly. Investment policy must dovetail into the liquidity requirements of the business and the evidence seems to be that most are sticking with simple deposits because they can build in fixed maturity dates, Baseby notes. In fact, in a very high turnover cash business, it is likely that most or all maturity dates will be short term, but for other business models, forecast accuracy is increasingly important as a means of determining investment strategy – there is after all a boardroom requirement to know that, should some event beyond treasury’s control suddenly impact the business, it will not run out of money. “Forecasting used to be something that companies did on an approximate basis, on a weekly cycle, over the next quarter. Now it is done in much more detail.”</p>
<p>For this reason, there is today more active oversight of where funds are, and why they are there. But how often should policy be inspected to keep investments relevant? “Investment policies are not supposed to be something that change every six months,” says Jim Fuell, Head of Global Liquidity, EMEA at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “They are broadly written, but with a level of constraint. Having said that, though, I think it is also important to build in some level of flexibility that allows you to navigate through some of the impending changes without necessarily having to go back to the board for further approval.”</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb is that it should be revisited annually at least, but more often during times of market stress. Certainly a policy that never changes should be a thing of the past, but conversely there should be a wariness of over-analysis. One means of avoiding so-called analysis paralysis is to make accurate and timely data easily available in a format that avoids confusion.</p>
<h3 id=""sitting-on-the-dashboard-case-study"">Sitting on the dashboard: case study</h3>
<p>Harvesting and presenting information to fulfil the high level needs of the board and the broad practical requirements of treasury is a function of advanced technology. The confluence of IT and investment policy is an approach taken by Dow Corning, a global leader in silicon-based technology and innovation. Its specific focus was counterparty risk management which had, by the company’s own admission, historically fallen short of industry standards. The process had involved a considerable amount of manual monitoring, was primarily reactive versus proactive and was limited in scope: “Treasury realised that this approach was not acceptable,” says John Coon, Global Treasury Manager, Dow Corning.</p>
<p>With thoughts of protecting its $2bn-plus in cash and investments from counterparty default to the fore, in 2014 Dow Corning created a Global Cash and Investments Committee. It consisted of a cross-functional team with members from Customer Financial Services (CFS) and Treasury. The team adopted a mission statement to “ensure that the risks associated with the company’s global cash and investments are monitored and are made transparent, leading to best in class practices supporting our investment objectives as defined in the Dow Corning Corporation Investment Policy”.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it set itself a number of practical goals including the implementation of a counterparty risk limit model, and the creation of a monitoring system in which risks could be quickly identified and remedied. The result – a Treasury Today Adam Smith Award 2015 Winner – was an internally developed risk limit model capable of aiding and checking the implementation of investment policy. This uses multiple independent sources of counterparty and default risk metrics including balance sheet health at bank-parent and subsidiary levels, as well as regulatory data such as Basel III risk ratios. Aggregated data is presented via a centralised “fully-automated one-stop-shop” dashboard for treasury. It enables easy daily monitoring of financial counterparties and provides a clearly defined escalation process when credit events occur. Functionality includes limit usage by financial institution (delivering real-time monitoring with alert notifications for breaches) and breakdowns of limit usage by cash type (for example bank accounts or time deposits). In addition, it provides background credit ratings information and credit default swap (CDS) activity for all counterparties.</p>
<p>Counterparty risk management solutions tend to use one or two sources of data to monitor risk. Dow Corning has developed a comprehensive limit model using in-house quantitative measures and credit risk metrics with real-time updates to a dashboard that incorporates supplementary sources including Bloomberg and Credit Risk Monitor. Coon explains that the overall process includes a “forward-looking, scalable model” to assess counterparty risk. It gives a 40% weighting for in-house quantitative measures using bank financial statements. Short and long-term credit ratings from multiple rating agencies are given a 25% weighting. Probability of default, calculated using a third-party tool with real-time market data, has a 25% weighting. The final 10% is made up of the Dow Corning Intangible index, incorporating a scale of bank service offerings and other relationship criteria.</p>
<p>“Like any risk management solution, it is difficult to place a figure on an event that you avoided by having the necessary safeguards in place,” says Coon of the system’s value to the company. “What we can say is that our ability to rest easier at night knowing our assets are allocated appropriately is worth a lot to us.”</p>
<h3 id=""trying-something-new"">Trying something new</h3>
<p>Whilst treasury should always adhere to policy, the generally changeable state of the market requires having the flexibility to respond in a timely manner to any cash or investment issue. It is therefore Baseby’s view that companies should have an “escape valve” to use when investment for some justifiable reason cannot remain within those conditions. A treasurer may be granted power to step beyond policy in certain circumstances but usually an exception would be executed through the Finance Director, CFO or, if a major breach of policy is required, then by referral to either an internal committee of senior executives or the board.</p>
<p>Regardless of the difficulties that investing may present, dealing with lower-rated institutions and products is not inevitable in today’s low/zero return environment. “Treasurers are beginning to find other ways of achieving security,” notes Baseby. The repo (repurchase agreement) market is developing to enable short-term (usually three to six months) investors to mitigate counterparty risk by taking baskets of high quality securities (such as bonds or equities) in exchange for cash.</p>
<p>Repos are often perceived as difficult to administer by the inexperienced user: this is almost certainly criticism levelled at bi-lateral deals where a corporate must find a custodian, manage a complex contract and have valuation, settlement and variation margin capabilities. But as an antidote to such difficulties, tri-party repos are gaining ground. Here, an appointed collateral agent does most of the background work so that beyond fine-tuning the standard contract (the Global Master Repurchase Agreement or GMRA), establishing any policy restrictions and preferences, and issuing instructions to go to market, the operational involvement of the treasurer is minimised.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Indeed, Baseby’s observation is that this route into the repo market appears to be the favoured one for the corporate investor although, he adds that the agent may seek to manage a number of counterparties on behalf of its corporate client to make it worthwhile. In policy terms, this may be desirable anyway, as not only will treasurers feel more comfortable lending more to counterparties with covered cash than without, it also means they can lend against the quality of collateral, not the borrowing institution, and this in itself may generate more scope for deals.</p>
<p>This may even open up safe non-bank financial institutions as viable deposit counterparties – insurance companies and pension funds sitting on high quality securities from time to time need short-term cash. This could be a market to watch as a means of diversifying investments without degenerating credit quality. As long as there is full understanding of what is being done, and that it does not conflict with policy, then arguably any collateral is better than no collateral in risk management terms.</p>
<p>With treasurers in ever-closer engagement with the wider corporate finance function, it has placed them in the driving seat as far as preparing and acting on investment policy is concerned. An effective investment policy need not prevent a progressive approach to cash and liquidity so that it is entirely possible to reflect the dynamic landscape of regulatory reform, market volatility, and low, zero or even negative interest rates whilst providing sufficient headroom to add yet more value.</p></div>

<p>Aidan Shevlin, Managing Director, is Head of Asia Pacific Liquidity Fund Management for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Based in Hong Kong since 2005, Aidan is a member of the global liquidity fund management group and is responsible for managing all Asian liquidity funds and short duration bond funds. During his time in Asia, a key responsibility for Aidan has been the development, launch and management of local currency money market funds across the region.</p>
<p>Aidan originally joined J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s International Fixed Income group in London in 1997. In that group, Aidan had a wide range of responsibilities including managing short duration credit portfolios, European liquidity funds and Libor-based strategies. He was also previously an analyst in the fixed income quantitative research team.</p>
<p>Aidan obtained a B.A. in Banking &amp; Finance from the University of Ulster. He also holds a M.Sc. in Finance and a M.Sc. in Computer Science, both from the Queens University of Belfast. He is also a CFA charter holder.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>One of the key changes in Asia Pacific’s short-term investment landscape over recent years has been the growing internationalisation of the region’s money market fund (MMF) industry. Increasingly, the old local model is giving way to more international western-style MMFs.</p>
<p>For treasurers the timing of this development could not be more fortuitous. Cash on corporate balance sheets is continuing to pile up with repatriation taxes encouraging companies to keep liquidity in overseas subsidiaries. Traditionally, the options treasurers had for investing this surplus liquidity would have been of a very small number, limited mainly to bank deposits. But with MMFs boasting increased liquidity and size, it would appear evident that banks now have a new set of rivals competing with them for corporate cash.</p>
<h3 id=""investing-in-asia-pacific"">Investing in Asia Pacific</h3>
<p>Just how strong that competition is, however, still varies considerably across markets. Broadly, different stages of development can be classified into three tracks. In some of the smaller markets or less developed markets, there may be no MMF products at all; in other markets, meanwhile, there are a range of short-term investment products that would not be unfamiliar to treasurers who have worked in the US or Europe.</p>
<p>“When we look at Asia Pacific, we see quite developed markets in places like Australia, Japan and Singapore,” says Aidan Shevlin, Head of Asia Pacific Liquidity Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPM AM). “These are very developed economies and are large enough to support an MMF industry, especially countries like Japan and Australia, which have large populations, a huge deposit base and lots of cash in the market as well.”</p>
<p>Then at the other end of the scale there are markets like Indonesia and Malaysia, which Shevlin says are “not very sophisticated and not very developed; these are markets that are still in their infancy, effectively.” Perhaps of most interest to the corporate investor at the moment, however, are the markets Shevlin identifies as residing somewhere in between: chief among which is China. This is a market of great importance to the growth strategies of a large number of multinationals in the region, and the range of options open to the short-term investor here are growing by the day. “These are markets which are developing and growing quickly,” Shevlin says. For the treasurer, staying abreast of a perpetually evolving regulatory landscape and understanding the implications of such changes on the short-term investment landscape can be challenging, to put it mildly.</p>
<h3 id=""rise-of-the-redback-mmf"">Rise of the redback MMF</h3>
<p>How far China has come in such a short space of time is astonishing. It was just over ten years ago, in late 2004, that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) established the first set of guidelines for MMFs, effectively giving the green light for asset managers to begin offering such products to investors in the country.</p>
<p>First, equity and balance funds begun to appear, but with interest rates being held artificially low by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), there was growing investor demand for products, like MMFs, that could offer improved returns by investing in liberalised interest rates determined by market forces. Naturally, such funds, when they were established, proved very successful in attracting assets and in a very short space of time China had a budding MMF industry, albeit, at that time, one very much geared towards the retail investor.</p>
<p>It was not long before institutional MMFs arrived on the scene though. JPM AM, spotting the unmet demand for MMFs from corporates in China, began work on bringing new funds to the market for the first time but doing so was not entirely straightforward. At that time, China did not boast a AAA credit rating and, as such, an international MMF ratings framework proved excessively restrictive for Chinese markets. Collaborating with Moody’s and Fitch, JPM AM worked on developing a ratings framework based on a local scale which effectively treated China as if it were a AAA sovereign.</p>
<p>“That made sense because, naturally, if you are a multinational investor in China, you are already taking the sovereign risk so within the country itself you want to take the lowest risk possible; a T-bill or a policy bank bond, for example,” says Shevlin. “So that was what we launched: the first AAA rated MMF in China<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. For institutional investors it was a new product which they needed time to understand. Therefore the first few years were very much a training exercise for us; trying to get clients comfortable with the instruments that were in that market, what we were doing in the fund and how we were managing it.”</p>
<h3 id=""western-influence"">Western influence</h3>
<p>The ability of MMFs to circumvent China’s regulated interest rates had, then, propagated two very contrasting styles of fund. For the retail investor, there were MMFs that prioritised yield above all other investment objectives. For the institutional investor, meanwhile, the market offered AAA constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs emphasising security and liquidity.</p>
<p>Naturally, the latter have proved to be popular with treasurers investing on behalf of foreign multinationals in the country. An internationally recognised AAA rating was, of course, imperative for many such investors, given that it is commonplace for MNCs to have investment policies prohibiting deposits in unrated MMFs. Interestingly, however, institutional MMFs have been attracting a new type of client of late. “We are seeing more and more local corporates in China invest in our institutional products,” Shevlin says. “I think this is because Chinese corporates are becoming more international. The number of Chinese corporates in the last few years that have listed in the US or have shares listed in Hong Kong is growing and they need to comply with international standards. They need to be seen to be taking the best practice from different markets in how they conduct their business.” And, as any conscientious corporate investor knows, best practice is to invest company liquidity in a diversified range of investment products, of which MMFs are one.</p>
<h3 id=""levelling-the-playing-field"">Levelling the playing field</h3>
<p>Yet in a country progressing incrementally from a closed, tightly regulated economy to one more greatly exposed to the oscillations of market forces, the competitive landscape in asset management was never likely to stand still for long.</p>
<p>In June 2015, the PBoC issued a regulation that will permit financial institutions in the country to issue large-denomination certificates of deposit (CDs). The move served as yet another indication that China’s governing authorities remain serious in their intent towards doing away with controls on interest rates, with banks having been given authority just the month before to raise deposit rates to 1.5 times the benchmark rate set by the PBoC.</p>
<p>This policy is likely to have significant implications for China’s MMF sector. We have already learned how, in the beginning, the disparity between the low returns banks were able to offer on deposits versus the market-rate MMFs helped give birth to an industry in China. With the elimination of that disparity it would seem reasonable to suppose MMFs will face tougher competition from banks for corporate deposits in the years ahead.</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">

<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>“That removes the advantage we have from offering higher yields,” says Shevlin. “Also, we saw at the time of the last PBoC rate cut, they removed the ceiling on deposits beyond one year, although a ceiling currently remains in place for deposits of durations up to one year. This allows banks to compete more effectively not only with MMFs but also wealth management products and trust products for assets.”</p>
<p>But any competitive advantage the banks gain over MMFs from that policy may well be tempered by another regulatory change introduced earlier this year. In May 2015, China announced the introduction of a long-anticipated deposit insurance system. Traditionally, depositors in China have, of course, viewed all bank deposits as carrying an implicit government guarantee. Banks that have run into trouble in the past have always been able to rely on the state to stand behind them and, when necessary, provide them with an injection of capital.</p>
<p>With that implicit guarantee on deposits of any size now becoming an explicit guarantee on a mere RMB 500,000, corporate investors are likely to be more mindful of risk, something which could potentially make them think twice about taking all of their company’s liquidity out of MMFs and into bank deposits. “Investors are still trying to understand what this change means and to what extent has risk been reallocated from the government to investors. I think this is going to have a very big impact on investors’ allocation decisions as there is now the need to develop a heightened awareness of risk that was previously not required in China.”</p>
<h3 id=""guiding-the-investor"">Guiding the investor</h3>
<p>The speed of change just in China – let alone Asia Pacific at large – is indicative of the challenge keeping up-to-date and understanding the range of different short-term instruments available represents for treasurers. That is why working with an experienced asset manager – like JPM AM – that understands the environment today and how it might be shaped by regulatory change going forward is vital, especially for those corporates who are new to the region.</p>
<p>“It is often a learning exercise when corporates first arrive in the market,” says Shevlin. These companies are, of course, investing money to build up their operations, and they are earning revenues in the country. But often they are not sure how to invest the cash piling up on their balance sheets. “That is why we do spend quite a bit of time educating clients – particularly those at headquarters who are less familiar with how things work here – as to the range of products available in each given market,” he says. “We educate them on how MMFs here work and how they are different from those which operate in western markets.”</p>
<p>So what advice does Shevlin offer to such clients with respect to their investment strategies in Asia Pacific? That, he explains, is very much country-by-country dependent. In the more developed markets of Australia, Singapore, Japan (and, increasingly, China), there are a reasonable range of advanced institutional MMFs available. Those venturing into markets elsewhere in the region would be advised, however, to exercise some caution around investing in MMFs. “Elsewhere in the region MMFs tend to be very retail focused,” he says. “In these markets investors need to be wary because the goals of the funds may be very different from those of the corporate. Retail investors are very focused on yield, but for the corporate the top priorities are security and liquidity.”</p>
<p>Beyond the normal due diligence processes treasurers should be observing prior to investing their company’s liquidity, Shevlin advises that inside China in particular, special attention should be given to counterparty risk. “The linkage between the rating and the credit spread on entities in the country may not be particularly strong. It would be prudent, therefore, for corporates to also consider the opinions of western ratings agencies where they can, and even in some instances perform their own credit analysis. For some products the risk is changing very quickly,” he says. “For MMFs I think it is a case of looking through the holdings, the reports and asking whether they are comfortable with what the fund is buying.”</p>
<h3 id=""growth-potential"">Growth potential</h3>
<p>The short-term investment environment in Asia has evidently come a very long way in a very short space of time, and there is little indication that this growth is about to lose momentum in the foreseeable future.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>On the contrary, Shevlin believes that in places like China, where MMFs assets of US$2.2trn are dwarfed by the US$120trn that is estimated to be invested in time deposits, there is still plenty of growing space for the industry. And with western multinationals continuing to look to expand in the region and Asian multinationals continuing to become more international in their outlook, demand for alternative investment products like MMFs should continue to grow in other markets too. “The pace of innovation and change across Asia is actually speeding up,” Shevlin adds. “The markets are getting bigger and everyone is getting bigger within it. These are still young markets with a lot of growth potential.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h4>How would you describe the liquidity management environment for corporates at the present time?</h4>
<p>‘Challenging’ is the word most of our clients are using to describe it. In any other historical period, a negative money market environment would probably have led to the vanishing or the ‘gumming up’ of that market completely. What negative rates tend to do is take out liquidity in an extreme way and collapse flow. What’s different this time around is that we are undergoing enormous change in regulatory architecture with Basel III which is dislocating money from banks and setting money in motion. It is this new dynamic which also means that negative rates may not only be a feature of currencies with negative deposit rates and we are still discovering the new steady state for money markets in general.</p>
<h4>How are treasurers responding to these new realities? Is there a need for treasurers to evolve their investment policies in order to adjust to these new realities?</h4>
<p>We were in close dialogue with our corporate client base as the market headed into negative territory and, while it is certainly not very palatable from their perspective, there is an understanding amongst most clients that this is just where rates are at the moment.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that we are starting to see a little bit of disparity amongst our investor base in terms of the response. The responses range from those of some larger corporates, who are accepting the situation and still see capital preservation as their primary investment objective, to others that are really trying to offset the negative impact and using this as an opportunity to segregate their cash a little bit more. Then we have those who are spending more to reduce the amount of cash they are holding. It’s not a natural thing to accept dealing with a negative for your cash – whether that is your own cash or your company’s – it just doesn’t sit well. As a result, it has even prompted some of our investors to look at taking on more risk and given the volatility we currently have in the market this needs to be very carefully considered.</p>
<p>We do think that the new investment realities treasurers are now facing mean that a more flexible approach within policies, or the ability to review them more often, will be required as we go through the next couple of years. A lot of corporates currently take an annualised approach to reviewing their investment policies, but that might not be enough. They need to be having dialogue with their boards around this changing landscape and really work out what the right policy is for them. Preservation of principal should remain the priority, though, because one of our biggest concerns at the moment is that the environment is pushing investors to take on too much additional unnecessary risk.</p>
<h4>What in your view is the best strategy for corporate investors at the moment with respect to yield?</h4>
<p>Our advice to treasurers is to be very wary of stretching for yield because we think that the risk is asymmetric. Even with the ongoing support of the European Central Bank (ECB) there are many scenarios out there that could throw the market; we have seen a number of such incidents over the past year. Moreover, the volatility attached to these events may be much higher now than it has been in the past. I think conditions will get more challenging from here, not less. Therefore, from a high level perspective, investors need to understand that from here the upside to investing is much harder to achieve than the downside.</p>
<p>The yield environment has spurred some interest in other types of investment products: separately managed accounts being one example. Interest in these products is not driven purely by the desire to offset negative yield though; for many, capital preservation is still the core of that strategy. Overall, corporates are realising they need to become far better and more targeted at segmenting their cash and finding ways to make it work that little bit harder. Unfortunately, the reality of the environment we are in today is that even if you are doing that, in euros you will probably still end up with a negative yield. It is a really difficult hurdle to get over.</p>
<h4>Trading liquidity has been on a downward trajectory in recent years. What impact is this having on the short-term investment environment for corporates?</h4>
<p>The issue of liquidity is absolutely front and centre, in every sense. In recent years it has been draining away from the banks and, as asset managers, we are going to have to hunt it in new places. I think BlackRock is perfectly positioned to leverage our counterparty base and access that balance sheet which we absolutely need in order to invest in these short-term markets. On the credit side, the changing regulation regimes in each country means investors are going to have to really understand where they rank in terms of seniority: deposits and certificates of deposit (CDs) may in some countries be higher than unsecured commercial paper (CP). Treasurers absolutely need to understand the intricacies around that hierarchy.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In the current negative yield environment, the lack of liquidity is becoming especially pronounced. When the money fund peer group went negative earlier this year – we were one of the bigger providers to go negative at the beginning of April – it was interesting because not all securities were trading with the same liquidity. Government securities traded on both bid and offer. In the credit market, in CP and CDs, the bid-offer spread started to widen whilst MMFs teetered at the zero yield level. Credit was offered at negative, but not bid at negative. It was an interesting dynamic and it took the gross yield on the peer group going negative for it to change. The bid-offer spread in credit is still wider than on the sovereign side in money markets.</p>
<p>For a MMF, it means that you have got to be thinking about raising the quality of your portfolio in order to maintain liquidity without increasing your cost of trading. A negative rate environment by virtue of being inherently less liquid will tend to switch you from thinking in an active portfolio sense, to a more buy and hold stance and it is important for investors to understand this dynamic.</p>
<h4>The regulatory environment is changing in the European MMF space. How do you see the reforms agreed earlier this year by the European Commission impacting the corporate investor? Will so-called low volatility (LVNAV) funds serve as a viable option for the corporate investor who is used to using stable NAV funds?</h4>
<p>On the face of it, we think the proposed LVNAV will be more palatable for our corporate clients, it being much closer to the constant NAV (CNAV) funds many of them use today. Conceptually, it could deliver some of the key CNAV features that investors cherish such as same day liquidity, intraday liquidity and a stable net asset value. We remain somewhat sceptical, however, with respect to the detail of the regulation. How that is mapped out over the coming months will be crucial. At the moment, the proposal has a sunset clause in it, which we do not see as being particularly helpful. The technical and the operational build around creating a product that has the ability to switch to VNAV on a day’s notice is actually really complicated. It is expensive to create.</p>
<p>But if the sunset clause is not there, then where the trigger threshold is set will be the main determinant for the success of LVNAV. If that ends up at a reasonable place – and the industry is comfortable with Parliament’s proposed 20bps threshold – then this could be a really workable solution, one which will deliver some of the key features that our corporate investors like. Realistically, from an investment side, the tightness of the trigger threshold will obviously de-risk the proposition, because from a fund manager’s perspective there is no incentive to want to be hitting those thresholds, at any point, and the best way to avoid doing so is to de-risk the fund. That is effectively what will happen if the regulators impose a trigger materially south of 20bps.</p>
<p>There is still a long way to go on this debate, though. The European Parliament passed the framework for MMF regulation in April and now the next step is for the Council of Ministers to provide opinion and text. The Council is by no means bound by the Parliament’s text – the member states retain divergent views on some key issues. The Council’s review is unlikely to be completed through 2015 while the Presidency sits with Luxembourg, a strong MMF centre that may not be deemed wholly independent by the broader EU community. The Council Presidency will pass to the Netherlands in January 2016 and we anticipate the MMF regulatory debate to gather pace around that time. Only upon the Council completing their review can the Trilogue process begin, through which the Commission, Parliament and Council will agree on the final text. Throughout the next steps in the process much of the technical detail behind the framework will be resolved and an implementation timeframe agreed. As such it could be that we are at least two years away from anything happening.</p>
<h4>How do you the see investment market developing for the corporate treasurer in the coming months and years?</h4>
<p>One trend that we are already seeing a lot of in the post-Basel III environment is an increase in structured paper being offered. We are seeing more structured repo; more term repo; and we are seeing a lot more structured CP being offered. That’s existed in the past, of course, but there is more of it being issued.</p>
<p>Banks are looking for new and innovative ways of financing trade receivables for their high quality corporates too, which is also a form of structured product financing. But the thing with all of these structures is that they inherently have no liquidity attached to them. That means they can be a part of the solution, but they may not be an entire solution.</p>
<p>Corporates have been talking more about the different products they can access and, certainly with the larger corporates, looking closely at things like repo. We think that can work for some of our client base, but again, it all comes down to the ability to access liquidity. Corporates need to have a large amount of counterparties set-up, and need to take a flexible approach to the collateral that is accepted. They also need to be more flexible with respect to duration, operating in that favourable space for the banks that tends to be over the 90-day mark. Ultimately, the market is moving towards more of a ‘buy and hold’ stance. That means the credit piece is becoming an even more crucial part of the corporate investors’ strategy. Corporates will need to allocate more resources towards credit and those who do not have them should think about outsourcing to an investment manager with extensive resources and a highly disciplined process involving credit, risk and portfolio management (<a href=""#chart-1"">see Chart 1</a>).</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Across the globe, the cash and liquidity landscape is changing. Once the dust settles from the extensive regulatory and market changes currently being witnessed, what will the new short-term investment world look like for the corporate treasurer?</em></p>
<p>Auna Dunlevy has been pondering the investment climate a lot of late. In just the past several years, the Head of Front Office at Royal Mail has witnessed euro rates dive into negative territory, banks becoming more selective around deposits, and regulatory upheaval within asset management that looks increasingly likely to eliminate one of her department’s preferred short-term investment vehicles, the euro CNAV money market fund (MMF).</p>
<p>Such has been the epochal scale of change in the European cash management landscape that treasurers like Dunlevy have had little choice but to almost go completely back to the drawing board (and many, indeed, to the corporate board) with respect to investment strategies. “Where possible we’ve tried to remove the ‘security blanket’ of overnight cash,” she explained to delegates at the Association of Treasurers Annual Conference 2015 in Manchester earlier this year. For what Dunlevy and her colleagues define as ‘primary liquidity’ the traditional investment prerogatives – security, then liquidity, then yield – remain the order of the day. Notwithstanding, treasury has worked hard to negotiate lower fees or higher rates on overnight deposits, leveraging where necessary relationships that banks have with the company’s pension department. But for secondary liquidity, yield is sought over liquidity in some cases.</p>
<p>“In order to maximise the duration of funds falling into this category, we make the decision as early in our cash flow cycle as possible,” she says. “We need to evaluate what the banks offer, check that it fits with our policy and make sure we understand the products. I’m not talking about anything fancy here – it is usually notice accounts or extendables but the fact is that every product is slightly different and they do change from bank to bank.”</p>
<p>Similar strategy discussions will have been taking place in corporate treasury departments across the globe, and especially within those that operate within the Eurozone. It is not just that the investment environment has become a much more challenging one in recent years, it is also that corporates, on aggregate, have much more to invest now than ever before. Companies have become increasingly accustomed to ultra-low borrowing costs (the other side of the low rate coin) and as they tapped the bond markets for record amounts the cash on balance sheets has swelled. Take as evidence the annual S&amp;P Global Corporate Capex Survey, which tracks the top 2,000 global companies that spend the most on capital expenditure. The survey revealed, when it was published in August 2015, that companies are now holding some $4.4trn of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>“Liquidity management is certainly a bigger activity for the typical corporate treasurer,” says Nick Burge, Managing Director, Head of Strategic Liquidity at Lloyds Bank. “Some of them are making the migration from managing a bit of cash on the side to an operation equivalent to a medium-sized asset business. So that will mean looking across a much broader range of products, different risk matrices, different maturity profiles; it’s all becoming about trying to get some return while still meeting that liquidity requirement.”</p>
<h3 id=""heading-east"">Heading East</h3>
<p>It is not just corporates in western markets that are facing investment challenges though. With the notable exception of Japan, treasurers in Asia Pacific have largely been spared the same ultra-low rates investment predicament facing their peers in the US and Europe. Nevertheless, central banks across the region now appear to be in a race to cut rates quickly in order to starve off the economic malaise now beginning to take hold in the region.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2015 a number of Asia Pacific’s major economies – China, India, South Korea, Australia, and Thailand – have reduced short-term policy rates to varying degrees. “In the emerging markets, we do see in our footprint a slight decline away from those double-digit interest rates there have been in the past to, depending on the market, between 7 – 10%,” Vanessa Manning, Head of Product Management, Transaction Banking, Europe, Standard Chartered told Treasury Today.</p>
<p>With corporates in the Asia Pacific sitting on more idle cash – an average of $4.2bn each according to S&amp;P – this is news that treasurers in the region probably do not want to hear. Although the risk to preservation of principal for the time being (especially against the current deflationary backdrop) is arguably minimal, a new corporate investment dynamic is beginning to emerge all the same. “That is why, across the regulated markets especially, we are seeing a growing range of interest optimisation solutions for short term operating cash balances where you have a range of EM currencies building up and difficulty in repatriation – your bank will provide a notional aggregation of those, providing both a local arms length return with additional incentive on top of the worth of those currencies and offer you interest based on those,” says Manning.</p>
<p>This is all a part of the treasury efficiency story for multinationals operating in emerging markets and it is, in some respects, a necessary step for corporates that wish to improve their returns while continuing to comply with their own governance and compliance polices. By working with a single bank across a region like Africa or ASEAN and using such interest optimising solutions, corporates can secure a safe enhanced return on operating cash, without needing to move into potentially riskier and less liquid structured products.</p>
<p>The changing rate environment in Asia is also giving a lift to a number of nascent MMF markets across the region. “Malaysia, and Indonesia especially, have rapidly growing MMF sectors,” Manning adds. “We are seeing more and more funds setting up in Indonesia and taking advantage of both the surplus of investment going into that market and the requirement for funds as an alternative investment product.”</p>
<h3 id=""demise-of-deposits"">Demise of deposits?</h3>
<p>The imperative to consider other types of investment product is not just being driven by the yield environment, however; several other factors are also at play here. First is the deterioration in the credit quality of many banking institutions witnessed post-crisis. Many investment-grade corporates are surveying the banking landscape and noting that a significant number of their banking counterparties are now deemed less creditworthy than they themselves are by the ratings agencies. And outlooks are tending more towards the negative than the stable.</p>
<p>“I’m moving away from investing in traditional bank deposits because with the reduced liquidity and the risk that a credit rating agency may change a view on a rating of a bank,” Asim Iqbal, Head of Treasury at British motoring association, the AA, said at the ACT Annual Conference 2015. “That would be putting me at risk of breaching my own treasury policy.”</p>
<p>Even in instances where the treasurer decides that the safest place for their cash is with one or more of their banks, they may find certain types of deposits are no longer welcomed. The beginning of 2015 marked the introduction of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under Basel III, designed to ensure that banks have sufficient assets on hand to withstand any liquidity crunch the market might throw at them. Prudent though that requirement may be, given everything that unfolded back in 2008, there is little doubt that it will impact the value of cash. Operational deposits are continuing to be sought after, but taking non-operational deposits, which have been assigned a higher run-off rate due to their perception as being less stable, is becoming far less attractive for banks under the new rules.</p>
<p>But those prophesying the imminent demise of bank deposits as a corporate investment vehicle might be jumping the gun a little. In fact, if a shift is indeed under way it appears, in the US at least, to be going in the opposite direction. To understand why, one would be advised to take a look at the 2015 Association of Financial Professionals (AFP) Liquidity Survey, which looked at what American corporates are doing with all that unused firepower accumulating on their balance sheets. The report notes that, in 2008, treasurers were keeping approximately half of their short-term liquidity in the capital markets, by way of MMFs, treasury bills and other such instruments. Around one-fifth, meanwhile was being stored in traditional bank deposits. Now we are seeing the reverse. Today, MMFs are storing a mere 15% of short-term cash, while 56% of is being placed into bank deposits.</p>
<p>That may well be a reflection of the fact that treasurers are now finally beginning to feel more confident about the health of US banks (in contrast to the picture in Europe) and that, in the current yield environment it is becoming extremely difficult to get any return on capital markets instruments. It may also be a manifestation of the growing concerns that treasurers have around the changing regulatory environment around the capital markets and, the reforms that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have introduced in the MMF space in particular. Either way, it would seem that a majority of corporates, having explored a variety of investment solutions, simply cannot find any better alternatives.</p>
<p>Recent talk around tri-party repos is a case in point. Superficially, at least, they look like a great alternative to bank deposits in the current environment. At a time when banks are not as safe as they once seemed, tri-party repos offer security. In markets where interest rates are flat or have minus signs next to them, tri-party repos are claimed to offer the rare prospect of some return. Indeed, tri-party repos would seem so advantageous for corporate investors in this current investment environment, greater direct participation from treasurers in this market would seem like a natural development.</p>
<p>Yet while some corporate treasurers have indeed begun experimenting with the tri-party repo, enthusiasm for the product within the profession has not quite been universal. “I have looked at repos but I have decided at the moment the time and cost in setting up a repo is quite significant,” says The AA’s Iqbal. “And from conversations I’ve had with other treasurers, I understand that the returns being offered by a repo might not be any more than that of a MMF deposit. So the question of tri-party repos is still out there for me.”</p>
<h3 id=""bracing-for-vnav"">Bracing for VNAV</h3>
<p>Although some treasurers like Iqbal might currently see no yield incentive to choose a tri-party repo over a MMF investment, there may soon, like in the US, be a regulatory one (at least for those who staunchly favour prime CNAV euro MMFs as a home for their short-term liquidity).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the European Commission (EC) announced new regulations for the industry, which, once formally approved over the course of the next year will reshape the investment environment for corporates in Europe quite radically. Rather than impose a mandatory VNAV for prime institutional CNAV MMFs without delay, as the US has opted to do, the EC has agreed (still subject to approval from the Council of Ministers) to allow for a so-called Low Volatility (LVNAV) money fund product to operate for a five year interim period.</p>
<p>Treasurers with a view to the long term have, however, have grasped the fact that – LVNAV or otherwise – prime CNAV MMFs now have a death sentence hanging over them and are beginning to consider how their investment strategies might have to adapt in the coming years as a result. Unlike in the US, the persistently poor health of the European banking sector would appear to rule out a return, en-masse, to traditional deposits. Some treasurers, like the Royal Mail’s Delaney, believe there is little sense in delaying the inevitable.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the thing we spent longest thinking about is CNAV MMFs,” she says. Unlike some of its corporate peers, Royal Mail’s board policy already covered VNAV funds. But treasury, being very comfortable with the CNAV funds they had used since the early 2000s, had always shied away from VNAV products. As the policy direction at the European-level became apparent, however, the department decided it was time to revisit the products.</p></div>

<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>The way they approached this task should serve as a useful best practice guide for other treasurers, many of whom are likely to have similar decisions to make in the coming years. “We looked at the volatility of VNAV and also the underlying volatility of CNAV funds,” she explains. “We considered the duration of which we could invest our funds. Then we considered some historical examples and, of course, checked out the accounting and spoke to some other corporates before we made the decision to invest.”</p>
<p>Many treasurers who, like Delaney, have gone through this process, have been pleasantly surprised by the muted volatility and general stability of the funds (Aviva Investors, which converted its daily sterling liquidity fund to VNAV seven years ago told Treasury Today in May 2015 that since its inception the valuation has never moved away from one). But a careful approach is nevertheless advisable, as it would be for any new instruments, and at Royal Mail investment limits are, for the time, at a lower level than for a corresponding CNAV fund.</p>
<h3 id=""tomorrows-world"">Tomorrow’s world</h3>
<p>Once the dust finally settles from regulatory and market adjustments of recent years the corporate treasurer is likely to see an investment world that has changed considerably, in some jurisdictions, perhaps beyond all recognition.</p>
<p>Caution, though, should be the name of the game for corporate treasurers right now. Many treasurers will feel obliged, in this new world, to experiment with new investment products and services, different durations and new cash segmentation strategies, as the insights offered by Delaney and Iqbal testify. But the prudent thing for treasurers to do would be to take their time. Only once each new product and strategy has been carefully considered and they have worked out what is the suitable to them, will the time be right to gradually implement the changes which need to be made.</p></div>

<p><em>Centralisation, automation and cost reduction remain the major trends when it comes to structuring the treasury function. With many companies intensifying efforts towards all of the above, it is pertinent to reacquaint ourselves with the basics of treasury models, asking the question ‘does full centralisation really suit every business’?</em></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>It is no secret that since the financial crisis, treasurers increasingly want to know where the company’s cash is and how quickly they can access it. Treasury Today’s Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study 2014 found that cash management and cash pooling structures are within the top three priorities for corporate treasurers. Moreover, addressing cash flow forecasting and improving visibility over the company’s cash comprised two of the top technology issues – the study concluded that on these points, there is still room to improve.</p>
<p>But what impact do these concerns have on treasury models? Certainly, emphasis on visibility and control is considered one of the drivers behind intensifying interest in centralisation. Moreover, technological advances have made it easier and cheaper to centralise. Technology is no longer the preserve of large corporates.</p>
<p>Operating a centralised structure is not always straightforward however and, as every business has individual requirements, it is important to determine (and periodically re-evaluate) the degree to which centralisation is beneficial and practical from a specific company’s perspective.</p>
<h3 id=""levels-of-centralisation"">Levels of centralisation</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three levels of treasury structure: decentralised, partially centralised and fully centralised. Although full centralisation may be the ultimate goal for most multinational corporations, many companies end up with a partial or decentralised structure simply because it is too impractical for them to operate in any other way. It is to these two that we first turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Decentralised.</h5>
<p>Treasury policy-making, decisions and activities are conducted by individual subsidiaries. Typically, only a small team is retained at group level to provide advice and support. Subsidiaries may have their own local banking arrangements, will organise their own funding and handle cash management (including short-term borrowing and investments) locally. Payments to and from the parent company will still occur.
    </p>
<p>Decentralised structures work well when the subsidiaries are independent and autonomous units with limited complimentary needs. Local treasury units’ enhanced local operational knowledge and risk awareness is advantageous – especially when the business needs to adapt to unexpected events. However, they face issues with limited automation (no central processes), and potentially lack the leverage or ability to offset surplus cash positions against borrowings elsewhere, among other potential problems of multiplying, rather than minimising, efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Partially centralised.</h5>
<p>Arguably a ‘best of both worlds’ approach, a partially centralised model usually involves individual subsidiaries following the treasury policy as outlined by group treasury – often they will also receive advice or instruction. Individual subsidiaries, however, will be responsible for executing deals themselves via their local banking partners. Back office operations may be undertaken at a local level or they may be centralised. Partial centralisation delivers more control while enabling subsidiaries to maintain a degree of autonomy within the front office function. It can also help to increase uniformity in treasury policies and procedures across the group and allows key decisions to be made at a global level with a comprehensive view of cash flow – whilst also retaining local expertise.</p>
<p>A common approach to partial centralisation is the regional model. With treasurers rethinking their approach to banking and funding since the financial crisis, the one-bank approach is no longer seen as a viable option. So, with treasurers giving more consideration to regional banking relationships, a regional treasury model is also being mooted as an equally prudent option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Fully centralised.</h5>
<p>With a fully centralised structure, a global treasury centre or regional centres (on behalf of subsidiaries across a specific region or across the group) will undertake policy-making decisions and most, if not all, banking and financial activities. These centres may offer 24-hour services to ensure round-the-clock coverage for all subsidiaries. The organisation of centralised treasury is increasingly built around two objectives – debt capital and risk management – with the aim to source and secure a strong cash flow by placing key decisions at the centre.</p>
<p>Centralisation ensures group treasury has standardised operations, greater control across the company with streamlined bank accounts and improved transparency of cash flow. The natural hedge created by matching of financial positions can also result in better margins. Moreover, the concentration of knowledge and experience typically leads to improved results with fewer people and a reduced risk of error.</p>
<p>Costs are also likely to reduce – if basic processes of payments and collections are centralised, the cost of those processes decreases: it is a simple economy of scale. Centralisation can, however, lead to a lack of local banking expertise and a loss of responsibility may lead to either (or both) a lack of interest and resistance at the local level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""centralisation-developments"">Centralisation developments</h3>
<p>Technological advances have been making it easier to centralise treasury operations, lifting both practical and financial barriers. Technology has come to be seen as a key enabler in the implementation of treasury centres and integrating company platforms with those provided by the company’s banking partners, therefore, a key success factor. Furthermore, some regulatory initiatives favour the adoption of centralised treasury structures. The persistence of general economic and geopolitical uncertainty means more corporates with global operations are looking at streamlining their treasury management into full centralisation.</p>
<p>The advent of cloud computing is also opening up new possibilities for treasury centre locations. Access to data sources and solutions in the cloud means that it increasingly doesn’t matter where the treasury centre is situated. This development means that labour costs have emerged as one of the primary factors in determining location.</p>
<p>Of course, labour costs shouldn’t be treated as the sole arbiter of location. Technology and communications infrastructure, time zone considerations, political stability and the local regulatory environment, should all be considered as part of the selection process.</p>
<h3 id=""issues-for-consideration"">Issues for consideration</h3>
<p>However, it certainly isn’t a case of one size fits all. Some responsibilities of the treasury department can benefit more obviously from centralisation – increased visibility of information, for example. Centralised information enables a business to ‘think globally and act locally’ ensuring sound management and the ability to prevent problems from a comprehensive group view – without having to compromise people on the ground managing both local risks and local opportunities.</p>
<p>Whilst other areas of focus consistently offer savings when centralised (for example payment processes), in some instances companies must question whether the process involved would be handled better locally. Certain commodities hedging or transactions requiring reporting to central banks provide two examples.</p>
<p>When deciding on a treasury model to operate, the following points outline some issues to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cost and cost saving.</h5>
<p>The financial implications of initial expenditure and ongoing costs must be weighed against the benefits and potential savings for each model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Group-wide support.</h5>
<p>The chosen model must gain full support at management and board level; the understanding from employees at both group and subsidiary levels is also required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Legal, regulatory and tax implications.</h5>
<p>The significance of changing structures and establishing centres in different regional locations (with potentially different tax, regulatory and legal requirements) should be investigated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>External relationships.</h5>
<p>Relationships with any banks and vendors impacted by any changes should be managed well – this involves negotiating advantageous terms and handling the declaration of any loss of business appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Technology.</h5>
<p>What steps are required to progress to the desired system infrastructure? Of consideration here is whether legacy systems are able to migrate or integrate – this could have an impact on costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Operational aspects.</h5>
<p>Any transition procedures, project management and staffing issues should be addressed with minimal adverse impact on daily treasury activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""the-treasury-centre"">The treasury centre</h3>
<p>Where a centralised structure is chosen, a treasury centre will be encountered. These are centralised treasury management functions, legally structured as a separate group entity or branch. Treasury centres are normally located in a tax-efficient environment, reducing the bill on transactions and profits associated with the entity. Also of importance is the location’s possession of highly developed banking infrastructure and a wealth of financial services expertise. Moreover, technology and communications infrastructure, time zones, political stability and local regulatory environments should all be considered when choosing where to locate a treasury centre.</p>
<p>A treasury centre will provide financial management and transactions services for the other group entities including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internal and external payment services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asset management services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial markets research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring and financing capital requirements of group companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management analysis and monitoring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to be aware that the capabilities and activities of a treasury centre are defined by each individual case. In some instances, responsibilities may be best managed locally as not all countries where group companies are located will necessarily permit the concentration of all treasury centre activities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, operating with a centralised treasury can lead to numerous improvements, including: governance improvements (co-ordinated and central database, group-wide reporting, standardised procedures), cost reductions (higher volumes and fewer transactions, reduced financing requirements) and efficient tax management (optimising global tax position).</p>

<h3 id=""finding-the-right-spot-treasury-centres-in-asia"">Finding the right spot: treasury centres in Asia</h3>
<p>As more and more corporates centralise their operations and look to establish a treasury centre in Asia, the big question is which location is best? For many corporates the choice is between the region’s two key finance centres: Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Singapore is currently the dominant treasury centre location in the region. The country offers a business-friendly environment, deep and well-educated talent pool, and best-in-class infrastructure which has seen it become the regional hub for many multinationals. In addition to this Singapore has a liberal regulatory environment, an excellent sovereign credit rating, a deep and liquid FX market and a legal system based on English common law. The city’s status as a financial centre also allows treasurers access to best-in-class banking services.</p>
<p>On top of this, Singapore offers corporates a strong incentive package to locate their treasury centres in the city in the shape of its Finance and Treasury Centre (FTC) award. Qualifying corporates receive a concessionary tax rate of 10% on all fee income received from treasury activities and an exemption from withholding tax on interest payments.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, the regions second key treasury centre location, is popular with companies that have a significant presence in China. On the whole it offers a similar proposition to Singapore with a business-friendly environment, legal system based on English common law, liberal and well-developed regulatory framework, deep, well-educated, international talent pool and excellent infrastructure. Corporates in Hong Kong also have access to a wide range of banking services and a well-developed RMB market.</p>
<p>One area where Hong Kong has lagged behind Singapore is in its tax incentive programme. But recent developments have looked to change this and address the tax imbalance which put some corporates off operating in the territory. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority have proposed that tax payments on intercompany loans will no longer be larger than profit earned – thus bringing the territory’s incentive package in line with Singapore.</p>
<p>Although Singapore and Hong Kong are currently dominant, there are other locations in the region such as Shanghai, Malaysia and Thailand which are all also looking to get a slice of the treasury centre pie. Currently, Shanghai is offering the strongest proposition and its attractiveness is growing as China further liberalises and the country becomes more critical to businesses. But, it remains to be seen if these locations will attract enough corporates to challenge Hong Kong and especially Singapore as the region’s dominant locations.</p>

<h4 id=""the-organisational-structure-of-a-treasury-centre"">The organisational structure of a treasury centre</h4>
<p>Depending on the group’s management philosophy, the treasury centre has a choice of two models to adopt:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The treasury centre acts as central agent, operating all financial transactions for the group companies in their name, compensated on a cost plus basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treasury centre acts as the group’s central in-house clearing bank, either on a shared service centre basis (which means that the group entities have direct relations with the treasury centre) or in competition with third-party banks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both models centralise the treasury know-how of the group. In addition, the in-house bank (IHB) operates the group’s financial management as its own business. Cost savings, as well as additional income earned, arise at treasury centre level.</p>
<p>If a treasury centre is organised according to an IHB model and is competing with other third-party banks, it will usually operate as a profit centre. The group companies’ financial needs are met on a price level applicable to a third party.</p>
<p>The question of whether a treasury centre operates as a cost, service or profit centre has a direct impact on where the treasury centre is located. Indeed, a treasury centre acting as a profit centre has a clear advantage if operating in a low tax jurisdiction.</p>
<h3 id=""in-house-banking-structures"">In-house banking structures</h3>
<p>IHB structures are typically established by medium-sized businesses upwards. An IHB acts as the main provider of bank services to all group subsidiaries. This may be established on a global scale or on a regional basis. Instead of using local external bank partners, each subsidiary channels its cash flows through bank accounts held at the IHB. The bank then nets out the resultant debit and credit balances across the group. The IHB may also use a netting process for foreign exchange (FX), as well as for the payable and receivable amounts owed between the subsidiaries.</p>
<p>It can be noted too that the IHB may organise inter-subsidiary lending. When all the internal transactions have taken place, any remaining investment, financing and hedging needs are fulfilled by external banks chosen by the IHB from its preferred group of relationships. Some multinationals have restructured their inter-company loans to repatriate cash and achieve tax efficiency. In the US, for example, there are strict ‘arms-length’ rules on interest charges which, according to Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y), “should reflect the interest rates on loans between unrelated parties with similar terms, including duration and credit standing of the borrower.”</p>
<p>However, as an example of what can be achieved through such a structure and practice, Toyota Financial Services (TFS), the finance and insurance brand for Toyota in the US, built an inter-company lending facility for global affiliates and achieved a $25m saving through reduced interest expense alone.</p>
<p>Centralised treasuries may operate an IHB within their overall model. However, an IHB can also be used to enhance operations whilst keeping a decentralised structure.</p></div>

<p>2013-2014 was one of the most challenging periods in recent memory for the Indian economy, but it was one of the most profitable for Indian conglomerate Larsen &amp; Toubro. Driven by its investment philosophy and an acute understanding of the country’s political and economic standing the treasury was able to generate an alpha of approximately 2.5% on investments worth US$1 billion. An increase from the two previous years when markets in emerging economies, such as India, were relatively calmer.</p>
<p>So while we all know that the corporate treasury must have one eye at all times on the political and economic landscape of those countries in which it has operations, do treasurers know how to use information proactively as well as reactively? In this webinar we hear how Larsen &amp; Toubro did exactly this and proactively analysed the political and economic landscape. Using this information to reinforce its short-term investment philosophy and make informed decisions that saw it outperform its expected rate of return and largely avoid any adverse impact from the turbulence affecting the Indian economy.</p>

<p>The concept of international convergence of accounting standards first arose in the late 1950s in response to post World War II economic integration and related increases in cross-border capital flows. Indeed, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have been working together to improve and converge US generally accepted accounting principles – also known as GAAP – and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) since 2002.</p>
<p>Impetus for convergence in Asia has grown since 2013 when Japan and China started working to converge their standards with IFRS. A table detailing the application of International Financial Reporting Standards across Asian-Oceanian Standard-Setters Group (AOSSG) member jurisdictions updated in March 2015 shows that the standards are required for all domestic listed companies in 15 of the 25 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Audit reports state compliance with IFRS in 14 jurisdictions, although there are some discrepancies between these two groups. For example, Cambodian International Financial Reporting Standards are mandatory for entities that are required to submit their financial statements for audit and have ‘public accountability’, while Nepal Financial Reporting Standards are being implemented for listed companies and government-owned business entities over a three year period starting in 2014. India, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam and Uzbekistan are in the process of converging with IFRS – a process that has been completed in China.</p>
<p>Richard Martin, Head of Corporate Reporting at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), observes that while IFRS is the key standard that will be affecting corporates in Asia, some elements will be more important than others. “The accounting standards for financial instruments tend to be among the most problematic for many companies – currently IAS 39, IAS 32 and IFRS 7 on disclosures. Corporates (and of course banks, insurers and those with treasury operations) are now gearing up for the new standard IFRS 9.”</p>
<p>Most corporates, according to Martin, are also planning the implementation of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which deals with revenue recognition – clearly fundamental as it affects the most quoted number in the accounts. Ian Mackintosh, Vice Chairman of the IASB agrees, adding that when getting ready for the revamped IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 standards, companies “have to invest time in understanding the new requirements and creating an implementation plan and there may be a need for system changes, new ways of gathering data and training of staff. It is important that companies engage with their stakeholders throughout the process, ensuring shareholders in particular are kept informed about what changes they are anticipating so there are no surprises.”</p>
<h3 id=""country-specific-issues"">Country-specific issues</h3>
<p>Specific countries may face challenges linked to certain standards as they transition to IFRS and these challenges can differ from country to country, adds Mackintosh. “IFRS is principles-based and as such aims to accommodate local variations in culture, practice and law. In the long run, we believe the benefits of principles-based standards are greater than more rules-based standards.”</p>
<p>Here, Mohini Singh, Director of Financial Reporting Policy at the CFA Institute, highlights some specific differences in IFRS adoption across Singapore, India, China and Japan. Singapore has adopted all effective IFRS (except for IFRIC 2 Members’ Shares in Co-operative Entities and Similar Instruments) and has made several modifications primarily to transition provisions and effective dates of the IFRS that it has adopted. Accordingly, the standards, known as Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS), are largely aligned with IFRS.</p>
<p>Under the Singapore Companies Act, Singapore incorporated companies (both listed and non-listed) are required to use accounting standards as prescribed by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council (ASC) in their consolidated and separate financial statements.</p>
<p>In India, the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has released a revised roadmap for the adoption of Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), which are largely converged with IFRS. In April 2014, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) publicly released a summary of its recommendations to the MCA on the timetable for the adoption of Ind AS, which proposed that listed and large entities should mandatorily apply the new standards in consolidated financial statements for accounting periods beginning on or after 1<sup>st</sup> April 2016.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the MCA has now released a revised roadmap that has been drawn up after what it describes as ‘wide consultations with various stakeholders and regulators’. In essence, companies with a net worth of Rs. 500 crore or more (approximately $80bn) will have to mandatorily follow Ind AS from 1<sup>st</sup> April 2016. Corporates that have a net worth of less than Rs. 500 crore but are listed, or in the process of getting listed and companies with a net worth of Rs. 250 crore or more will have to follow the new norms from 1<sup>st</sup> April 2017.</p>
<h3 id=""convergence-appeal"">Convergence appeal</h3>
<p>The adoption of Ind AS is expected to attract significant foreign investment into India. Yet, despite wide acceptance of the international financial integration benefits, few domestic companies have implemented operational plans for the change to date – owing to transitional costs, compliance burdens and/or pending evaluations. Singh points out that the new roadmap exempts banking, insurance and non-banking finance companies. The roadmap for financial institutions and insurance companies is being determined in a separate process, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).</p>
<p>The impact of convergence with IFRS will be significant for banks in India in areas such as loan loss provisioning, financial instruments and derivative accounting. This is likely to have a large impact on financial position and financial performance, directly affecting parameters like capital adequacy ratios.</p>
<p>In China, the use of IFRS is not permitted for domestic companies. All Chinese companies whose securities trade in a public market in the country are required to use Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBEs) for financial reporting within mainland China. These are substantially converged with IFRS. It should be noted, however, that Chinese companies whose securities trade on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong may choose among IFRS, Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) and Chinese Accounting Standards (ASBEs) for purposes of financial reporting to Hong Kong investors.</p>
<p>Voluntary application of IFRS for consolidated financial statements by companies in Japan that meet certain criteria has been permitted since March 2010. As of February 2015, 65 listed companies had either started to use IFRS or had publicly announced their intention to use IFRS as a basis for preparing consolidated financial statements as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA).</p>
<h3 id=""regional-disparity"">Regional disparity</h3>
<p>Despite progress towards IFRS convergence, key accounting and reporting issues affecting corporates in Asia still vary significantly by jurisdiction explains Singh. “For example, in India the adoption of Ind AS will largely impact revenue recognition and financial instruments, while fixed assets will present practical difficulties.”</p>
<p>Key accounting areas that need to be viewed with a healthy dose of scepticism in China are revenue recognition, inventory and cash, he continues. “There is a proposed new foreign investment law, which appears to change the way China will look at variable interest entities, focusing on who actually controls the entity versus who is the owner of record. That could create problems for many variable interest entities structures that would be found to have prohibited foreign investment.”</p>
<p>In Korea, the key accounting issue relates to party transactions, Singh explains. “The primary reason for intra-group manipulations – such as cross debt guarantee practices and intra-group transactions – is to arbitrarily relocate profits and expand their external size.” International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC1) establishes a firm’s responsibility to set up and maintain a system of quality control for all audit and assurance engagements. Major Asian economies have largely either adopted or are committed to adopting ISQC 1, says Fayez Choudhury, CEO of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).</p>
<p>“In addition, members of the Forum of Firms – who audit the vast majority of public companies globally and in Asia – commit to apply ISQC 1 across their networks. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) has a project under way on the topic of quality control, in particular to consider inspection findings and implementation challenges that have been identified and may find it necessary to revise ISQC 1 as a result of these deliberations. Jurisdictional regulators/professional accountancy organisations across Asia monitor the application of the requirements in their oversight programmes and national auditing standard setters and professional accountancy organisations may also develop guidance to assist in the effective implementation of ISQC 1.”</p>
<h3 id=""regional-disparity"">Integrated reporting</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, the ACCA’s Martin says there is significant interest from Asian companies in both integrated reporting and sustainability reporting and that some are already doing it – albeit at a lower level than in Europe or Australasia. “We see this as likely to be of increasing significance in the future. In 2013, we conducted an integrated reporting roundtable in Malaysia. The main finding from this event was the view that integrated reporting will improve communication about company value, as well as playing a vital role in increasing transparency.”</p>
<p>Choudhury describes the uptake of integrated reporting and sustainability reporting as variable, while acknowledging that a number of Asian jurisdictions and companies have clearly led in implementing and promoting enhanced corporate reporting such as sustainability reports under the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and integrated reporting. The chairman of the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) has described integrated reporting as a significant innovation and “the future of corporate reporting”. A market-led steering committee has been created to move from concept to execution, with committee members including the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA), the Singapore Institute of Directors and Singapore Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Japan Investor Relations Association estimates that around 130 Japanese businesses are practising integrated reporting currently. Professor Kitagawa from the Graduate School of International Management at Aoyama Gakuin University believes that between 300 and 400 Japanese businesses will adopt it over the next two reporting cycles.</p>
<p>One of the proposals in the national growth strategy revealed by Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in June 2014 is the establishment of a platform consisting of investors, business and interested bodies for the purpose of discussions on the future of corporate reporting and how to promote constructive dialogues between business and investors. Integrated reporting is referred to in the ‘future of corporate reporting’ agenda.</p>
<p>In India, the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) has created a multi-stakeholder integrated reporting lab through collaboration with the Confederation of Indian industry (CII). Designed to facilitate knowledge sharing, it is chaired by Koushik Chatterjee, CFO of Tata Steel, and includes CFOs of leading Indian companies, academics and regulators. Following the launch of the initiative in August 2014, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) requested an industry-led roadmap setting out the plan for business adoption of integrated reporting over the next decade.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Securities Commission has embedded integrated reporting within its capital markets plan, which has a strategic focus on inclusiveness. Integrated reporting is seen as an essential part of the infrastructure underpinning this strategy and the Malaysian Securities Commission is encouraging businesses to adopt the framework.</p>
<h3 id=""following-the-lead"">Following the lead?</h3>
<p>The OECD is pushing the Common Reporting Standard as a key component of its single global standard for exchange of financial information. According to Choudhury, several Asian countries have committed to implementing the Common Reporting Standard by 2018, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. “A primary concern around the standard is how the associated compliance burden and technical capacity can be addressed in developing countries. This is as much a concern in Asia as it is in the rest of the world and will really only be resolved with the experience of implementation.”</p>
<p>On the subject of compliance burdens, Singapore and Hong Kong have extremely well run regulatory and compliance systems in place and make an effort to be transparent and help local companies do the same explains Chris Devonshire-Ellis, Managing Partner at Asia Dezan Shira &amp; Associates. “Others, such as India are difficult to understand and vary so much within the country that it can be nearly impossible to fully understand the system from both the regulatory and compliance viewpoints. China meanwhile continues to treat local companies (and especially state owned enterprises) in a different fashion to foreign investors, despite both having to abide by the same rules.</p>
<p>“Other emerging countries are still developing both their regulatory platform and their monitoring of it, so it is a moving target. But by and large, General Anti-Avoidance Act (GAAR) is a good benchmark and is used by most internationally minded companies as a standard to refer to when things become uncertain.” While internationally minded businesses refer to IFRS as an operating standard, locally focused businesses may not as it could be more advantageous for them to take advantage of the more lax local arrangements, he continues.</p>
<p>Devonshire-Ellis refers to similar inconsistency around integrated reporting and sustainability reporting. “The majority of Asian firms remain small and although they may have relationships with other practices, such as Singapore practices with other firms in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, very few have actually reached out to establish and invest in their own subsidiaries in other Asian countries. There are very few firms that have a viable Asian-wide presence and can integrate financial reporting.”</p>
<p>The OECD, he says, is viewed in Asia as an organisation with roots in international trade development. Accordingly initiatives promoted by it – and others – tend to be recognised, in the main, by businesses that are operating across borders, which by definition means larger companies. “At a local level, throughout the region, businesses will not be so aware and currently have little opportunity or reason to improve upon that until they start to gain a more international awareness,” he concludes.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Whether you’re looking for new services and banking partners or updating current systems, a Request for Proposal (RFP) is a core stage in any tendering process. In this article, we look at the building blocks behind drafting, issuing and analysing a best-in-class RFP.</em></p>
<p>In the world of corporate treasury, there are few ‘one-size-fits-all’ solutions. When looking to implement or update a particular element of the treasury set-up, be it a multi-currency pooling structure or a Treasury Management System (TMS), a choice will need to be made concerning which solution is selected and from whom.</p>
<p>A well-managed request for proposal (RFP) can therefore be an invaluable tool available to the treasurer that – if used correctly – can ease the selection process, and highlight the often nuanced differences between the solutions. And while the RFP process can take time and consume resources, it can provide far better results than an unstructured approach.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the RFP process, it can broadly be broken down into four key stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understanding the requirements of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drafting the RFP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuing the RFP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluation and analysis of responses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will look at what needs to be done during each of these four stages in order to construct a best-in-class RFP.</p>
<h3 id=""building-a-clear-picture"">Building a clear picture</h3>
<p>The first stage of the RFP process is arguably the most important and the work done here will have a significant impact on the success of the rest of the project. It is at this stage that the treasury will analyse and document its current processes and technology, in order to develop an intimate understanding of them and highlight the issues that need to be solved when implementing the new solution. This analysis will allow the treasury to build a list of key objectives for the project and an outline of how these can be achieved – this will provide a foundation for the rest of the project.</p>
<p>Of course, in many cases it will not just be the treasury that will be impacted by the new solution or service; it is essential to think carefully about which other functions will be affected, if they should be involved in the consultation processes and who could or should benefit. Completing this analysis will allow the treasury to understand who the key stakeholders are.</p></div>

<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>At this stage, the treasury may also want to begin developing an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the banks/vendors that they are likely to send the RFP to. While there are many ways that this can be achieved, some of the most common include: attending industry conferences and events hosted by the banks, having informal conversations with other treasurers, using industry studies (such as Treasury Today’s Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Studies) that rank the banks in a number of different areas, and by reading industry publications.</p>
<p>The banks can be contacted directly in these initial stages. For example, it may be a useful exercise to submit a Request for Information (RFI) to some banks that you feel may have the required capabilities. Also, it may be possible for the treasury to have an informal conversation with its current relationship banks in order to understand if it can match the high-level requirements of the new project. During these discussions it is recommended that the treasury clearly states that it will be submitting an RFP to a number of banks and that this initial approach does not mean the bank will be able to secure the corporate’s business without submitting a full response to the document.</p>
<p>The time and effort that is required to complete the first stage of the RFP process appropriately – and in enough detail – should not be underestimated. And of course, if the solution spans multiple geographies and/or business units then the time and resources required will be greater. However, completing the first stage correctly will pay dividends further down the line. If the treasury is able to fully understand its current processes and what it hopes to achieve then it will be able to convey this to the banks in the RFP and ultimately help them to suggest their best solutions.</p>
<h3 id=""drafting-the-rfp"">Drafting the RFP</h3>
<p>How the RFP document is drafted will go a long way to ensuring that the banks are able to suggest the best solutions. It is vital from the treasurer’s point of view to ensure that the RFP conveys precisely and clearly what is required according to the circumstances underlying the project. The document should be frank and open but omit irrelevant information. For example, explanations of company structure and other background details should be included only if it helps the banks understand what is needed from the solution.</p>
<p>To clearly convey what is required the treasury will need to go beyond asking basic questions. The questions set out in the RFP have to be considered – and tested – carefully, to see if they are understandable, unambiguous, and likely to yield the type of answers that are sought after. In doing so, the treasury can avoid receiving ‘cut and paste’ answers and potentially irrelevant information. It is worth noting that unless the RFP conveys precisely what is required, the pricing is likely to be skewed; corporates should be aware that adding elements merely out of curiosity or as a demonstration of knowledge could push the cost up.</p>
<p>For some, the size of the RFP document is also a consideration. The logic is that a long RFP – over 50 pages – will potentially be overwhelming and off-putting to the banks. Because of this some argue that the bankers responding may not pay as much care and attention to every question as the treasury may wish them to. A document this length may also contain irrelevant information which, as stated earlier, should be omitted. Yet, there is another camp who argue that the size of the document is irrelevant: the belief being that the quality of (necessary) information contained in the RFP should not be compromised in order to keep the document concise.</p>
<p>Just as the questions need to be clear and precise, so does the layout – no matter the size of the document. It can be very useful if the RFP is broken down into manageable sections, both for the bank and the treasury team when analysing the responses. An introduction laying out the key requirements of the project (and perhaps a contents page for guidance) should be included to assist those responding. The banks should also be given sufficient space for their responses.</p>
<p>Concerning the responses, the RFP should instruct banks to what format they should reply in. This will give the best chance of the answers being in a consistent organisation from all the banks, making comparison easier at a later stage. Planning is required to do this efficiently – the instructions need to be prescriptive enough to allow comparisons, but not so restrictive as to stifle banks’ creativity and style. In particular, it may be possible that a bank offers solutions which were not anticipated; space and flexibility may be required in order for them to express this. Moreover, banks pricing structures may vary, so if a corporate is too prescriptive in its demands a comparison may actually be made more difficult.</p>
<h3 id=""issuing-the-rfp"">Issuing the RFP</h3>
<p>The response to an RFP will be lengthy – a minimum of 40 pages but maybe as many as 200. It is unsurprising, then, that when issuing an RFP it is often recommended to limit the number of banks invited to provide responses. Of course, the more invited to provide responses the more difficult it is to make a comparison but the bigger the list, the greater opportunity to find the most appropriate partner. This is a common conundrum for treasurers engaged in the RFP process.</p>
<p>It is however possible to build in mechanisms that do not limit the amount of RFPs that can be sent out, but does limit the amount of responses that are sent back. For example, the method described by Horan in the case study: including a list of key criteria at the start of the document that has to be matched, in order for the bank to be considered, is one such technique.</p>
<p>When issuing an RFP, the treasury should also include a timeframe for the banks to adhere to. This should be a realistic timeframe for the vendor to respond and with enough detail – this will vary depending on what the RFP is for and how many locations or business entities it covers.</p>
<h3 id=""making-sense-of-the-responses"">Making sense of the responses</h3>
<p>Once the document has been drafted, issued and the responses have been collected, the next stage of the process is transforming the collected data into business intelligence. To do this each individual RFP should be reviewed in detail, hopefully giving a clear demonstration of each vendor’s capacity to add value and differentiate itself and, in some cases, address issues that may not have been raised in the RFP.</p>
<p>The information that is provided by each bank will be different and will need to be placed on an even footing. Ideally, and depending on the size of the project, a well-crafted set of questions should enable the project team to consolidate answers on a single spreadsheet, allowing a quick view of scores for each aspect. To adequately score the responses, it is common practice to ‘weight’ each section according to its relative importance. This ensures that the overall score reflects those values, and that the outcome is not unduly influenced by an aspect that is of lesser importance. There are various methods of reaching a final score, but in any case the chosen model should be agreed upon before starting to assess responses, to avoid any confusion or disagreement.</p>
<p>In the end, the decision may come down to which vendor the treasury team feels most in tune with or even price, but the RFP will have provided most of the technical information needed to be able to make the decision with confidence.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-the-rfp"">Beyond the RFP</h3>
<p>Once all the information has been collected and analysed, it is recommended that the treasury meets with its preferred choices to iron out any remaining creases. It is then up to the treasury to make its final decision. But even after this has been made, the usefulness of the RFP doesn’t end. It can be retained as the basis upon which the implementation of the solution is measured and monitored. It can also be referred to should the bank fail to live up to its original promises.</p>
<p>At the end of the process, those involved will also want feedback – regardless of whether they won or lost the contract. Here, the RFP plays an important role in ensuring that the treasury communicates how it came to its conclusions. This review process is not just important for the banks, but also the treasury who can analyse what was done well (and what can be improved on), making for a smoother RFP process in future and one that is more likely to obtain the best services available.</p>

<p class=""management-summary""><em>While some treasurers may simply see the RFP as a functional tool that allows the treasury to understand its different options and make an informed decision when implementing a new solution, Trevor Horan, Treasurer, Global Cash &amp; Liquidity at Kerry Group, believes it can be more than this – and, in fact, that it can be an effective relationship management tool.</em></p>
<p>For Horan, the key to achieving this is to make the RFP process open and transparent. The openness derives from ensuring that the tendering process is open to all banks (something which some may argue is ill-advised given the additional workload this creates for the treasury). For Horan, this is misguided. “I believe that all banks that the company has a strong relationship with should be offered the opportunity to win the business. By doing so, we demonstrate that we value their support and the relationship we have. We are also not limiting our options.”</p>
<p>Of course, like all treasurers, Horan does not want to have to sift through endless RFPs. So instead of not inviting banks to take part in the RFP process, Horan has built in a mechanism that reduces the amount of responses the treasury gets to its RFP. “At the start of the RFP document, just after the index, we include a list of key criteria that has to be matched,” he says. “If this criteria cannot be matched then we suggest that the rest of the document is not completed. This is where being transparent about the process prevents the banks from wasting time filling out the document and also reduces our workload when it comes to analysing the responses.”</p>
<p>We also make sure that those involved in the tendering process know who else has been invited, who has made the shortlist and who we are moving the process forward with,” he adds. “By doing this there are no secrets between us and our key counterparties, something that is appreciated by all involved.”</p>
<p>After the RFP process has been carried out each respondent is also given the opportunity of a full de-brief of their proposed solution in due course. “The feedback from banks to this de-brief has been extremely positive, it helps them understand why their solution was not selected and maintains strong relationships, something that is very important to Kerry Group,” says Horan.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>New regulatory proposals set out for money market funds (MMFs) by the European Commission (EC) earlier this year are set to radically reshape the trillion dollar industry. But perhaps not in the way that a lot of people anticipated.</em></p>
<p>Over the last several years the money fund industry in Europe has been shrinking. Every year since 2012, data has shown the total number of funds to be in decline. With far from universally favoured regulatory proposals in the offing, together with the negative interest rate environment, many in the industry thought that that this decline would accelerate further still in the coming months and years. They may have spoken a bit too soon.</p>
<p>Conversations Treasury Today has recently had with European asset managers indicate that the coming regulatory shake up may well preclude a growth in MMF products, albeit by means of the assets already held in prime CNAV MMFs being reallocated into various smaller funds.</p>
<p>Retail and government constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs will remain on the menu for the time being. The big news, however, is that an entirely new category of fund will be established subject to a five year sunset clause: Low Volatility (LVNAV) MMFs that will be required to publish their mark-to-market daily and remain within a 20 bps range. As asset managers endeavour to establish new funds compliant with the regulations, treasurers may soon have much more to choose between when it comes to investment vehicles for their cash investments.</p>
<p>“What is clear is that MMF providers will have the abilty to offer a wider range of products to suit their client base”,” says Ian Lloyd Senior Business Manager for Liquidity at Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM). “I think it is clear that all managers running CNAV’s will be considering LVNAV and government MMF’s. The current product offering is very commoditised, as we move forward I expect to see a wider range of products. Where we’ve got a flagship sterling fund – which today stands at circa £23bn, it is likely that this could end up split into a Government fund, a LVNAV and a VNAV product. The ultimate size of the respective funds will be based on investor appetite.”</p>
<p>Any new funds that are established may very well, in the current environment, be attractive propositions for corporates relative to bank deposits (depending, of course, on how security, liquidity and yield are prioritised). Contrary to expectations, neither regulatory uncertainty nor free-falling interest rates have precipitated substantial outflows from the industry. “You need to be careful looking at combined asset flows in euro terms because of the euro depreciation, but the actual flow into CNAV MMFs in sterling, euro and dollar terms over the last year have all been positive,” says James Finch, Head of Global Liquidity Management, EMEA at UBS. “Even in the US asset levels have actually been higher since their regulatory measures were announced. Everyone was slightly pessimistic, saying that it would lead to outflows from the industry but it hasn’t – it has, in fact, been the reverse.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Like LGIM, there are already plans in place at UBS to grow their liquidity fund product range. Initially, they plan to launch a range of traditional CNAV funds in Ireland to complement the VNAV funds they are running already in Switzerland and elsewhere in mainland Europe. Once the regulation is agreed these newly established CNAVs will be amended accordingly. “At UBS we are going to be building out our product range in the short-term MMF space,” says Finch. “If you look at ourselves – and the other providers – we want to have a range of solutions from potentially CNAV retail or government only, through to LVNAV and VNAV funds. From the client’s perspective, they are going to have a range of different products to choose from. The demand is still going to be there for high-quality short-term MMFs that settle on a same day basis, so we will be trying to take the things that investors find most attractive about CNAV MMFs and deliver them in a new regulatory environment.”</p>
<p>Even the impact of negative yields, which many treasurers cite as a greater concern than regulation, appears to be more nuanced than some anticipated.</p>

<h3 id=""less-than-zero"">Less than zero</h3>
<p>Corporates are facing an exceptionally challenging investment environment in Europe at the moment – one which actually has little to do with the forthcoming regulatory changes being imposed upon the money market fund industry. The recent monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank (ECB), in particular the decision to slash its deposit rate to minus 20 basis points is driving yields on virtually all euro-denominated MMFs into negative territory. Treasurers, none of whom are feeling overly enthusiastic about the idea of paying for their liquidity (which thanks in part to the recent bond issuance frenzy is at extraordinarily high levels), have been re-considering their options.</p>
<p>“Like many other corporates, we are not currently using euro denominated money funds due to the yield, rather than the new regulation issues,” says Andy Nash, Senior Vice President and Group Treasurer at the Dutch international retailer Ahold. Compounding the problem is that, in Europe at least, there are almost no other liquidity vehicles able to provide a positive yield without sacrificing the other two elements of that impossible short-term investment trinity, security and liquidity. It’s of little surprise, then, that those who are able to are keeping their cash elsewhere.</p>
<p>Ahold is quite fortunate in the respect that 60% of its business is in the US and has US dollar cash which can be invested in a better yield environment including dollar money market funds. It is also possible to manage the FX risk from dollars to euros but this entails taking a different approach to asset liability management. “Normally you would be much more focused on having a balance between dollar assets and liabilities. But in today’s environment it is much better to actively manage the FX and keep more dollar cash, ensuring the FX is managed for euro needs. It also means being very strong on cash flow forecasting and understanding how far you can term out.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""nowhere-to-turn"">Nowhere to turn</h3>
<p>Why have those expected outflows not materialised? After all, IMMFA estimates that a majority (57%) of all euro area MMF assets are held in CNAV funds. These are evidently very popular investment vehicles, and given that regulation means they are set to vanish from the European market one might expect some investors to take their liquidity elsewhere.</p>
<p>One of the problems with that reasoning is that it works on the assumption that there are plenty of other viable vessels out there waiting for corporate liquidity. There simply are not. In reality, the alternatives on the market are few and far between. Although bank deposits might serve as a feasible option, for some (if they can stomach the even more negatively yielding deposit rates), the introduction of Liquidity Coverage Ratio has seen to it that non-operational deposits are now being actively discouraged by some institutions. Segregated mandates have some benefits for exceptionally cash rich corporates, but are more or less impractical for everyone else. Another possibility might be an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), but any treasurer who goes down that route would have to be willing to tolerate longer durations and, by extension of that, higher levels of risk.</p>
<h3 id=""stability-by-other-means"">Stability by other means</h3>
<p>For corporate investors, however, MMFs remain the preferred option. The fact that a large slice of the market could be obliged to convert to VNAV – albeit over a long period – may in fact be immaterial to many. Investment policies may need to change in some cases; tax and accounting treatment may for some prove more challenging, but even so the anecdotal evidence suggests that most treasurers understand now that VNAV does not necessarily equate to volatility.</p>
<p>It all depends on how the fund is managed. Anybody who still doubts this should take a look at the liquidity fund offerings of Aviva Investors which were converted to VNAV back in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers. “The valuation of our daily sterling liquidity fund over the past seven years has never moved away from one,” says Matthew Tatnell, Head of Liquidity at Aviva Investors. “If a cash fund is managed in accordance with its stated objective of maintaining a £1 share price then there should be little or no volatility in normal market conditions. The term VNAV can in fact be used as a label for a very wide range of different ‘cash’ investment styles that certainly don’t all set out to provide a stable asset value, high amounts of liquidity and low credit risk.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Aviva has been able to achieve this share-price stability simply by managing their funds in a more conservative fashion, prohibiting the purchase of higher yielding floating-rate notes, for example where historically prices can be volatile, preferring instead to offer this type of product in a separate AAA-rated fund that doesn’t target a stable asset value. Of course, in extremely stressed market conditions the value of the fund’s portfolio could decline and that would show in the share price. That would happen to any investment fund though, regardless of what label one puts on it. The difference is that, when faced with such conditions, the ability of the share price to fluctuate helps to keep the fund open for business.</p>
<p>In contrast, when a CNAV MMF is faced with such market conditions it could, in the absence of sponsor support, be forced to wind down. In this extreme situation, the investor could potentially experience a long, nervous wait to see how much of the investment will be repaid as the fund sponsor attempts to sell off the portfolio into a market that, in all likelihood, is already stressed. “I actually think this whole VNAV and CNAV differentiation is irrelevant,” says Colin Cookson, Managing Director of Liquidity at Aviva Investors. “Just because you put a label on something doesn’t mean it’s immune. Instead investors should be thinking about how the sponsor is managing the portfolio to minimise the probability of a potential for a move in the NAV.”</p>
<h3 id=""decisions-decisions"">Decisions, decisions</h3>
<p>As noted earlier, treasurers in the post-regulation European MMF landscape are likely to have considerably more choice in terms of products. But what type of fund will ultimately end up being the most popular choice for the corporate investor? With the expectation being for so long that it would be VNAV or nothing for European MMFs, some of those who formerly invested in the other category of fund have been busy readying themselves for VNAV, considering how such investments and removing any potential obstacles ahead of time. Many of them may also be looking at the more stable incarnations of VNAV MMFs, as run by the likes of Aviva and Northern Trust, and reaching the conclusion that this type of product, if managed in the right way, might not be so incompatible with their investment needs after all.</p>
<p>On that basis, LGIM’s Lloyd believes that the bulk of corporate liquidity may eventually end up heading in the VNAV direction. “It may well be that VNAV over time becomes the preferred choice for corporate treasurers, especially given the LVNAV sunset clause. If that is indeed the case, how does Lloyd see all of those CNAV-only fund investors adjusting? “To begin with investors will have to get used to the mechanics of a VNAV but given the underlying investment guidelines are unlikely to change dramatically it is likely that over time corporate treasurers will become comfortable with this product.”</p>
<p>UBS’s Finch agrees, adding that the now-visible volatility will also entail changes in accounting methodologies and, possibly, updates to TMSs and other relevant systems. “If treasurers are used to CNAV funds then changes in the underlying NAV will make it somewhat different in terms of the accounting or how they book it into their systems.” Providing the introduction of LVNAV MMFs is confirmed in legislation later in the year, however, treasurers will at least have time on their side. “That should be a kind of stepping stone product,” he says. “It will look and act like a CNAV product and will provide clients with similar benefits.”</p>
<p>Straightforward, easy to book and report on a tax basis; it is not difficult to understand why prime CNAV MMFs have long been popular investment vehicles, for corporate treasurers especially. However, ever since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers caused the Reserve Primary Fund to “break the buck”, regulators have had the industry in their crosshairs. Now, rightly or wrongly they have decided that in the interests of financial stability they should be phased out. That is the reality facing investors. For those who prefer their NAVs fixed at a price of one it is not an ideal reality, yet in the current environment it is hard to see many corporates discontinuing or even reducing their use of MMFs once the regulation is finally passed into law.</p></div>

<p>That should give everyone an idea of prospects for the industry going forward. If the notion of paying to deposit liquidity proved insufficient to drive investors out of the MMF space, it seems somewhat unlikely that changes to how funds account for capital and income, and value their underlying investments, will.</p></div>

<h2>China’s Money Market Fund Regulation in a Global Context</h2>
<p>The global campaign to better safeguard investors in money market funds (MMF) in the wake of the financial crisis has focused attention on fund regulatory efforts in the US and Europe. Less is known about the regulatory environment in one of the world’s fastest growing markets. The rise of MMFs in China has accelerated as investors gravitate to the relative security and diversification of professionally managed funds, not to mention the substantial yield pickup over bank deposits. However, not all MMFs in China are created equal. Financial market regulatory changes over recent years have had the effect of opening the local fund industry to further expansion, and the standards of operation vary considerably. We believe investors can benefit from insights into the range of funds available in China and the risk management guidelines under which they operate.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-framework-and-function"">Regulatory framework and function</h3>
<p>China’s MMF industry is barely a decade old, but assets under management (AUM) have grown nearly fifteen-fold in the past four years alone to around RMB 1.9 trillion as of October 2014.</p>
<figure class=""left"" style=""margin-bottom:0;"">

<p class=""source"">Source: WIND, as of October 31, 2014</p>
</figure>
<p>The industry operates within a formal regulatory framework that has itself come together quickly since the early 1990s, with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) as the leading oversight and enforcement authority for MMFs. Overall, the CSRC’s responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Formulating policies, laws and regulations concerning markets in securities and futures contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overseeing issuing, trading, custody and settlement of equity shares, bonds, investment funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supervising listing, trading and settlement of futures contracts; futures exchanges; securities and futures firms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regulatory oversight of money market funds varies globally.  In the European Union (EU), there are a number of important regulatory and legislative bodies. National legislators and the European Council, European Parliament and European Commission develop MMF regulation, while national regulators are responsible for oversight.  In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary regulator with discretion over MMF rules, similarly to the CRSC.</p>
<p>Like its international peers, the CSRC is developing policy to address the oversight challenges of a sizeable industry at the core of the financial system. However, the priorities for China’s policymakers at this stage of the MMF industry’s evolution are different from those in longer-established markets. For instance, the SEC and EU institutions are addressing perceived shortcomings as a legacy of the financial crisis, including more restrictions on existing, standardized investment requirements for MMFs. The CSRC, meanwhile, is focusing on ensuring that there is proper oversight of new entrants in a market with many different types of funds—particularly given the ascendance of online funds in the retail space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The CSRC, meanwhile, is focusing on ensuring that there is proper oversight of new entrants in a market with many different types of funds—particularly given the ascendance of online funds in the retail space.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CSRC spokesman Zhang Xiaojun underscored this priority in a press conference on February 28, 2014. Zhang noted that the CSRC is “working to adopt relevant rules on further enhancing risk management for money market funds and supervision of internet-based offers and sales of funds.”</p>
<h3 id=""points-of-difference"">Points of difference</h3>
<p>Like its peers in the US and Europe, the CSRC sets risk management requirements for MMFs that limit the duration exposure, credit risk, liquidity risk and concentration of assets in portfolios. The main difference is that CSRC standards allow MMF managers more flexibility than the US and European regulations, particularly given the tightening in SEC and European rules since the crisis. US and European managers are further constrained from a yield standpoint by the historically low interest rates and shortage of high-quality assets in developed markets. The following are key distinctions between the CSRC’s guidelines and international standards:</p>
<p><strong>Duration exposure</strong> Money market funds typically comprise very short-dated securities, in order to limit the potential impact of rising interest rates on the value of the investments. The CSRC’s requirements for MMFs allow for greater interest rate management flexibility, both in the overall average maturity and individual investments, than US and European requirements.</p>
<p>In the US and Europe, regulators impose restrictions on the maturity of each instrument as well as the weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average life (WAL) of the portfolio in total. In the US, the SEC limits the maturity of any fixed- or floating-rate security to 397 days, with the exception of government floating-rate notes, for which there is no maximum (other than those resulting from the overall portfolio WAL limit of 120 days). The CSRC similarly sets a maximum maturity of 397 days for fixed-rate notes, but does not set a limit for floating-rate securities (no overall WAL limit) although holdings for those floating-rate securities with a maturity that is longer than 397 days may not be more than 20% of the MMF’s assets. As for the portfolio’s average maturity, the SEC and ESMA each impose a maximum WAM of 60 days, while the CSRC’s limit is 180 days.</p>
<p><strong>Net asset value (NAV)</strong> Changes to the accounting regime for MMFs were a big feature of the latest US amendments as well as those being contemplated in Europe and they affect how a fund’s NAV (or price at which an investor transacts) is reported. A fund with a “stable NAV” traditionally uses amortized cost accounting methodology, where the price of a unit/share is held constant at 1.00 by amortizing the underlying investments while the actual underlying market prices of investments in the portfolio may be very slightly higher or lower than the amortized price. A NAV calculated using market value prices is commonly referred to as a market-value or shadow NAV. China’s MMFs generally use amortized cost accounting methodology to offer stable NAVs, and managers are required to calculate their market-value NAV and publish their maximum deviation during any calendar quarter following the end of that quarter. By contrast, in the US, within a couple of years, US institutional prime funds will fully switch to a floating NAV, and MMFs that transact at a stable NAV, including government funds and retail funds, will be required to report market-value NAVs on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Credit risk</strong> China’s MMFs are permitted to hold a range of assets across government, quasi-government, bank- and corporate-issued securities. While US MMFs can invest in corporate issuance, the US money market regulations specify that no more than 5% of corporate investments can be from a single issuer. In China, the maximum concentration is 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage</strong> International MMFs generally do not permit explicit leverage, meaning borrowing for purposes of creating more than 100% asset exposure. In China, the CSRC allows up to 20% leverage via borrowing cash/lending securities in repurchase (repo) markets.</p>
<h3>Eligible Assets</h3>
<p>Eligible assets for China’s MMFs include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Treasury paper</strong>, which is issued by the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy bank bonds</strong> are the largest segment of the fixed income market. These securities are issued by three 100% government-owned policy banks, the Agricultural Development Bank of China, Export Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank. Policy bank bonds are similar to Agency paper in the US and Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time deposits</strong> with which MMFs can invest in interbank negotiated deposits with banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate securities</strong> are available in a variety of structures, including commercial paper and medium-term notes. Typically these instruments have variable liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repos</strong> including interbank and exchange-traded repos typically with high grade collateral.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Role of ratings agencies</h3>
<p>China’s standards are similar to international conventions in that the securities in MMFs are required to have top-shelf ratings. In the US,  money market fund rules from leading rating agencies such as Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings stipulate that 100% of triple-A rated funds must generally be invested in first tier securities that are rated at least A-1/P-1/F-1.</p>
<p>However, triple-A criteria for China’s local ratings agencies vary. When it comes to ratings of the funds themselves, the local agencies’ standards for MMFs are typically no more stringent than the CSRC guidelines. Fitch, the main international rating agency operating in China, sets tighter restrictions in line with global standards, but its triple-A rated funds account for just around 3% (as of September 30, 2014) of China’s MMF industry. Fitch’s<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> criteria on factors such as leverage, liquidity and portfolio concentration are consistent with, though not identical to, triple-A guidelines in the US and Europe. For instance, Fitch’s maximum WAM of 75 days is well below the CSRC maximum of 180 days, but still above the global norm of 60 days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fitch, the main international rating agency operating in China, sets tighter restrictions in line with global standards, but its triple-A rated funds account for just around 3% (as of September 30, 2014) of China’s MMF industry.”</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>The potential benefit in terms of risk management does entail some sacrifice when it comes to yield. Fitch’s funds exhibit a material difference in risk and return versus non-Fitch triple-A rated funds that use the full flexibility allowed under CSRC guidelines. Historically, non-Fitch triple-A rated funds have substantially outperformed, albeit in an environment where corporate defaults are still very rare.</p>

<h3>Manager discretion</h3>
<p>While MMFs in China have the flexibility to access higher yields, the risks to capital preservation and liquidity can also be higher. This is where the expertise of the fund manager comes in, and risk management is a distinguishing factor in China’s increasingly crowded MMF space. The following are key areas in which a manager’s philosophy can make a difference in this regulatory environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Independent assessment of credit risk</strong> for various issuers, rather than relying solely on issuers meeting the minimum requirements of credit rating agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensuring sufficient liquidity</strong> is maintained in the fund relative to the amount and variety of shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calibrating duration</strong>, whereby some managers will voluntarily restrict WAM even further—down to 60 days—to be more consistent with global practice. This is very pertinent considering the pronounced interest rate volatility in China’s money markets (see <a href=""http://treasurytoday.com/2014/09/chinas-markets-interpreting-interest-rate-volatility-ttad"">China’s Markets: Interpreting Interest Rate Volatility</a>).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This expansionary phase of the MMF industry’s development in China is a boon for the growing population of corporate and retail clients seeking alternatives to bank deposits and help in navigating the domestic securities markets. However, investors should also exercise discernment in their choice of manager, given the range of relatively new entrants and the variation in their risk management expertise. In a growth industry so far untested by crisis, it pays to focus on the risks as much as the returns, in line with standards shared by a global community attuned to the challenges of today’s investment environment.</p>

<p>Most investors in the money market fund (MMF) space will be aware that changes are afoot in this industry. With the SEC having laid out its plans in July for the US, and its European counterparts currently debating along similar lines (but yet to declare its hand), these changes are likely to shake things up quite a bit.</p>
<p>Many investors – certainly those anchored in the world of corporate treasury – will also be aware that regulatory reform could impact them indirectly, as the likes of Basel III and CRD IV reach the financial services sector, casting a shadow over the desirability for banks of very short maturities and reducing the supply of eligible assets in the process. It will be a rare investor too who has not witnessed interest rates fall away to almost zero and, in Europe, even stray into negative territory.</p>
<p>These observations serve as the backdrop to a significant change by one global asset manager to the way it approaches its euro MMF. When in August 2014, Northern Trust Asset Management launched its variable net asset value (VNAV) Euro Liquidity Fund it was taking a somewhat vanguard position (most funds remain focused on the constant net asset value, or CNAV, model). But the significance of the change for the market will not translate into client upheaval.</p>
<p>The impact of moving to a VNAV fund should be minimal for our clients,” comments David Blake, Director, International Fixed Income, Asset Management for Northern Trust. “We have a core belief of how a MMF should be run; our investment philosophy in terms of liquidity policy, eligible investments, portfolio diversification all remain the same,” he adds. “To us a VNAV fund is identical to a CNAV fund in terms of its underlying investments, so effectively it is just a change of accounting treatment, from amortised cost accounting to variable price accounting.”</p>
<p>Northern Trust did a lot of “road-testing” over a two-year period before launching its VNAV fund. The reaction, Blake reports, was mostly favourable. Acceptance in certain cases was “a journey”, with some clients hanging on to the idea of ‘CNAV with a positive return’. But the reality of the situation is that interest rates are negative in Europe – and likely to remain in this territory for some time – and there is a fundamental incompatibility between a CNAV structure and a negative rate of return. For Blake, change was inevitable.</p>
<p>Although ‘breaking the buck’, where the price drops below the fixed rate of ‘1’, is a cardinal sin in the money market world, he is at pains to mark the distinction between asset impairment or default (as happened to the now infamous Reserve Fund in the US), and simply being forced to endure a negative central bank rate. A negative rate is not a failure, “just the price of doing business in euros at the moment”.</p>
<p>This distinction aside, in a negative rate environment, holding cash is expensive. However cash is held by some clients because they need to, notes Blake. And whether it’s for operational needs or to satisfy investment or asset allocation decisions, money funds remain an effective vehicle for that cash. Whilst positive returns cannot be produced out of nothing (or less than nothing), Northern Trust’s investment philosophy steers all of its funds towards the preservation of capital and same-day liquidity first and foremost; only then will it seek to maximise return. “We position ourselves at the more conservative end of the spectrum,” he comments. Whereas some managers may dabble with increased risk to try to extract yield, where it is simply not possible to go out on the curve (and you would have to go some way out these days for notably better yield) he advocates “facing up to reality” by changing accounting structures; a change for Northern Trust made concrete by its VNAV Euro Liquidity Fund.</p>
<p>Challenges had to be overcome on the journey into VNAV. “Our investment guidelines and holdings are the same and our cut-off times and payment instruction deadlines are the same too. But there has been a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen at a transfer agency and fund accounting level,” Blake explains. He adds that adoption of VNAV was never a foregone conclusion as the most appropriate alternative accounting mechanism to deal with negative interest rates. The team considered the reverse distribution mechanism (also known as ‘CNAV with unit cancellation’). In this model, instead of varying the price of the fund as in VNAV, the price is maintained at a steady ‘1’ but shares are necessarily redeemed to cover any negative accruals. “Economically it is identical to VNAV but the transparency of variable pricing seems greater to us than not knowing how many units are held in a fund,” he explains. But perhaps even more persuasively, with the likelihood that European regulators will follow the SEC down the VNAV line, he adds that it made little sense to adopt anything else.</p>
<p>With clients being closely involved in the ‘design’ process of its VNAV fund, Northern Trust has been able to provide a euro-based vehicle – alongside its existing sterling and dollar CNAV funds – that can operate effectively in the current environment and pre-empt likely mandatory market changes without stepping outside of its own and indeed most treasurers’ core values of transparency, security and liquidity. The time for VNAV seems to have arrived.</p></div>

Short Term Investments,Separate Accounts: building a personalised portfolio, Published: Nov 2014 ,,"<div class=""gs-grid__col gs-grid__col-1-10 gs-grid__col--expand"" style="""">

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p><i>Separate Accounts can provide cash investors with enhanced flexibility and the opportunity to obtain greater yield than money market funds (MMFs). Corinne Lewis-Reynier, Head of Product Strategy for the EMEA Cash Management Group at BlackRock, examines the benefits of Separate Accounts and the operational factors for corporate treasurers to bear in mind when considering them.</i></p>
<p>Separate Accounts differ from pooled mutual funds in that they are segregated mandates comprised solely of one company’s assets. The investment strategy of the account is driven only by the specific objectives and risk tolerances of the sole shareholder, which are typically dictated by their investment policy. Separate Accounts can add value in any economic environment, but they are particularly relevant to investors at the moment owing to a confluence of factors.</p>
<h3 id=""the-relevance-of-separate-accounts"">The relevance of Separate Accounts</h3>
<p>Firstly, interest rates across most of the world’s major currencies are very low; in the Eurozone, for instance, overnight rates are in negative territory. This is putting pressure on corporate treasurers, who need to make sure that their operating cash is not only invested safely, but also that it is placed in an instrument in accordance with their investment policy.</p>
<p>“One way Separate Accounts help investors to mitigate this low-yield environment is by allowing them to hold their cash further along the yield curve,” explains Corinne Lewis-Reynier, Head of Product Strategy for the EMEA Cash Management Group, BlackRock. Furthermore, Separate Accounts can be tailored to a corporate’s needs, investment policy and risk guidelines – investors can dictate the level of risk they are willing to take and their provider can offer a solution to reflect this.</p>
<p>Regulation is another factor. On the one hand there is bank regulation. “Under Basel III, banks are having to revisit and redesign their business models for decades ahead, impacting how much they lend and for how long,” says Lewis-Reynier. “Banks are now in a situation where they are unable to provide the level and breadth of services to corporates that they have in the past, which will force some corporates to rethink their relationships with banks and how they manage their short-term cash.”</p>
<p>Money market fund (MMF) regulation is also having an impact. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently pronounced that in the next two years institutional prime MMFs in the US must have a Floating Net Asset Value (NAV), and while it remains to be seen how regulation in Europe could evolve, it is clear there is a general trend from Constant NAV towards Floating NAV. In this regulatory context, Separate Accounts provide an alternative to corporates as to how their cash can be managed.</p>
<p>The same MMF regulation is also affecting the cost of liquidity, which is exacerbated in this low-yield environment. Under the SEC’s new rules, prime MMFs are obligated to hold a set level of liquidity, both overnight as well as in weekly buckets. This inherent cost of holding liquidity is passed on to investors.</p>
<p>Beyond the low-yield environment and the challenges posed by regulation, Separate Accounts can also help corporate treasuries to be more resource-efficient. As corporate treasuries often face increasing pressure on staffing levels, Separate Accounts provide access to specialist resources that serve as an extension of a company’s treasury team. Employing an external manager can ease the pressure and enhance the quality of the investment management process through direct access to specialist credit, risk and portfolio management resources.</p>
<h3 id=""flexibility"">Flexibility</h3>
<p>Unlike MMFs, which have a single set of guidelines in an investor prospectus, Separate Accounts give investors the opportunity to engage with an asset manager who can advise them on the benchmark that is best suited to their investment needs, set measures for their risks, and forecast what their cash needs may be in the future, all in order to provide them with an investment solution that is optimised for their individual characteristics.</p>
<p>Separate Accounts are arranged through the signing of an investment management agreement (IMA), which is essentially a legally binding partnership between the investor and the provider. The IMA is not set in stone, and can be revisited at any time in the future should the investor wish. “This flexibility is of great value to investors, because markets, interest rates and the credit environment are liable to change over time, and it is important to choose the right partner to maintain an ongoing dialogue throughout these changing times,” says Lewis-Reynier.</p>
<p>The IMA is the legal framework around the guidelines and parameters of the engagement between the two institutions, and it is reviewed by the legal departments on both sides.</p>
<p>Points set out in the IMA include the objectives of the portfolio, and guidelines on, credit, portfolio duration and liquidity needs. Details include agreements on maturity limits, the investor’s risk tolerance, and average or minimum ratings of the underlying securities the corporate is willing to invest in, as well as the investment universe the investor is comfortable with.</p>
<h3 id=""operational-considerations"">Operational considerations</h3>
<p>There are a number of operational factors corporates need to consider when setting up the IMA for a Separate Account – these considerations need not be prohibitive, but should be understood by the company.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Accounting treatment.</h5>
<p>The direct ownership of the securities held within a Separate Account can lead to accounting and tax considerations that differ from the standard cash and cash equivalents treatment of a constant NAV vehicle. The mark-to-market accounting treatment of variable NAV assets can vary from client to client depending on their reporting preferences, accounting policies and strategy for the Separate Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Tax considerations.</h5>
<p>Separate Account clients should be aware of their domicile’s tax laws that may impact the purchase, transfer and sale of securities across different jurisdictions. For detailed tax information it is recommended that you contact your tax consultant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Gain/loss budgets.</h5>
<p>Clients can place restrictions or limits on gains/losses they are willing to tolerate. Good managers will be very familiar with the process and will have systems to ensure limits are managed appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Custodial relationship.</h5>
<p>In moving from a pooled fund to a Separate Account, the corporate will need to employ a custodian to take direct ownership of the securities. As such, the client has sole influence in the selection of both the investment manager and the custodian, the latter of which will take responsibility for the safekeeping of assets as well as undertaking administrative and transaction services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these considerations, investors should also be conscious of their own liquidity needs, and explain to a provider exactly why they want to pursue the Separate Account route. For example, if a corporate needs to raise cash ahead of a big dividend payment, this could impact the management of their Separate Account going forward.</p>
<p>In addition, investors should think carefully about what they want to achieve. Whether they are seeking liquidity, yield or a little bit of both, will have a bearing on what kind of investment is best for them. Their appetite for exposure to a certain sector or country, or indeed their desire to avoid a certain sector or country, will also play a part.</p>
<p>Furthermore, investors need to understand current market conditions. Some US corporates with European treasury centres may wish to transpose current US guidelines in order to run their Separate Accounts in Europe in the same way they do in the US; however, there are significant structural differences between the two markets in terms of size and issuance, and it makes sense to speak to an expert about these differences.</p>
<h3 id=""separate-accounts-at-blackrock"">Separate Accounts at BlackRock</h3>
<p>To leverage the full benefits of Separate Accounts, investors need to partner with an experienced provider, who has a knowledgeable team that has weathered many different economic cycles.</p>
<p>“Having a partner that has a broad range of products across all the asset classes is key, and this is an important differentiator for BlackRock, because we cover all the asset classes; even if the investor is not interested in them all now, they may be in the future,” says Lewis-Reynier.</p>
<p>“Risk management is one of the founding principles of BlackRock and our understanding of the risks investors take when they invest in certain markets or for certain durations is key to our offering. We provide our clients with tailored risk solutions, which is extremely important in the current market, and we are constantly on hand to provide scenario analysis,” explains Lewis-Reynier.</p>
<p>“BlackRock’s credit research team and relationship managers have considerable experience in the asset class and provide world-class insight and client engagement”, she says. “Indeed, client contact is a key differentiating factor of Separate Accounts – we have more frequent and more detailed touchpoints with the investor, and provide daily or weekly reporting depending on their needs.

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>While money market funds (MMFs) are the staple of the short-term investment strategies of many corporate treasurers across Europe and the US, the instrument is far from attaining mainstream status in the boardrooms of Asia.</p>
<p>The most popular product for corporates in the Asia Pacific region who are looking to invest their excess cash remains bank deposits. “The short-term investment market for investing corporate cash in Asia is still relatively new,” says Paula Stibbe, Head of Global Liquidity Sales – Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPM AM). “Traditional bank deposits have been the primary vehicle that corporate treasurers have used to manage their non-operational cash.”</p>
<p>And while MMFs are far from unheard of in the region, there are significant hurdles to overcome before they become a mainstay of the Asian treasurer’s investment toolbox.</p>
<p>Subash Pillai, Head of Global Liquidity Management, Asia, at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says there are two key conditions necessary for the establishment of a successful MMF market. One is a large, diversified underlying market of high-quality, liquid paper for funds to invest in. “Many markets in Asia do not meet this condition,” he says.</p>
<p>The other condition is likely to be met, at least in some jurisdictions, before the first: a favourable interest rate environment. “Countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which have high-quality underlying assets but very low interest rates may well see their MMF markets grow materially when there is a normalisation of interest rates,” he adds.</p>
<p>Indeed, considering Pillai’s first condition, the fact that MMFs are not widely used by Asian corporates is partly a function of the lack of depth of the capital markets in Asia; in many countries in the region, local currency capital markets are simply very small in comparison with those for dollar-denominated products.</p>
<p>But beyond this lack of depth in some Asian capital markets, what MMFs there are in Asia tend to be smaller-sized funds, as there is just not the range or the volume of assets available for the funds to invest in. This can in turn deter corporates, who might otherwise be favourable towards MMFs, from investing in smaller funds that they consider less diversified, and therefore less safe. “Given that most investors go to MMFs for diversification of risk rather than purely for yield, this is one of the big barriers to growth in the MMF market in Asia,” explains Philippe Jaccard, Head of Global Liquidity Management at ANZ.</p>
<h3 id=""banking-culture"">Banking culture</h3>
<p>Another reason for the continuing popularity of bank deposits in Asia relates to banking culture in the region, says David Blair, Managing Director, at Acarate. “Many local banks in Asia are still very focused on having big balance sheets. Some Chinese bank managers are indeed compensated based on the size of their balance sheets, whereas most Western banks want to reduce their balance sheets by as much as possible,” he explains. “On top of this, it is more common for large Asian conglomerates to have close relationships with certain banks.”</p>
<p>This is especially the case with companies working within a keiretsu system in Japan, and chaebol arrangement in Korea (informal business groups), whereby a bank can form the core part of a conglomerate’s operations.</p>
<p>However, despite the continuing popularity of bank deposits, there are signs that the nascent MMF market is starting to increase in popularity in the region.</p>
<p>“Over the last ten years we have started to see the types of investment tools that corporate treasurers in Asia use expand,” says JPM AM’s Stibbe. “MMFs, for example, have grown to where they are now considered a key liquidity option for treasurers to consider.”</p>
<p>And one of the key MMF markets of the future in Asia is undoubtedly China.</p>
<h3 id=""looking-to-china"">Looking to China</h3>
<p>China is widely considered the MMF market with the biggest potential in the region, given the scale of the financial resources in China. Indeed, it already represents a significant focus for some of the biggest fund managers, although it is not necessarily the largest MMF market in Asia.</p>
<p>Of J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity’s nearly $18.2 billion of assets under management in Asia Pacific, almost half ($7.5 billion) is in China.</p>
<p>“Chinese MMFs have offered investors returns above 3.0%, and although they are not guaranteed, this compares favourably with the People’s Bank of China’s seven-day time deposit rate ceiling of around 1.35%,” says Stibbe. “This kind of yield in a AAA-rated vehicle is difficult to come by elsewhere. As a result many treasurers are now choosing to keep their cash inside China because of the attractive returns available, and solutions are starting to appear outside traditional bank deposits to help them achieve these returns.”</p>
<p>Several Western asset managers are increasing their presence in China, with a number of RMB MMFs emerging in recent years. However, these firms are establishing their Chinese MMFs as joint ventures with a local partner, who must be the majority shareholder under Chinese regulation. “Some corporate investors will feel more comfortable investing in Chinese MMFs through names they know,” says ANZ’s Jaccard. “But it is important to bear in mind the funds are run in collaboration with local Chinese firms.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity China, for example, distributes a China-domiciled RMB fund to institutional investors in China from its joint venture, China International Fund Management (CIFM). J.P. Morgan Asset Management UK Ltd owns 49% of the joint venture, while local partner Shanghai International Trust Co., Ltd. owns 51%.</p>
<p>“Through locally domiciled funds like this we now have the ability to bring the depth and breadth of our product offering and insights to corporate treasurers, not only to local Asia-based companies but also to multinational US- or European-based firms with locally domiciled subsidiaries in-region,” says JPM AM’s Stibbe. “With money markets in Asia developing, especially in China, they are seeing their investment options in the region expand for a range of the functional currencies they carry.”</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, too, has a domestic Chinese money market vehicle that it offers through its strategic partner Beijing Gao Hua Securities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, non-Asian MMFs are upping their investment in Chinese bank debt. Between April 2013 and April 2014, Fitch-rated prime MMFs increased their assets in debt from Chinese financial services groups from around zero to 0.4%. Fitch put this increase in exposure to Chinese bank debt partly down to a higher level of issuance as well as greater investor demand.</p>
<p>The fact that foreign MMFs are increasing exposure to Chinese bank debt demonstrates that China certainly has the underlying assets to sustain a buoyant domestic MMF market too.</p>
<p>And if regulators soften to the extent that 100% foreign-owned asset management entities are permitted, the options available to investors will proliferate. “If the Chinese market continues to open up in the way it has been, and foreign asset managers are allowed to have majority-owned joint ventures, more firms will surely want to expand in the country,” says JPM AM’s Stibbe.</p>
<h3 id=""short-term-investments-elsewhere"">Short-term investments elsewhere</h3>
<p>Beyond China, the prevalence of MMFs and related instruments among corporates in Asia Pacific is varied.</p>
<p>In India, where the market for instruments known as liquid funds, which are similar to MMFs, is well established, the underlying assets are already in place. “India has an especially developed bond and commercial paper market, which provides the instruments needed for a sound MMF market,” says Acarate’s Blair.</p>
<p>Here liquid funds offer corporate investors an access point to other asset classes. “India has an established liquid funds industry offering various degrees of liquidity. They also offer a tax advantage to investors if funds pay a dividend rather than an interest rate,” adds Blair.</p>
<p>In January 2014, the liquid fund market in India was worth around $40 billion, and it has grown at an annual rate of 15% over the past five years.</p>
<p>Japan also has a significant MMF industry, although currently the yield environment is highly unattractive, with rates barely above zero on most short-term instruments.</p>
<p>In certain other jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region, such as Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore, MMFs have similarly languished in their challenging interest rate environments, with slim spreads between the rates on bank deposits and MMFs, and bank deposits remaining the vehicle of choice for many corporates with excess cash, although Australia stands out in that its MMF industry is larger and more developed.</p>
<p>Australia is also notable in that it will be one of the first countries in the Asia Pacific region to implement Basel III in January 2015. This is significant because Basel III will, among other measures, lead to banks being penalised for holding large amounts of corporates’ non-operational cash. This will likely drive investment in MMFs as corporates, discouraged from depositing excess cash with their banks, will seek off-balance sheet solutions.</p>
<p>This impact of Basel III on the MMF industry is not limited to Australia, nor indeed to the Asia Pacific region; it is set to be a worldwide phenomenon. However, it will be interesting to observe how Australia’s head start in implementing the regulation will affect the development of its domestic MMF industry, as will the subsequent spread of Basel III in other Asian jurisdictions have on their respective MMF industries.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-change"">Regulatory change</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in Asia is dealing with the variety of regulatory environments, some of which are much more tightly controlled than others (China, for instance, being one of the more controlled jurisdictions, although this may well change considerably over the coming years). For fund providers, this means packaging and distributing their products according to local regulation, and adhering to cross-border currency movement controls. As we have already seen, it can also mean having to team up with a local partner.</p>
<p>Regulation from European and US legislators is also likely to affect the MMF industry in Asia. However, while the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) shakeup of MMF regulation in the US is likely to have repercussions on MMF vehicles throughout the world, no regulators in Asia Pacific have for the moment put in place an articulated plan to move to variable net asset value (VNAV) pricing of funds. That is not to say, however, that such a shift will not take place in some Asian jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In terms of country-specific regulation, China, not surprisingly, is one of the fastest-changing regulatory environments in Asia Pacific for short-term investment products. And in many cases, regulatory change can be advantageous for corporates, with the relaxation of some rules proving a benefit of both providers and investors.</p>
<p>For example, while MMFs in Europe and the US are typically settled on a same-day basis (T+0), Chinese MMFs were until recently settled on a T+1 basis. For treasurers used to same-day settlement, this made cash planning and forecasting more challenging in China. Now that a recent change in CSRC regulations has allowed MMFs to settle redemptions on T+0 in China, there is an opening for more products with international standards.</p>
<p>For instance, CIFM launched a new RMB MMF in August 2014 that offers institutional investors in China the capability of T+0 settlement on redemption for the first time (although subscriptions will continue to operate on a T+1 basis).</p>
<p>“New products, enabled by the changes in regulation are allowing corporate investors to earn higher yields than bank deposits, while also giving them the ease and convenience of having access to their cash on a same-day basis on redemption,” explains JPM AM’s Stibbe. “The direction China is moving in is allowing providers to launch products more consistent with international standards, and is boosting the growth of MMFs in the country.”</p>
<h3 id=""investor-attitude"">Investor attitude</h3>
<p>Besides regulation, another major challenge to the growth of the MMF market in Asia is that some investors do not fully appreciate the key advantage of the instrument.</p>
<p>“In recent investor memory in Asia there have not been the near misses or indeed failures of financial institutions that we have seen in other regions,” says Goldman Sachs’s Pillai. “While corporates in Europe and the US have witnessed the potentially catastrophic consequences of not diversifying their short-term investments, companies in Asia have not had this call to action to invest in MMFs.”</p>
<p>He says the diversification benefits of MMFs – one of the key selling points of this type of fund – are yet to resonate as strongly with Asian investors. “Providers continue to educate corporates in Asia about how they can diversify their risk by investing in MMFs,” he says. “As investors in the region recognise this, market growth will accelerate.”</p>
<p>Given that corporates in Asia Pacific may not have as much experience in investing in MMFs as some of their western counterparts, it may take time for some to get to grips with investing in MMFs or other short-term investment options, other than bank deposits. ANZ’s Jaccard says there are three steps companies in the region should follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A company needs a board policy outlining the excess cash ‘buffer’ it will retain. The size of this buffer is a function of the amount of funds it estimates it will require in a stress scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excess cash should be spread across as many legal entities, in as many currencies and in as many countries as possible. The more diversified the buffer, the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be a mechanism in place for controlling excess cash once it is invested. For example, there are usually conditions attached to the withdrawal of funds from an MMF. What’s more, exposure to counterparties and instrument types should be frequently monitored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these steps will not guarantee the success of a corporate’s short-term investment strategy but it could help prepare the company for the expanding range of instruments available to them in the coming years.</p></div>

<p>Jonathan Curry is Global CIO for the Liquidity business and has been working in the industry since 1989. Prior to joining HSBC in 2010, Curry worked as Head of European Cash Management at Barclays Global Investors. He is Chairman of the Institutional Money Market Fund Association and a Board member since 2006, the industry association for AAA rated money market funds. He is also a member of the Bank of England’s Money Market Liaison Group and a member of the European Banking Federation’s STEP Committee.</p>
</div>
<p>It has been a long time coming for the US and it will be a while yet for Europe, but the full extent of money market fund (MMF) reform is slowly being realised. However, with the US having shown its hand and Europe still debating the issue, it may seem like a two-part play; either way reform is coming and investors need to understand what the changes mean to be able to make the most of them.</p>
<h3 id=""us-mmf-reform"">US MMF reform</h3>
<p>On 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2014 reform of the US MMF market was announced. With three of the five appointed commissioners having voted for the proposed amendments to market regulation, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires the changes to be implemented within two years.</p>
<p>The most significant change is the way certain funds are valued; the model is now to be based on Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) for prime and municipal MMFs held by institutional investors. This will require funds to be valued daily to the four decimal places. This creates a variable share price whereas before, in the Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) model, funds targeted a stable price of $1 (or £1/€1). Retail funds will be able to continue using CNAV but will be subject to more stringent reporting of market movements. For all funds, the SEC is expecting greater diversification and is imposing enhanced stress-testing.</p>
<p>The other major change, as expected, is the requirement for institutional prime and municipal funds to have the ability to apply discretionary redemption gates and liquidity fees. Designed to protect investors in these funds and to help avert a market panic, these abilities can be levied by non-government MMFs. Although government funds are not mandatorily required to have this ability they can opt in.</p>
<p>In practice, a liquidity fee up to a maximum of 2% may be applied after consideration by the fund’s Board only if weekly liquidity assets drop below 30% of that fund’s total asset value. The fee effectively pays for the cost of liquidity during the period of stress. Additionally, if a fund’s liquidity falls below 10% it can levy a 1% fee on all redemptions. Institutional funds also have the option at the 30% trigger-point to suspend redemptions altogether for up to ten days (the so-called redemption gate). “These mechanisms, in our view, are there to protect investors if the fund is subject to a period of stress,” explains Jonathan Curry, Global Chief Investment Officer – Liquidity at HSBC Global Asset Management.</p>
<p>The reforms are the result of considerable industry-wide dialogue concerning the most appropriate way forward. Over the six months preceding the SEC’s announcement, the volume of that dialogue naturally reduced as the five commissioners convened. Asset managers such as HSBC Global Asset Management kept the channels of communication open throughout this period, but now that the industry knows where it stands, Curry believes the time is right for professional asset managers to further engage with their clients “ensuring they have the understanding and the strategies to optimise investments under the new rules”.</p>
<h3 id=""european-activity"">European activity</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Europe waits. The key constituents of the regulatory process here are the European Commission (which proposed the changes), the European Council, and the European Parliament. Each player is obliged to formalise its own view of the proposal. To date the only published view is that of the European Commission who drafted the proposed regulation.</p>
<p>In terms of progress, something of a hiatus was witnessed between early April and the end of June as the outgoing European Parliament had been unable to reach a conclusion regarding its position on MMF reform. Sensibly, rather than try to rush through a decision it decided to pass the mantle on to its successor parliament, as voted in by the populace on 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2014.</p>
<p>The new parliament is yet to commence its deliberations on MMF reform but progress is nonetheless being made, notes Curry. Membership of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) has already been agreed. This is an important step as ECON bears responsibility for MMF reform from a European Parliament perspective. This committee had previously seen a fairly balanced set of views with support for both the European Commission’s key proposals and for an alternative approach to these key proposals focused on the use of liquidity fees and redemption gates. The loss of certain key figures, including the Chair of the ECON, the rapporteur (the person appointed as the lead Member of the European Parliament [MEP] on the ‘file’ and the official report author) and three out of the four shadow rapporteurs (the persons appointed to assist the rapporteur) has led to a significant loss of knowledge of this file in the Parliament. The new cohort will need to get up to speed with the issues before making any pronouncements. The expectation, says Curry, is that the work will commence in earnest sometime in September 2014.</p>
<p>Discussion has recently got underway within the European Council which brings together the heads of state or government of every EU country. It requires input from representatives of all 28 member states; coming up with a united position on the proposal will take time as all stakeholders will seek to air their voice in the light of analysis by bodies such as the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p>
<p>The seemingly glacial movement of the overall debate means there is still a lot of work to be done by interested parties in this debate, notes Curry. With a new European Parliament now in situ there will need to be considerable engagement on behalf of the industry with the yet-to-be announced rapporteur and his or her shadows. “I can see the second half of this year being very busy for all those wishing to have their opinions heard,” he comments.</p>
<p>The industry, through the Institutional Money Market Funds Association (IMMFA), has played its part, not just through its own representations but also by arranging events in Brussels, bringing investors, MEPs and attachés together so that interested parties on the regulatory side can hear directly the views and concerns of investors.</p>
<p>Once the proposals have been accepted there will be a transition period for all concerned. Whereas the US is allowing two years, the European Commission’s proposal is for six months. “Our view is that this is significantly shorter than it needs to be for all parties,” states Curry, suggesting that a minimum of 18 to 24 months may be required for migration. “It is unlikely we will see a conclusion before the first half of next year.”</p>
<h3 id=""getting-ready"">Getting ready</h3>
<p>There are a number of similarities between the changes now set for the US market and those proposed for the European industry. The switch to VNAV for part of the US industry and rules around diversification and transparency are, for example, broadly in line with European Commission thinking. But major differences also exist. The SEC makes no provision for the use of capital buffers for funds whereas the EC is proposing a 3% buffer for funds not switching to VNAV. To date there are no plans in Europe for liquidity fees and redemption gates. And where amortised cost accounting for assets with maturities shorter than 60 days is permissible for US MMF investors, there will be no such cost accounting at all in Europe.</p>
<p>Regardless of similarities or differences, there does not appear to be any statement of intent by the regulatory bodies on either side of the Atlantic to align their respective approaches to MMF reform. However, Curry suggests that as the US has been the first to break cover, it will now give one side or other of the debate in Europe “some ammunition”. Although convergence is unlikely, he believes that it would be “unhelpful” for the industry if the two sets of reform diverge substantially. “Obviously we need a situation where both regulatory bodies implement reforms that are necessary; we would not support consistency for consistency’s sake. But we want the right reforms to be in place and if that only happens in one jurisdiction then that is preferable to consistency that is consistently wrong.”</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers may currently feel under siege by regulatory reform; the asset management industry is sympathetic. “We know that there is only a certain amount of time that can be devoted to MMF reform, but we do encourage all investors to engage in the debate and to ensure their voice is heard,” says Curry. “There are various forums that facilitate response but for these to have the most impact our investors, particularly Europe, need to raise their voice at the most opportune moments.”</p>
<p>Asset managers will continue to play a vital role in delivering information and offering informed views on actual and proposed market changes. In this respect, HSBC Global Asset Management has a number of educational approaches including one-to-one sessions, group meetings, ‘treasury breakfasts’ and articles in the industry press. “We have a clear view on these reforms and we are sharing that with our investors,” states Curry.</p>
<p>By encouraging investors to understand the impact of MMF reform, and by individually helping them to formulate the most appropriate response, key players such as HSBC Global Asset Management are offering a solid foundation upon which investment strategies can be built. Ultimately, with the protection that these reforms are designed to offer investors, they are also helping to deliver the industry safely into the next phase of its development.</p></div>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>It’s the early 1970s and the US economy is in a mess. The boom years of the 1960s are fading fast; the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) falls by 40% in the space of just 18 months; economic growth is weakening and unemployment about to hit double digits.</p>
<p>If that is not bad enough, there is also the problem of spiralling inflation. The US Federal Reserve, in a relentless pursuit of full employment, allows the rate of inflation to rise to over 10% by the mid-1970s from a base of just 3-4% the decade previous. Cash preservation therefore poses an enormous challenge for businesses in the US during this period; a challenge made particularly acute by the fact that the interest that banks are allowed to pay to their customers has a fixed limit.</p>
<h3 id=""an-industry-is-born"">An industry is born</h3>
<p>It was against this backdrop that the first money market funds were introduced. The first MMF in the US was established in 1971 by Bruce Bent and Henry Brown. It was created, chiefly, for the purpose of side-stepping a federal banking law, Regulation Q, a rule introduced during the Great Depression which limited the rate of interest banks were permitted pay to depositors. Regulation Q had not been as much of an issue for depositors when inflation was around 3-4% as it was for much of the 1960s. When in the 1970s it began to surge to record highs, however, investors began to seek out alternatives to traditional deposit accounts.</p>
<p>In the commercial paper market, investors bypass banks altogether by lending directly to borrowers. The first MMFs were established when brokers and other financial institutions began to pool investors’ funds into the purchase of commercial paper and other short-term securities. MMFs could not guarantee the same level of safety as banks with FDIC-insured deposits, but, by residing outside of the banking sector – and so beyond the purview of banking regulators – they were able to attract an increasing number of investors through the offer of higher rates.</p>
<p>Despite the legal classification, MMFs like the Reserve Primary Fund, shared some traits in common with regular corporate bank accounts. To begin with, security and liquidity were the top priorities. From day one, the purpose was to provide investors with easily accessible, cash equivalent assets which meant restricting portfolios to short-term securities representing very high-quality, liquid, debt and monetary instruments. And, by matching the term structure of the portfolios assets with the term structure of its liabilities, funds were able to guarantee investors that their money would be there to withdraw as and when they needed it.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker – who many years later drafted as part of the Dodd-Frank regulation the eponymous ‘Volker Rule’ – liberated the banks by revoking the limit on interest payments to customers. Investors quickly began to flee MMFs, pushing their funds into new, FDIC-insured high interest savings accounts set up by the banks. As Chart 1 illustrates, MMFs took a big hit from the change, losing close to 25% of their assets in the space of just a few months. Clearly, funds needed to find another way to compete against the banks.</p>

</figure>
<p>The solution for the MMF industry was to persuade the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow them to adopt a new accounting treatment that made the value of their portfolios appear more stable than it really was. A constant net asset value (CNAV) which prices to two decimal places, helped make the funds a more attractive investment. This was particularly the case for corporates, the biggest MMF investors, who hold large sums of cash on a short-term basis and want to avoid dramatic fluctuations in value. But, as we will see, the special accounting treatment MMFs were permitted to use would, later on, become a target for regulators in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<h3 id=""banks-enter-the-game"">Banks enter the game</h3>
<p>Throughout the subsequent decade, the volume of assets under management in the MMF industry continued to grow and, by the late 1980s and early 1990s, banks that had been casting an envious eye decided that they too wanted a piece of the action. The problem for banks, however, was that in the US they were still prohibited under the provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act 1933 from combining their banking operations with a business in securities. If a bank wanted to offer a money fund, there was only one legal means for it to do so: it had to outsource either the administration or the distribution of the fund.</p>
<p>New, third-party organisations quickly began to emerge to perform these activities on the banks’ behalf. One of the largest of these, Concord Financial, was the company at which Ed Baldry, now the CEO in EMEA at ICD-Portal, began his career. “Our job was to go to these banks and, in addition to providing the administration, distribution or transfer agency functions, educate them around selling their institutional funds” explains Baldry. In fact, the large Wall Street banks – Citi and Bank of America, for instance – that entered the money market fund business at this time experienced little difficulty in finding clients. Banks, after all, were also the principal source of finance for many corporates and this gave them a clear advantage over non-bank funds. “For corporate investors I think that it was a fairly straightforward decision,” says Baldry. “‘Do I give my money to a bank or do I give it to another fund that has never done anything for me?’.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly then, the bank share of the MMF business continued, with the help of intermediaries, to expand throughout the 1990s. Finally, after the Graam-Leach-Biley Act 1999 swept away the final remnants of Glass-Steagall, banking institutions, now sanctioned to own and control both bank and non-bank financial entities, began to assume a more direct involvement in the industry. In the years that followed, the assets under the management of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies rose sharply (see Chart 2) and continued to grow right up until the recent financial crisis.</p>

<h3 id=""breaking-the-buck"">Breaking the buck</h3>
<p>Prior to the 2008 financial crisis only one relatively diminutive fund had officially ‘broken the buck’; a colloquial expression used for when the capital price of a fund breaches tolerance levels and thus forces the fund to restate the actual share price below 1.00. But this fact only made the events that came to pass in the autumn of 2008 seem all the more shocking and catastrophic.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 16<sup>th</sup> September 2008, the US’ oldest MMF, the Reserve Primary Fund, began to inform investors that they would lose money. The Reserve had made a decision to own a huge amount of Lehman Brothers commercial paper. After these securities became, in September 2008, worth less than the paper they were written on, the fund was left with no choice but to revalue shares. Instead of each share being valued at $1 for every dollar invested, the fund was forced to tell customers that shares were only worth 97 cents. It was the first time in 14 years that one of these seemingly super-safe investment vehicles had incurred losses and news of the impending $64.8 billion firesale caused shockwaves in the financial world. Suddenly MMF investors became incredibly anxious and, as they sought to redeem their holdings, a large number of funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on redemptions. Investor conviction that MMFs were no riskier than regular bank accounts now appeared to be gone for good. “That really changed the landscape forever,” remarks Baldry.</p>
<p>In the space of just a few days following the Lehman Brother’s default, redemptions across the MMF industry had reached an astonishing $300 billion. The speed and scale of the exodus was so severe that the US government was left with little choice but to intervene by providing unlimited insurance to all money market fund depositors. A number of other funds in Europe were also underwritten by their respective governments.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-backlash"">Regulatory backlash</h3>
<p>The story of the MMF industry – particularly in the US – is closely entwined, if not inseparable, from the evolution of financial regulation going right back to the Great Depression. Now, in the wake of a new global financial crisis, fresh regulatory proposals seem likely to drive change every bit as momentous as the industry changes seen in the past.</p>
<p>Government intervention may have brought a halt to the market panic and even saved the industry from probable implosion, but political leaders across the globe have been working ever since to ensure that funds are able to stand on their own feet in a future crisis. In the US, the SEC’s first move was to introduce changes to Rule 2a-7 that established stricter quality and liquidity requirements on funds. But more proposals were soon to follow.</p>
<p>In June 2013, the SEC offered two alternatives for further reform. Under the first option, institutional or ‘prime’ MMFs would be required to transact at a floating NAV, rather using amortised cost to value their portfolio securities. The second course of action suggested that MMFs could continue to use their accounting treatment of preference, but would be required to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates in times of market stress. In Europe, meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) has been weighing up the introduction of similar accounting proposals in tandem with compulsory capital buffers set at 3%.</p>
<p>The suggested reforms have resulted in much public debate and, in the case of the NAV proposal, strong opposition from market lobbyists. Corporate end-users, in particular, have raised concerns regarding the impact that an industry-wide switch to VNAV (variable net asset value) might have upon their investment strategies. Large numbers of corporate treasurers, both in the US and Europe, prefer the simplicity of the tax and accounting treatment under CNAV, and industry bodies have repeatedly cited empirical studies that suggest the form of accounting treatment will make little material difference to the behaviour of MMF investors in crisis scenarios.</p>
<p>No final decision has yet been made in either jurisdiction on the way to proceed. However, industry experts expect something to be agreed by the respective regulatory and legislative bodies within the next 12 months. Should the regulators choose to disregard industry concerns and press ahead with a mandatory switch to VNAV it is likely that we will see a seismic shift in investor preferences, with 20-30% moving away from MMFs into other investment vehicles according to estimates by the credit ratings agency Moody’s. It might even be a greater exodus than that. In the Association of Financial Professionals (AFP) 2013 liquidity survey, 65% of respondents indicated their intention to reduce or sell off their MMF holdings entirely if CNAV funds are prohibited.</p>
<h3 id=""consolidation"">Consolidation</h3>
<p>These are uncertain times then for the $2.7 trillion dollar industry which has become a mainstay of the financial world. For fund managers, the challenge of managing the prospect of changes to the way the industry is regulated has been compounded by the pressure of ultra-low interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic. The twin pressures of rates and regulation appear to driving the industry full circle.</p>
<p>Deregulation at the turn of the millennium helped banks assume greater involvement in the industry by allowing them, for the first time, to establish subsidiaries in the securities business. The number of banks in the MMF business multiplied in the wake of that change, but now the trend appears to be going into reverse. Consolidation is now the name of the game.</p>
<p>In the past year, we have seen Lloyds Bank announce the sale of SWIP to Aberdeen Asset Management, Barclays selling their fund BlackRock, and RBS offloading theirs on Goldman Sachs. Once again the winds of change are sweeping through the industry; only this time they are blowing in a different direction.</p></div>

<p>Investors in the short-term money markets, already coping with the continued low-rate environment, have also been subjected to reduced money market issuance over the last few years, depleting the pool of suitable assets to invest in. Whilst life is slowly coming back to the sector as economies begin to emerge from the gloom – and measures taken by certain authorities to provide relief start to take effect – the fact remains that the short-term money markets continue to feel unsettled.</p>
<p>Money market funds can help treasurers deal with the changing nature of the short-term money markets and professional fund managers can provide the essential understanding and analysis investors require to steer their way through the uncertainty, particularly if policy dictates that they no longer have access to some of the issuers they previously felt most comfortable with.</p>
<h3 id=""supply-uncertainty"">Supply uncertainty</h3>
<h4 id=""regulation"">Regulation</h4>
<p>The reduction of supply may be attributed to a number of factors. Regulatory developments have played a key role in transforming the markets over the years and in particular Basel III liquidity requirements. But liquidity ratios contained within Basel III will see banks seeking longer-term funding, reducing the amount of short-term issuance and making certain short-term deposits less attractive. Even though they are not required to comply with the requirements until 2017, many banks are pre-emptively making the changes, notes Barry Harbison, Senior Product Specialist, Liquidity, HSBC Global Asset Management, Americas. “Every financial quarter we are seeing more banks voluntarily getting their positions in place to comply with the requirements, potentially further reducing supply in the short-term space.”</p>
<p>As the Basel III deadline looms, the progressive reduction in opportunities for treasurers will gain momentum. Banks will necessarily revisit their treatment of various deposits, and businesses will pay for those changes accordingly; deposits that do not help the banks meet their liquidity requirements will either fall well short on acceptable returns or even present negative rates. “A corporate treasurer will typically be dealing with a fairly narrow group of approved issuers,” Harbison notes. “The constraints applied by regulations such as Basel III exacerbate the issue.”</p>
<p>To a certain degree, supply in the US market has been impacted by regulatory reform of the repo market, suggests John Chiodi, Chief Investment Officer Liquidity, HSBC Global Asset Management, Americas. Stemming from the failure of Lehman Brothers, investors and issuers are now required to match their repo agreements by midday. Where previously it was an end-of-day operation this is now deemed too late for the regulators to be able to assist a stressed institution. The intention of earlier matching is well-founded but, notes Chiodi, “the fact that the majority of repos are now taken care of prior to noon leaves investors fewer options later in the day”. Other US-specific issues include the reduction of Treasury issuance, possibly based on factors such as increased tax revenues or even continued dividend payments from mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which both seek billions of dollars in cash from the US Treasury Department every quarter, mostly to pay a required 10% dividend on preferred shares that goes straight back to the Treasury).</p>
<h4 id=""monetary-policy"">Monetary policy</h4>
<p>Eurozone-specific factors accounting for a reduction in supply have included the European Central Bank’s (ECB) long-term refinancing operation (LTRO). This was intended to provide a liquidity buffer for banks holding illiquid assets to maintain inter-bank lending (and other loan origination). It had the unintended consequence of removing the short-term bank paper supply as banks favoured cheaper longer-term funding. However, Olivier Gayno, CIO, Wealth and EMEA Liquidity, HSBC Global Asset Management, notes that recent more favourable market conditions have meant that many banks have paid back on the LTRO “sooner than expected” causing short-term inter-bank borrowing rates to increase.</p>
<p>Although LTRO did take supply out of the market this is now perhaps returning. But it is not over yet. “We must keep in mind the fact that if the economic recovery in the Eurozone falters, the ECM might launch another LTRO; it is something openly being discussed,” warns Gayno.</p>
<h4 id=""credit-concerns"">Credit concerns</h4>
<p>Another ongoing issue being faced by investors is the credit-rating changes that have pushed some issuers outside the boundaries of approved lists for some investors. Whilst increased regulatory pressure has decreased supply, these measures have also served to improve the credit profile of some banks. In some instances this causes investors to consider investing in issuers who had previously been removed from approved lists. The strengthening profile of some banks may see them return to favour for individual investors, says Harbison, but in the manner of Pandora’s Box, now that the topic of institutional credit ratings has been raised to such a high profile, investors are “mindful” that they can and do change. The removal of an issuer from an investor’s approved list – which typically contains just five or six preferred providers – may still mean it is reluctant to add it back onto the list if and when ratings improve.</p>
<p>In a diminishing pool of providers, the security of diversification becomes increasingly difficult. If this is the case, treasurers must consider a wider range of potential issuers than in the past. For example, they may need to seek out non-US issuers in USD, and issuers from outside the Eurozone issuing in euro, from countries with perceived strength such as Canada, Australia, the Nordics, the UK and some of the stronger Asian countries. There may be more confidence now in the credibility of ratings agencies, notes Chiodi, but exposure of treasurers to a wider market generates an increased need for market intelligence and independent credit analysis, resources and skills which are not on-tap in most treasuries.</p>
<h3 id=""indirect-relief"">Indirect relief</h3>
<p>There is some light at the end of the tunnel. Some changes in money market fund supply are providing relief, albeit indirect, for some investors both in terms of supply and rates, comments Harbison. The ongoing roll out of the US Federal Reserve’s reverse repurchase facility is increasing eligible investments for US money market funds; money which is thus not buying up some of the other short-term supply. And by setting a floor on overnight rates it has had a knock-on impact on the rest of the short-term markets as there needs to be some premium over the ‘risk-free’ Treasury rate. Treasury Floating Rate Note issuance has seen prime money market funds become increasingly interested given the reduction in supply elsewhere and given that they are considered highly liquid. Reduction in the Fed’s asset purchase programme (so-called ‘tapering’) has also seen a gradual increase in the amount of repo collateral available, also indirectly opening up availability for investors.</p>
<h3 id=""money-market-funds-finding-the-balance"">Money market funds: finding the balance</h3>
<p>In a rapidly changing market, there is an ever greater reliance on thorough credit research and market knowledge. Investors should consider the strengths of a money market fund in this context.</p>
<h4 id=""credit-analysis"">Credit analysis</h4>
<p>“Credit analysis is a fundamental part of the money market fund solution,” says Harbison. Its value is clear where investors experience reservations regarding the strength of the rating agencies’ decisions about existing providers. But, he adds, it takes on a new level of importance with the introduction of new issuers to a portfolio. Whereas some treasurers may invest in government or treasury-type issuances to avoid all or most risk, others may see what looks like an attractive rate from an issuer with which they are not familiar but in reality could be exposing the business to more risk than they understand. “From a money market perspective, we have the capacity to offer thorough credit analysis and to find the right balance for the client, setting credit and maturity limits appropriate to that issuer,” says Harbison.</p>
<h4 id=""diversification"">Diversification</h4>
<p>In a market environment that has in recent times demonstrated a propensity for rapid change, if a treasurer were to lose just one or two approved issuers from a typical list of five or six it still represents a significant threat to short-term availability.</p>
<p>For Harbison, a fund manager’s capacity to analyse and offer an approved list of 100 or more issuers not only creates a broader potential supply than would be available to many (or indeed most) investors but also lessens the impact of a reduction in supply of certain issuers.</p>
<h4 id=""liquidity"">Liquidity</h4>
<p>The Basel III liquidity requirements are pushing banks away from certain types of short-term funding. This may mean that investors face a choice between overnight deposits at unattractive rates or longer-term deposits with reduced access. “Another key strength of a money market fund is that it can offer daily access to investors, which is typically not the case for fixed term deposits or other similar products,” Harbison explains. For Chiodi that means investors comparing one- or seven-day direct investments with a money market fund that can have up to a 60-day weighted average maturity.</p>
<p>In a constantly changing short-term investment environment, where uncertainty prevails, money market funds can offer treasurers a level of independent credit analysis, portfolio diversification and liquidity that could strike a balance between yield and protection. That is an offer the alternative short-term solutions may find hard to match let alone beat.</p>

<h5 id=""neil-stirling-treasury-dealer-weir-group"">Neil Stirling, Treasury Dealer, Weir Group, responded:</h5>
<p>If the proposed changes by the regulators are implemented and money market funds (MMFs) are forced to switch to variable net asset value (VNAV) then we can see this having serious implications with the likelihood that we will stop using MMFs going forward.</p>
<p>Currently, constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs provide a very useful cash management tool and one that we favour using at Weir Group. This is primarily because we view them as a low risk, secure investment, giving counterparty diversification and easy access to our cash on a daily basis. Furthermore, we value the credit ratings provided by the rating agencies – both for the fund itself as well as the underlying assets – as they provide us with an independent evaluation and credit analysis.</p>
<p>Despite the current benefits offered by MMFs, the proposals, including the 3% capital buffer for fund providers, seem to suggest that all funds will be forced to switch to VNAV. I personally cannot envisage how fund providers would be able to continue to offer a CNAV fund in its current form, due to the higher costs associated with this and especially in the current low yield environment.</p>
<p>If all MMFs are switched to VNAV then there are a number of implications that may lead to us no longer investing in the funds. Firstly, with security of principal of paramount importance, a large problem would be posed by the fact that we would no longer be able to guarantee a full return on our investment. In addition, accounting issues may arise as we currently classify MMFs as cash or cash equivalents and if the funds were required to switch to VNAV we may not be able to continue in this way. Also, with fund providers required to mark-to-market their assets and the operational issues that this may bring, the high liquidity currently offered from CNAV funds may significantly reduce. This would have implications for corporates who want to invest in low risk, highly liquid funds. Finally, the removal of a fund’s credit rating will cause a problem for corporates like ourselves who rely on credit ratings for our investment policies.</p>
<p>Should the changes occur, we will need to revisit out investment policy to consider whether the use of MMFs is a suitable tool for managing our liquidity. Should the decision be made to no longer invest in MMFs, then I expect we would initially revert back to using bank deposits for our surplus cash as an alternative.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I can see no advantages of a switch to VNAV from a corporates perspective. If the regulations are imposed as being suggested then I believe this will have serious implications for corporates investing in MMFs going forward – which will have a knock-on effect for the MMF industry as a whole.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Britta Hion"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/02/2014-02-tt-02-qa-britta-hion-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""britta-hion-head-of-emea-corporate-cash-sales-blackrock"">Britta Hion, Head of EMEA Corporate Cash Sales, BlackRock, commented:</h5>
<p>As extensive debate continues globally with regard to the regulatory reform of MMFs, it is prudent to consider that this cash investment vehicle in Europe may be required to move its accounting methodology from CNAV to VNAV. Should this happen, the impact on corporate treasurers could be significant but we do not believe it will be unmanageable or insurmountable. Further, any imposed change will almost certainly include a long lead time, giving treasurers time to adjust and adapt.</p>
<p>While it may appear a drastic change, we expect a VNAV MMF will be very similar to a CNAV MMF. At BlackRock, we would continue to manage our MMF portfolios with the same credit and risk process resulting in an approved list of securities and counterparties. Therefore, we do not anticipate the composition of our funds to change and there will be no change to the style of investing we employ. We will continue to minimise any mark-to-market movements in the NAV and meet investment expectations.</p>
<p>Enhanced reporting and disclosure over the past few years has provided investors with increased knowledge about their MMF investments and most industry providers have been publishing their mark-to-market NAVs daily for some time. This has demonstrated how little the VNAV fluctuates on a daily basis, highlighting the conservative nature of the underlying investments.</p>
<p>More importantly, there may be some potential operational implications for treasury functions to consider such as tax and accounting treatment as well as the trading and settlement cycles of funds. However, it is currently too early to predict the outcome of the regulatory process and in the meantime, fund providers, industry bodies and accounting firms should work together to minimise impact on the corporate investor.</p>
<p>Change also signals opportunity and throughout this process many managers and end investors are working together to explore innovative solutions in the cash investment space – such as separately managed accounts or different fund structures. Even if the industry does switch to VNAV, we believe that MMFs will continue to provide many shareholders with an important source of short-term liquidity and investment diversification. We remain committed to the MMF industry with the goal of providing an investment vehicle that meets the needs of our clients whilst preserving the benefits to the broader financial ecosystem.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Matthew Tatnell"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/02/2014-02-tt-02-qa-matthew-tatnell-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""matthew-tatnell-head-of-liquidity-aviva-investors"">Matthew Tatnell, Head of Liquidity, Aviva Investors, answered:</h5>
<p>A number of reforms to MMFs are currently being pursued by European regulators aiming to prevent another bank run similar to 2008. The most significant is the proposal that all CNAV funds start carrying a 3% capital buffer or switch their fund to a VNAV basis. We believe this is very likely to force MMF sponsors to switch funds from CNAV to VNAV.</p>
<p>In a CNAV fund, investors are incentivised to pull their money out first under extremely stressed conditions. If they wait there is a danger the fund ‘breaks the buck’ further down the line and access to cash is delayed until the fund can be wound down in an orderly manner. In contrast, a VNAV fund can essentially lift the lid off the pressure cooker, as the price of the fund will rise and fall depending on market conditions, removing the incentive for investors to pull their money out first. We believe this significantly reduces the risk of an investor run on the fund.</p>
<p>In the short term, investors are unlikely to see many differences switching from a CNAV to a VNAV fund. For example, the inability to obtain same day liquidity is often cited as an effect that investors will experience should the switch occur. Yet at Aviva Investors we have been running a VNAV fund for five years and have been able to offer this to our clients. I therefore believe, if asked, the vast majority of our investors would say they have seen little difference from investing in a CNAV fund.</p>
<p>If all the changes are enforced, then corporates may see other effects. For example, the European Commission is proposing a ban on MMF sponsors soliciting an external credit rating. Investors may be affected by this change if they have an internal credit or investment policy, which states that an external rating is needed for any fund they invest in. Under these new conditions investors may wish to rewrite their investment policies and possibly place a greater emphasis on due diligence – making sure that their MMF sponsor has policies and an infrastructure in place suitable for managing their money.</p>
<p>An alternative to MMFs is something we have seen become increasingly popular over the last six to nine months with our investors who ask their investment manager to manage their cash on a segregated or direct basis with banks or corporations. This strategy has two key advantages: firstly, it frees the investment manager from the constraints of a MMF to explore new ways to obtain higher returns on their investors’ cash. Secondly, the strategy is bespoke, so investors can personalise their requirements and continue to enjoy piece of mind that their investment manager is using specialists to perform detailed credit assessments on their investments – after all it could take many lifetimes to recover a defaulted investment in the current low yield environment!</p>
<p>The proposals are not set in stone, yet the outlook surrounding MMFs is quite negative. We believe it would be of benefit to investors, the money markets, and the industry as a whole if the proposed regulations were softened in certain areas. Despite this, I do remain positive about the future of MMFs. Even if the full range of changes is implemented, the basic requirements for treasurers who have cash to invest will remain the same. Because of this, I believe we will continue to have a market that is thriving.</p>

</div>
<h3 id=""an-everyday-phenomenon"">An everyday phenomenon</h3>
<p>New approaches to cash management and investments in China must be sought if corporate treasurers are to leverage the progressive liberalisation of the remninbi (RMB).</p>
<p>Not a day goes by without another statistic published that points to China’s fast ascent to global significance in international trade and, in turn, to global economics. But the opportunity only started to become a reality once China had embarked on its steady but relentless journey of financial liberalisation a few years ago.</p>
<p>Throughout 2012 and 2013 a number of key regulatory changes were unleashed as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) or central bank drove further RMB internationalisation. A simplified cross-border settlement process, further exchange and interest rate liberalisation by widening the RMB FX trading range and removal of loan interest rate controls are a reality. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) too has been transforming administrative controls that will lead to greater consistency and transparency via a number of reforms to current account and capital account rules.</p>
<p>As China’s relevance and importance to international companies has increased, so the RMB has risen in importance for trade settlement. According to SWIFT, in October 2013 RMB was the world’s second most-used trade finance currency (some way behind the US dollar but significant nonetheless). It remains the 12<sup>th</sup> largest currency for payments globally (compared to 35<sup>th</sup> three years ago).</p>
<p>As the market has opened up, more companies have started to hold and utilise RMB cash balances – both onshore and offshore – for payments and receipts. The reasons for this are clear; doing so can improve FX risk management, potentially reduce costs, better align the company to its Chinese customers or suppliers payment preferences and, in turn, provide incentives for better trade terms.</p>
<p>Total RMB deposits onshore in mainland China stand at RMB 103 trillion and in Hong Kong (the largest offshore market) stand at RMB 826 billion (both as at November 2013), a little over 11% of total deposits across all currencies in Hong Kong<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id=""the-evolution-and-expansion-of-cash-management-techniques"">The evolution and expansion of cash management techniques</h3>
<p>The development of China’s financial and commercial infrastructure adds tools and flexibility to enhance corporate working capital and cash management practices both in China and offshore operations. With the gradual relaxation on capital and currency controls, China is encouragong international companies to set up business operations and treasury centres onshore. Many of these enhancements have been managed through pilot schemes launched through a limited group of companies and banks.</p>
<p>Until recently, corporate cash and liquidity management in China has been largely domestic, in terms of the payments system and tools, liquidity management structures (such as domestic cash concentration) and how treasury functions operate. These practices and tools have evolved considerably over the past two years in terms of enhancements to domestic and to cross-border and offshore cash management.</p>
<p>The most significant developments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border trade settlement:</h5>
<p>Schemes to streamline cross-border payments and receivables processing using netting and gross-in/gross-out settlement methods in pay-on-behalf/receive-on-behalf (POBO/ROBO) models; reduction of documentary requirements; and using technology to streamline manual processes. End-to-end electronic payment processing has been piloted, allowing electronic submission of supporting documentation. These schemes will allow payments into/out of China to be processed more efficiently, promptly and with greater control, visibility and centralisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border liquidity optimisation:</h5>
<p>Pilot initiatives are being rolled out to support cross-border sweeping and intra-group cross-border lending. These allow treasurers to manage surplus cash in China more efficiently, with internal funding optimisation achieved through linking onshore positions with their international treasury structures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""options-for-the-investment-of-surplus-rmb"">Options for the investment of surplus RMB</h3>
<p>With the expansion of cash and liquidity management tools, and the increase in RMB currency balances held, treasurers naturally focus on how short-term balances are managed and invested within their usual risk management framework and investment policies. A number of options exist in various offshore markets such as London and Hong Kong, but what about RMB balances that remain in mainland China?</p>
<h4 id=""deposit-options-in-china"">Deposit options in China</h4>
<p>RMB deposits sitting in bank accounts in China currently provide a return largely determined by existing central bank regulations which provide a baseline rate commonly known as the PBOC deposit rate. See boxed example.</p>
<p>A further option (typically for longer-term cash) is structured deposits. These are arranged with additional terms, usually incorporating a derivative transaction allowing investors to hedge against movements in interest rates or FX. Tenors vary.</p>
<p>There has been commentary on liquidity levels in the China banking sector recently, with volatility in interbank rates in China towards the end of 2013; for example the seven-day repo rate increasing from 4.5% to 8.5% during December. The central bank has however provided liquidity since then as part of its normal operations and rates fell in January.</p>
<h4 id=""onshore-rmb-liquidity-management"">Onshore RMB liquidity management</h4>
<p>The regulatory framework in China currently does not permit inter-company lending. The only way companies can lend to one another is under the ‘entrusted loan’ framework used by banks in China to help companies structure their cash pooling solutions. Apart from using bank deposits to generate a return, companies with excess RMB liquidity in China continue to explore onshore RMB liquidity management structures (such as RMB cash concentration/pooling) to optimise their onshore RMB working capital amongst group entities and as a means of reducing external bank borrowing needs onshore.</p>
<h4 id=""rmb-cross-border-lending"">RMB cross-border lending</h4>
<p>Companies are now permitted to lend their excess RMB liquidity in China to related companies offshore. A transfer-pricing mechanism ensures transactions are maintained at arms-length. This option offers the opportunity to mobilise RMB excess liquidity internationally to be utilised as an internal source of funding, reduce external indebtedness or participate in centralised investment programmes. Some companies might not find this model optimal in the absence of ways to redeploy liquidity more efficiently, and considering RMB deposit rates and returns in China remain attractive.</p>
<h4 id=""money-market-funds"">Money market funds</h4>
<p>An onshore legal entity in China can also invest in an onshore RMB money market fund (MMF). The industry in China is just over ten years old, with assets under management of RMB 883 billion (c. $146 billion) at the end of December 2013<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>. There are over 100 MMFs in the country, falling into two categories; funds provided by international asset managers (and managed similarly to those offered in Europe and the US), and funds offered by local Chinese asset managers who follow the risk profile set out in local domestic regulation.</p>
<p>MMFs in China can offer investors a valuable complement to existing bank structured deposits or reverse repo transactions. They invest in a basket of short-term money market instruments targeting a liquid or low-duration portfolio, offering next-day liquidity. The range of issuers and asset types in China is lower than money markets in the US and Europe. However, a typical fund offered by an international manager includes investments in Chinese government bonds, Central Bank notes, PBOC bills, repurchase agreements backed by Chinese sovereign debt, deposits and other investments from the three agency banks that are 100% owned by the Chinese government, as well as deposits and other investments issued by the “big four” banks.</p>

</figure>
<p>MMFs in China can provide a higher net-return compared to short-term bank deposits – by way of illustration, and for comparison to the deposit table above, the average net returns for the month of December 2013 of all AAA-rated RMB MMFs was 4.339% per annum<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> (there are currently five RMB MMFs that hold the local AAA rating in China). There are two reasons why this can be the case; firstly, dividend income from a MMF is free from corporate income tax in China (compared to a 25% income tax on bank deposits); secondly, the interest paid on bank deposits in China is regulated, whereas the majority of investments placed by a MMF are not, and are therefore driven by the market and so returns can potentially be higher or lower.</p>
<h3 id=""what-next-for-rmb-and-china"">What next for RMB and China?</h3>
<p>As financial liberalisation continues and accelerates, it will become easier to do business in China. As more schemes are rolled out, and existing pilots are broadened, corporate treasurers should look to create greater efficiency and control over their RMB and foreign currency transactions and balances. Confidence remains that the RMB will become fully convertible in the next five years and, as markets deepen, greater choice for investment options are expected, including for offshore RMB investment options in the future.</p>
<p>Given the pace and complexity of change, it is important to stay informed and to work with the right banks and asset managers. These should not only understand the local market and be actively involved in new schemes as they are piloted and rolled out, but also have international reach to provide a consistent service globally, enabling companies to connect their cash management across the markets and currencies in which they deal.</p>

Short Term Investments,Balancing investment return and liquidity cover, Published: Nov 2013 ,,"<div class=""gs-grid__col gs-grid__col-1-10 gs-grid__col--expand"" style="""">

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Establishing a methodology that enables a treasurer to better understand and react to corporate liquidity requires considerable thought and discussion; there is no one-size fits all solution because no two sets of business needs are exactly alike. That said, it is possible for an individual corporate to construct an accurate picture of how its cash and investment needs can be balanced for both safety and return without losing liquidity cover.</p>
<p>Cash is still king in the eyes of many; it offers flexibility and independence from financial institutions. It’s not surprising then that, as the economic crisis developed, those treasurers that could hold on to cash did so with increasing enthusiasm. “That’s not unreasonable given that there was an increasing fear-factor in the markets,” comments Stephen Houghton, Director, Financial Risk Advisory, Lloyds Bank. With the chief alternative form of short-term liquidity being bank overdraft/loans in the form of revolving credit facilities (RCFs), the fact that many banks had either scaled back on the offering of these facilities or pulled out of the market altogether after the crisis, stock-piling cash was the most logical action in the face of such uncertainty.</p>
<p>For the corporates holding cash, the instinctive reaction to keep investments short, and thus liquid, remains compelling. But Houghton puts the case for revisiting this strategy, arguing that if a balance can be struck between liquidity and return, the treasurer will be ahead of the curve.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-sources-and-uses"">Cash sources and uses</h3>
<p>In order to understand how such a balance can be achieved, the first stage is to fully determine the sources and uses of cash within the business and how these can be impacted by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Business uncertainty (eg future earnings, costs, unexpected capital expenditure (capex)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market uncertainty (eg FX translation of foreign earnings, floating interest expense).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Typical sources of liquidity include cash (generated from operations), interest income, revolving credit facilities (RCF), issuance of long-term debt, equity and cash received from hedging activities. A corporate cash balance can be deployed for operational, reserve or strategic purposes and may find its way towards covering typical business costs such as production, labour, real estate, finance, sales, tax, dividends, capex and energy bills.</p>
<p>For some businesses cash flow is cyclical and potentially difficult to balance; for example, the travel sector has fairly well-defined peaks and troughs and many retailers need to build up inventory, pre-season, which must be paid for, before revenue is generated. Failure to adequately manage liquidity can see an otherwise healthy business suffer potentially severe consequences. Tapping reserves of cash may be the solution to protect a business from such adversity, but often other forms of liquidity are called upon.</p>
<p>If a business is unable to generate sufficient cash then it can obtain long-term funding using two of the most common methods: it can either seek equity capital (which can be seen as the ultimate ‘cash buffer’ in that there is no requirement to pay it back and losses are absorbed by the investors), or it can borrow. The latter could be as a long-term loan via the banks or capital markets which, although providing funding certainty over an extended period, can prove more expensive, especially if that cash is intended only as a buffer.</p>
<p>The second option is short-term debt – either through a bank facility such as a RCF, or, if the corporate is large enough, through issuance of commercial paper. The advantage of the RCF is that it can be drawn down and repaid as required and, although this flexibility means it can be expensive, it is nonetheless useful as a short-term solution and one that is almost universally employed. However, notes Houghton, some companies use it as a semi-permanent funding option (and in some cases, their only source of debt) deployed alongside cash from long-term debt as a means of stabilising any seasonality they may have in their cash cycle or as the short-term response to any unexpected outlay. This is not an issue in itself in benign credit market conditions but the scaling back of credit provision by banks after the credit crisis now leaves treasurers with the problem of less certainty around the availability of refinancing in future, which means a more diverse funding strategy is desirable going forward.</p>
<p>Indeed, taking this approach now practically requires businesses to be perpetually in a good state of credit, which clearly is not always the case: if the corporate needs the facility it could be they are in a very difficult financial state and thus may not be able to re-finance the debt when it comes due. At the very least, Houghton says, it is advisable for a corporate to ensure that its bank facilities do not all come up for renewal at the same time, as failure to roll-over debt could prove disastrous. Fortunately the capital markets are increasingly active and other longer-term funding sources such as retail bonds and US private placements are now making serious headway out of the crisis.</p>

<h3 id=""how-much-and-when"">How much and when</h3>
<p>The skill and judgement of the treasurer rests in understanding how much, and when, funding is needed and the most appropriate instruments to use at the point of execution. For a cash generating business, the treasurer must additionally identify the value that cash has if it is retained as a liquidity buffer, to what degree that value may change over time and whether it may be better to re-deploy that cash.</p>
<p>Houghton notes that, historically, hanging on to cash has been seen as a buffer in many industry sectors. For those that hoard cash without considering the true impact of their action, he has a word of warning: “low returns from short-term cash investment can act as a drag on profitability”.</p>
<p>A corporate that has borrowed will face a ‘cost of carry’ on stockpiled cash simply because the rate of return on that cash, when invested short term eg overnight, will possibly be much lower than the cost of borrowing. The downward pressure on yield on short-term (less than 90-day) investments caused by bank regulations such as ILAS in the UK and the Basel III initiative, will maintain this for some time to come.</p>
<p>For corporates that have large cash balances, traditional finance theory suggests that money should be returned to investors, in the form of a dividend or share buy back, or used to repay longer-term debt (and save interest costs). However, given the unpredictable nature of the markets and uncertainty of future credit availability, should the corporate then need this cash, going back to investors with a cash call or rights issue may appear to be bad planning, or worse, the corporate may not be successful in raising the amount required.</p>
<p>An alternative option, says Houghton, is to retain the cash in the business, but move it out of short-term investments into those that potentially yield more – term deposits, longer-term government securities or high quality corporate bond portfolios – effectively creating an investment fund whose liquidity and risk can be defined to improve yield but not by unduly taking more risk to capital or sacrificing too much liquidity. Since the credit crisis, treasurers still take the view that, even if they only need half the cash they are sitting on they are only prepared to invest short, ‘just in case’. This, he comments, is often because they have not fully considered how they may use their cash to best advantage. “Treasurers may not have thought about optimally placing their cash because the reward of more yield may not counter the downside of tying up ‘too much’ cash and then finding they need it.”</p>
<h3 id=""calculating-excess-and-adding-stress"">Calculating excess and adding stress</h3>
<p>Industries that have long-term liabilities, such as the insurance sector, have to make their investment portfolio work in order to meet their continuing obligations (often setting premiums according to anticipated returns). Corporate treasurers seemingly do not face the same pressure and thus may not see their cash in terms of investment opportunities. “But, in order to optimise the use of cash in the ‘investment option’ that Lloyd’s are proposing, they will now need to”, says Houghton. To determine how much could be deployed in such a way, a treasurer must start by calculating the corporate’s total cash liquidity requirement over the short and medium term (considering any RCFs or other credit facilities that act as a cash substitute for liquidity purposes) and then determine whether they currently have cash that is in excess of this requirement that they could invest for strategic purposes.</p>
<p>Internally reviewing and planning the sources and uses of cash both operationally and strategically may require the input of many functions because it may involve consideration not just of cash generation but also of future strategic planning elements such as M&amp;A activity, debt re-financing, or major capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Having calculated how much cash will be generated and needed over a given period, it is essential then to stress-test the results to see the effect of volatility in the underlying assumptions used to generate the future cash balance of the corporate. This could be caused by, for example, lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, unexpected capex or worsening of working capital requirements. The approach will also need to take into account the likelihood of these events happening, according to certain assumptions and based on historical internal data (such as the historical range of actual costs, revenues and capex) and external data (including interest and FX rates or commodity price projections).</p>
<p>By using the worst case level in the possible range of these factors, a projection of the corporate’s ‘worst case cash balance’ over time can be constructed, which can then be used to determine how much of the current cash balance can be invested and for how long. “The idea”, says Houghton “is that the corporate does not need liquidity for the term of these investments and so can invest in less liquid investments and for a longer time horizon to improve returns with greater confidence, a confidence brought about by having a better liquidity model of the business”.</p>
<h3 id=""modelling-projections"">Modelling projections</h3>
<p>This approach, therefore, not only requires an understanding of how much of the current cash balance is needed and how much can be invested but, says Houghton, from a planning perspective, of how much might be needed and the extent to which other medium-term factors such as future M&amp;A, debt needs and capital expenditure need to be planned in. A corporate may typically build a cash flow forecast model to combine the future sources and uses of cash within the business into a projection of the future cash balance, which is then used by treasury to determine its liquidity management approach.</p>
<p>As described above, Lloyds seeks to take this process a step further by stress testing and factoring in a broad range of market uncertainties. “If the corporate has debt linked to interest rates, foreign currency earnings or inflation-linked income, for example, these are elements linked to actual market factors which we can model and hedge,” Houghton says. “At Lloyds Bank, we don’t just look at sources and uses of cash but also how financial market movements can affect a business.”</p>

</figure>
<p>For many corporates this exposure to the markets is seen through their debt. If debt is fixed then it is not a problem, but if it is linked to LIBOR, for example, this is an explicit link to interest rate levels. “It could be argued,” admits Houghton, “that interest rates may increase because the economy is improving and so some of the market links a corporate is exposed to may be seen as benign or correlated with revenue and so they wouldn’t necessarily hedge them”. But, he continues, “uncertainty over the next five years in the cash and business cycle might equally stem from unknown elements which a business may wish to tie down”. For foreign currency exposures, for example, Lloyds can advise a business on how to reduce uncertainty so it can make its predictions with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>By building an element of stress into the forecasts it is possible to determine the minimum amount of cash over time that a corporate may need (its Minimum Liquidity Term Structure), Houghton explains. “Any cash currently held or forecast to be received in excess of this requirement over a period of say 12 months, can be treated as reserve cash and beyond that as strategic cash.”</p>

</figure>
<p>The excess cash forms the Investable Cash Balance and, using the stressed cash flow forecast, it is possible to determine a precise term structure for the investable balances within the reserve and strategic cash pools (referred to by Houghton as the Investable Cash Term Structure) – without losing liquidity cover. “If a corporate wants excess cash, there is no reason why it can’t layer its investment over a given period to stagger the liquidity to earn a bit more on it,” notes Houghton.</p>
<h3 id=""the-holistic-approach-to-cash"">The holistic approach to cash</h3>
<p>If there is no short-term need for cash then why hold on to it? If the modelling and projection has been executed diligently and any potential for loss is perhaps three or four years out, then that excess cash could be better employed in a less liquid but higher yielding investment portfolio.</p>
<p>As has been made clear, cash is king in the eyes of many, but it can also be a drag on the profitability of the business; a RCF’s cost only ramps up when it is used, but there could be an issue of availability when it is rolled over – what is offered now may not be available in the future. Is there a formula to calculate the balance? Realistically, Houghton concedes that there are too many variables in terms of economic factors, business sector and individual corporate needs, risk appetites and so on to be able to offer an off-the-shelf solution. What can be delivered though, he says, is an holistic view of liquidity management within an individual business that takes into account internal and external factors, using historical data, assumptions and projections. Lloyds Bank’s Financial Risk Advisory Methodology is based on this model and can be used by treasurers as part of the financial planning process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all liquidity solution that balances cash, debt and investment because no two companies are exactly alike. Of course, if the money runs out, all businesses meet the same end, but by knowing how much total liquidity is required and how to divide and balance its own cash and debt, a corporate will be in a far stronger position going forward.</p>

Short Term Investments,MMFs regulations: is it too late to influence the outcome?, Published: Oct 2013 ,,"<div class=""gs-grid__col gs-grid__col-1-10 gs-grid__col--expand"" style="""">
<div class=""hero hero--article spaceing"">

</div><div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Regulators internationally have been keen to increase control over money market funds (MMFs), which many consider to be part of the shadow banking system, since the financial crisis of 2007/8. The whole purpose is to address financial instability, and the proposals that have emerged from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year and more recently the European Commission (EC) must be put in the same context as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of Basel III, which puts constraints on banks to ensure that they adequately manage their liquidity.</p>
<p>However, now that both proposals are on the table, it is clear to see that these two jurisdictions are taking diverging paths to achieve the same end.</p>
<p>What has become clear is that the US regulators listened to the industry and have adopted an important second alternative to MMF reform. The SEC proposals tabled in June 2013 suggested two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Variable net asset value (VNAV):</h5>
<p>Investors will buy and sell shares using the actual net asset value, not a stable $1.00 share price. Fund managers all say this can only be done on a T+1 basis, which is a following day settlement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Constant net asset value (CNAV):</h5>
<p>Fund managers may continue to provide CNAV funds providing there is provision for liquidity fees and the funds are permitted to impose redemption gates at times of stress.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This second alternative is a real breakthrough for the industry, following much more restrictive suggestions. Many in the industry credit lobbying and thoughtful briefing papers by HSBC as being the catalyst for this new alternative. Jonathan Curry, Global CIO Liquidity at HSBC Global Asset Management, who is also chair of the Europe-based International Money Market Funds Association (IMMFA), told Treasury Today: “We are pleased to see that the valuable part that liquidity fees can play in protecting investors and reducing ‘run’ risks has been recognised by the SEC as a potential part of the reform process in the US.”</p>
<p>However, not all corporate treasurers are supportive of gates and fees. In a comment published on the SEC website, Gregg Murphey, Manager Global Treasury, Novelis Inc., argues that this proposal will “bring into question one of the greatest strengths of a prime MMF – liquidity”. He goes on to say: “A fund who imposes a fee or withholds redemption would sink faster than a fund that breaks the buck under current regulations, which means the tool for the funds would be ineffective. In addition, cause runs could occur on funds, when news events about an issuer would cause holders to quickly sell their shares before everyone else does, trying to avoid the gate and or fee. In the current world, news events about individual issuers doesn’t cause the level of panic that will be present when gates close and fees are imposed.”</p>
<p>He believes that the proposed changes will discourage his company from participating in MMFs, and as a result funds will be smaller on an ongoing basis, “so it will be more likely that redemptions will push funds into a crisis position”. David Dohnalek, Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, The Boeing Company, echoed Murphey’s concerns in his contribution to the consultation process.</p>
<h3 id=""meanwhile-back-in-europe"">Meanwhile, back in Europe…</h3>
<p>The news on the other side of the Atlantic is not as positive. EU legislators have, after extensive lobbying, adopted what are being described by the MMF industry as draconian rules. What you think of the rules depends on your perspective: finance ministers from France and Germany lobbied regulators to scrap CNAV funds, but there are many corporates who like the product and will be sorry to see it go. But go it will in its present form if the new EU regulation is adopted.</p>
<p>Whether or not the new legislation will get passed is where the industry is currently hanging its hopes. It is important to note that the regulation represents the EC’s proposed initiating legislation and it must pass through the European law-making procedure involving the European Parliament and European Council before it can become new European law. This is likely to be delayed as a result of the European elections to be held in May next year.</p>
<p>Once in effect, funds must submit an application for authorisation as an MMF to their regulators within six months evidencing compliance with the regulation. The regulation is conceived as leaving no scope for additional ‘gold-plating’, or different implementation, at national levels.</p>
<p>Many in the industry hope that, as happened in the US, a change of political personnel will result in the proposed legislation losing its sponsors and fading away. They are also encouraged in this view since Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor at the Bank of England (BoE), who was a major advocate of stringent MMF reform, left the bank after failing to get the job as Governor. But it is far from clear why new regulators would back off from the proposed regulation. The proposals have been made with much references to public engagement and co-ordination with International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).</p>
<p>There is also concern over regulatory arbitrage, but there are restrictions on Europe-based fund investors switching to US funds and issues about repatriation of funds becoming taxable in the US for US multinationals. In other words, some monies might find efficient ways to get into US funds but most will stay invested in Europe in some form. Going offshore (ex-EU) is not practical as the selling rules and regulations would preclude the funds being effectively sold to European investors. In addition companies are not likely to want to be seen investing in offshore locations which might lead to accusations of tax avoidance, whether justified or not.</p>
<p>In short, the European CNAV institutional MMF industry has a big problem on its hands. The Institutional Money Market Fund Association (IMMFA) has summarised the key issues, starting with what it describes as overarching issues.</p>
<h3 id=""overarching-issues"">Overarching issues</h3>
<h5 id=""three-percent-capital-buffer"">Three percent capital buffer</h5>
<p>The current EC proposal is that each fund has a NAV buffer of at least 3% in cash. This is the single most important issue the industry has with the EU regulations. The idea that capital will be injected into funds in this way is a non-starter for some thinly-capitalised fund management companies – they simply do not have enough capital to be able to do this. Investment and commercial banks who have more capital believe that it is impossible to provide an adequate return on any capital that was so used. There is evidence to support this. Fund managers have been giving up or minimising fees to prevent the returns on funds going negative with short-term interest rates close to zero. It is hard to see how any the additional return required on capital could be earned.</p>
<p>IMMFA also makes the point that if the capital required (estimated at €14 billion) was withdrawn from the banking markets, it would, because of bank leverage, result in €200-250 billion being withdrawn from the European economy. Of course, it could be said that if the returns were adequate the capital would be found. The point is that insisting that CNAV funds have 3% capital destroys the business model and there is no evidence that we have seen to believe any fund provider believes it can do this and make anything like adequate returns.</p>
<h5 id=""time-for-transition"">Time for transition</h5>
<p>The IMMFA then goes on to say that the implementation time for any changes set at six months is totally inadequate. Meanwhile, behind the scenes the mangers are looking at what is involved in moving to VNAV funds and what other options there might be.</p>
<h3 id=""category-a-issues"">Category A issues</h3>
<p>The IMMFA then goes on to describe what it calls “Category A” issues.</p>
<h5 id=""valuation-use-of-amortised-cost-accounting"">Valuation – use of amortised cost accounting</h5>
<p>The industry uses straight-line amortised cost accounting to value short-term investments. This is not mark-to-market, but the industry points out there is no liquid secondary market price for many short-term investments and thus no reliable pricing. Regulators want the industry to find a solution.</p>
<p>The IMMFA says: “In the absence of traded or quoted prices, amortised cost accounting is a pragmatic way to evaluate the fair value of money market instruments. Amortised cost accounting is widely used in the EU, is compliant with the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and has been accepted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as being compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). It is also used in the financial statements of banks to value loans and certain other assets. MMFs are not outliers in their use of amortised cost accounting.”</p>
<h5 id=""asset-backed-commercial-paper"">Asset-backed commercial paper</h5>
<p>The narrow description of ‘securitisations’ affects the funds’ ability to invest in many types of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). IMMFA says this “has potential to hamper this funding stream to the wider economy”. In practical terms, it also reduces the eligible investments managers would like to use in order to earn some slight additional yield.</p>
<h5 id=""reverse-repo-collateral-diversification"">Reverse repo collateral/diversification</h5>
<p>The regulation proposes rules on what MMFs can invest in and what activities they can perform, restricting the type of collateral that can be used in reverse repurchase (repo) agreements and banning funds from engaging in certain securities financing transactions (SFTs).</p>
<h5 id=""definition-of-liquidity-requirements"">Definition of liquidity requirements</h5>
<p>Certain levels of daily/weekly liquidity are prescribed in order for funds to satisfy investor redemptions. CNAV funds will be obliged to hold at least 10% of their assets in instruments that mature on a daily basis and an additional 20% of assets that mature within a week.</p>
<h5 id=""prescriptive-credit-process"">Prescriptive credit process</h5>
<p>The proposed regulation has set requirements for a consistent prescribed credit process across all funds designed to prevent credit arbitrage between the funds.</p>
<h5 id=""ban-on-fund-level-ratings"">Ban on fund level ratings</h5>
<p>Finally, there is an issue that will affect investors in particular – a ban of fund ratings by credit rating agencies. This will remove the AAA fund rating which is the cornerstone on which most investors base their investment policies. Fund managers expect this proposal in itself to lead to many investors walking away from this form of investment.</p>
<h3 id=""other-issues"">Other issues</h3>
<p>The IMMFA then goes on to list other ‘issues’ which are as follows:</p>
<h5 id=""application-of-the-regulation"">Application of the regulation</h5>
<p>The way the regulation is worded potentially creates a higher risk of liability on the manager than any other type of investment product.</p>
<h5 id=""valuation-of-assets"">Valuation of assets</h5>
<p>The regulation talks about assets being priced on the “more prudent side of bid and offer”. The lack of a secondary market in many short-term securities which are all being held to maturity makes this impossible.</p>
<h5 id=""eligible-assets"">Eligible assets</h5>
<p>Shares in MMFs are not themselves classifies as an eligible asset, thus preventing any master feeder structures.</p>
<h5 id=""diversification"">Diversification</h5>
<p>There is an inconsistency in the drafting that places limits on one type of investments and not another. In summary, it could be said the industry does not like the EC proposals.</p>
<h3 id=""call-to-action"">Call to action</h3>
<p>Lobbying is continuing apace, but it may be too late. The proposed regulation is not open to public consultation – yet many are attempting to influence regulators/legislators through diverse channels. For example, Richard Raeburn, Chair of the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT), wrote a letter to the Financial Times on 6<sup>th</sup> September, calling into question the bar on the provision of external ratings. This stance was backed up by a letter from Mark Hannam, Independent Director at the IMMFA.</p>
<p>The IMMFA is working together with the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT) to ensure that the corporate voice is heard. Each member of the IMMFA will also be reaching out to its investors to get involved in the debate.</p>
<p>Susan Hindle Barone, Secretary General of IMMFA, recommends pointing out directly to local MEPs, as well as representatives from the BoE and the Treasury, how damaging these proposals could be. “We are encouraging anyone who cares about this to make their voices heard, whichever avenue that takes,” she says. “We are trying to explain that this has a real impact on the broader economy and we struggle to get that message through.”</p>
<p>The UK and Irish governments have been very vocal in their opposition to the proposed regulations. The French and German governments, on the other hand, support the legislation and want a ban on CNAV funds. Many German corporates invest in CNAV funds, whereas French corporates tend not to.</p>
<p>We live in an environment when regulation of the financial services industry is seen to be a good thing. It is hard to see why EU regulators would back away from legislation that has been proposed after ‘extensive consultation’ regardless of the consequences, both intended and unintended. One legal observer pondered that this was just an intermediate solution before a complete ban.</p>
<p>In the short term, CNAV funds will wait to see what the regulators do and, in the meantime, manage all the other challenges they are experiencing – low interest rates, flat yield curves and lack of short-term investments.</p>
<p>In the longer-term, the CNAV fund industry may disappear or shrink dramatically. In a subsequent article we will look at how VNAV funds might work in practice and what alternative forms of investment might startto find favour with corporate investors.</p></div>

<p>There are a number of major changes taking place in the money markets that have been a consequence of the financial crisis in 2008. These changes are impacting all the major participants in the money markets from corporate treasurers and banks to money market funds (MMFs) and many others as well.</p>
<h3 id=""ultra-low-interest-rates"">Ultra low interest rates</h3>
<p>Ultra low interest rates have been a theme in the developed world money markets for a number of years now. This has had a consequence for investors who are earning a significantly lower return on their cash. “We have noticed a trend amongst investors to perform a major strategic review of their cash holdings and their investment strategy for this cash,” says Jonathan Curry, HSBC’s Global Chief Investment Officer – Liquidity.</p>
<p>The review has led corporates with surplus cash to consider strategic options such as increasing dividends, paying down debt, injecting cash into underfunded pension schemes. Many of those that have decided to invest their surplus cash have changed their investment procedures. Strategies used include increasing risk to earn a higher return, or investing in different asset types such as ‘repo’, segregated accounts and more.</p>
<p>These investors have decided to reallocate a proportion of their cash. They have adapted their investment strategy to take on more risk and investment in new asset classes. “However, we are not seeing a high degree of take-up in alternative products mainly because the majority of clients remain focused on security and liquidity as the key objectives of their investment policies,” explains Curry. “At the moment, the risk/return trade-off has not made sense, so they have stayed with MMFs and other lower risk investment options.”</p>
<p>With the market not expecting the European Central Bank (ECB) nor the Bank of England (BoE) to make any changes in short-term interest rates for the remainder of this year and well into next year, Curry expects “investors to continue strategically to look at options for their cash pools”.</p>

<h3 id=""risk-remains"">Risk remains</h3>
<p>As noted, a number of structural changes are occurring in the money markets that are impacting all investors, whether they invest directly in the market themselves, or via a MMF or a segregated account managed by an asset manager. As a result of these changes, the industry faces new challenges.</p>
<p>“For example, we see a supply and demand imbalance for money market assets with shorter maturities,” says Curry. The supply of money markets assets is being reduced, primarily through changes in bank regulation that are negatively affecting banks’ incentives to issue short-term funding. This is increasing liquidity risk. It is also increasing risk through a reduction in diversification, as it is harder for investors to diversify to the degree they would like to.</p>
<p>On the demand side, investors have reduced the number of approved issuers. This is based on their changing perceptions of credit quality, which effectively begins to concentrate demand on a smaller number of issuers. In addition, investors, such as MMFs, now need to carry higher levels of liquidity post-crisis, reducing their demand for longer dated money market assets.</p>
<p>The supply and demand imbalance is creating challenges for MMF managers, as well as direct investors. It takes longer to invest on a day-to-day basis and it is harder to diversify as much as investors would like. As a result, the industry as a whole is more resource and research intensive than previously.</p>
<p>“We are also seeing governments putting new regulation in place in the financial services sector. Firstly to reduce the probability of another financial crisis and secondly to reduce the impact on the taxpayer if another crisis were to occur. The trend here is that in future regulation will allow debt as well as equity investors to take the risk of a bank failure. This development, plus an increase in collateralised lending by investors, has meant that if a default in the banking sector were to occur in the future the risk of being an unsecured debt investor is rising,” says Curry.</p>
<p>In addition, credit ratings agencies (CRAs) are regularly changing their ratings methodologies. This has led to the re-rating of banks and a significant portion of sovereign credit in developed markets over the past few years. This has effectively shrunk the universe of available credit for investors that use external ratings as part of their investment guidelines. Plus CRAs are now much more reactive to market developments, which adds risk to managing money market investments by increasing market volatility.</p>
<p>The increase in risk in the money markets emphasises the importance of credit analysis skills and access to credit resources beyond external CRAs. Analysis of equity valuations and credit default swap (CDS) levels are blunt tools, and without dedicated credit analysts there are not credible options available to investors. This is a difficult environment for resource-strapped investors, who may not have the credit expertise to reduce their dependency on CRAs without limiting the diversity of their portfolio. For example, investors in Europe or the UK – with insight into the credit risk profiles of domestic or regional banks – will concentrate their investments geographically if they don’t have the credit expertise to make informed decisions in outlying jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“One of the advantages of using external providers is that most, but not all, can look at credit profiles across geographies within the parameters set by a specific credit process. This will help to mitigate the supply and demand imbalance that is building up in the market,” argues Curry.</p>

<h3 id=""new-regulations"">New regulations</h3>
<p>Currently, regulators consider MMFs to be part of ‘shadow banking’ and are prone to runs. Therefore, MMFs require reform. The regulatory debate is intense in all jurisdictions – in the US, Europe and elsewhere. Despite extensive collaboration and lobbying, there appears to be a worrying lack of objectivity and understanding amongst regulators. However, the industry can take some solace in the knowledge that the new regulations will take some time to implement as the changes are likely to be material.</p>
<p>In Europe, for example, the European Commission (EC) released its MMF reform proposals on 4<sup>th</sup> September, which was postponed from an earlier target date of 26<sup>th</sup> July. The next step is for the EC proposals to be voted on by the European Parliament (EP) and the European Council, before being written into law (if they are approved). This will be followed by a transition period for providers, investors and others involved in the industry to make the necessary changes. Therefore, it will probably be mid-2015 or later before funds need to be compliant with the new regulation.</p>
<p>In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has released a consultation document, requesting comments by 17<sup>th</sup> September, in order to incorporate these suggestions into its final proposals for reform. These proposals are likely to be released towards the end of 1H14, and implementation will then occur in 2016.</p>
<p>Obviously, all stakeholders in the industry will need to make a number of changes in order to become compliant. Today, there remains much uncertainty that needs to be resolved before investors and industry stakeholders have a clear picture as to the final reforms. We need to see collaboration continue between investors, regulators and politicians as we go through this process.</p>
<p>HSBC Global Asset Management has been focused on clarifying what reforms are needed to make MMFs even more resilient and which reforms will not deliver this objective. “We do believe that there are reforms that will benefit all stakeholders in the money fund industry,” says Nick Jones, Head of Sales, Liquidity, EMEA at HSBC, who goes on to say “ the stated aims of the regulators are to reduce systemic risk in the financial system by reducing the probability of runs occurring in MMFs. Anything that makes MMFs more resilient to risk, whilst remaining proportionate and allowing funds to continue to provide a valuable service to clients, are clearly an objective that HSBC Global Asset Management supports.”</p>
<p>For example, HSBC Global Asset Management would support a European regulation that stipulates a minimum liquidity requirement that MMFs should hold to give funds greater ability to meet redemptions, such as 10% in overnight and 30% in one-week paper. HSBC already follows its own stricter, internal policies in terms of how much liquidity their funds need to hold, and believe that this would be a sensible reform and improve a fund’s ability to provide same-day liquidity.</p>
<p>HSBC also supports the following reforms for MMFs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>‘Know your client’ and client concentration policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equality between shareholders should be strengthened by empowering MMFs to impose a liquidity fee on redeeming shareholders during periods of severe market stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fund sponsors should not be able to support MMFs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MMFs should not be rated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, other reform proposals that HSBC does not support include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Capital/net asset value (NAV) buffers, which are ineffective in reducing run risk and brings into question the economics of MMFs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiation of risk between constant NAV (CNAV) and variable NAV (VNAV) funds, which is a ‘red herring’ not based on facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Hold back’ mechanisms, which are ineffective in reducing run risk and operationally impractical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restrictions on the usage of amortised cost accounting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""impact-on-corporate-treasurers"">Impact on corporate treasurers</h3>
<p>It is clear that corporate treasurers are being adversely affected by reduced yields. In general, money market investors have focused on higher quality issuers as supply falls and demand increases. The new environment is a strain on already limited resources in the treasury department due to an increase in time required to perform the daily investment function, as building a diversified portfolio is more challenging and hence time-consuming. As explained previously, to maintain a diversified portfolio some investors may have to go beyond their current area of credit expertise.</p>
<p>“Corporate treasurers will also see an increase in risk in a number of ways: firstly, as banks borrow more through central banks and repo, unsecured lending becomes riskier because losses would be greater if a default were to occur; secondly, as a result of rating downgrades and increased volatility in the market,” explains Jones.</p>
<p>In addition, corporates may suffer from the fall-out if these new regulations remove an outsourcing option – in a worst-case scenario MMFs could be regulated away – and it is therefore important that they make their views known. Finally, it increases the probability of extreme market events, such as negative yields in core Eurozone Treasury bill and repo (with government collateral) markets.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Time will tell as to exactly what lengths the proposed reforms will go. But based on the direction regulators are heading, it is clear that there will be an impact on the industry as a whole, including corporate investors.</p>
<p>HSBC Global Asset Management will be assisting its clients in understanding the changes and their impact. “We also think it is very important that the voice of the investor is heard, particularly as we enter the political part of the process when the European politicians vote on the reform proposals. They need to understand the impact on corporates and what the reforms mean for the real economy,” says Jones.</p>
<p>Therefore, HSBC Global Asset Management has been actively encouraging corporate investors to get involved in the debate, either directly representing their own organisation or through a relevant industry association. It is important that their voice is heard to make sure that it is factored into any decisions that are ultimately made. “Without this input, it would be difficult to make a fully considered decision on what is appropriate for the industry as a whole,” says Jones.</p>
<p>In addition, understanding the consequences of reform is best practice on the part of the regulatory community and the politicians, to ensure that any reform is in the interest of investors in MMFs, who clearly value them as a cash management tool. But that tool needs to be available to them in a form that works for them.</p>

<h5 id=""what-is-the-state-of-play-with-money-market-fund-mmf-regulation-especially-with-regards-to-proposals-made-by-the-securities-and-exchange-commission-sec"">What is the state-of-play with money market fund (MMF) regulation, especially with regards to proposals made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?</h5>
<p>In the world of MMFs, the cardinal sin is ‘breaking the buck’. If the fund’s market-based value drops below the consensus $/£/€1 stable share price (known as constant net asset value (CNAV)) investors can lose value – and faith – in their investment.</p>
<p>The last time this happened, in September 2008, the potential contagion was halted when the US Treasury stepped in to provide support for the ailing fund in question, the Reserve Primary Fund. The SEC’s response was to seek reforms to limit the likelihood of a repeat event.</p>
<p>By March 2010, a number of amendments had been published concerning the SEC’s existing MMF Rule 2a-7 (the exemption dating back to the 1980s that allowed MMFs to maintain the stable $1 share price instead of being subject to market fluctuations in the value of the securities held by the fund). The amendments sought to impose stability by reducing credit and liquidity risks within MMF portfolios without, it hoped, stifling the market.</p>
<p>Roll forward to June 2013 and the SEC, having had time to review the effectiveness of its amended rule set, responded by publishing an additional batch of MMF-reforming proposals designed to further protect investors in this $2.9 trillion market. In the words of Mary Jo White, Chair of the SEC, speaking in June 2013: “These proposed reforms should further enhance the resiliency and transparency of this important product, and are significant complements to the other proposals.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The MMF space remains a challenging environment both from an investment and a regulatory perspective. Indeed, looking at the challenges by currency, the euro continues to be the most demanding, with shortage of supply, generally low rates and with an increase in provider consolidation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alongside a set of enhanced disclosure requirements, proposals for stronger diversification of portfolios and enhanced stress testing, the latest suggested proposals include two principal alternative reforms that could either be adopted alone or in combination. The first requires a variable net asset value (VNAV) for prime institutional MMFs. Removing the $1 stable share price model, and instead allowing daily share prices of MMFs to fluctuate alongside the market price of securities in the portfolio, is seen as a way of not only increasing investor awareness of MMF risks but also as a method of reducing the likelihood of a run on a fund in times of financial stress.</p>
<p>Where prime institutional funds may currently “penny round” their share price to the nearest whole unit, if the proposals are accepted in their current form they will be expected instead to “basis point round” their share price. This will create a more precise valuation and pricing model for investors, although government, treasury and certain retail MMFs will be exempted from this requirement.</p>
<p>The second alternative allows MMFs to carry on transacting at a stable share price but deploy liquidity fees and redemption gates in times of stress to limit runs. The former proposes that if a fund’s level of weekly liquid assets (typically cash, US Treasury securities, certain other government securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less, and securities that convert into cash within one week) drops lower than 15% of its total assets, then a 2% liquidity fee may be imposed on all redemptions (unless the fund’s board believes it would be imprudent to do so). A redemption gate is intended as a temporary suspension of redemptions (for no more than 30 days in any 90-day period) to be imposed when a fund reaches a certain level of redemption activity. All MMFs will be required to deliver prompt public disclosure of either action.</p>
<h5 id=""are-these-new-regulations-in-effect"">Are these new regulations in effect?</h5>
<p>At this stage, these are nothing more than proposals – but the required 90-day public comment period is underway and the industry is ramping up for action. The MMF space remains a challenging environment both from an investment and a regulatory perspective. Indeed, looking at the challenges by currency, the euro continues to be the most demanding, with shortage of supply, generally low rates and with an increase in provider consolidation where assets under management (AUM) are moving out of some of the smaller managers whose scale, in terms of distribution, has forced them to withdraw from the euro cash market altogether.</p>
<p>As the MMF industry moves into the period of consultation around the SEC’s proposals, quite a lot can happen. It is now down to sponsors, providers and – importantly – investors to make their opinions known. All things considered, aspects of the new SEC proposals demonstrate a pragmatic approach to market change, and allowing CNAV vehicles to continue, with the ability to apply gates and liquidity fees in certain circumstances, is a thoughtful, well-considered angle to take.</p>
<h5 id=""what-is-blackrocks-opinion-of-the-proposals"">What is BlackRock’s opinion of the proposals?</h5>
<p>BlackRock is not supportive of mandatory conversion to variable net asset value (VNAV) because it does not address the key criteria driving the regulation, particularly the run-risk in the market. With the devil very much in the detail of this circa 700-page report there will be nuances therein that interested parties must carefully work through and fully understand before responding. As much as it is now about feedback on what the SEC has proposed, there will be a degree of clarification required.</p>
<p>In general, we support and applaud the steps being taken and will provide clear written feedback on what our thoughts are on the proposal.</p>
<p>Certain clarifications aside, the readiness of the industry to meet the SEC’s proposals is not in question. Once the period of consultation is completed, there will be another period before the final draft is issued, most likely followed by a period of grace for providers to comply with the changes. At this point BlackRock is well positioned to navigate that process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With the devil very much in the detail of this circa 700-page report there will be nuances therein that interested parties must carefully work through and fully understand before responding. As much as it is now about feedback on what the SEC has proposed, there will be a degree of clarification required.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, with the rule changes of 2010 having required greater levels of liquidity and more disclosure, and the industry voluntarily publishing ‘shadow NAVs’, or mark-to-market valuations, on a daily basis (the SEC publishes MMF-reported portfolio holdings and prices on a 60-day delay), some of what is being proposed is already being complied with. And, in the interest of executing “good market practice and business conduct”, institutions such as BlackRock have been doing so for some while.</p>
<h5 id=""how-will-the-new-proposed-regulations-impact-the-investor"">How will the new proposed regulations impact the investor?</h5>
<p>For the investor, as future changes are introduced, they will need to be fully understood and where necessary translated into individual investment guidelines and reporting requirements. Part of the proposal requires funds to be run shorter and more liquid which means, over time, yields may fall. Given the low-rate environment, many investors are in this mode of thinking anyway, but they will need to be more mindful of how they segment their cash. They should be reviewing the kind of ladders put in place and differentiate between working capital that needs to be truly liquid versus that which can be considered more strategic and moved further out the curve, towards slightly longer-duration vehicles where they can get a better yield pick-up.</p>
<p>Being pushed into a VNAV situation will demand a more dramatic reaction with considerations around accounting and tax treatment potentially being more impactful and damaging to the industry and client interests.</p>
<p>With this threat hanging over the industry, through the consultation period investors will become more vocal. Their thoughts will find voice through varying associations, such as the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT) and, in the US, the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP), which will be lobbying, as with previous proposals, to have MMFs remain as intact as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From the industry’s perspective, the best way to reduce risk in these products is to increase diversification, shorten tenors and increase the level of disclosure and transparency on investments. Changing CNAV to VNAV does not reduce run risk caused by systemic issues.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BlackRock together with industry peers, particularly in the US, will now be considering their individual responses. A co-ordinated industry-level response, with questionnaires being distributed amongst clients to ensure these proposals resonate with the investor-base, will then add to the feedback. The response from clients so far is broadly positive, but this is tempered with the knowledge that the end-point may look markedly different from what is currently being proposed.</p>
<h5 id=""what-should-investors-be-concerned-about"">What should investors be concerned about?</h5>
<p>Investors currently face two main perils. The first is the ongoing tough market conditions. Supply is limited, yield-levels are low and ratings-agency actions can impose restrictions and enforced diversification that may not be in the best interest of the investor. It is a very difficult job at the moment for a manager to put together a high credit-quality portfolio that is suitably liquid and paying a level of return that is attractive. The harsh reality is that if a business is holding truly instant access cash then it is difficult to get paid on that, and therefore it has to look at being smarter at how it segments that working capital.</p>
<p>The second concern is how the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission (EC) propose to handle MMFs through forthcoming legislation – an announcement is expected to be made in July and a consultation paper published.</p>
<p>In April, the EC’s Systemic Risk Board – worried about massive and sudden redemption requests – issued a paper stating its desire for mandatory conversion of all CNAV funds to VNAV, with a demand for a 3% cash buffer for funds to absorb any losses, amounting to around €14.7 billion across the European industry. The paper also proposed that all MMFs should be barred from accepting collateral with a maturity of longer than 397 days to back repo trades. This may just be a means of forcing participants to come up with a better proposal.</p>
<p>From the industry’s perspective, the best way to reduce risk in these products is to increase diversification, shorten tenors and increase the level of disclosure and transparency on investments. Changing CNAV to VNAV does not reduce run risk caused by systemic issues.</p>
<p>Whatever transpires, the conversation between providers and policy-makers must be mindful that a potential situation of “domiciliary arbitrage” – where it is better to launch funds outside of Europe because of the unfavourable regulatory environment – is not the way forward.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most unattractive outcome of the proposals would be for the SEC to deliver a thoughtful solution that is supported by the industry, but with its European counterparts moving in the opposite direction. If the creation of an uneven playing field makes it untenable to offer MMFs within the regulated framework of Europe, providers and investors would be forced to look to other domiciles.</p>
<p>BlackRock strongly hope that there is co-ordination, acknowledgement and recognition of the amount of time and effort that the SEC has taken on this, in terms of cost-benefit analysis and focusing on the specific problems trying to be addressed. It would be disappointing if we come out with anything other than a level regulatory playing field.</p>
<h5 id=""how-is-blackrock-alleviating-its-customers-concerns"">How is BlackRock alleviating its customers’ concerns?</h5>
<p>BlackRock’s client-base is being kept up to date on developments in the US and in Europe as developments unfold. We are working with existing clients, plus bringing new investors to the product, ensuring that we keep them fully appraised of what is happening from a regulatory perspective.

<p><em>In the current global economic environment, corporates are finding the task of capital preservation increasingly challenging. For corporates operating in tightly-controlled Asian markets the decision as to where to invest surplus cash is often even more complex. In this article, we examine these and some of the other issues surrounding short-term investments currently facing the corporate treasurer.</em></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Generating profit is not usually the concern of the corporate treasurer. Treasury departments are cost centres, their function limited to managing accounts and, where possible, controlling the financial risks stemming from the company’s operations.</p>
<p>So, why would a non-financial corporate decide to invest surplus capital? The reason in most cases is the preservation of principle. Particularly in today’s low-interest rate climate, the value of corporate cash deposited with banks is vulnerable to erosion through inflation. Moreover, with the Basel III regulation requiring banks to hold extra capital against deposits, they are becoming more reluctant to hold large sums of surplus cash.</p>
<p>The contradiction lies in that companies in Asia, as in Europe and North America, are growing more cash-rich. For example, recent data compiled by Thomson Reuters indicates that two China-listed companies, China Life Insurance Company and Ping An Insurance Group, have cash balances of $82 billion and $38 billion respectively. But for companies such as these, deciding what to do with that money can be even more complex when you factor in the restrictive monetary policies at play in China and a number of other countries in the region.</p>
<h3 id=""investment-priorities"">Investment priorities</h3>
<p>A corporate’s investment decision-making is usually influenced by three main considerations: security, liquidity and yield. The relative importance of these considerations has always run in that particular order. However, in recent years the importance of yield has diminished even further in the eyes of the corporate treasurer.</p>
<p>Following a financial crisis which plunged the global economy into a downturn, the like of which we have not seen since the 1930s, the growing risk aversion taking hold of companies should not come as a surprise to anyone. For treasurers investing in this perilous environment, security and liquidity have become paramount. The focus, therefore, will be on developing an investment strategy that produces the optimal risk-adjusted return.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the key short-term investments companies may use to achieve this objective. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Money market funds (MMFS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exchange traded funds (ETFs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificates of deposit (CDs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury bills (T-bills).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repurchase agreements (repos).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""mmfs"">MMFs</h3>
<p>With strong security and high liquidity, MMFs remain a popular option for corporate investors. This was reflected in a recent survey by Fitch Ratings, according to which 50% of corporate treasury professionals use MMFs, making the funds their next preferred investment vehicle after bank deposits.</p>
<p>The funds are typically used by corporates as an alternative to bank deposits, one which offers the investor higher yield but without sacrificing liquidity. There are significant differences between the two. MMFs are asset management products where providers secure yield for their clients through the purchase of a narrow range of highly-rated assets. Secondly, MMFs are not guaranteed, whereas bank deposits are. In fact, some critics argue that their ultra-safe, deposit-like appearance often masks a deep-rooted structural instability.</p>
<p>The risk for investors is that there will be a run on the funds or, to put it another way, too many investors seek to redeem at the same time. As a consequence, the fund may struggle to liquidate its assets quickly enough, causing the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV) to fall below the prescribed $1 baseline, something which is referred to in the industry as ‘breaking the buck’.</p>
<p>The last time an event of this nature occurred was in 2008, when the reserve primary fund collapsed as investors all rushed to the door over concerns about the fund’s exposure to Lehman Brothers. Such events are uncommon, however. From the industry’s beginnings in 1971 until the financial crisis, only three MMFs ever broke the buck – a figure which some critics argue might be higher without the discretionary sponsor capital many are able to draw upon in times of market stress to preserve their constant NAVs (CNAVs).</p>
<p>No wonder then that the same Fitch Ratings survey found that CNAV investors tend to place great emphasis on the importance of the sponsor when choosing a fund to invest in. Other factors commonly taken into consideration include the credit/risk quality – with AAA being the preference – and the funds past performance.</p>
<p>The industry is now more tightly regulated than it was prior to the financial crisis, and there is also the prospect of further regulation on the horizon. One proposal, recently mooted by the European Systematic Risk Board (ESRB), is proving particularly contentious. The ESRB recommended in a recent review, that there should be a mandatory conversion of all CNAV funds to floating NAVs, on the grounds that this would help to reduce the ‘first mover advantage’ believed to be a cause of runs on funds. But this, some say, may diminish the utility of MMFs for corporate investors, who largely prefer CNAV because of the simpler tax and accounting treatment.</p>
<p>In recent years, MMFs have become an increasingly popular alternative to bank deposits for companies operating in China. In the past, these companies were rather limited in their options for managing liquidity. Both yields and tenors of bank deposits are regulated in the Chinese market by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and rates are often lower than they would be if aligned to real market yields.</p>
<p>The introduction of MMFs has provided an attractive alternative for investors. Most of the funds currently flourishing in China follow guidelines set by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which are considered to be much tighter than current international guidelines.</p>
<h3 id=""etfs"">ETFs</h3>
<p>Amid all the uncertainty regarding the regulatory changes to MMFs now looming on the horizon, corporate investors may wish to consider short-duration bond ETFs. A degree of caution should be observed as these types of fund typically assume greater levels of risk, compared with traditional MMFs, in order to secure marginally higher yields. Another big difference is that the shares of short-duration ETFs, unlike CNAV MMFs, fluctuate during trading hours – much in the same way as stock prices.</p>
<p>Again, these could be an option a corporate operating in China may wish to consider. In China, ETFs such as FXI, the iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index ETF, invest in the equity prices of China-based companies. Similar to MMFs, the funds reduce risk through diversification, allowing investors to gain exposure to a number of different sectors such as banking, construction, energy and communications.</p>
<h3 id=""cds"">CDs</h3>
<p>CDs are debt instruments issued by banks and other financial institutions which are widely used by corporates in place of clean, fixed bank deposits. In exchange for keeping the money on deposit for an agreed fixed-term, unlike a traditional bank deposit which can be withdrawn at will, a set rate of interest is paid to the investor. The rate that is offered is generally aligned to the maturity of the asset, which can range from only a few weeks to several years.</p>
<p>As is the case with any tradable instrument, the secondary market value can be impacted by investor sentiment. This is the main source of risk for corporate investors not wishing to hold on to the CD until maturity. It means that negative news concerning the issuing bank could, potentially, result in a dampening of demand for the product.</p>
<h3 id=""t-bills"">T-bills</h3>
<p>T-bills are a short-term money market security issued by national monetary authorities. The probability of a sovereign default is considered to be very low – recent events in Argentina notwithstanding – so T-bills are often the first point of refuge for investors during periods of market stress. The main disadvantage for investors in these securities is that yields are often minimal at best. For example, US T-bills have traded at negative yields in recent years and are currently close to zero.</p>
<h3 id=""repos"">Repos</h3>
<p>Repos involve the sale of securities such as corporate or government bonds tied to a commitment from the seller to buy them back at a later date. Investing in repos can sometimes prove complex. Such securities are therefore more suitable for large corporations with very sophisticated treasury departments able to handle the administrative burden.</p>
<p>In Chinese repo agreements, the collateral posted is typically a government or corporate bond. Repos cannot be entered into by foreign-invested enterprises. The yields on repos or short-term government debt are generally more attractive than short-term deposit rates.</p>
<p>A good time to tap the repo market is in the run-up to the Chinese New Year when banks are often short on cash as demand rises (<a href=""#chart-1-seven-day-repo-rates-before-and-after-the-chinese-new-year-holiday"">see Chart 1</a>). Again, when a big IPO comes to the market, exchange repo rates can be extremely high as investors rush to find ready cash. There is undoubtedly a correlation between hot stock issuance and inflated exchange repo rates. The seven-day bond repurchase rate closed at a three-year high of 7.69 at the start of 2013.</p>

<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The present economic climate poses a number of challenges for the corporate investor. Banks’ appetite for deposits is diminishing as a result of new liquidity regulations such as Basel III. However, with interest rates near record lows across a large number of Western and Asian markets, low-risk returns through investment vehicles such as MMFs are not easy to come by either.</p>
<p>The current scarcity of yield should not be the over-riding concern. New risks to global financial stability are emerging, even before the problems left by the last financial crisis have yet to be fully resolved. For corporates operating in this uncertain environment, security and liquidity will certainly be the main factors for consideration when it comes to depositing their cash, with yield now nothing more than an afterthought.</p>
<p>Are there ways to secure better returns without necessarily forsaking yield? There has been talk recently on the prospect of ultrashort-term ETFs being used in lieu of MMFs, should the proposed regulatory changes feared by the industry be introduced. The aim of these funds is similar to MMFs: preservation of capital. A note of caution, however – the risks assumed by investors in these funds may be greater than the norm in the MMF market. In addition, since ETF shares float and their prices are not fixed like CNAV MMFs, principle can be lost.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also important to remember that when it comes to returns on balances, yield is not the only factor. In recent years, banks have been developing new products – such as accounts which allow clients to use their operating balances to manage down their fees and increase their margins – which should certainly be of interest to the corporate treasurer, providing that is, they do not disappear in the wake of Basel III.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>In the autumn of 2008, the banks at the heart of the Western financial system suffered a severe crisis, the likes of which had not been seen since the Great Depression. Governments around the world attempted to co-ordinate their efforts in introducing regulatory changes aimed at building a more stable, less leveraged global banking system.</p>
<p>Today, with banks having to scale back their risk taking activities in response to Basel III, attention is switching to the so-called shadow banking sector. In 2010, the G20 leaders gathered at the Seoul summit voiced their concerns about the role of shadow banking in the financial crisis and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) was asked to work with other international regulatory bodies in developing recommendations to strengthen oversight of the sector.</p>
<p>The functions performed by organisations outside of traditional banking – and, crucially, outside of the scope of banking regulation – have become increasingly important to the day-to-day operation of the global financial system over the course of the past decade. The Deloitte Shadow Banking Index published last year estimates that on the eve of the financial crisis, the total assets under management in the shadow banking system stood at over $20 trillion dollars, eclipsing even that of the traditional banking sector.</p>
<p>Since then, regulatory pressures have brought about a decline in the sector – in absolute terms and relative to the traditional banking sector. By 4Q11, assets were estimated at $9.53 trillion, more than 50% lower than at the 2008 peak (<a href=""#chart-1-shadow-banking-versus-traditional-banking-sector-assets-us-2004-2011"">see Chart 1</a>).</p>

<p>Despite this recent decline, introduction of the regulatory proposals currently being discussed will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the global economy. The credit intermediation, liquidity and maturity functions provided by shadow banking institutions are essential to many corporates. Consequently, there is concern in the market that an overly stringent approach to regulation may damage the ability of non-banks to provide services upon which a large number of businesses still rely.</p>
<h3 id=""blinded-by-the-light"">Blinded by the light</h3>
<p>These concerns are particularly acute when it comes to the reform of the money market fund (MMF) industry. Tighter oversight of the industry has been on the agenda ever since the financial crisis, when the exposure to Lehman Brothers debt securities caused the Reserve Primary Fund to lower its share price below $1 and ‘break the buck’. Other funds in the US and Europe were underwritten by their national governments. In the wake of those events, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who regulates financial markets in the US, adopted revisions to rule 2a7, requiring funds to improve liquidity and the credit quality of their portfolios.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“SME treasurers are probably using CNAV MMFs because they are straightforward, easy to book and report on a tax basis. Now, if the market changes to a new way of doing things which requires you to change your accounting processes, then you may just think it is not worth the hassle and return to bank deposits.”</p>
<p><cite>Aymeric Poizot, Head of EMEA Asset Manager Ratings team, Fitch</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, further reform of the industry is almost certain. One proposal, considered by the SEC and other international regulatory bodies such as the European Commission (EC), is to introduce a mandatory conversion to variable net asset value (VNAV). The backlash against constant NAV (CNAV) funds is based on the perception that investors will ‘run’ from a CNAV fund more readily as they aim to ensure they receive their full $1 per share value before the fund value fall below one and ‘breaks the buck’. However this theory was not borne out by the behaviour witnessed in the crisis. Indeed many who did redeem shares from prime CNAV MMF promptly reinvested in government funds – which are also operated as CNAV.</p>
<p>But some opponents of this approach argue that a mandatory conversion to VNAV poses a serious threat to the MMF industry. A recent study found that of the investors surveyed, only 16% use VNAV funds alone. Meanwhile, a clear majority, 25% – equating to 50% of those who use MMFs – are said to prefer CNAV funds. Aymeric Poizot, Head of Fitch’s EMEA Asset Manager Ratings team, says the survey revealed two commonly cited reasons for this apparent preference. Firstly, there is the inherent simplicity of the tax and accounting treatment required for users of CNAV funds; not every business will have the resources to cope with the added complexity a move to VNAV will bring, he asserts.</p>
<p>“If you are a treasurer for a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME), then this might cause a headache,” he says. “They are probably using CNAV MMFs because they are straightforward, easy to book and report on a tax basis. Now, if the market changes to a new way of doing things which requires you to change your accounting processes, then you may think it is not worth the hassle and return to bank deposits.”</p>
<p>Secondly, Poizot argues that a switch to VNAV may complicate risk management for corporates – something rather paradoxical, considering the overriding objective of the proposal is to reduce the level of risk in the market. “This is something the regulators do not appear to be fully aware of,” he begins, explaining that when a treasurer uses a CNAV fund they are using a product with a very clear risk profile – the fund is rated by multiple agencies and has very strong governance. “But if all funds were to switch to VNAV, then there is a strong argument to be made that the risk profile of the industry would be less clearly defined.”</p>
<h3 id=""if-its-not-broke"">If it’s not broke…</h3>
<p>Susan Hindle Barone, Secretary General of the Institutional Money Market Fund Association (IMMFA), is more cautious on the potential impact of a compulsory move to a floating NAV. “A lot of investors would be seriously inconvenienced if funds were forced to become VNAV. They really appreciate the simplicity of using a CNAV fund and the last thing we want to do is discourage them from achieving diversification in their cash holdings by pushing more of their money back into bank deposits,” she says. However, if regulators persist and all the funds had to convert to floating NAVs, she believes that, given time and a pragmatic approach in tax and accounting treatment, many investors would transfer over to VNAV MMFs. The trouble is, she says, the premise that CNAV funds are inherently more risky is something the industry simply does not agree with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“VNAV does not tackle the fundamental reason why investors will redeem from an MMF, namely that they are concerned about the credit quality of a particular security in that fund.”</p>
<p><cite>Joanna Cound, Head of Government Affairs and Public Policy, Europe at BlackRock</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This argument is reinforced by a recent research paper published by the Columbia University School of Law, which studied the comparative run rate of the two types of MMF during what is now known colloquially as “Lehman week”. The study found no empirical evidence to suggest that CNAV funds have a higher risk of “breaking the buck” in times of market stress. On the contrary, the two factors observed to contribute to run risk for MMFs were higher yields (indicating additional risk) and the perceived capacity of sponsors to support the fund.</p>
<p>It is the futility of the VNAV approach in terms of enhancing the stability of MMFs that concerns Hindle Barone most. “What worries us is that by switching the funds from CNAV to VNAV the regulators believe that with this they will be making a great contribution to global stability – a great step forward – yet we think that it will achieve nothing. It won’t remove risk or interconnectedness from the market, and that is what really alarms us.”</p>
<p>It is an argument echoed by Joanna Cound, Head of Government Affairs and Public Policy, Europe at BlackRock. Blackrock stresses that it is not opposed to either a conversion from CNAV to VNAV or to capital in principle but, like IMMFA, BlackRock does not believe the floating NAV proposal will be effective in addressing client redemptions in the event of a crisis. “It does not tackle the fundamental reason why investors will redeem from MMF, namely that they are concerned about the credit quality of a particular security in that fund. Clients ran during the 2007/2008 financial crisis because they didn’t know which funds might be invested in Lehman Brothers or any other name in the headlines at that time. It was clearly a run to safety.”</p>
<p>A similar argument is also made against capital buffers, another proposal currently being weighed up by European regulators. Having some capital put aside for times of market stress may make MMFs marginally more stable and better able to withstand idiosyncratic risk. “But such a level of capital will not be sufficient to protect a MMF facing mass client redemptions in the midst of a systemic crisis,” according to Cound. “The amount of capital required to achieve this would be so large that it would make MMFs uneconomic for any fund manager to offer to their clients.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-alternatives"">The alternatives</h3>
<p>Both IMMFA and BlackRock are at pains to emphasise that they are not against regulation of MMFs per se; it is just that they do not agree on the efficacy of the above proposals. An alternative approach, one which the industry would almost certainly back, would be to introduce prescribed liquidity buffers. Unlike mandatory VNAV and capital buffers, a liquidity requirement would go right to the heart of the problem. When markets become stressed, as they did in 2008, the most effective protection for a fund is to have natural liquidity in its portfolio so that it can meet client redemptions without having to sell assets at low prices in a distressed market.</p>
<p>Another idea, currently being promoted by Blackrock, is to require fund managers to introduce redemption gates and liquidity fees which are activated when certain triggers are met. When the market enters a period of stress, an objective trigger is hit and the Board or Management Company would be obliged to gate the fund and reopen the next day with a liquidity fee. Clients who needed their cash would have access to it – providing they pay a small fee to ensure equal treatment of all the investors in a fund – but the overall volume of client redemptions would be reduced. “It would be the most effective means of mitigating a run on MMFs,” Cound says. “Unlike mandatory conversation to VNAV and high levels of capital, which limit choice for investors, liquidity fees preserve the benefits of CNAV for those clients that require such MMFs, whilst effectively addressing the concerns of regulators.”</p>
<h3 id=""end-times-for-mmfs"">End times for MMFs?</h3>
<p>The regulators will certainly be aware of the concerns many in the MMF industry have over the current direction of reform. Yet a proposal drafted by the EC appears to indicate that the regulators are intent on pressing ahead, regardless of the opposition. The draft, which was leaked to the Financial Times in April, gives funds a choice of two options – either convert to a floating NAV or retain a 3% capital buffer.</p>
<p>If these proposals are introduced without amendments, corporate investors who maintain large cash balances in MMFs may well begin looking at the alternatives. For operational funds which require overnight liquidity, a return to bank deposits, even in the current ultra-low interest rate environment, seems to be the only feasible solution. But many companies are currently also holding onto funds as part of a longer-term cash reserve. For these funds, a short-term bond exchange traded fund (ETF) – such as the PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity ETF – may be an option for consideration.</p>
<p>“There will be a solution,” says Hindle Barone. “Like any equilibrium, it will find the right level. All we hope is that this is not to the detriment of investors because after all that’s who the products are for.”</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Corporate investment decisions have always been influenced by three overriding objectives – security, liquidity and yield. But in recent years, the first two of these objectives have become paramount and yield has taken a backseat. Since 2008, companies have become increasingly conservative and risk-averse. Above all, they want to be able to convert their investments back into cash quickly to meet any unexpected demands or needs. And remarkably, this precedence has persisted even in an environment with burgeoning sums of cash on corporate balance sheets.</p>
<p>The trend is clearly represented in Treasury Today’s European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study published in 2012. In Europe, the vast majority of respondents (79%) described liquidity as a “very important factor” when making investment decisions, and for security the figure was 76%. Meanwhile only 28% of the corporate professionals surveyed considered yield to be a very important factor.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-yield"">Beyond yield</h3>
<p>Alex Riseman, Head of Liquidity Solutions, EMEA at J.P. Morgan Treasury Services, thinks the results of the 2012 Treasury Today Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Studies are a reasonably accurate reflection of what he has witnessed over the past five years with respect to the bank’s clients. According to him, they are keeping more in their liquidity buffer and looking to short-term investments in order to optimise liquidity. And although investment guidelines will always dictate security and liquidity as the priorities, that doesn’t necessarily mean that yield is entirely irrelevant.</p>
<p>“There is always a need to balance security or safety of principle with liquidity and yield. But I think that if you look at what has happened since 2008, there has been a definite sea-change where security has become even more important than it was previously,” Riseman says.</p>
<p>“That is really the number one priority for our clients – they are always going to be concerned about capital preservation above all else. Basel III is also having a significant influence, while making banks stronger than ever and creating a more consistent funding structure, it can also uncover new earning opportunities for clients’ operating cash.”</p>

<h3 id=""once-bitten-twice-shy"">Once bitten, twice shy</h3>
<p>Although security and liquidity have always been priorities for corporates when it comes to investments, yield was not always considered to be quite such a subordinate factor for businesses when making investment decisions.</p>
<p>The situation in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis gives an inkling as to why this is. Today, the caution many corporates are showing with regard to investments is widely believed to be a symptom of the trauma that lingers from that period.</p>
<p>Before the world of banking descended into chaos in September 2008, many corporates enjoyed trouble-free access to revolving credit facilities from their banking partners. Banks would extend lines of credit to their corporate clients, who could, in return for a commitment fee, draw down on the facility when needed and repay the money when they reached a net-surplus cash position. But when the US sub-prime mortgage sector crisis began to spread across the globe, banks began to batten down the hatches.</p>
<p>“Corporates found that they couldn’t use those facilities in the immediate aftermath of the crisis,” says David Whelan, Director of Treasury Services at Capita. “Banks said if we are not able to fund your draw down, then you cannot use the facility – regardless of the agreement that was in place or the fact that they had been using them to date.”</p>
<p>Corporates were quite understandably disturbed by what had followed in the aftermath of the crisis. They began to look at ways to diversify their funding base and reduce their dependence on traditional bank finance. As bank lending declined, asset finance, and particularly corporate bond issuance, skyrocketed. In 2009, $1.5 trillion of debt was issued by companies in the capital markets – a record which would eventually be surpassed three years later in 2012.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-stockpiles-begin-to-grow"">Cash stockpiles begin to grow</h3>
<p>One consequence stemming from this determination to reduce their dependence on the banks was that companies began to build up large sums of cash on their balance sheets. Since the crisis, treasurers have been consistently increasing their cash balances in every economic quarter, as indicated in the 2012 Liquidity Survey by the Association of Financial Professionals (AFP).</p>
<p>In September 2007, exactly one year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, UK non-financial corporate cash deposits stood at £622 billion. Just five years later, in September 2012, the corresponding figure had increased by £50 billion to £672 billion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Corporates now have less trust in the banks to be available when the going gets tough.”</p>
<p><cite>David Whelan, Director of Treasury Services, Capita</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this trend has caused a large degree of consternation – among shareholders, politicians and the press – others, like Whelan, see it as a natural, understandable reaction by companies to what they experienced after 2008. “Corporates now have less trust in the banks to be available when the going gets tough,” he says. “A CEO of a big business such as British Airways, for example, would say that they know these facilities are available once again, but they want to make sure that the credit lines are there when they want to draw down on them. If the CEO has a programme for capital expenditure which needs to be executed they don’t want to be told they can’t access the facility because the bank, or the country where the bank is based, is suffering.”</p>
<p>This may also explain why there is such a pronounced level of aversion from companies to seek ways of securing better returns.</p>
<p>But there are ways that banks can help clients to get better returns on the cash sitting on their balance sheets without compromising security and liquidity. One of the ways J.P. Morgan is doing this is through a product it has developed called the Liquidity Management account. With this product the bank looks at the value of the cash over its duration, returning some of the yield that it sees from the long-term value of operational cash back to the client. “It gives the clients benefits in a number of areas,” says Riseman. “From a security point of view the deposit is on J.P. Morgan’s balance sheet, which clearly helps them, but it also gives them the yield that comes as the balances stay with us over time as well as the liquidity that comes with leaving balances in an operating account.”</p>
<p>The bank is also developing other products that Riseman says will secure better returns for clients on their cash balances. It is not just yield that clients are concerned about, he says. Many of the bank’s customers are also looking for ways to manage down their fees and increase their operating margins. “We are looking at developing solutions in which clients can use their operating balances to offset their fees – either locally or on a global basis,” Riseman adds. “When you are looking at returns, yield is not the only factor, so we are also looking at enhancing the ability of our clients to improve their operating margins as well.”</p>
<p>“I think that is exactly the way we approach clients nowadays and how clients see the banks,” adds J.P. Morgan’s Wilco Dado, Head of Cash Management, EMEA, Treasury Services. “We basically say, bring the business with you and because it is linked nightly with operational balances, this type of product can give the client – maybe not better yield – but better overall return on the liquidity through a better pricing on the payment fees.”</p>

<h3 id=""money-markets-since-the-crisis"">Money markets since the crisis</h3>
<p>In order to preserve their capital corporates in Europe, the UK and the US have also been increasingly turning to money market funds (MMFs), as a means of avoiding losses through inflation, but importantly, without compromising safety or liquidity.</p>
<p>MMFs have always been centred upon stability of principle as their main objective, says Ed Baldry, CEO, EMEA, at ICD-Portal, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform investors can use to analyse money markets. “I’ve been in the MMF business for over 20 years, and it has always been security as king, liquidity as queen and yield as the aspiring prince,” he says.</p>
<p>The popularity of MMFs has not been significantly diminished by the lack of yield. Baldry explains that currently in the AAA prime money fund space there is a range between 2bps and 18bps. In euro, the yields are even more marginal, ranging between zero and 4bps. But despite the emphasis of corporate investment strategies moving away from yield, MMFs remain a useful tool for corporate investors. “Effectively since 2008, when we had the Lehman Brothers meltdown and the beginning of the crisis, we could have completely removed the yield column altogether from our website and 80% of our clients wouldn’t have noticed,” he says.</p>
<p>“The focus has very much gone away from the yield on the funds. I would say that in terms of the stability of the funds, the astute corporate treasurers are – from a best practices standpoint – looking further into what they own. For virtually all of the large corporates, financial institutions – and anyone else using money funds via our platform – their focus is on the security of principle first and foremost.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-looming-regulatory-challenge"">The looming regulatory challenge</h3>
<p>There seems to be little possibility of the corporate investor’s current focus on security and liquidity changing at any time in the foreseeable future. Whelan says that Capita’s forecast for the next few years reveals that the UK and Europe will remain on the verge of recession until at least 2015 – if not descending fully into outright recession.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The focus has very much gone away from the yield on the funds.”</p>
<p><cite>Ed Baldry, CEO, EMEA, ICD-Portal</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, with the challenge of new regulatory standards for banks and other financial institutions looming on the horizon, the corporate investor’s job of finding the right balance between security, liquidity and yield, is not likely to become any easier. Most of the new regulatory changes in the financial sector – Basel III, Solvency II and the EU Green Paper on Shadow Banking – are concerned with ensuring that banks and other financial institutions put aside additional capital as a buffer to cover losses in the event of another crisis on the scale of September 2008.</p>
<p>These impending changes will inevitably impact the way in which corporate deposits and investments are handled, says Whelan.</p>
<p>“Banks and other financial institutions will change in order to reflect what the regulators are saying they now need to do in terms of shoring up and putting aside additional capital,” he says. “I believe that this will lead to these institutions seeking longer-term and stickier deposits. And I’m sure the corporate market is quite ready to make that leap. They still want to keep cash relatively short, liquid and visible.”</p>
<p>“I think it will be really interesting to see what happens next,” he adds. “How the structure of the market is going to change as a consequence of these new regulatory pressures and demands, and how the corporate customer base of these banks and financial institutions will react to that.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>As cash pools grow in China, treasurers are looking for secure, highly liquid investment solutions in line with corporate policy. The CIFM RMB Money Market Fund<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>, pioneered by JPMAM, goes one step further.</p>
<p>In China, a country still relatively restricted in terms of cross-border money flows, multinational corporations (MNCs) seeking a short-term, more secure home for their excess cash have few options open to them. The traditional response has been to play safe and opt for bank deposits; however, their yields and tenors are regulated by the country’s central bank, People’s Bank of China (PBoC), making them less flexible than international bank deposits.</p>
<p>For a treasurer seeking more security, liquidity and optimal returns on their cash, there is a means of gaining packaged access into the underlying fixed income markets in China, which generally are much higher-yielding than regulated deposits. And there is one solution that has considerably more provenance than any other in China.</p>
<p>The China International Fund Management (CIFM) RMB Money Market Fund (CIFM RMB MMF), pioneered by J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) through its joint venture company, CIFM, was the first – and is the largest<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> – AAA-rated fund in China<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> and has become one of the most popular investment choices for treasurers in China.</p>
<h3 id=""in-the-beginning"">In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The history of MMFs in China stretches back to 2003 when the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) first published MMF guidelines. In 2004, CIFM was created as a joint venture between JPMAM, itself the largest institutional AAA-rated MMF provider globally (with more than $506 billion under management as of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2012<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup>) and the non-bank financial institution, Shanghai International Trust Co (SITCo). The CIFM RMB MMF was launched in May 2005, leveraging on the product and investment expertise of JPMAM. JPMAM continues to be in direct communication with CIFM in regards to the investment process for this fund.</p>
<p>The CSRC guidelines are much broader than what we see in the existing international setting, comments Travis Spence, Head of Global Liquidity, Asia Pacific for JPMAM. The weighted average maturity guideline, for example, is 180 days in China, which is three times longer than typically allowed in the international context at 60 days. Having the appearance more of a short bond fund than a MMF, Spence says JPMAM saw the strategic opportunity to create a AAA-rated fund which would not only be more consistent with the guidelines understood and accepted by its global clients operating in China, but also better serve the needs of rapidly expanding local corporates who share the same investment objectives for their excess operating and reserve cash.</p>

<p>The rating is an additional level of comfort for treasurers, which is also often a requirement of investment policies. “We worked with the rating agencies to develop a rating structure for AAA MMFs in China,” Spence explains. The CIFM RMB MMF’s rating is provided by both Fitch and Moody’s local unit, which is a joint venture with CCXI, the first nationwide domestic credit rating agency created with the approval of the PBoC.</p>
<p>Cash balances are growing faster in China than other developed markets and this has fuelled a quest for better alternatives.</p>
<p>The publication of CSRC’s guidelines was a timely intervention and, as a pioneer in this space, the CIFM RMB MMF was proactively designed to fit neatly into most global investment policies while satisfying the burgeoning needs for better diversification, liquidity and yield optimisation. The CIFM RMB MMF’s T+1 liquidity gives it more flexibility than regulated call deposits, while typically out-performing the rates prescribed by PBoC.</p>
<p>As the concept becomes more familiar, increasing numbers of both local and MNCs are choosing to invest in MMFs in China. The CIFM RMB MMF in China, Spence adds, has doubled in size in the past five quarters, with RMB 21.99 billion ($3.5 billion) in assets under management as of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2012<sup id=""fnref:6""><a href=""#fn:6"" rel=""footnote"">6</a></sup>, and rose another 10% during January 2013 – there are more than 250 institutional investors using the fund, giving it a highly stable client base<sup id=""fnref:7""><a href=""#fn:7"" rel=""footnote"">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The launch of the RMB fund was part of a long-term strategy in Asia to serve JPMAM’s global clients and develop new local currency solutions for domestic institutional investors, notes Spence. Since then JPMAM has developed its footprint in Asia with the addition of AAA-rated MMFs in Japanese yen (JPY) in 2007, Singapore dollar (SGD) in 2007 and Australian dollar (AUD) in 2010.</p>

<h3 id=""taking-it-to-the-region"">Taking it to the region</h3>
<p>In taking this trail-blazing approach, JPMAM becomes the only provider with a consistent MMF strategy across the region, added to which it brings the benefits of its wider global investment experience. Despite its ongoing series of ‘firsts’ in this space, Spence feels JPMAM is still at an early stage of development of its regional solutions. This is not false modesty, he explains, but “part of our long-term strategy to build a complete platform of short-term solutions across key markets in Asia, and grow with the markets.” It has, he opines, “certainly been a very successful beginning. However, it is important that we continue to innovate in the largest markets like China and Japan, which is why we launched our second MMF in Japan in October 2012, the JPY Government Liquidity Fund, which became the first ever T+0 institutional MMF in the domestic market limited to government risk in the underlying portfolio.”</p>
<p>Indeed, in January 2013, total assets under management (AUM) for JPMAM’s Asian local currency MMFs exceeded $11 billion<sup id=""fnref:9""><a href=""#fn:9"" rel=""footnote"">9</a></sup>, along the way securing its status as the largest institutional MMF provider in Japan<sup id=""fnref:10""><a href=""#fn:10"" rel=""footnote"">10</a></sup> (and only AAA MMF), the largest AAA MMF in China and the largest and only AAA-rated MMF in Singapore dollars<sup id=""fnref:11""><a href=""#fn:11"" rel=""footnote"">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The CIFM RMB MMF was the fastest-growing MMF of the Asian platform for JPMAM during 2012, rising by about RMB 8 billion ($1.2 billion)<sup id=""fnref:12""><a href=""#fn:12"" rel=""footnote"">12</a></sup>. “What we are experiencing is corporate demand driving growth of short-term fixed income markets in Asia, represented by the MMFs we manage,” comments Spence. “This will continue to allow us to create new and innovative solutions for our clients.”</p>
<h3 id=""what-the-treasurer-wants"">What the treasurer wants</h3>
<p>Treasurers generically look for five key attributes when evaluating new investment products, explains Spence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Security of principal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity, without hidden costs or penalties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency, with easy to understand structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relative yield.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“The CIFM RMB MMF in China is successful because it hits all of these attributes and it is consistent with global treasury policies,” he states, adding that even the push for yield, which is typically the last in the list of demands, is satisfied. “The unique thing about China is that the regulations are still demanding: bank deposits, for example, are controlled by both tenor and yield. However, there is a deep and growing fixed income market that operates based on market yields.”</p>
<p>But the fixed income markets are not the easiest for a treasurer to gain direct access to, comments Spence. MMFs – especially the AAA-rated fund, which invests in the highest rated instruments available onshore (primarily treasury bills and other government-backed instruments, and repos) – provide a neatly packaged solution for those seeking to access the fixed income markets to achieve both diversification and higher yields than traditional bank deposits. For example, during January 2013, the seven-day repo market (the deepest most liquid market in China) provided yields averaging 3%, whereas a regulated seven-day PBoC deposit offered 1.35%<sup id=""fnref:13""><a href=""#fn:13"" rel=""footnote"">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides improved yield, there is an additional advantage for treasurers. Dividends from mutual funds in general, which would include MMF’s are tax-exempt. With corporate tax in China up to 25%, this is potentially a material difference to other taxable investment options, including deposits and direct securities<sup id=""fnref:16""><a href=""#fn:16"" rel=""footnote"">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this context, if the prospect of MMFs in China sounds too good to be true, Spence refers back to the generally broader guidelines issued by CSRC. Of the 62 MMFs<sup id=""fnref:17""><a href=""#fn:17"" rel=""footnote"">17</a></sup> in the market today, most follow the broader set of guidelines. Investment practices, he notes, will therefore naturally differ from one fund to another and he urges investors to fully understand the investment processes and risks of the funds they are considering, as well as the experience of the manager, adding that due diligence has always been an important part of investment decisions.</p>
<p>The guidelines of the CIFM RMB MMF creates a unique appeal to prudent corporate and institutional investors in China. Indeed, with the demand in China increasing for alternative investment solutions beyond using simple bank deposits, the CIFM RMB MMF is seen by Spence as “a great first step” for companies to take.</p>

<h3 id=""the-next-big-trends-in-china"">The next big trends in China</h3>
<p>JPMAM’s experience suggests that trapped cash will still exist, despite new programmes from the Chinese government designed to liberalise cross-border capital flows. For example, pilot schemes around RMB and foreign currency movements are underway, under the guidance of China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), in consultation with PBoC. For now, these pilots are deliberately limited in their reach (around five banks and thirteen corporates to date).</p>
<p>While the pilots will offer some companies more flexibility in managing excess cash balances in China, Spence notes that there are also companies that are intentionally holding back annual dividends for future growth. “For many companies, there is much more potential to grow inside China than outside,” he notes, adding that local cash in the meantime could earn an average of 3-4% in China as opposed to “near-zero” in developed markets, with the opportunity also for currency appreciation.</p>
<p>As these reserve cash pools grow, treasurers are increasingly looking to segment cash in China, as many already do globally. More intensive cash flow forecasting processes will deliver more balanced decisions between the need for liquidity versus longer investment horizons. Currently the options available further out on the curve are “very limited – almost non-existent”, says Spence. So, as companies in China consider what to do with their cash reserves, he says discretionary investment portfolios, or separate accounts, are becoming “very interesting”.</p>
<p>CIFM, using the same investment process as the RMB MMF and in conjunction with JPMAM, launched the first short-term fixed income separate account in June 2012<sup id=""fnref:18""><a href=""#fn:18"" rel=""footnote"">18</a></sup>. Such solutions will play an increasingly important part of its solutions mix going forward. Companies will normally maintain diversification limits in individual mutual funds, thus restricting how much can be placed in a single MMF. The “almost unlimited” scale and diversification that can be achieved in a separate account will thus provide the ideal vehicle for the corporate treasurer with cash reserves that have a longer investment horizon.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious success of the CIFM RMB MMF, surprisingly it is only in the last 18 months that a small band of competitors has seen fit to enter the market. Whilst there are some natural barriers to entry, the most obvious being foreign fund managers’ requirement to operate through a joint venture (one of the reasons why JPMAM partnered with SITCo to create CIFM), Spence admits that he anticipated competitors would appear “much earlier on”.</p>
<p>Regardless of the how and when other players make their entrance, Spence welcomes these incursions into what has become JPMAM’s own high ground. “It will help to grow the overall market and provide some alternatives,” he comments. But then he can perhaps afford the easy acceptance of competition: with an eight-year track record in the market, it gives JPMAM a distinct advantage in terms of market knowledge and scale within its funds. “I think that is going to continue to differentiate JPMAM and CIFM for years to come.”</p>

<h3 id=""mmfs-a-brief-guide"">MMFs – A brief guide</h3>
<p>Money market funds (MMFs) are short-term debt securities, forming a part of the fixed income market. There is no central exchange or trading floor and trades are executed via the dealer market only, which is to say transactions are made through the dealer’s own account; money markets rarely offer direct access for investors and so mutual funds tend to be the way in. Instruments traded are numerous but the main ones typically used in the international setting are treasury bills, certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper (CP), Eurodollar deposits, asset-backed securities and repurchase agreements (repos). MMFs tend to be rather conservative in their approach and therefore relatively low-yielding, but they are highly liquid, making them attractive to treasurers seeking a home for their excess cash.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>The coming year will no doubt bring with it some money market fund (MMF) proposals from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as further reforms in Europe, in particular regarding constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs.</p>
<p>In addition to these reforms, MMFs are battling myriad other difficulties: the European sovereign debt crisis, concerns about the stability of European banks’ credit quality, negative yields in Europe and fiscal cliff remnants in the US. Furthermore, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) unlimited deposit insurance coverage expired on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2012. If these vulnerable deposits are reallocated into MMFs and money market securities, it may push short-term investment rates down even further.</p>
<p>Managers of MMFs are already struggling to maintain investments that deliver positive returns despite low interest rates. Prime MMF sector gross yields have fallen from more than 0.75% per annum in January 2012 to around 0.13% per annum in December 2012. In an industry where liquidity and stability of investments normally trumps yield, tough market conditions are forcing fund managers to dedicate their efforts to generating yield against all odds. However, with returns on short-term MMFs trending lower and the supply of suitable high quality issuers declining, options are becoming increasingly limited.</p>
<p>The MMF industry is no doubt preparing itself for upheaval and modification with the introduction of inevitable reforms. But the global financial arena is also shaping the structure and various management approaches to funds and certain portfolios. The MMF environment has become quite a different one to the investment arena it once was.</p>
<h3 id=""reforms-and-ratings"">Reforms and ratings</h3>
<p>Ever since the Reserve Primary Fund ‘broke the buck’ (fell below one dollar a share) in September 2008, financial market regulators have stressed the need for additional MMF regulations. In 2010, the SEC adopted revisions to the regulations to enhance the resilience of MMFs. But when former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro announced in August 2012 that the majority of SEC commissioners did not support her reform proposals for MMFs and therefore was not proceeding with a vote to solicit public comment, the money fund industry was suitably relieved. However, subsequent public comments indicate that additional reform is almost certain – the date that this is set to happen is rather more unpredictable. But by deciding not to hold a vote, Schapiro effectively handed the issue to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).</p>
<p>Alastair Sewell, Director, Fund and Asset Manager Rating Group at Fitch, believes that the pace of MMF reform could accelerate significantly in 2013. “In the US, SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar recently voiced his support for a floating NAV structure for MMFs, which makes it more likely for this option to be carried out by the SEC,” he says.</p>
<p>“This follows the FSOC proposals in November 2012 for MMF reform. These proposals included amendments to the existing MMF structure such as a floating NAV; a stable NAV with NAV buffer and “minimum balance at risk”; and a stable NAV with NAV buffer and other measures.” The public commentary period on the FSOC proposals, which was to close on 18<sup>th</sup> January 2013, has been extended to 15<sup>th</sup> February “to allow the public more time to review, consider and comment on the proposed recommendations”.</p>
<p>MMF regulation is also picking up worldwide. The International Organisation of Securities Commissioners (IOSCO), which the SEC is a member of, has published its policy recommendations for improving oversight and regulation of the ‘shadow banking’ industry (which includes MMFs). These recommendations are intended to complement existing regulatory frameworks where the IOSCO believes there is still room for further reform – including the US. In addition, the European Commission (EC) under the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) VI report is considering whether CNAV funds should be subject to additional regulations, such as capital buffers.</p>
<p>Sewell adds: “The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is considering the report published by IOSCO in October last year that suggests that the global MMF industry should be further regulated to reduce systemic risk. Specifically, IOSCO recommends additional safeguards for those MMFs using amortised cost accounting and offering CNAV per share. Furthermore, IOSCO recommends a conversion of CNAV MMFs to floating NAV MMFs through limited use of amortised cost accounting only for assets maturing below 60 days.”</p>
<p>Fitch’s rating criteria is applicable both to floating NAV and CNAV MMFs. Under its Principal Stability Fund Rating methodology, Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P) also currently rates MMFs exhibiting a variable NAV as well as CNAV MMFs, according to Françoise Nichols, Director, Fund Ratings and Evaluations at S&amp;P.</p>
<p>“We will monitor and review what impact further regulation of the MMF sector in the US, Europe and elsewhere may have on S&amp;P rated MMFs. If CNAV MMFs were to become a less attractive investment opportunity (as a result of reforms), some investors may decide to move their investments to less regulated segregated managed accounts, or to directly transact in less diversified and liquid instruments such as bank deposits and/or repurchase agreements,” he says.</p>
<p>Recently, major providers have taken steps to provide more transparency in their money funds, disclosing values on a daily basis rather than monthly. Following the announcement by Goldman Sachs of its intention to disclose values of their funds each day, J.P. Morgan, BlackRock and Dreyfus said they will also list NAVs each day. Seen by many as a positive development, daily disclosures may also make investors more likely to pull money out as a result of seeing minor discrepancies.</p>
<h3 id=""alternative-approaches"">Alternative approaches</h3>
<p>In the past 12 months, euro-denominated funds have faced the brunt of the harsh economic conditions, prime funds and government funds have been withdrawn. There have also been numerous downgrades of European financial institutions and sovereign issuers. As a result, some funds have diversified into issuers outside of Europe, albeit in smaller amounts and for reduced maturities.</p>
<p>Amid this unprofitable environment, numerous MMF providers announced soft closes restricting new accounts and placing varying restrictions on new investment from existing clients. The soft closes were introduced in the summer of last year following the European Central Bank’s (ECB) move to lower its deposit rate facility to 0% with an aim to protect MMF investors from dilution risk, according to Nichols, but some have since modified their restrictions. “We see this trend evolving and predict funds reopening to new investors, since dilution risk has reduced, as higher yielding assets held by MMFs have matured.</p>
<p>“More recently fund providers have been looking at ways to handle negative yield for euro denominated MMFs. Certain providers have already announced fund restructuring involving a share cancellation mechanism to compensate negative yield and continue to maintain a CNAV,” he says.</p>
<p>In response to the prevailing low yields and a risk of deterioration of MMFs’ NAV, J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPM AM) is one such provider that has elected to employ unconventional measures. The investment firm’s board of directors decided to restructure its euro-denominated MMFs, making share class amendments and updating the investment objectives for both the J.P. Morgan Euro Government Liquidity Fund and the J.P. Morgan Euro Liquidity Fund.</p>
<p>Sewell recognises the proactive approach European MMFs have taken to deal with the unfavourable future and offset the potential impact of negative rates on NAV. “Negative MMF yields stemming from the short-term market rate environment would not be a negative rating factor per se for Fitch-rated MMFs, including for those rated at ‘AAAmmf’,” he insists.</p>
<p>“Some fund complexes have already implemented new share class structures to pass on potential negative yields to fund investors. We expect several others to follow suit in the coming weeks. The essence of the negative yield distribution mechanism is based on keeping the NAV per share stable at the initial subscription price per share. Thus, if a fund suffers a negative overall yield then the fund redeems pro-rata investor shares such that the NAV per share remains stable (ie the number of units (shares) in the fund can vary, but the value per share remains stable at one).”</p>
<p>The introduction of flex shares is designed to ease investors’ accounting and tax issues through maintenance of share values at par. Yet the net result is that investors lose capital and this, according to some market experts, is at odds with the AAA ratings definition (Moody’s cites the ability to meet the objective of preserving capital as one of the key measures). That said, it can be argued that a MMF is a lower risk proposition than direct investment and that yields, although potentially negative, should compare favourably with market returns on similarly high-grade and liquid investments.</p>
<p>According to a Moody’s whitepaper, changing the fund’s structure is credit positive for JPM AM as it will enable it to operate in both a negative and positive yield environment. “Such flexibility will empower JPM AM to retain current investors and attract new assets under management (AUM), resulting in higher MMF revenues,” says the report.</p>
<h3 id=""mmf-managers-feel-the-strain"">MMF managers feel the strain</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, the burden on providers continues to ramp up. With the pressure to achieve yield while remaining risk averse, portfolio managers have placed heavier reliance on barbell strategies. In the US, MMFs are expected to attract new assets as a result of the end of the FDIC’s insurance on bank deposits. This may place pressure on yields offered by US MMFs, according to Nichols. Furthermore, some generalist fund providers are focusing on distributing product generating higher fees than MMFs, resulting in further product rationalisation and consolidation in the industry.</p>

</figure>
<p>“The extremely low level of yield for euro-denominated MMFs has led some providers to offer higher yielding alternative products to their investors, which may be less liquid or riskier than ‘AAAm’ rated short-term MMFs,” he explains. The declining yield environment, reduction of eligible supply and tightening rating requirements have each, to varying degrees, impacted and accelerated the level of consolidation in the euro Institutional Money Market Funds Association (IMMFA) space, which represents European AAA rated MMFs, according to Mark Stockley, Managing Director, Head of International Cash Sales at BlackRock. “Consolidation to date has principally occurred with those providers who had smaller sized funds, limited distribution and have found managing their euro funds challenging.”</p>
<p>This theme of consolidation is a concept Sewell agrees with, mainly among MMF managers that are sub-scale and do not derive synergistic benefit from MMF offerings. “Niche MMF players are already under material profitability pressures in this prolonged, ultra-low interest rate environment. The impact of low yields on fund manager fees may cause some managers to reconsider their strategic commitment to the cash management industry. “In instances where MMF managers apply management fees, waivers are likely to persist, especially for US dollar-denominated MMFs, to maintain a positive yield to investors. We would question how sustainable these fee waivers are especially for small to mid-size MMF complexes,” he says.</p>
<p>And while Mike Hughes, Global Head of Fund Services, Deutsche Bank, doesn’t expect the larger players pulling back from the MMF market, he also notes that: “total expense ratios (TERs) are under severe pressure given the interest rate environment. Few MMF managers can really afford to absorb any fees, yet are being forced to subsidise charges from banks, administrators and custodians to protect TERs.”</p>
<h3 id=""an-ongoing-battle"">An ongoing battle</h3>
<p>The MMF sector would no doubt benefit from the resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis. A likely by-product of the resolution of this issue would be an increase in issuance of MMF-eligible securities due to the potential improvement in economic activities. According to Sewell, Fitch expects the limited supply of high quality short-term assets to continue to be one of the major challenges for the MMF sector in 2013, especially those portfolios denominated in euro and sterling. Nonetheless he remains positive for the future of the MMF industry and Fitch’s global outlook for MMF ratings in 2013 is stable.</p>
<p>“We see a few interesting trends: first, towards collateralised exposures (repo, ABCP); and second, to non-traditional geographies – we have seen an uptake in exposure to issuers from Asia in particular, although outside of US dollar denominated funds issuance levels will limit uptake in MMFs. We would expect liquidity levels to remain high in 2013, but weighted average life (WAL – used to measure credit risk)/weighted average maturity (WAM – used to measure interest rate risk) will increase slightly as funds selectively add longer dated exposures to higher quality issuers,” he says.</p>
<p>As the regulation debate on MMFs continues, market participants will likely present alternative ideas as they look for common ground on which to operate and aim to maintain a thriving fund industry. However, achieving sustainable yield and currency stability in the volatile financial climate will also play a major part in defining a new, improved fund environment. The question is: will the arduous search prove successful enough to restore investors’ confidence in MMFs, and thus stabilise the future of the industry?</p></div>

Short Term Investments,Short-duration strategy: tailoring your cash portfolio for higher yields , Published: Sep 2012 ,,"<div class=""gs-grid__col gs-grid__col-1-10 gs-grid__col--expand"" style="""">

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Record low central bank rates are driving down the available yields from money market instruments. Regulation is compounding matters by suppressing yields and potentially limiting the pool of investments available to corporate treasurers. With these structural changes in the financial industry reshaping best practice cash management, how can treasury professionals look to optimise their cash portfolio and achieve higher yields, while being mindful of risk? A short-duration strategy within a separately managed account could be the answer, according to BNY Mellon Asset Management.</p>
<p>While the return on cash may be lower on the treasurer’s priority list today than minimising investment risk, this does not mean that the desire for yield has disappeared entirely. Nevertheless, the high-quality, easy access liquidity provided by money market funds (MMFs) and bank deposits has superseded the yield requirement for many companies of late. But by limiting their cash investments to these traditional tools, treasurers may be foregoing opportunities for higher yields – or even accepting negative returns. This approach may also preclude a corporate from achieving greater control and improved cost efficiencies over their cash investment portfolio.</p>
<p>So what is the alternative? A short-duration strategy within a separately managed account (SMA) can, according to Laurie Carroll, Director, BNY Asset Management, provide an attractive option for those investors in search of higher yields (than those currently offered by fixed net asset value (NAV) instruments). In order to fully embrace this tailored portfolio approach however corporates would be well advised to ensure they have a good, strategic hold over their available liquidity from the outset.</p>
<p>BNY Mellon recommends a three-tier approach, segmenting cash into operating, core and strategic balances. “We provide solutions appropriate to the three different tiers of cash typically held by clients,” says Carroll.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first tier consists of operating cash which is required for daily cash flows. This needs to be highly liquid and money market funds or short-term separately managed accounts are the most appropriate means of providing this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second tier is the company’s core cash. This is allocated to particular medium and long-term requirements and therefore needs moderate liquidity. “We believe that treasurers may be missing an opportunity to pick up additional yield here,” continues Carroll. “We suggest using enhanced cash or ultra short separately managed accounts for the second tier.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third tier is set aside for longer-term liabilities (such as construction costs or capital calls) and therefore less liquidity is needed and higher yields and returns are expected. “We can provide this with one-three or one-five year maturity portfolios or matched funding separate accounts.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Separately managed accounts can be used for all three tiers of cash, but may be of particular benefit in the second and third tiers, given their longer time horizon and higher total return objective.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id=""sources-of-performance"">Sources of performance</h3>
<p>For those corporate investors who have the flexibility to consider a broader scope of relative-value opportunities across slightly extended time horizons, a bespoke SMA can be constructed to capitalise on a wider range of strategies, sectors, and securities than those available through constant NAV vehicles. “Yes, companies need liquidity – whether that be money market funds, bank deposits or whatever you use for your daily/weekly cash needs – but in this environment where there is little yield, companies should also be looking to generate some excess return, for example by placing at least some of their money further out along the yield curve,” explains Carroll.</p>
<p>BNY Mellon Cash Investment Strategies (CIS) Team uses an active investment management approach to help clients generate consistent, low volatility returns. This is the team’s aim whatever the interest rate or macroeconomic environment.</p>
<p>The four strategies which the CIS team employs to do this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased maturity/duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yield-curve positioning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So how does each of these work?</p>
<h3 id=""increased-maturity-duration"">Increased maturity/duration</h3>
<p>By modestly increasing the average maturity or duration of their portfolio, companies should be able to take advantage of the normally positive slope of the yield curve. In other words, by moving out slightly further along the yield curve, returns should typically be enhanced, as the chart below illustrates.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, corporates should be aware that there are several different types of yield curve. “The key point here,” says Carroll, “is that the yield curve is normally positive. Sometimes it isn’t. Furthermore, by extending the maturity, corporates will have their cash locked in for longer, which will impact their liquidity and could potentially increase volatility.”</p>
<p>This is where the three tiers of cash come into their own, as they essentially impose maturity limits on a segment by segment basis. “The team of experts at BNY Mellon will also work with companies to ensure that they have sufficient operating capital to meet any immediate or emergency liquidity requirements. In other words, we keep a very close eye on any risks so that clients can comfortably extend the average maturity of their portfolio in search of additional yield.”</p>

<h3 id=""credit"">Credit</h3>
<p>Looking for undervalued securities in the market is another way of increasing the yield potential of a portfolio. But this requires skill, expertise and resources. “We have a team of credit analysts who establish a ratings trend for each securities issue. An in-house assessment as to the likelihood of the issue’s current rating changing – whether it be an upgrade or a downgrade – is undertaken by the team. Our portfolio managers then combine this trend outlook with current spread levels to help inform their buy and sell decisions,” says Carroll.</p>
<p>Increasing the credit risk of investments can also enhance yield. For example, corporate securities tend to offer potentially higher yields than government securities since the credit quality of corporate securities is not normally as high as their government counterparts. This outperformance is particularly marked in the current macroeconomic environment, but has been noted across a variety of market cycles, as illustrated in the table opposite.</p>

</div>
<p>In this interview we look at the benefits of a short-duration strategy as well as best practice in managing cash investments today.</p>
<h5 id=""what-does-a-short-duration-strategy-within-a-separately-managed-account-offer-to-corporates"">What does a short-duration strategy within a separately managed account offer to corporates?</h5>
<p>It’s a question of layering the cash that the corporate doesn’t need overnight – so that duration becomes part of the strategy. This is not a question of hedging; this is the investment management of a pool of ‘near cash’ whose average maturity or duration is not as short as a bank deposit or a money market fund. Realistically, that’s anywhere from a six month to a two-year duration.</p>
<p>At BNY Mellon Asset Management, we believe that this kind of approach should really form part of a client’s three to five year strategy. Naturally, the majority of a client’s cash is going to be very short-term, but you can never tell where interest rates or credit quality are going. As such, it is the investor’s duty to seek diversification of strategies today.</p>
<p>Just look at the Eurozone where deposits and MMF returns are very close to zero. Some corporates are keeping all their eggs in those very low-rate ‘baskets’ because they like the security and liquidity. But that does not necessarily constitute optimal cash management. Put simply, since no-one can forecast interest rates with any certainty, we feel that clients should diversify their sources of performance, even in the very front end of the yield curve.</p>
<h5 id=""how-does-the-short-duration-strategy-look-to-enhance-yields"">How does the short-duration strategy look to enhance yields?</h5>
<p>Within our short-duration strategy we have four tools that can be used to add value. As outlined, we use average maturity and duration; credit quality; liquidity – ie balancing how much the client needs overnight versus what can be put out longer; and then we look at yield curve positioning. It’s interesting that all of these tools are used to some degree in managing money market funds. Given the restrictions placed on MMFs however (take a AAA rated fund with a maximum WAM of 60 days), they can only leverage these tools to a small degree.</p>
<p>Moreover, those companies who cannot see beyond investing solely in MMFs or bank deposits are not embracing best practice cash management. Understandably, treasurers are not used to thinking about cash diversification in a way that uses longer average maturity and longer duration. They may therefore be hesitant that, by going in search of yield, they are putting company money at risk. But leaving money to earn zero or negative yields ultimately means losing out on both money (time value) and opportunity.</p>
<h5 id=""why-is-this-strategy-a-key-part-of-bny-mellon-asset-managements-offering"">Why is this strategy a key part of BNY Mellon Asset Management’s offering?</h5>
<p>Providing a more strategic approach for our corporate investors really differentiates us from those banks that are just offering money market funds. More importantly, it allows us to open up a full spectrum of instruments to our investors. And we’re not just talking about commercial paper, bank deposits or money market funds (MMFs remain a key part of our offering) – we’re talking about the shorter maturity part of the bond market. That in itself is extremely powerful and shows BNY Mellon’s commitment to this space.</p>

<h3 id=""liquidity"">Liquidity</h3>
<p>Although many corporates would be wary of altering the liquidity of their portfolio too much, it is possible to make strategic tweaks. Says Carroll: “Take two securities that are to all intents and purposes identical – except for their liquidity. The less liquid of the two will tend to offer a higher yield. Shrewd allocations to certain securities or even sectors which are less liquid can potentially generate incrementally higher returns.” With the expertise available at BNY Mellon Asset Management, this tweaking should have minimal impact on the portfolio’s overall liquidity.</p>
<h3 id=""yield-curve-positioning"">Yield curve positioning</h3>
<p>Yield curves come in three primary shapes: inverted, flat or normal. Critical factors affecting the shape of the yield curve include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expected changes in monetary policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current outlook for future inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency flows driven by the trade balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The future path of interest rates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main ways that BNY Mellon’s CIS team attempts to realise above-average yields by ‘riding the yield curve’. Both relate to the spacing of maturities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Bullet strategy.</h5>
<p>This is where a portfolio of securities with maturity dates concentrated at one point on the yield curve (eg ten years) is built. This maturity date is not necessarily the same as the time period for which the funds are available for investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Barbell strategy.</h5>
<p>This is where a portfolio of securities with maturity dates set at two extremes on the yield curve (eg five and 20 years) is built.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These techniques are best suited to the front-end of the yield curve, where a high degree of slope and curvature is typically found.</p>
<h3 id=""balancing-risk-and-return"">Balancing risk and return</h3>
<p>By going in search of additional yield, corporates will inevitably encounter risks such as interest rate risk; liquidity risk; credit/downgrade risk and spread risk. At BNY Mellon Asset Management, however, these potential risks are factored into a holistic risk-reward framework and portfolio strategies are constructed with the aim of meeting clients’ specific investment goals. Separate account management is a key step towards achieving these.</p>
<p>The benefits of SMAs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A portfolio objective specific to the company’s risk tolerances and total return objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guidelines and strategy can be easily revised based on the company’s changing goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A separate investment management contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom guidelines structured to meet a company’s requirements for quality, liquidity and duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment management is not impacted by the flows of other investors, or controlled by regulatory changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The availability of customised reporting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the use of a short-duration strategy within an SMA can be an extremely powerful tool for those companies seeking improved returns across a broad spectrum of cash activities.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><i>Whether you are looking for a traditional short-term money market fund or a fully customised solution, finding products that match your liquidity needs is crucial to any successful cash investment strategy.  In this Product Profile, we look at a range of available liquidity products, how they differ in terms of risk, return and duration and how they tie in with cash segmentation.  We also discuss the ways in which yield can be maximised for a given level of risk.</i></p>
<p>Maintaining sufficient liquidity while generating a suitable level of return from a pool of cash investments continues to be a challenge for today’s corporate treasurer.  There is no easy answer to striking the right balance, but adopting an organised investment approach by segmenting cash according to its purpose – and therefore the time horizon for which it can be invested – is a good first step.  Segmenting cash also makes it easier to identify those investments that accurately align with the company’s desired risk/return profile.</p>
<p>Companies may categorise their cash differently, but usually there will be two, three or four options reflecting the short-term, medium-term and longer-term needs of the business.  It is possible that there will be sub-categories according to location or currency, for example, and the liquidity management structures in place (such as cash concentration and notional pooling) will also need to be taken into account.  Broadly speaking though, the following categories provide a simple, clear and useful segmentation between the different types of cash a company has:</p>
<h5 id=""operating-short-term-horizon"">Operating (short-term horizon)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cash typically used for daily operating needs which is likely to be required at very short notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires preservation of principal, late-day access and same-day liquidity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=""reserve-medium-term-horizon"">Reserve (medium-term horizon)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Same-day access not needed, although must be kept liquid in case of unforeseen requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash set aside for possible acquisition, stock repurchasing and R&amp;D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typical investment horizon of 3 to 12 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=""strategic-longer-term-horizon"">Strategic (longer-term horizon)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No short-term use forecasted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash on the balance sheet that has not been historically used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment horizon of one year or longer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But what instruments are available to maximise the use of surplus cash across these segments and across the liquidity spectrum?</p>

<p>According to Travis Spence , Head of Global Liquidity, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, corporates that are looking to truly optimise their cash investments should consider broadening their horizons beyond bank deposits.  “That’s not to say that deposits are not useful tools – they absolutely are –and in some cases, they are the only available option.</p>
<p>However, many corporates have simply relied on bank deposits as a matter of legacy process rather than active decision making.  Fixed Income Markets, especially in Asia, have developed rapidly over the past five years.  Now, more than ever, it is crucial for companies to revisit and update their investment policies and practices, taking into account all of the investment instruments available to them.”</p>
<!-- nextpage -->
<p>Some companies are already doing just that, as the results of the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Global Liquidity Survey 2011 demonstrate:</p>

<br/>
<p>In fact, treasurers across Europe and Asia have a similar allocation to instruments outside bank deposits.  However, these results also highlight the heavy reliance on bank deposits that Spence mentioned.  “At J.P. Morgan Asset Management, we are able to place bank deposits through our parent bank, if that is what is best for the client.  But we also have a suite of liquidity products available for ‘all seasons’ from a risk-return perspective.  In other words, no matter which way a client’s requirements shift from a risk standpoint, from an interest rate or currency perspective, we have a product to suit their needs.”</p>
<p>The range of short-term investment products available from J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) Global Liquidity encompasses the following:</p>
<h5 id=""stable-net-asset-value-snav"">Stable Net Asset Value (SNAV)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Government Liquidity funds.</h5>
<p>AAA-rated funds with same-day liquidity investing predominantly in government issued securities, offering maximum security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity funds.</h5>
<p>Also known as credit funds or money market funds are AAA-rated funds with same-day liquidity investing in a broad array of money market securities selected by JPMAM’s global team of credit analysts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=""variable-net-asset-value-vnav"">Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Current Reserves Funds.</h5>
<p>These are AAA-rated funds investing in a broad array of money market securities while potentially offering an incremental return over AAA-rated liquidity funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Managed Reserves Funds and Strategy.</h5>
<p>Either AA-rated funds or separately managed accounts, these potentially offer an additional return over AAA-rated liquidity funds while maintaining a low level of volatility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Short Duration Funds and Strategy.</h5>
<p>These funds or managed accounts potentially offer an additional return over a low duration market index while maintaining a moderate level of volatility.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s suite of liquidity solutions extend from the very safest fund offerings to those that cater for a slightly higher appetite for yield. This means that our experience not only spans a broad risk-return spectrum but also takes into account a variety of liquidity needs.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>“Moreover, the solutions we can offer in our liquidity fund range are becoming increasingly global,” says Spence.  “We expanded from a USD MMF house in 2000 to offer euro and sterling funds.  Since 2005 we pioneered the development of a consistent platform of money market funds in Asia including Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Australian dollar.  And more recently we added solutions in Brazilian real.  So our platform is very international from a currency perspective too.”</p>
<!-- nextpage -->
<h3 id=""matching-requirements"">Matching requirements</h3>
<p>“Of course, our conversations with clients aren’t about the presentation of our product line up though,” Spence explains.  “It’s a question of understanding how well they know their cash position, as well as the policies they have in place to manage their cash.  In conjunction with that, we like to have a healthy discussion around issues in the short-term investment space and the outlook for the current yield environment.  That really enables us to get a holistic picture of how the client’s cash could be put to best use, whilst ensuring liquidity requirements are met.”</p>
<p>Speaking about which products are most suitable for each segment of cash, Spence says: “Our SNAV products – the credit funds and the government liquidity funds – are ideal for operating cash, that is, day-to-day working capital type liquidity.  From a regulatory perspective, both of these SNAV funds fall under Rule 2a-7 in the US and under the ESMA definition of a short-term MMF in Europe.  This means that they have daily liquidity and the investor sees no volatility and cash equivalent in accounting treatment.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>Stepping out a little further along the liquidity spectrum, we then have our Current Reserves and Managed Reserves funds. These are ideal for reserve cash allocations with longer investment horizons, from over one month to over six months, respectively. Such funds tend to sit just outside of the 2a-7 and ESMA short-term MMF space and by their nature they may carry slightly lower levels of liquidity. There may also be some volatility as these funds have a variable NAV. Nevertheless, in a product like this, the volatility is still managed to tight parameters.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>“As we step out further again, we enter the short duration funds space, which is ideal for strategic cash allocations with an investment horizon of over 12 months.  Again, volatility will be more noticeable in this kind of fund, but while an investor may see a deterioration in NAV on a daily or even monthly basis, this would perhaps not be the case over a historic rolling three-month period – hence the longer investment horizon.”</p>
<p>In addition to its range of funds, J.P. Morgan Asset Management also offers separately managed accounts in all our major markets including China.  These are for clients who require a customised portfolio of securities to meet specific investment needs.  Portfolios can be tailored based on a client’s credit risk, interest rate risk, cash flows, tax status and investment horizon.  When establishing a separately managed account, J.P. Morgan’s teams work closely with the client to set a clear mandate.</p>
<p>The portfolio management team for a separately managed account also holds discussions with the client to establish the desired investment objective, benchmark, expected risk/return characteristics and other requirements of the new account.  Based on these in-depth conversations, an investment strategy is developed, as well as a set of investment guidelines.  These guidelines will be closely followed at all times in order to successfully execute the investment strategy on the client’s behalf.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to help clients identify which products are best suited to their liquidity needs and also to help them recognise how yield could be maximised, while adhering to any risk parameters,” adds Spence.  But why choose an asset manager to invest your surplus cash, and more specifically, why choose J.P. Morgan Asset Management?</p>

<h5 id=""how-would-you-describe-the-health-of-the-international-mmf-industry-at-the-moment"">How would you describe the health of the international MMF industry at the moment?</h5>
<p>Despite the challenging market conditions that we’re operating in, I consider the industry to be robust and in relatively good health. Look at the demands of the Eurozone environment, the reduction of available suitable liquid instruments, and the issues some of the peripheral currencies and countries within Europe have been facing.</p>
<p>Those hurdles, coupled with a significant change in some of the dollar funding patterns, have made it a difficult environment for MMFs. But as an industry we have stood by our guiding principles of security and liquidity, which has given us a conservative but reliable reputation. So while 2011 was certainly a very difficult year, the industry weathered it well and continues to do so in 2012.</p>
<h5 id=""speaking-of-the-eurozone-crisis-how-is-it-impacting-the-mmf-industry"">Speaking of the Eurozone crisis, how is it impacting the MMF industry?</h5>
<p>Hopefully politicians are working towards, or beginning to achieve, a greater sense of stability but there is a lot of progress to be made from a macroeconomic perspective. Looking at the impact of the Eurozone troubles from an industry standpoint, the concerns largely revolve around credit risks, reduced supply, lower yields, and generally less liquidity in the market.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>There are also difficulties around the selection of suitable investment instruments, particularly in the European government space, as demonstrated by the German and Dutch authorities (issuing paper over the Christmas period at anything up to minus 20 basis points). If you had asked me a number of years ago what the most difficult products to manage are, I certainly wouldn’t have said it would be a government-only euro denominated fund.</p>
<p>Our experience with our clients is that they are largely focused on capital preservation and liquidity, while avoiding being overly exposed to single counterparties through the deposit market. Yield is some way down the priority list at present.</p>
<h5 id=""yes-there-has-been-a-lot-of-press-about-short-term-investment-challenges-for-corporates-lately-are-money-funds-benefiting-from-that"">Yes, there has been a lot of press about short-term investment challenges for corporates lately – are money funds benefiting from that?</h5>
<p>That’s a good question. If you focus just on funds in the IMMFA market then overall growth in assets in 2011 across all currencies was a healthy 7.2% as industry assets increased to $663 billion from $618 billion. IMMFA fund assets have increased a little under 1% so far in 2012. If I look at it purely amongst our peer groups, BlackRock has navigated this period particularly well – in 2011 we grew our funds around 10% or so from $80 billion to $88 billion, while we’ve had a good start to the year increasing nearly 2% to just under $90 billion in assets<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><h5 id=""there-has-been-considerable-regulatory-focus-on-mmfs-recently-what-is-the-current-thinking-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic"">There has been considerable regulatory focus on MMFs recently. What is the current thinking on both sides of the Atlantic?</h5>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has some pending Rule 2a-7 recommendations and it looks like they will come out with some new proposals in the next month or so. It is unclear yet exactly what the draft proposals will be, but there may be a set capital requirement. Whatever happens, it will be interesting to see after that what is adopted or recommended in Europe.</p>
<p>Stepping back a little, immediately following the 2008-9 crisis, regulators in both the US and European markets amended the rules around MMFs. For instance, the SEC introduced some major changes to Rule 2a-7 introducing more stringent guidelines around transparency as well as new or amended rules around credit, liquidity and interest rate risk.</p>
<p>At the same time the European Commission adopted new rules for MMFs as proposed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) that categorised funds into ‘money market funds’ and ‘short-term money market funds’. We think ESMA brought some positive clarity to the European industry by doing so, and the consensus from the industry and investors has been that the SEC’s changes in the US market have been positive also.</p>
<p>While these are major steps for the US and European markets, what I can see now is that there is definitely greater trans-Atlantic co-ordination between the various regulatory bodies and greater focus on trying to put some additional regulation in place; in theory, to make money funds safer.</p>
<p>From an industry perspective, there’s been quite a strong leaning towards that synchronisation because post-2008 there have been a lot of piecemeal changes made.</p>
<p>That said, the arguments that many industry groups are putting forward is that the new recommendations being considered, in particular by the SEC, would possibly be detrimental and might negatively impact the industry. So we are already seeing quite a lot of concern and speculation about pending or proposed rule changes because we don’t actually know what they will be yet.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>In Europe, MMFs are also faced with the focus on systemically important institutions. The question is whether money funds represent a risk to the banking sector and MMFs get drawn into wider debates around ‘shadow banking’ and systemically important institutions.</p>
<p>In contrast to some of the positioning that thinks of MMFs as leading to greater volatility in the financial markets our argument is that they, in fact, provide greater stability.</p>
<p>What you don’t want to do is implement a set of reforms that significantly impact the MMF industry and drive those balances and flows back on to bank balance sheets. This is counterintuitive; given the challenges and failures the banks have had, the last thing that regulation should do is to reduce the investment choices that clients have available to them.</p>
<p>We think the SEC are likely to clarify their thinking around the new proposed changes to Rule 2a-7 sometime in the first half of 2012. They’re likely to put out their proposals and give some time for the industry and other interested parties to comment prior to implementation but at this stage there’s no definite timeline.</p>
<h5 id=""how-has-that-impacted-the-short-term-credit-markets"">What about regulatory changes in the banking sector (eg Basel III) – how has that impacted the short-term credit markets?</h5>
<p>I think one of the fallouts from Basel III is that a lot of the banks have been forced to issue much longer, to look for longer-term sources of funding. This is unfortunately a bit of a ‘perfect storm’ when you think about the rules and regulations approach that MMFs are obliged to take.</p>
<p>Just to delve into this a little deeper – following the financial crisis in 2008-9 regulators identified that banks placed too much reliance on short-term wholesale funding, very often in the form of repurchase agreements. When banks became nervous of each other, particularly in 2008, they stopped providing these short-term credit lines to other banks and a number of institutions ran into liquidity issues. Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns are cases in point here.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Basel III really is a direct response to that – the new regulations focus on reducing banks’ reliance on short-term wholesale funding and this has seen more issuance by banks in longer-dated securities and a reduction in short-term debt offerings. MMFs are big buyers of high quality short-term securities issued by financial institutions and as a result we’ve been faced with diminished supply.</p>
<h5 id=""what-are-fund-sponsors-doing-to-help-their-clients-understand-risk-in-the-money-markets"">What are fund sponsors doing to help their clients understand risk in the money markets?</h5>
<p>Certainly from our perspective, we aim to stay close to our clients, helping them to better understand what’s going on in the markets. At all times we aim to provide our clients with thought leadership and inform them about industry challenges and how they may play out.

<p>Particularly when you’re in markets like these, clients are a lot more focused on trying to get greater information and achieve greater control over a broad range of topics.

<h5 id=""is-technology-changing-the-way-you-sell-cash-products-to-your-investors-and-if-so-how"">Is technology changing the way you sell cash products to your investors and if so, how?</h5>
<p>Technology is becoming more important in the industry, whether it is the traditional ways that clients can access and use a money fund; whether they can automatically sweep from their bank account to and from a money fund; whether they use it to access general information on products, on markets, on yield characteristics or whether they start using it to think about risk concentration and transparency.

This gives clients the ability to completely look through to all of the underlying holdings, right across a range of different providers. This is currently available in the US and is something that we will be rolling out in Europe in the near term.</p>
<h5 id=""is-there-need-for-an-advisory-service-to-back-up-the-depth-of-information-that-clients-can-access-via-a-portal"">So while technological advances are beneficial for transparency and so on, is there need for an advisory service to back up the depth of information that clients can access via a portal?</h5>
<p>Clearly there is a growing trend towards transparency as knowing the underlying risk of the entire portfolio is becoming increasingly critical for clients. The issue with some of the technology solutions out there that provide a so-called high level of ‘look through’ is that they are only as good as the way the data has been classified or mapped.</p>
<p>Firstly, you require full transparency and secondly, you need to know what to do next with that data. How are you going to use it and what does it tell you? So, while technology is absolutely an enabler, it does not detract from the need for an advisory offering.</p>
<h5 id=""finally-what-other-key-themes-or-challenges-do-you-see-in-the-industry-right-now"">Finally, what other key themes or challenges do you see in the industry right now?</h5>
<p>One of the things that will definitely be a challenge for the next year to 18 months will be the final outcome of the regulatory proposals. It’s about making sure that both clients and regulators properly think through and understand what the true impact of any changes will be. After all, the objective of this regulation is to provide an industry that is still efficient while meeting clients’ needs.</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Are corporates continuing to invest in money funds with yields being so low? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> We are certainly seeing that corporates are interested in investing in constant net asset value funds (CNAV). Yes, yields are low; however, it’s the liquidity that attracts investors as well as the diversification that these funds offer. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> The fundamentals haven’t changed. Corporates still have the same concerns, if not more heightened in the current environment, around making sure that they’ve got capital protection, credit diversification and liquidity. The harder question out there, particularly in the US dollar space, is whether or not to be in a treasury or prime vehicle given the narrowness of the return differentials.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> Before the crisis you often heard providers talk of the three objectives of money market funds: security, liquidity and yield. More often than not these days, yield is less of a focus and security and liquidity are the priorities. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> In comparison to time deposits, money funds also continue to deliver capacity to larger investors without the need to spread cash around to multiple counterparties.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> And of course when comparing funds to deposits, one should consider the research into the issuer: often the corporate treasurer’s credit research department will review the bank where they’re placing the deposit just when the investment decision is being made, rather than on an ongoing basis. There won’t be any form of ongoing credit research, or surveillance. An investment into a fund offers that with one trade: the credit team sitting behind it will be reviewing the portfolio on an ongoing basis.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Are corporates taking more of an interest in what’s going on behind the scenes now, for example, in your credit processes?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> Since the beginning of the credit crisis, investors have started ‘looking under the hood’ more to understand the process. They’re more informed in terms of the questions they ask, more articulate in terms of the information that we provide them and the transparency around what we’re doing, so it’s becoming a more fluid conversation in general.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> Absolutely. Transparency has become a core theme for our industry. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Corporates are also taking a greater interest in exposures. Post the Irish banking crisis, the situation in Greece and the knock-on effects in other peripheral European markets, there is definitely a greater interest around that. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Does this impose an additional reporting burden on you?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> A key underlying theme is, as Jennifer said, investment transparency. In the US, the SEC now requires that publication of shadow or mark-to-market NAVs, along with other detailed portfolio information takes place on a monthly basis, albeit with a 60 day lag. The likelihood is that similar types of data transparency will move into the international space and the ability to aggregate holdings across providers and analyse risks by geography, individual issuer, asset type and duration will become more important to investors. This will in turn require managers to provide more detailed reporting and greater analytic capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> This is now part and parcel of being in this business. If you want to play in this space, you need to be transparent and provide the reporting. It comes hand in hand with having a strong portfolio management and credit process. Ultimately, it’s what investors expect.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> How have money funds fared post-crisis? Are corporates still interested in investing in them and are they attracting many new investors? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> We have certainly seen a flight to quality during the credit crisis. Some came from a pure asset allocation trade from investors who were not traditional cash investors, however corporate investors have always been cash investors and have continued to have an appetite to invest in money market funds.</p>
</div>

<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> One of the key issues from the credit crisis was that corporates understood that having all your money in two or three banks was a high risk strategy. The number of corporates investing in money funds has therefore increased substantially.</p>
</div>

<p>“One of the key issues from the credit crisis was that corporates understood that having all your money in two or three banks was a high risk strategy.”</p>
<p><cite>Andrew Tunks, <abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Money funds have navigated a very difficult period well whilst the same cannot be said about the banking sector. Post the financial crisis, corporates de-risked by moving out of higher yielding, longer dated investments and enhanced cash, increasing their allocation to prime-style and government/treasury based funds. At the same time, there was a lot more focus and analysis on individual providers, their track record, commitment, depth of resources, and credit research capabilities. Corporates are more cash rich now than ever and many are at the limits of what they can place with banks. They continue to invest but look to do so with a very high degree of confidence around preserving their capital. That’s the first challenge. The next one is the rate of return.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> If corporates are cash rich, are you seeing a demand for funds in other currencies? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Definitely. In fact, we recently launched new products denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Indian rupees and Taiwan dollars.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> This is reflective of the success of the product and how corporates view it from a credit and risk perspective: they’re more comfortable investing monies in a money market fund regardless of what the domicile is than they are in a deposit product with perhaps a Chinese bank in China. In a perfect world, corporates will always seek to pull cash back to the centre and use it to offset obligations. So, as they have higher levels of cash and growing businesses in markets where cash is naturally trapped, money market funds are an ideal solution.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Depth of market and secondary liquidity is one of the real challenges out there as you move away from well-developed markets/currencies. There are some nuances and differences, some access problems, tax considerations and so on. It’s complicated. Breadth of client base is also a requirement. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> There are circumstances where there is demand from clients but not sufficient liquidity in the market, so there’s an imbalance. The trick is in ensuring that you’re ready to launch a new fund at a time when there is sufficient market liquidity and depth for it to be viable.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Moving to the subject of regulation, could you summarise what the current regulatory issues are and when we can expect any decisions to be made? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> They are different, depending on your regulatory jurisdiction and product domicile. The US is a more homogenised market where, through the newly formed Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), regulatory agencies such as the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and SEC have a clear remit to collectively oversee and control risks attached to US-based dollar denominated products. Globally, central banks are looking for areas of perceived systemic risk and one of the products they’ve focused on is money market funds.</p>
<p>Put simply, the focus at this point centres on the industry either providing some form of capital support or moving the product to a variable NAV (VNAV) model. Our feeling is that some form of capital will be required. The drive towards VNAV has softened, but is dependent upon coming up with a suitable capital model. One area that hasn’t been clarified to date is how the pricing of underlying securities will work and what accounting standards will apply ie use of amortised cost versus mark-to-market. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> I agree. The regulators have grasped the interest rate risk issue but not the liquidity issue or the credit issue with this particular product.</p>

<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> During the 2008 crisis, when clients were redeeming from money market funds the French industry, which is based on VNAV, was impacted by outflows just as much as the international industry and its CNAV products. It is a misconception that VNAV offers greater client protection or liquidity than a CNAV fund. Risk for a fund is principally driven by the investment strategy and not the distribution or pricing policy. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> And I think the regulators are now realising that a VNAV solution is not going to resolve the issues we saw through the crisis.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> CNAV portfolios have changed significantly over the last two years – they are now run with shorter maturities, new rules around liquidity and improved credit risk, together with offering greater transparency. How much more do they really need to be changed? It’s somewhat a question of ‘wait and see’ at present. It’s thought that the SEC would like to have agreement in principle of regulation changes for US money market funds by the end of this year.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Going back to your comment about the accounting treatment of assets within the fund Mark, are you saying that you feel that regulation should be going further? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> The issue is no different: if you’re in a deposit and want to withdraw early then the bank will make the liquidity available, typically including a breakage penalty. If you are providing a highly liquid pooled vehicle and there’s a point in time where a systemic-type event takes place, then a run on the vehicle may occur. Whether a money market fund offers a VNAV or CNAV shares will not change the amount of liquidity that can be generated from its portfolio securities.</p>
<p>To somewhat paraphrase the regulatory discussion it seems that if you want investors to think of money market funds purely as investment products, then they need to be offered as VNAV funds using full mark-to-market pricing, rather than amortised cost thereby allowing the fund’s NAV per share to truly fluctuate. At the same time it’s possible that the regulators might say that a CNAV fund can keep using amortised cost accounting and retain its stable NAV but it will be required to hold capital as a buffer against any adverse price volatility in the underlying portfolio.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Is all this regulation going to make the product safer for the corporate investor?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> From our dialogue with regulators, we expect them to desire some sort of incremental structural reform and they seem to be going down a path where the preferred option may be a capital option of some description. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> Of course, the capital needn’t necessarily come from the sponsor. The capital could come from investors in the fund. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Yes, it could be client-driven, sponsor-driven or market-driven. However the clear feedback in the US is that we need to narrow down the options to a model involving some amount of capital support if we are going to continue a CNAV based offering in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> There is no certainty that they will opt for the capital guarantee option. A distressed market redemption levy is another option. Why do you need a capital buffer? The problem with a capital buffer is that by definition it will restrict the size of the industry. There will be an awful lot of people who will pull out.</p>
<p>So there’s a vested interest in the larger houses to push for a buffer. Somehow the sponsoring entity is going to have to get a return on that buffer, which would imply to me that costs for the corporate will go up. After all, if the number of providing houses falls, market forces will push that to occur and therefore the client will end up with a significantly lower return, increased costs and less choice. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> That’s assuming that the sponsor needs to provide this capital. It’s quite possible for capital to come from within the fund, peeling off a bit of yield every day to create some type of NAV buffer within the product itself. Just as a realised gain would be held in a fund. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Indeed, but that would take a long time to build up unless you have the capital buffer given by the sponsor, which is then drawn down as the interest rate levy grows. Given the success of the industry in terms of avoiding breaking the buck and the default situation, is this really what our clients want?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> It’s not necessarily what the industry wants but staying with the status quo is not good enough and in terms of finding a solution, it really hits back to the issues that we had at the time of the credit crisis. We realised VNAV wasn’t the solution and the other options are pretty limited. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> A liquidity driven redemption levy could work, without costing the client anything. It would keep the size of the industry where it is and maintain current returns. You may have to have a scenario whereby there is an external party that will dictate when that levy is introduced. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> That could almost be considered a form of capital, because that redemption levy gets paid back into the fund. The statement of capital is very, very, broad. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Yes, but it would only occur at points of strain and only for clients who demand their money out at that point. It’s not actually a physical buffer that is there every day – only when either the market is in general crisis, such as a Lehmans event, or when an individual fund is in crisis.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> I hear what you’re saying, but a redemption levy could also supress the size of the industry as levies may discourage corporate investors. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Investors should be aware that these funds are not a no-lose situation. They aren’t magic funds that are able to generate a constant NAV. Any structure that promotes education so that investors fully understand what they’re buying, and what they should expect to get out, has to be a good thing. A capital buffer is interesting but it may not be big enough to be able to support a crisis. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> There are plenty of mechanisms that already exist within prospectuses for funds to be able to suspend redemptions and apply redemption levies, both of which are highly undesirable for money market fund investors. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> But none of you have done that? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> We wouldn’t be sitting here today if we had. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> That’s the dilemma. The second a practitioner draws on it, effectively their business model is dead, which is another reason why an external arbiter would probably need to be found to confirm a redemption levy needs to be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> The regulators’ and central banks’ concern is that investors in money market funds have a strong perception that the stable price provides a level of implied guarantee. Money funds are therefore under pressure to come up with some form of capital solution, assuming that moving to a VNAV is not in the interests of investors. Clients are very clear – they want to be able to segregate capital from income for a number of operational reasons: tax, reporting, ease of use, and so on. There’s very strong support for the CNAV product continuing. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Are we saying that the regulators are definitely going to require some form of regulatory capital?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> No. There is definitely a move for the regulators to take action. It is up to the industry to ensure that the action that is taken is in line with the interests of our clients and also the interests of the industry. </p>

<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> For the investor, is the advice to sit and watch?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> If they have an interest in the continuation of the CNAV industry, it would be better if they made their opinions known. There is a business secretary who could have influence so there are various bodies to whom they can make their views known.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Some investors are frustrated about how long the uncertainty has gone on. They’ve been more vocal, particularly in the last six months, about the importance of the product and of not wanting to go back to depending upon deposits. Money funds grew up for a very clear reason; investors wanted an alternative to putting money on bank balance sheets with the associated concentration of risk. The product driver is as strong as ever but the ongoing uncertainty about how these are regulated in the future is not in the client’s interest.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> If capital is going to have to be provided what is the likely impact on the yield? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> It depends on where it comes from and how much will be required. In terms of the amount of capital, 0.5% to 1% of a fund’s assets is a conversation that the industry is having. Beyond that, you’re beginning to put the product into a very difficult position. However, until there is some greater clarity around how the capital could be structured, over what time the capital would be required to be built, who and how it would be funded, it’s hard to know.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> If that amount of capital has to be put up and has to have a superior yield because it’s going to be subordinated debt what is the impact on the yield to the other investors?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> It depends how it’s executed. There are a multitude of ways this could be executed. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> The cost of the product in this scenario will go up. If you took a normalised yield environment in dollars, let’s say where we’re running at a 3% type return, on average the difference between treasuries and prime vehicles such as money funds has been ten to 15 basis points. If the impact of the capital cost to the fund’s return is greater than that differential, what’s the point? One of the questions that investors will be forced to consider is whether they really need same day liquidity? Do you really need a constant NAV vehicle? Some clients might not think these features are as important as others and may look to transfer some monies into investments offering slightly different liquidity and cost characteristics.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> The maintenance of a stable NAV has a cost to it. We all agree that a stable NAV is critical and regulators may allow it to continue in force but it’s likely going to come off the back of structural reform. </p>

</blockquote>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> We are likely to end up with investors who are prepared to incur a small cost premium associated with a CNAV same day vehicle and those who’d prefer to utilise slightly longer dated liquidity in a VNAV fund without the capital support.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> So clearly a more diverse product offering is coming down the pipe to meet different needs. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Some of which will not be CNAVs? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> That’s right. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Yes, and clients will benefit from working out exactly what their liquidity requirements are. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Are we talking about the enhanced funds we saw a few years ago? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Not necessarily. We are talking about investors focusing on their cash flow forecasting to predict their liquidity requirements, then segmenting the cash into what they need today, as opposed to tomorrow or in the future. Once they’ve analysed their cash-flows they should be able to invest in different types of vehicle for more and less liquid buckets – these vehicles may be both CNAV for more liquid and VNAV for less liquid buckets, with the latter having a different or higher return dynamic in part due to their lower operating costs from not requiring capital behind them.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> That’s the benefit you get if the client is prepared to give up a degree of liquidity: you can increase the return on those funds. 	 </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> On the subject of increasing costs, do you compete on fees at the moment? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> There’s a difference between being competitive and correctly priced in the market within a range and trying to buy or build market share based on giving it away. You’re looking at quality providers who are not interested in running a discounted product. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> It’s not an ingredient for long-term success.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> These days, clients are more focused on the quality of the resource, the size of the resource behind the product and the processes, than they are necessarily on a basis point here or there. Some have short memories, but a lot of people are well aware of where to look and what to focus on, and it’s not just a few basis points in fees or additional yield.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> I’m reminded of the conversations that I’ve had with bankers in the past along the lines of, ‘we’re facing increased capital ratios and we’re going to have to pass the cost on to the corporate’, and they do and the corporate walks. Then, lo and behold, they bring their pricing back down again. Do you see that happening here? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Products and markets evolve. We’re at an inflection point and we need to work out what the impact will be of any new regulations. It’s not in the clients’ interest for regulation to squeeze the life out of the industry. If money is driven back onto bank balance sheets, that’s not good for the client in terms of choice and diversification and it will impact the returns regardless.</p>
<p>We are trying to find a suitable solution that balances clients’ needs and industry needs whilst keeping the existing breadth of the market and respecting the very reasons why money funds developed in the first place and why they are a popular investment choice. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Is the industry body, IMMFA, doing a good job? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> IMMFA has done a lot of work over the last few years in terms of education. Many more clients are asking if we are a member of IMMFA which is a direct result of the focus on promotion of the Code of Practice. One of the challenges IMMFA faces is a membership body with different objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> IMMFA is still a relatively young industry body and has had to navigate a very difficult time period, during which it has demonstrated well co-ordinated activity, involvement and consensus-building in a European environment, where pan-European regulation for money market funds has historically been quite limited.</p>
<p>With no equivalent for the SEC’s Rule 2a-7, providers in the international markets have had to implement self-regulation. In terms of achieving consistency, implementing self-regulation and managing communications during the credit crisis, IMMFA has been very successful.</p>
<p>None of the IMMFA funds broke the buck and all of them survived the worst crisis when a large number of banks, insurance companies, structured products and bond products didn’t fare particularly well. We’re now at a different, but just as challenging point. If regulators introduce the requirement to provide capital or change CNAV funds structurally, each IMMFA member will be impacted differently. It is therefore very difficult to balance members’ individual needs.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> What role do you see IMMFA playing going forward? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> They just made more modifications to the IMMFA Code of Practice, so there is now broad consistency with US 2a-7 funds. The questions that IMMFA is focusing on now are on the options that are being considered by the central banks and regulators and how best to respond, working with the other member states and securities bodies, to come up with a best fit, which is not easy.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> Yes. Their role has been evolving and it continues to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> As members, there’s a responsibility on us to help IMMFA come up with a common solution. Bespoke solutions cannot be created for individual members. We said earlier that clients are increasingly asking if we are members of IMMFA. There is therefore a driver behind providers coming to an agreed solution. If the option was that you go with the agreed solution or you leave IMMFA, it would be a very interesting situation.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> I don’t think that’s completely off the table. I think you may well see quite a change to the IMMFA membership in three years’ time.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> To a certain extent, the code of practice set out a minimum set of standards that we all adhere to, much like ratings agencies do. If investors simply relied on that, it wouldn’t be sufficient. With the emergence of a new regulator in Europe, IMMFA needs to evolve as an organisation and ensure that it is seen as the first port of call for regulators when they are reviewing and considering changes to money market funds. The historical purpose of the code of practice no longer stands. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> And certainly clients should never rely on that. It’s one of the many indicators to how a fund is being managed, but looking deeper into underlying processes is always the way to go. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Some members have expressed the desire to do nothing, make no changes and carry on educating the market. The likelihood of that succeeding with the momentum and scrutiny around this from a banking and regulatory perspective is nil. Doing nothing is not an option.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> IMMFA are doing a good job of attempting to educate the membership on current discussions with regulators. This includes letting members know that regulators don’t feel that retaining the status quo is really a viable option. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> What role are the rating agencies playing in all this? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> The ratings agencies continue to provide a level of oversight and surveillance of the products. Many corporate treasurers require at least two ratings on a fund; however, I don’t think many providers view the rating agencies as helping to manage the funds better. That’s absolutely driven by internal processes. And again, that’s where clients should be focusing and not just taking the ratings stamp as a confirmation that the fund is robust. There’s a role for ratings agencies to play but it’s not necessarily as broad as sometimes assumed.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Have the rating agencies changed at all?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> They’ve changed their guidelines for CNAV money market funds over the last couple of years. One or two agencies initially proposed completely different ratings criteria, which were not deemed appropriate by the industry, as they focused on parental sponsorship and availability of supporting capital. Fortunately the agencies took on board the feedback from the industry and investors and their frameworks now largely look and feel similar to IMMFA’s framework and some of the other regulatory frameworks such as The European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA). IMMFA did a very good job of making sure that the changes made were sensibly rolled out in a feasible timeframe without impacting underlying clients.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> They were talking at one stage about if there is an implicit support it ought to be explicit? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> The end result was a little more subjective. As well as applying a quantitative framework they will look at funds and ask, ‘Do you have the resources, the skills, the tools, the technology and the commitment to the business?’ It’s not something that can be exactly quantified, but they’ve been more explicit about its importance.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> They’re very much making that assessment themselves rather than asking for any confirmation from the fund provider or sponsor. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> Yes, they backed off some of the changes they were seeking to push through, which would have caused investment policy disruption. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Yes, well, it would have done the regulator’s job perhaps?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> Some of the changes would just have been difficult to execute operationally for those invested in the funds, for example changing the symbolism of the rating.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Because in their internal guidelines they don’t have those criteria. </p>

<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> There was a sense that the rating agencies were quite heavily criticised throughout the crisis and they obviously defended their position and decided they would make even stronger changes to the way that they rated the industry. Some of those were deemed impractical or not operationally sensible, particularly in the eyes of clients, and had to be modified.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> What additional impacts is regulation of the industry having?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> Regulation is also taking place which has implications for the short-term investment products that we buy into funds. These investments may also suffer from yield compression on the back of things like Basel III, which will put pressure on short-term yields across a variety of products. So the scenario isn’t just one of money market fund yields going down and yields on everything else staying the same.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> One of the consequences of banks being forced by Basel III and other regulation to seek longer term funding is that it’s getting harder and harder for money market investors to find high grade, quality, liquid instruments that are short-term and aligned with the investment guidelines for their funds. So if issuance and origination is forcing financial institutions to fund themselves through longer dated debt and yet ratings requirements, regulation and guidelines are mandating funds to invest in shorter-dated maturities, you’re creating quite a mismatch between demand and supply.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Once again, clients must look at their demand for liquidity and if they can accept situations whereby they have a proportion of their money in a daily liquidity fund and a proportion of their money that can go longer but still require a degree of liquidity, then the industry will be able to produce products that can take advantage of those high yields in longer terms but they can’t do it all in daily liquidity funds. There will be a return incentive to do this. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Yes, and perhaps a larger gap there which means that the corporates will have to start looking at it more seriously? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> They don’t have to, but obviously the return driver is there. They will have to give up a degree of liquidity and a constant NAV on that longer term cash holding but they can still have the diversification and the rating that the CNAV fund has.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Cash flow forecasting and analytics are critical here. It’s less about taking increased credit risk to drive return and more about investors correctly assessing and segmenting their cash flows and then taking appropriate amounts of duration risk for their cash ‘buckets’ through using different products. I’m sure you’ll see an evolution of products and the increased use of segregated accounts to achieve this.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> It’s very important to state that the return is not the same as we had in the enhanced money fund products of three or four years ago that were chasing credit. These will be funds that chase longer term durations and will be invested in the same entities/issuers as the CNAV daily liquidity fund but they will have longer maturities within them.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> And the yield curve is going to be sharper? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> That’s the logic. </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> There are noticeable step-out points when you go up the curve, for example, when you hit six months there’s a different profile, when you go beyond 397 days, which is the 13 month maximum maturity typically that money funds can invest in, suddenly there is a step-up in the return characteristics. How you achieve returns going forward may well be more about duration management rather than credit or structural management.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> Is there evidence of banks putting pressure on corporate investors to use their own money funds? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> We’re part of a large global banking organisation that seeks to deliver a global suite of products to its global clients. But sitting in an asset management business it’s really incumbent upon us, on the distribution side of our business, to make sure our investors are investing in the product because they understand the risk associated with it.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> What role are portals playing in the industry now and where are we going with them? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> The role of portals will continue and will be increasingly important as clients demand more transparency and want to aggregate and look across different vehicles, for example, direct investments, segregated accounts, money fund holdings, and so on. Transparency and risk analytics are going to be critical in the future. We have talked about a more expensive industry going forward. In this environment, it’s not realistic for portals that don’t have true underlying distribution capabilities and clients to charge a premium as though they’re a financial intermediary, when actually they’re really just providing settlement, enablement and operational ease of use.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> What continues to be an issue with some portals is transparency through to the clients themselves. Knowing our clients and having a relationship with them is essential in order for us to better understand how they’re going to use the funds.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> And understanding what they need from a liquidity perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> Portals which behave responsibly through client education and investor transparency have a role to play. Also, keep in mind that rating agencies are now challenging us on shareholder diversification whereby we have to be able to demonstrate a diverse base of clients. We have to know the underlying nature and characteristics of clients. There are some portals that have actually done an excellent job on transparency and they’re good partners to work with.</p>
<p>In the end, we can only manage the money effectively if we’ve got a very good vision of the underlying clients. Take that away, add volatility to it and promote switching between providers and it’s very difficult for a manager to look after their clients’ best interests.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (<abbr title=""Treasury Today"">TT</abbr>):</span> If you’ve got a corporate treasurer sitting in front of you and you just want to give them one word of advice on money funds right now what would it be? </p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Jim Fuell (J.P. Morgan Asset Management):</span> It’s the same as it always has been, ‘know your manager’. That applies to the funds, the credit risk management process that underlies everything they’ve done, historically and to date, and to the view they have around impending regulation and how it’s likely to impact their business model.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Mark Stockley (BlackRock):</span> To understand that there is change underway. As Jim said, work with providers that you know and make sure that you understand properly what their process is. In the same way that if you were to go and undertake a review of your banking provider or you were to make a direct investment, really look through and understand their processes. As BlackRock said in an article some time ago, ‘don’t just kick the tyres’. More so than ever, you really need to understand who you’re working with, what their commitment is in the space, their track record and the resources they apply.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Jennifer Hole (<abbr title=""State Street Global Advisors"">SSGA</abbr>):</span> I would echo Mark’s sentiments – there’s never a dull moment in the money fund industry at the moment. We’re hoping the industry becomes boring again!</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Andrew Tunks (<abbr title=""Scottish Widows Investment Partners"">SWIP</abbr>):</span> Know your liquidity is another key message. Understand exactly what it is you want your money to do and you’ll find that you’ll get a better risk return reward for that.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Is there really any substance to supply chain finance? Isn’t it just a fancy name for a set of straightforward products?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> That really depends on how you define supply chain finance (SCF). Over the last few years, the term SCF has been used by multiple parties, including banks and service providers and has essentially become an umbrella term that encompasses whatever they may be offering in the supply chain space. Many associate the term with a specific form of payables financing, that is also known as supplier financing, but in my view it’s much broader than that.</p>
<p>SCF not only includes payables but it also includes elements that are further upstream, such as pre-shipment finance; elements that are in the middle of the cash conversion cycle, around inventories for example; and then downstream into the sales and distribution channels. This wider definition opens up a myriad of potential financing structures that are relevant to supporting clients in getting their product to market.</p>
<p>In other words, the SCF ‘label’ is as narrow as the service provider may want it to be, and yet it is as broad as the needs of the corporate. So, depending on who’s providing that service or solution, it will take on a different connotation.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> I agree that in the past we often looked at supply chain finance as a specific product group. Increasingly, however, SCF is coming to encompass much more than receivables finance, payables finance, pre-export finance and so on – it is becoming a total package of working capital product offerings.</p>
<p>So really, the aim is to connect the elements together to help a client find a suitable, holistic solution. There is also room for further expansion around the whole SCF angle, to include FX services, for instance. I think that is the model that many of us are at least trying to move towards.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> Eric has a very valid point of view and I also think that the banks and financial institutions are increasingly striving to deliver end-to-end supply chain solutions to clients. Yes, SCF comes in various guises and different ‘wrappers’ if you like, as each institution delivers solutions in a slightly different way. Nevertheless, ‘utopia’ for everyone involved is to be able to deliver end-to-end supply chain solutions to our clients, and for me, that’s what SCF should be.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> Equally, corporates aren’t just looking for the standard payables/receivables solutions anymore, they want SCF to be innovative and that is largely a reflection of the external environment. We are definitely seeing renewed interest in SCF from the corporates: in 2007 and 2008 there was a lot of interest because they had disruptions to both their physical and financial supply chains. In 2010, the noise around SCF somewhat subsided as the global economic situation began to stabilise. This year, we’ve had the Arab Spring, the awful natural disaster in Japan, sovereign concerns in the EU, not to mention rising commodity prices, and as such, we’re seeing renewed interest from the large corporates. They want to ensure that at both ends of their supply chain there is plenty of liquidity and availability of credit.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that going forward, corporates are going to call on us for creative solutions. Whether it is based around traditional payables financing, or receivables financing, the key word is ‘innovation’. It’s a question of helping clients – both buyers and suppliers – to have mobile and yet safe supply chains.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> Looking at this at the broadest level, supply chains continue to become more global and complex, not least because of macro and micro-economic factors, regulatory challenges and political issues. Over the last three to four years, we have seen more disruption in supply chains than we had witnessed for a considerable time.</p>
<p>It is understandable and indeed sensible that corporates are refocusing on, not just the security of those supply chains, but ensuring that their suppliers and their customers are financed appropriately. In turn, this means that the business continues to move forward and operate efficiently.</p>
<p>Given the underlying complexity in today’s global supply chains, it is inevitable that the financial aspect of the supply chain has to reposition and adapt in terms of product development to support that dynamic.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> To Nick’s point, what the shifting dynamic calls for here are event-driven decisions by corporates to, for example, move supply sources to locations closer to itself, or to potentially have contingency planning in place for their supplier base that allows the corporate to hedge the supply of goods. These types of situations almost beg the question as to whether the banks should be looking at SCF as a set of products that are delivered in a cookie cutter model or really as an ad hoc solution that is tailor-made for corporate clients’ evolving situations and needs given the complex global environment in which they operate.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n6"">
<p><span>John McQuaid (BNP Paribas) was unable to get to the Forum, however he has subsequently added his comments:</span> SCF is a banking business in its own right and has developed significantly over the last decade especially since the financial crisis of 2008. Clearly SCF utilises traditional banking techniques but these are applied in a new and more effective manner enabling banks to intermediate throughout the entire supply chain process. Banks have different definitions of what SCF means, ranging from simple receivables factoring to the entire product suite which is aimed at optimising working capital within the supply chain. As mentioned by Roque, SCF does not just mean payable financing and corporates are looking to the banks to provide tailor made rather than cookie cutter solutions that address their working capital requirements. Our clients’ supply chains are highly complex and fluid and the bank’s product offering has to be flexible and robust enough to cope with the evolution of the clients’ requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> We touched on the fact that corporates are facing more risk in their supply chains today, but which of these risks do you consider top priority and what should corporates be doing to manage emerging risks?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> The natural disaster in Japan for example, demonstrated the weakness of certain supply chains – in particular those relying on a sole supplier for key components. Since then, several corporates have revisited their supply chain structures and are instigating multiple production sites for very critical components.</p>
<p>The main area that corporates are coming to us for advice on is how to analyse the impact of such an event. We therefore take a consultative approach to our clients’ overall supply chain, providing the most appropriate solutions to meet their specific needs.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> Would you say then that corporates have historically acknowledged risk but have done very little to actually address that risk? We talked earlier about the liquidity risk that corporates run with their supply chains, but it wasn’t until the liquidity crisis hit that they realised it was actually a risk. And Keith, you mentioned supplier risk in terms of Japan. Of course corporates now acknowledge that risk, but, in some cases there was little done prior to that point to mitigate that.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> When a crisis hits, it’s a top priority for a year or two and then if there isn’t another episode, it is easily forgotten. There is an opportunity for banks and corporates to work together to better assess and effectively manage these risks on a proactive basis.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> In that case, since corporates have historically done little to address their supply chain risks, it should be the banks’ role to pre-empt that behaviour and offer advice on how certain situations may impact the corporate and their supply chain.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> Around that angle, a number of our corporate clients are moving into new markets where they have little or no experience in, or in fact may just be exporting into or importing from a market without having a real presence there. One of the things that we’re certainly trying to help with is ensuring an open dialogue with our clients specifically around market dynamics. We have people domiciled in a number of these markets, who experience on a day-to-day basis what the best practices are and what the risks specific to that market are likely to be. It’s a question of arming the client with knowledge and tactics for that particular market.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> Personally, I think that, after recent events, corporates realise all too well what the risk of a disruption in supply is, and what the financial impact of that could be. Also if you look back five or ten years ago, the retail and auto industries were always squeezing their suppliers very hard – they have definitely learned that pushing suppliers too far is not the most efficient thing to do for their own business.</p>
<p>Equally, I think any prudent treasurer, and any prudent CFO should have supply chain finance on their agenda to be considered at this stage, and at least explore the alternatives, the complexities and the associated costs. As we said earlier, these are straightforward products, but together they provide a holistic solution. Let’s help our treasurers to have much more predictable cash flows, predictable suppliers and better performing, more consistent businesses.</p>

<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> We also have to recognise that the way the world works has changed in many ways. We’ve touched on the macro picture, but trading patterns have also changed significantly. There are different risks associated with trading on open account versus trading on traditional terms such as letters of credit, but banks are in the business of providing many services, some of which are risk-related. As such, it shouldn’t be a surprise to us that corporates are looking to banks to provide risk-related solutions for their open account trading activities in much the same way as they were looking to us to provide risk mitigation services for their documentary trade activities.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n6"">
<p><span>John McQuaid (BNP Paribas):</span> The global nature of the supply chain brings several risks that corporates must manage. These range from the physical, ie the distance that inventory must travel and the subsequent risk of disruption due to natural disasters or blockages in transit, to financial risk on both their suppliers and buyers. Diversifying suppliers and their location can help reduce the risk of physical disruptions but will not eliminate it. This results in the requirement to build up inventory which in itself ties up working capital. The ability of suppliers and buyers to fund themselves poses a significant risk which, given the current financial crisis, is putting increasing pressure on the supply chain. This pressure arises both from the retrenchment by local and international lenders and due to regulatory action. Managing buyer credit risk and the commercial pressure to provide extended payment terms remains a risk that must be managed either via banks or the insurance market. The global banking crisis is far from over and the impact is becoming evident throughout the supply chain.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> How has the role of the treasurer developed to encompass the growing number of risks and the more strategic elements of SCF that we have already highlighted? Also, where does the treasurer’s skill set need to develop next?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> The treasurer is now being seen as the company expert around risk. This means taking on not just financial or counterparty risk, but now supplier-related risk. The challenge is how treasurers can bring their existing skill sets to the fore in analysing the financial and counterparty risks into the company’s supplier base.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> We hear a lot about the treasurer being increasingly ‘in the spotlight’, but it’s true that the role of the treasurer has actually changed. The role of the treasurer used to be more limited to managing cash flows, managing bank relationships, and of course managing interest rate risk and so on. As Nick said, they’re now looking at supplier risk. And not only that, they’ve also been tasked with being the working capital management champions within an organisation. Some of the roles that were more traditionally within the CFO’s side of the corporation, have now shifted to the treasury function. So treasurers are finding themselves having to pick up a whole new set of skills, which might be part of the reason why they are looking to banks more and more to support them in an advisory fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> Looking ahead, I think the next area of skills for the corporate treasurer will be Basel III, among other regulations, and looking at how it will affect them and their suppliers. Inevitably, Basel III will impact banks’ capacity to support our corporate customers and their suppliers, as well as making our services more expensive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are local initiatives, in the UK for example, and the government wants the banks to actually finance more MMEs and SMEs in the country, and is pushing us to extend the balance sheet. So with these two forces at work in a contradictory fashion, we somehow need to get them together to make sure that we all agree on which course to go.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n6"">
<p><span>John McQuaid (BNP Paribas):</span> Working capital management is now firmly within the remit of treasurers and therefore SCF has become one of the key aspects of the treasurer’s responsibility. Whilst traditional treasury functions such as FX and interest rate management have been almost entirely within the control of treasurers, managing SCF and working capital management requires the treasurer to work in tandem with a number of other functions within their companies, eg accounting, purchasing, production, sales and IT. Unless the treasurer develops the skills to manage the expectations and requirements of this diversified group, then optimising working capital with the supply chain will be very difficult. The treasurer also needs to ensure that his company understands the implications of Basel III in respect of both the availability of funding and pricing and the realities of the current banking crisis.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Will prices really go up? Because as a corporate, I often hear the banks saying ‘oh, we’re going to have to charge more, the days of cheap credit are over’, but then nothing really changes.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> Firstly, Basel III is not final yet, but the indication is that for the large global banks which support a lot of the cross-border trade, the capital requirements are going to increase. With increased capital requirements on a given asset, to get the same return, banks will be required to increase their pricing. For traditional trade related to letters of credit, LC confirmations and things of that nature, the capital requirements are going to increase under current Basel III proposal.</p>
<p>Banks will of course continue to provide this important service to clients: it will just be at a higher cost. If we have to pass on these higher costs, that’s going to hit the corporates, and it’s another cost they will have to pass on either to their supplier base or to their buyers.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> We won’t be able to give a definitive answer on costs until the final decision is made. Everybody has an interpretation at this moment in time of what they think may happen. But for the time being there’s no certainty and the lobbying of the regulators continues.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> A number of surveys and reviews have been conducted around this and I’ve heard the cost of capital in the trade business is likely to increase by somewhere between 15% and 35%. Conversely, the negative impact on global GDP could be in the one to two or even 3% range. If that is correct, those are significant numbers.</p>
<p>To that end, the trade banks are working together with the regulators to try and determine whether trade assets should be risk-weighted at the same rate as other financial assets. I think the underlying feeling is that because of the low levels of default and the different nature of trade finance it perhaps shouldn’t be weighted at the same ratio. That is clearly an on-going discussion and we hope it results in a favourable outcome for the trade business.</p>

<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> There is an opportunity for corporates to influence the outcome of this situation. The regulators are hearing a lot from the banks on Basel III but I propose that corporates could be playing a more active role in voicing their concerns. ‘What’s the potential effect if you actually go and implement these proposals? So if they do require a higher capital for what I think both corporates and banks consider low-risk trade, what’s the effect on that?’ If implemented as it stands, Basel III is definitely something that will affect corporates and I would recommend corporates continue to learn about this proposed regulation and become more involved in the discussion. This will ensure that Basel III decision makers understand how their decision will impact businesses and thus are better equipped to make important decisions in the coming months.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> I agree with you Keith, because at the moment the lobbying is coming from banks and bankrelated institutions, but I see very little lobbying from corporate institutions around the impact it will have on them. There needs to be more push from the corporates to understand what the real consequences might be.</p>
<p>This theme really goes back to the point we made earlier: it’s the corporate acting after the event. So corporates should now be engaging with their bank – and vice versa – to actually understand what the effects of this will be.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> Yes, we’re going out and talking to corporates about the proposals and explaining which products it would affect, how much more capital we would have to allocate, and how much higher the cost could be. Basel III leaves corporates with limited options – they are faced with either changing the way they do business (letters of credit or open account for instance) or managing added cost in the system.</p>

<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> But of course Basel III wouldn’t naturally apply itself in a linear fashion across all companies. The biggest companies will probably have more pricing leverage with their banks anyway and will get better deals, whereas the smaller middle market companies will have less leverage.</p>
<p>I think some of these larger corporations therefore need to start looking into their supply chain and thinking about their suppliers and resultant impact. They can probably absorb some of this cost whereas at the middle market end of the supply chain, there may be more impact and that ultimately could affect the whole supply chain.</p></div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> Absolutely. Corporates need to look both upstream and downstream. Upstream into their supply chain and downstream into their distribution chain. It is indeed the smaller companies which are likely to get penalised because the ratings assigned to them by banks tend to reflect higher risk. It’s also important to highlight that suppliers and distributors located in emerging markets may not be viewed very favourably under the proposed regulations. In my view it’s a two-way street, and we need to be doing more to educate our clients, but equally the banking industry could do with a little more input from the corporate side.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n6"">
<p><span>John McQuaid (BNP Paribas):</span> We need to look not just at Basel III but also at liquidity costs generally and the impact of local regulators. If the Basel III regulations remain as currently proposed there will be a negative impact on pricing. Clearly given the risk weighted approach of Basel III the pricing impact will not be linear but overall pricing will increase. Apart from Basel III we need to consider the liquidity crisis that we are currently experiencing. In several regions banks are trying to strengthen their balance sheets by reducing lending. This is impacting weaker credits much more than highly rated companies. We are also seeing several regulators, eg the Chinese, dampening down lending both by local and foreign banks. This is pushing pricing up. As all these factors are occurring together I believe that pricing will increase.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Is there anything banks can do to help their corporate customers to cut costs in other areas of their financial supply chain – through technology for example?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> All of us are being pushed to become more and more efficient and effective for our corporate customers, and to a certain extent the increased regulatory cost will push us harder. One way of doing that is to work more with them on a straight through processing to increase their efficiencies and hopefully reduce costs. The other angle here is around giving the customer choice, so rather than taking a solely proprietary approach, banks need to work with bankagnostic platforms as well.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> At the moment, many of the platforms that provide SCF solutions are quite simplistic. I agree therefore that the banks will have to go further down the STP route because most of the platforms at the moment are driven from an invoice perspective. There is certainly room to look at the purchase order side of things, for example.</p>
<p>To Eric’s final point, I think the clients will definitely drive whether they want a single platform or whether they’re prepared to accept multiple platforms from different banks. It is our job to listen.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> My sense is that corporates would obviously prefer the path of least resistance: that may or may not be a single platform. In fact, it might actually be a standardised set of data requirements, much like you have within the banking system, in SWIFT for example. In the mid- to long-term, things might move in that direction with regard to the technology.</p>
<p>I also believe there will be an interim step, and we will potentially see some level of consolidation. You’ll have the very large banks who have the capacity and have already invested significant amounts of capital in developing their proprietary platforms. Then you’ll have the banks like Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who have the flexibility to work with their own platform, as well as third party platforms. Finally, you’ll have banks that are smaller, or have other needs for their investment dollars, and choose to outsource their platform needs.</p>
<p>But by and large from a corporate perspective, my sense is that if they’re a customer with global operations, they will want to do things in fairly much the same way in Europe as they will in Asia and in the US, and I think that will continue to push the industry towards some level of standardisation on the technology side.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> We are seeing more large corporates review the supply chain technology with a renewed risk perspective, whether it be provided by banks or non-banks. Historically this review was probably in its infancy, but with the further development of supply chain solutions, corporates are using a growing number of different platforms from different providers. So even if a corporate standardises all of its feed processing, they are reviewing what risk they are taking with multiple platforms.</p>
<p>It’s probably still too early to say what the outcome of this review will be, but I think corporates are going to start saying: ‘Am I taking on additional risk by using multiple outside platforms rather than using one from someone I know and have a long-term relationship with?’</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I agree with Roque that corporates want the platform feeds to be the same. In the long-term, we will see a consolidation of platform providers and thus standardising of feeds. As an industry, it’s not efficient for every bank to have its own platform. From a risk perspective, can the industry and our corporate customers continue using third parties whose balance sheets may not be as strong? This is an important point to consider when technology needs continue to require increased investment.</p>

</figure>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> Also, I think that corporates need to very carefully distinguish between technology and the risk element, as well as which banks are participating to provide the funding. For example, one can still have a bank-agnostic technology and yet have only one bank funding it. So I would very much recommend to treasurers, that whether you pursue a bank-agnostic platform or a bank proprietary platform, make sure you understand and you’re comfortable with who is actually funding it behind the scenes.</p>
<p>From a corporate treasury viewpoint it would be great if banks, corporations and governments would come to work together on structures where the governments’ suppliers could be more easily financed by us, as financing SME and MMEs is exactly what UK government wants us to do in the UK. So I see there is a responsibility for the three of us – corporates, banks and governments – to work together on grander solutions that help support the economy at this stage, and that are also technology-based.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> I think you’re right, after all, we’ve looked from the finance industry a number of times to the public sector to help drive change. On the cash side, if you take SEPA for example, it took a long time for the SEPA payment environment to start generating transactional activity and the early expectation was that the public sector would support and help drive change. Unfortunately, it turned out that they were in some ways more averse to change than the corporate world was.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> Funnily enough, governments in emerging markets are often very proactive and some have actually created portals where investors can step in and actually provide liquidity to the SMEs and MMEs.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> A few have gone beyond providing portals and actually endorsed private sector programmes and provided the backing of the state to those programmes with the aim of supporting SMEs and MMEs. This has been achieved with great simplicity and without the need of overly-complicated, quasi-capital markets structures that we’ve seen in some programmes in developed markets.</p>
<p>So there’s certainly something to be said on that front, not just in terms of making the access for the suppliers easier, but we’ve also seen governments, ECAs and other multi-lateral institutions very engaged in trying to support trade as a way to revitalise economic activity.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n6"">
<p><span>John McQuaid (BNP Paribas):</span> Improved technology, per se, is a means to providing our clients with a better service and enabling the banks to monitor the underlying risks. However, improved technology does not reduce the cost of risk but rather allows banks and corporates to monitor and share risk information.</p>
<p>A separate question is whether corporates wish to see individual banks developing their own platforms or whether the ‘bank agnostic’ provider is the preferred route. We all saw some financial institutions withdraw from funding supplier financing and receivables programmes during the 2008 crisis, quite often with undue haste. Some argue that if there was a bank agnostic platform the other participating banks would have remained and replacement banks found for the withdrawing banks. This analysis is somewhat simplistic. Corporates need to choose their banks and the respective platforms carefully. Replacing a bank funder may well be easier than replacing a platform, especially in the short term. Finally, banks must improve their ability/willingness to provide multi banking platforms both for trade payables and receivables programmes.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> What about card technologies – do these have a place as SCF tools for corporates are they firmly in the cash space still?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> We’re starting to see more procurement spend from corporates being settled with cards, as opposed to documentary trade settlements, or standard payment settlements. We are also seeing procurement-led value gain across card programmes now. It’s hard to tell whether there’s necessarily a linkage with the supply chain finance angle though. I think some corporates are starting to look at that in terms of potentially releasing some working capital from the business.</p>
<p>For example, if a corporate can settle some of their procured goods on a card it tends to give them more liquidity as well as a settlement period, which means that they end up paying later than they would do through other settlement techniques.</p>
<p>That’s really the angle that comes up when we’re engaging with the procurement side of the large corporates, but they also want to help provide security and mitigate some of the risk of fraud in the way they settle with suppliers, whilst also helping the company’s working capital cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> I think you’re right. Cards are very much at the lower value end of the market. In reality, cards are never going to be the sole option, but card programmes will certainly be relevant, and I think as we go forward cards will become more and more popular, certainly for the lower value transactions that corporates undertake as part of the supply chain process.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> There are very different strata on the procurement side – some will fit the supplier finance solution set, others might fit an e-invoicing type solutions set, and yet another might be more suited to the card space. There may also be some overlap between solutions, but in general, cards are more within the procurement realm than treasury as such.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n6"">
<p><span>John McQuaid (BNP Paribas):</span> Card technology is much more a procurement tool rather than an SCF one. It would be possible to integrate the suppliers who accept card payment into a trade payable programme but I would imagine that the volumes concerned would be low.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n0"">
<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Looking forward, what are the major trends that you are seeing in the financial supply chain space? And what advice would you offer to corporates based on those trends?</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> In terms of advice, one suggestion would be to quantify the added value that you can provide to your company. Investigate what the real benefits of supply chain finance might be for your organisation – information around this is not frequently provided by banks. On that note, I think treasurers should be more demanding and get their banks to actually calculate the benefits.</p>
<p>We can calculate the benefit fairly precisely in terms of freed up working capital. These are, in my view, very conscious decisions that treasurers should take. It’s important to get the procurement people involved as well to make sure that everyone is well informed about the numbers – after all, at the end of the day this is a numbers game.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> Yes, picking up again on some of the earlier themes we discussed, I think that corporate treasurers need to be more demanding of their banks in terms of advice and information. Of course the banks have a responsibility to keep their clients informed, but it is also the treasurer’s responsibility to enquire as to how external threats – like Basel III – will impact them. And I think if they can do that, identify the risks that they are taking, and also ask the bank to help them better understand those risks, there will be a benefit to the business both in terms of risk mitigation and also in terms of their working capital optimisation.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> Just to come back to where we started our discussion, there’s certainly a very strong need for internal alignment – in particular on the payables side – between various parts of the organisation to make these SCF programmes successful. And so my advice would be to treasurers that are engaged in looking at these solutions to make sure that their working capital needs align internally before embarking on these ventures. This is because the success rate is largely dependent on multiple parties within the organisation in addition to procurement technology, accounting and so on and it is very important to ensure buy-in at an early stage.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> In addition, on the SCF angle, there are different drivers for why a company may implement a supply chain programme, and based on that you probably need different sponsors in your business to support you in that effort – whether you’re looking to the security of your suppliers, whether you’re looking to improve your working capital position or whether you’re looking for some leverage in terms of pricing of contracts.</p>
<p>There are a number of different reasons a company may establish a supply chain finance programme and each programme will involve slightly different people in the company whose collaboration and support is vital for the programme to run efficiently and effectively. So, as well as quantifying the value, it is important for treasurers to ask what the driving principles are and why the company is entering that programme. As Roque alluded to, it’s also key to ensure that you’re aligned with your internal partners in procurement and finance, and to certainly think about how those partners will beimpacted (positively and negatively) by an SCF programme.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n4"">
<p><span>Keith Karako (Citi):</span> I agree with what has been said around quantifying the benefits, but at the same time it’s actually rather difficult to do so because many of them are intangible. For instance, it’s easy for the banks to claim that if you extend your trade terms by 20 days, your savings will be x amount.</p>
<p>But what we’re finding is that, whether it’s the payables or receivables side, or letters of credit, customers are keen to understand the intangible benefits from the customer relationship point of view. I would say that at least half of the benefits of SCF are intangible and cannot be put down on paper, certainly not at day one.</p>
<p>The other angle customers really want to work on is reducing risk with regard to adequate financing of suppliers.We talked about risk management early on in this discussion and supply chain finance has a lot to do with risk management. How much risk does the corporate want to take? How much does it want to distribute through supply chain solutions, so that it can start to mitigate some of these risks? Of course the bank may 	not be able to eliminate these risks altogether, but if you can help your suppliers, your customers, through the volatility that we talked about, it’s going to position the corporate more favourably versus the competition.</p>
<p>Is that going to show up in lower costs of goods sold initially? Or more sales? It’s very difficult to say, but I think in these volatile times – in my view, the next few years are going to be more volatile than five years ago – how much risk are you willing to accept and how much risk are you going to ask your banks to help you to mitigate?</p>
<p>Having an SCF programme in place is also about options – it’s about being able to go out and offer your customers, or your suppliers, solutions, even if they don’t elect to utilise the option. Simply having such a facility available to offer to them during these difficult times will add value. The role of the bank is to help identify what is the most competitive way to deliver these solutions to benefit both the corporate and their suppliers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in terms of trends, the banks are also seeing SCF as an increasingly important function and I think that trend is going to continue. Each bank’s SCF department, play a much more important role in our banks than they did five years ago. And I think if Basel III gets implemented as proposed, we’re going to play a more important role five years from now than we play today.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n3"">
<p><span>Roque Damacela (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> I would add that the profile of the trade organisation is also different, because a different set of skills is required to structure some of these solutions, particularly as you begin to move away from the procurement side of the trade flows.</p>
<p>What we’ve really seen over the last few years is a convergence of trade with commercial finance-type structuring capabilities, much more focused around receivables finance as opposed to documentary credits. They’re very different skill sets and so the investment is not just a raw number of people, it’s also an investment in a totally different type of expertise in the organisation.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>Nick Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> As global trade continues to grow and I think it will, as one of the accepted ways of bringing growth back into individual GDPs and world GDP, the need to finance that is only going to continue to increase, and we as banks have to find ways to do that. To the point earlier around regulation, we are unlikely to be able to take all of this on our balance sheets, so we’re going to have to think of innovative ways to bring in third parties in an easy manner to help support that growth. At the moment it can be challenging to obtain that third party financing, whether that’s government-backed or otherwise, into these structures.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n5"">
<p><span>Eric Lemmens (RBS):</span> One more piece of very tangible advice I would like to give to treasurers is that SCF programmes are only ever successful if the suppliers actually co-operate and participate in them. If I were a treasurer looking to set up an SCF programme, I would make very sure that the bank I sign up with has the capacity to do the on-boarding in a very swift way: on-boarding is a crucial service we provide to our customers, and treasurers should be looking out for the on-boarding capacity of the bank they decide to do the business with.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays):</span> Finally, I think it’s really important that treasurers own the whole SCF programme – they actually have to acknowledge that they must drive it through the company, push the SCF programme through their procurement areas and push it through their suppliers, to make sure it happens. If they don’t it’s unlikely to happen, and actually for the business, it will not achieve maximum benefit.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n6"">
<p><span>John McQuaid (BNP Paribas):</span> SCF will extend to all aspects of the supply chain. SCF is not limited to payables programmes. Treasurers are now responsible for managing risk throughout the supply chain. This will include, inter alia, (i) liquidity for their suppliers, buyers, and themselves, (ii) impact of Basel III on pricing and availability, and (iii) risk management on their buyers. There has been a lot of focus on supplier financing but it needs to be recognised that extended terms of payment is now seen as a key marketing differentiator and the treasurer will need to manage liquidity and risk appetite on his customers. The use of insurance as a risk mitigant will increase. It should be noted that the insurance market has developed significantly and is prepared to look at sophisticated trade transactions.</p>
<p>In terms of advice it is clear that treasurers must understand the importance of managing working capital within the supply chain and, as importantly, ensure that they have the unequivocal buy-in of the other key internal players in their company, if they are to succeed. I agree that treasurers must challenge their banks and be fully aware of all of the options that are available. Finally, make sure that you choose your core banks carefully!</p>

<p>Matthew Tatnell joined the investment industry in 1983 and Aviva Investors in January 1983. He is responsible for all of Aviva Investors’ money market activities and the Aviva commercial paper programme.</p>
</div>
<p>This month we talk to Colin Cookson, Managing Director, Global Liquidity, and Matthew Tatnell, Deputy Head of Liquidity Funds at Aviva Investors to explore why corporate treasurers should look beyond yield and fees when selecting and investing in money market funds.</p>
<h5 id=""in-your-view-how-should-corporate-treasurers-evaluate-money-market-funds"">In your view how should corporate treasurers evaluate money market funds?</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>CC</span> – Historically many people viewed money market funds as a commodity product. To a large extent their investment decision was often driven by the name of the provider, the rating of the fund, the fee structure and the historic yields. However all funds are not the same and in these turbulent economic times an investor should be doing a lot more research into the underlying core competencies of any fund before making an investment. It’s about ‘what is the added value of a particular fund provider not which gives the best yield?’</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – Whether an investor should be a credit expert or not is a moot point. Typically a corporate treasurer is not going to be a credit expert and will not employ a team of credit analysts. So to analyse the credit worthiness of the underlying investments held within a money market fund in great detail is probably going to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>beyond their traditional areas of expertise,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stretch existing heavy workloads to almost impossible levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s therefore important that the corporate treasurer focuses on what they aim to achieve when investing in a money market fund. First and foremost, as Colin alluded to, it’s the outsourcing of the credit process. In terms of due diligence, I believe it is therefore critical that a corporate treasurer should look at the infrastructure of the provider/sponsor who they’re placing their money with. You could argue that the vast majority of the management fee is paying for the detailed credit analysis supplied and the corporate treasurer must be confident that they are receiving value for money.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""do-you-think-that-many-corporate-treasurers-are-carrying-out-due-diligence-on-the-credit-analysis-process-before-investing-in-money-market-funds"">Do you think that many corporate treasurers are carrying out due diligence on the credit analysis process before investing in money market funds?</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>CC</span> – Yes, the more sophisticated investors are. There are still some investors who simply invest because it’s a ‘bank-owned fund’ and they naïvely rely on the ‘hoped for’ support of the sponsoring bank. Whether this support would actually materialise if there was another systemic crisis in the economy is debatable.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""how-should-a-corporate-treasurer-evaluate-a-credit-team-and-their-skills"">How should a corporate treasurer evaluate a credit team and their skills?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – First and foremost investors must look at their sponsor and ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do they have expertise in this area?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the sponsor have a large credit team?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they manage long-term and short-term credit assets elsewhere?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they own their own credit assets?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got an organisation with a large portfolio of its own investments then they’ve clearly got a big vested interest in getting the credit process right. If they’ve been analysing and investing in credit for some time and they’re still here after arguably the worst financial disaster of all time, it’s a good indication that they’re committed for the long term.</p>
<p>Then you must ask how they actually perform these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the credit process, how is it managed, who’s running it, who’s responsible for what, etc?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long has the team been together?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the credit team look like?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they have an asset backed specialist?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is key because asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) is a transparent diversifier of credit risk and it’s therefore advantageous if your provider has expertise in this area. If they have rating agency experience, this is an added benefit (they may have even rated the ABCP programme)! Get into the nitty-gritty and satisfy yourself that, logically, it makes sense. Ask for concrete examples of programmes that they’ve reviewed and what they think the positives and negatives of those programmes are. Check all the usual things that you would normally cover when performing any investment due diligence. I firmly believe it’s key that investors meet the sponsor and do their homework before they invest. Once you’re comfortable with their credit processes, you should then be able to explain it to your board, or the CEO, and they should be suitably impressed.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""what-should-a-corporate-treasurer-be-looking-out-for"">When it comes to how the credit team should be structured, what should a corporate treasurer be looking out for?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – There are two key points. Firstly, where is the credit team located? Ideally the core of the team should be in the same time zone as the fund managers to facilitate live dialogue to allow any arising issues to be resolved quickly. Second it is important to have representation from credit analysts in different locations in the major countries you’re investing in. Local knowledge makes it much easier to meet senior management in the local area, enabling more informed decisions. Ideally, the sponsor should therefore be a global player otherwise you simply don’t get that level of expertise.</p>
<p>On the subject of the scale of the business, big is not always best but it can give you an open door into the senior management of the counterparties you are investing in. Certainly at Aviva Investors we will have met senior board members of most of the counterparties we invest in as part of our credit process, regardless of whether we are buying money market instrument, bonds, property or equities.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""it-could-therefore-be-advantageous-to-invest-through-an-organisation-that-is-also-buying-the-equity-of-companies-because-it-maximises-their-leverage-in-terms-of-access"">It’s an interesting point. It could therefore be advantageous to invest through an organisation that is also buying the equity of companies because it maximises their leverage in terms of access?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – Yes. The greater the spread of your activities, the greater the depth of research you will have, the more advantage you will gain.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""how-are-the-teams-structured-in-aviva-investors"">How are the teams structured in Aviva Investors?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – The liquidity portfolio managers sit within the fixed income area in London which is a team of around 60 people, with the liquidity team comprising five portfolio managers. Cash assets under management are just under £18.6 billion<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. Within the London fixed income team we have four credit analysts who specialise in the financial institutional credit names that we typically hold in money market funds. In addition we have two analysts in the US, two in Paris and one in Singapore performing a similar role. In the UK, the asset-backed specialist previously worked at a rating agency. In addition to fundamental research, the portfolio managers also use quantitative (quant) research which has flagged up many issues, such as Ireland. As a result we were out of Irish stocks from a very early stage compared with many other funds.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""has-it-pulled-you-out-of-investing-in-all-the-pigs-economies"">Has it pulled you out of investing in all the PIGS economies?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – Spain is the exception where we do have some short dated exposures. Although we have a positive view on the two main Spanish senior bank credits we take a fairly conservative approach when it comes to all areas of peripheral Europe where we are sceptical about sovereign debt sustainability.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""is-there-anything-else-about-your-credit-process-that-differentiates-aviva-investors"">Is there anything else about your credit process that differentiates Aviva Investors?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – For us, the fundamental credit research process is key. We overlay our quant model and include factors such as live credit ratings data (which can affect price and liquidity) and finally the in-house credit process is then stress tested using a combination of third party research and fund manager flair!</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""how-does-the-portfolio-review-process-work-and-what-is-the-frequency"">How does the portfolio review process work and what is the frequency?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – It’s a live, ongoing process. A typical day for the portfolio management team would start with an early review of the quant model output, which has built in trigger levels highlighting issues that need to be investigated immediately with our global credit team. They will also be scanning news flows from financial news suppliers such as Bloomberg, Reuters, etc, reading daily third party research and scanning a wide selection of financial journals. Formally there is a daily credit meeting, in addition to a monthly sector meeting with a credit analyst. The Aviva Investors credit committee, chaired by our CFO meets monthly to oversee all new and existing money market investments providing a final layer of due diligence. With five managers dedicated to cash alone and a large team of credit analysts around the globe, we firmly believe we have a great infrastructure in place to provide our clients with the highest levels of expertise.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""how-do-you-manage-liquidity"">In the credit crisis some money market funds had liquidity problems and were forced to withdraw same day access. How do you manage liquidity?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – After credit risk, liquidity risk is our second priority before yield because we find investors sensibly want to know firstly, ‘am I going to get my money back?’ and secondly, ‘am I going to get it back now?’ and finally, ‘am I getting a competitive return?’ In contrast to many other funds we run a large amount of liquidity. In the UK sterling fund this is largely in overnight reverse repo transactions where we lend to a bank taking UK Government Gilts as collateral and on top of that receive a ‘haircut’ which allows for any price moves we incur in the unlikely event that we have to liquidate the collateral. To manage this repo process we have our own securities finance team whose expertise would be key to ensuring quick collateral sales at attractive prices in the unlikely event of a bank default. Our second area of liquidity is certificates of deposit, an area which has been consistently strong, even after the Lehman default. These two areas of liquidity mean that over three quarters of our portfolio can be converted into cash for same day value. Finally, we have investments such as asset backed commercial paper, which although slightly less liquid are used to diversify credit exposure.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>CC</span> – Post credit crisis we took the view that money market funds should go back to basics. So we are now focused on having significant liquidity and also, eliminating inappropriate asset classes, such as floating rate notes (FRNs), which do not offer the required liquidity and could return less than par (an issue highlighted with Lehman). Money market funds are not guaranteed, which is why we advise investors to lift the lid off funds and take a look at what’s underneath rather than simply looking at yield.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""what-is-your-response"">Following the credit crisis, many corporate treasurers are seeking higher levels of transparency. What is your response?</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>CC</span> – Post credit crunch we wanted our funds to be the most transparent in the market. We believe we were the first fund provider to provide all clients with weekly reports detailing the fund portfolios. This includes information such as the investments in the portfolio, the percentage of the fund that each comprises, their rating, liquidity profile etc. We were also the first to publish Weighted Average Life of the fund daily. More importantly, although the aim of our main liquidity funds is to maintain a constant value of 1.000 we took the decision to move to Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) pricing, calculating and communicating to clients a daily mark-to-market valuation. We believe this is a significant improvement in transparency over constant net asset value funds. In practice, due to the policies, procedures and credit analysis that Matthew’s team impose on the funds, our daily value has never moved from 1.000 in nearly three years. If the valuation was to move from 1.000 clients would be aware of it on the day it happened. For us, transparency is about giving clients as much information as possible and the adoption of VNAV Pricing is integral to this. In practice this means that our funds appeal to the more sophisticated investor. They understand our approach and rationale, whilst acknowledging that we are still targeting a stable price of 1.000.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""are-you-involved-with-immfa"">Are you involved with IMMFA?</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>CC</span> – Unfortunately not. IMMFA only represents those funds which use the constant net asset value approach. When the markets were in crisis three years ago we took this decision to publish daily mark-to-market valuations of the funds and moved to VNAV. Our aim was to provide clients with maximum transparency. As a result we were required to leave IMMFA. Should they decide to broaden their criteria and embrace alternative approaches we would happily become active members again.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""does-targeting-a-daily-mark-to-market-valuation-of-1000-whilst-being-technically-vnav-mean-you-have-to-manage-the-fund-more-conservatively-than-cnav-funds"">Does targeting a daily mark-to-market valuation of 1.000 whilst being technically VNAV mean you have to manage the fund more conservatively than CNAV funds?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>MT</span> – Yes, we actually have a lower level of mark-to-market tolerance than a CNAV fund as our 1.000 fund price is measured to three decimal places rather than two for a CNAV fund. We think this is a major positive for investors. As a result the main difference in our investment approach from many CNAV funds is that we don’t hold any FRNs. After Lehman, FRNs became very illiquid for quite a long while and prices, even in some very high credit quality issues, proved very volatile which would have been enough alone to challenge the price tolerance for many CNAV funds who could have been in danger of ‘breaking the buck’. We believe this event could be repeated so this sort of instrument is simply not appropriate for a fund aiming to maintain a stable asset value. We also restrict the amount that we invest in longer dated investments. For example, to remain within 60 days you could invest 90% in overnight deposits and 10% in one year certificates of deposit. A significant and unexpected change in interest rates could again cause the 10% invested in longer term investments to potentially ‘break the buck’ of the whole fund. We therefore restrict the amount invested in the longer term and stress test our portfolio, using a range of scenarios where, for example, interest rates move or credit spreads change unexpectedly in reaction to a major event. This helps to ensure that even in a stressed environment our 1.000 share price would survive.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>CC</span> – In practice, we’ve returned our main liquidity funds to the traditional money market fund model, focussing on security, liquidity and yield, in that order. There are constraints on our main liquidity funds that perhaps other funds don’t have. However, we have a range of funds and if a client is looking for additional yield we have other funds which may be appropriate. So it’s a much more sophisticated approach to investing into money market funds which is neither yield nor price driven. It’s about investors understanding our depth of expertise and where our fund managers add value, over and above yield and fees.</p>

Thierry holds a Master of Statistics from ENSAE (Paris) and a degree in Actuarial Studies from the Centre d’Etudes Actuarielles (Paris).</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""how-long-has-amundi-been-present-in-the-cash-management-market"">How long has Amundi been present in the cash management market?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>TD</span> – Amundi has been managing a full spectrum of short-term and medium-term products from AAA-rated liquidity funds to short-term fixed income or absolute return solutions for years. In France, the Amundi Group has a market share of around 33% of the market, with around €120 billion under management in this asset class.</p>
<p>Our management team follow a very safe investment process that has been in place for over 15 years, thus allowing them to achieve a good risk-return profile. This security-driven investment philosophy enabled us to come out of the financial crisis unscathed.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>FB</span> – Whilst we have been very present in our domestic market for sometime, we have not as yet built upon our shareholder’s footprint in the Europe corporate market. We are now extending the savoir-faire we have accumulated over the years in our domestic market to investors across Europe and beyond.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>TD</span> – Indeed, there is clearly an ambition to share the positive experience we have achieved in France, especially during the crisis, which our funds rode out with no damage of any kind. During 2008, we benefited from a probable ‘flight-to-quality’, as our money market fund assets grew by more than €19 billion. We enable our clients to benefit from the large amounts we manage and from the privileged access to the market that we are able to provide given these volumes. We are talking about an industry where size is very important. We provide clients with sizeable funds, and we manage money market funds that have significant assets under management.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""what-sets-amundis-liquidity-offer-apart"">What sets Amundi’s liquidity offer apart?</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>FB</span> – Our competitors are fairly big in this market, but we are confident that we are just as good in the way we manage money market funds and that we have a best-in-class approach. We aim to offer competitive fees, and good performance within a safe environment. We keep our funds liquid because it is important for clients that we are able to accept any kind of redemptions, even at very short notice. We are used to actively hedging a large part of our fixed rate investments, hence pushing down the weighted average maturity (WAM) of our portfolios. This is advantageous in the current interest rate environment because even though rates are low, we may expect some increases in EONIA in the coming months. We are well-positioned and are prepared to take advantage of this scenario, whereas some of our competitors may have to wait a little longer before they are able to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>TD</span> – We use front office tools that are directly linked to our risk management teams and to various pre-trade controls and risk monitoring processes. We have defined very strict risk limits. Not only do we monitor these limits on a ‘live’ basis using our tools but we also make overnight compliance checks on the funds. In addition, we benefit from pre-trade risk blocking if a trade is not compliant with the limits that we ave set. This is an additional factor of security for our funds and for the client.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""it-must-be-difficult-to-provide-competitive-returns-in-the-current-interest-rate-market"">It must be difficult to provide competitive returns in the current interest rate market.</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>FB</span> – Yes and in addition to this, when interest rates are very low, small variations are more significant. When rates are around 50 basis points, a difference of a couple of basis points is much more important for the client, which was not the case when rates were higher.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>TD</span> – Performance is one of our objectives – but it is not the primary one. We have to be clear about that. We intend to maximise performance and work within the given risk framework. A money market fund is not designed to provide performance first and foremost. Our priority is to provide customers with security, liquidity and transparency in their investments.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>FB</span> – In the US, most treasurers of large corporations are limiting themselves to very safe money market investments – a new trend in Europe. Every week we are meeting treasurers who have in the past not chosen to invest in money market funds but have now chosen to take this route. A corporate treasurer has to do their best to achieve the best possible returns for their company – but it appears that an increase in interest yields by a couple of basis points is less consequential than a loss in their portfolio.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""are-any-other-factors-prompting-treasurers-to-consider-using-money-market-funds"">Are any other factors prompting treasurers to consider using money market funds?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>TD</span> – They are not necessarily fully comfortable with counterparty risks when leaving deposits with their banks. Money market funds can offer them a good way to mutualise this risk and simplify their access to liquidity.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>FB</span> – For treasurers, it is also a question of resources. If they wanted to do what we (asset managers) do, they would need their own analysts and a specific back office. This is a lot of work and for us, it is our core business. A few large corporate treasurers have their own dealing rooms and to a certain extent, they replicate what we do by investing in short-term debt from different issuers with different maturities while maintaining their own liquidity.</p>
<p>However at the end of the day, if you invest in a mutual fund, you benefit from the overall liquidity of the portfolio and no matter how big corporations may be, it is rare that they would manage as much as €120 billion.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""would-you-agree-that-corporations-are-looking-for-more-visibility-in-their-investments-since-the-crisis"">Would you agree that corporations are looking for more visibility in their investments since the crisis?</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>FB</span> – Indeed. They all want to have a look at the portfolio, see the details and analyse how the fund is structured. On the other hand, these corporations know that if they invest in a AAA-rated money market fund, they already have the answers to a lot of questions. They choose to invest in a AAA-rated money market fund because it is a source of comfort for them.</p>
</div>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>TD</span> – Upon request, we are able to provide our clients with comprehensive details of the portfolio within a short deadline. We believe that client relationships need to be based on trust and trust comes from having control; so we are very happy to provide as much information as we can to our clients in order for them to be comfortable with investing in the fund. As professional investors, they have the right to this information.*</p>
<p>At the same time, feedback related to areas such as risk or country exposure helps us to improve our offer. We set up regular client meetings with the fund managers to discuss our investment strategies.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""what-challenges-are-corporate-treasurers-currently-facing-in-terms-of-liquidity-management"">What challenges are corporate treasurers currently facing in terms of liquidity management?</h5>
<div class=""person n1"">
<p><span>FB</span> – The world has changed. A lot of corporate treasurers have expressed shock about the crisis; by the fact that some financial institutions have gone bankrupt and that a couple of money market funds either lost some of their Net Asset Value (NAV), or could not offer liquidity. Treasurers discovered that part of their job was to manage counterparty risk. A new kind of money market fund is emerging – the AAA-rated liquidity fund – that helps treasurers make sure that they are investing in an instrument with very low credit risk and excellent liquidity – and that it is an instrument they can use on a daily basis for large amounts.</p>
</div>
<h5 id=""how-are-treasurers-using-money-market-funds-in-the-current-market"">How are treasurers using money market funds in the current market?</h5>
<div class=""person n2"">
<p><span>TD</span> – Treasurers are using money market funds for obvious reasons – to manage their cash balances for one, especially the big corporations that have a high concentration of cash. Clearly, for corporate treasurers, money market funds are seen as a convenient and practical tool to manage their inflows and outflows on a ‘live’ basis. They are using these instruments to match their exact needs in terms of the speed of execution, of getting back liquidity when they need it and of investing daily cash flows.</p>
<p>More generally, investors – and not necessarily just corporate treasurers but institutions in general – are using money market funds as tools which can be used somewhat like a parking lot. Our French money market funds benefited from these kind of inflows during the crisis, when institutions sold their risky assets such as long-term bonds or equities. They were happy to place their cash in this kind of mutual fund for a certain period, which in practice lasted for a long time, since risk remained at a rather high level.</p>

<h5 id=""what-impact-are-regulatory-changes-likely-to-have-in-this-area"">What impact are regulatory changes likely to have in this area?</h5>
<p>TD – After the events that followed the Lehman collapse, it is clear that we are now working within a new regulatory environment, especially for money market funds in Europe, where the new regulator (ESMA) has changed the classification criteria for funds belonging to this category. On 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011, there will be two new categories for money market funds – the first is ‘Short-Term Money Market Funds’ and the second category is simply called ‘Money Market Funds’.</p>
<p>For both categories, the limits that have been set and that we will apply are much stricter than those that have existed so far. In actual fact, this regulatory development will not change anything for our entire range of money market funds. Even before the crisis and before these new criteria were applied or were even defined, our funds were by and large already compliant with these new criteria, so this will in effect not make any difference to our investment processes.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>While much has been written about the impact of the financial crisis on companies looking to raise funds, the implications for investing have been just as profound. As always, treasurers and other investors have to balance their needs in relation to security, liquidity and yield but investment challenges have greatly increased due to the double whammy of depressed prospective returns coupled with elevated risk. In this Business Briefing, we look at the key drivers affecting investment decisions, consider how the structure of corporate investment portfolios has evolved and explore the wider changes in treasurers’ investment behaviour.</p>
<h3 id=""treading-the-fine-line-between-risk-and-return"">Treading the fine line between risk and return</h3>
<p>As the global downturn continues, central banks around the world have reacted by adopting increasingly drastic monetary easing policies, moving towards a Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) environment and introducing quantitative easing. For investors and treasurers, this has resulted in the challenging and somewhat unappealing combination of reduced prospective returns, coupled with elevated risks when managing and investing cash balances.</p>
<p>Consequently, the financial crisis has led corporate investors to reassess their objectives and revisit the structure of their investment portfolios. The events of the past 18 months have shaken the market to such an extent that the rules have been rewritten. While the dust appears to have settled to a certain degree, investors remain highly cautious, risk premia remain elevated, and few feel confident enough to predict how the market will develop.</p>

<p>For many corporate treasurers, short-term investment may previously have been viewed as a relatively straightforward activity, where objectives were, on the whole, clearly defined, and the consequences of misjudgements were often mitigated by access to liquidity and capital at reasonable costs. Consequently, treasurers tended to focus on yield, and often viewed investment activities in the wider context of managing relationships and reciprocity across their partner banks.</p>
<p>Times have changed, however, and treasurers are now keenly aware of the need to avoid losses and the importance of liquidity for the company as a whole. The combination of increased risk and volatility, increasing tightness of cash generation and access to external funding, together with low prospective returns in a ZIRP environment, is making investment decisions substantially more complex than in recent history. This has upped the accountability of treasurers, who are consequently taking a more robust and proactive approach to their investments than ever before in order to navigate the challenges presented by a continually evolving market.</p>
<h4 id=""investor-priorities"">Investor priorities</h4>
<p>In addition to their corporate investment policies, investors usually take into account the following four key factors when making an investment decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Risk.</h5>
<p>How much risk is the investor prepared to accept?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Preservation of capital.</h5>
<p>Is this essential?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity.</h5>
<p>Is daily liquidity required? For what percentage of the invested funds?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Expected return.</h5>
<p>What yield is the investor looking for?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All investment options entail a certain degree of trade-off between these priorities. The lowest risk investments are also associated with the lowest yield, while investment options offering less liquidity, or entailing a higher level of risk, may offer greater yield. The ongoing financial crisis has led investors to re-evaluate the importance of each of these factors and to revisit their investment decisions accordingly.</p>
<p>While it is possible to observe broad trends in investment practices, it is important to remember that each investor has different priorities and requirements. Some investors will be concerned with yield and not counterparty risk; others will prioritise liquidity over every other consideration.</p>
<h4 id=""cause-and-effect"">Cause and effect</h4>
<p>The events of recent months have illustrated the complex interaction between market events, investor behaviour and investment options. Before the onset of the financial crisis, yield was viewed by many investors as the most important of the four investment goals. “Eighteen months ago, a lot of our clients were driving purely after return,” says Steve Elms, Liquidity &amp; Investments Product Manager, EMEA, Citi. “They would have their own set of counterparties that they could deal with and as long as these counterparties were part of their investor list, then they would be looking for yield as their key driver.”</p>
<h5 id=""the-conservative-approach"">The conservative approach</h5>
<p>As events unfolded at high speed in late 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, investors reacted by becoming more conservative and increasingly prioritising liquidity and capital preservation over yield. Counterparty limits were reduced and counterparties were removed from investors’ lists as investors fought to insulate themselves from counterparty risk.</p>
<h5 id=""the-point-of-no-return"">The point of no return</h5>
<p>However, as interest rates have dropped towards zero, the yield available on the most secure investment instruments has fallen dramatically. In December of 2008, the yield on three-month US Treasury bills temporarily dropped below 0%, meaning that investors were effectively paying the government to safeguard their funds.</p>
<p>In recent months, some investors have begun to turn their attention back to higher yielding investments, particularly as the widespread turmoil triggered by Lehman Brothers’ collapse subsided. “During late 2008, we saw the dust settle a little,” says David Li, Liquidity &amp; Investments Market Manager, EMEA, Citi. “Investors had seen some winners and losers emerging amongst banks and investment counterparties, and yield started to come back into play.”</p>
<p>With interest rates on some bank deposits dropping in line with rate cuts, investors have exhibited increased interest in money funds, which can benefit from a lagging effect due to the longer maturities of some of their underlying assets. However, as David Li continues, “As rates reach a more stable environment, even if stability is a zero interest rate policy environment, other investment/deposit options will become relatively more attractive again, as the lagging effect with money funds starts to run off.”</p>
<h3 id=""investment-options"">Investment options</h3>
<p>While investor behaviour has continued to change in response to the evolving market conditions, some investment instruments have benefited while others have fallen out of favour. Notable developments include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h5>Treasury bills.</h5>
<p>Investor demand pushed the yield on three month US T-bills below zero in December 2008, illustrating the extent of the scramble for low-risk investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Commercial paper.</h5>
<p>Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, volumes in the commercial paper market plummeted in the US and Europe. Between October and November 2008, the volume of outstanding European CP dropped by $100 billion. Corporate investors have dramatically reduced their holdings of commercial paper and asset-backed commercial paper continues to be largely rejected by investors despite a revival of interest in yield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Money market funds.</h5>
<p>Investment in money market funds has continued to grow. News that the Reserve Primary had ‘broken the buck’ in September 2008 (ie its share price had fallen below $1) resulted in some withdrawal from money funds; however, the category has reverted to its growth track, with inflows as fund managers sought to de-risk or clarify the assets underlying their funds. There is increasing differentiation by investors across money market funds, and after a surge of interest in government funds, recently there has been some flow from government backed money market funds to higher yielding prime funds in a renewed drive for yield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Enhanced cash funds.</h5>
<p>Investor appetite for higher yielding/higher risk funds has however decreased significantly, in a climate where risk premia remain elevated. Constraints on access to liquidity (typically part of these funds’ proposition) also inhibit their uptake under current market conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bank demand deposits.</h5>
<p>Standard bank deposits are associated with relatively low yield but are highly liquid – funds can be transferred as soon as required. Bank deposits also reflect interest rate cuts instantly, so rate cuts may prompt investors to move to products such as money market funds which reflect rate cuts more slowly. Overall the move towards a ZIRP environment has dented the appeal of bank deposits offering slender returns and has prompted investors to consider different asset classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Term deposits.</h5>
<p>Investors keen to keep cash readily accessible have been less willing to tie funds into fixed-term investments. Time deposits have accordingly shifted towards offering shorter tenors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These trends have also been reflected in the composition of money market funds, which have increased their holdings of government debt and reduced asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) and commercial paper.</p>

<h3 id=""investor-behaviour"">Investor behaviour</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, far-reaching changes are taking place in terms of how investors are engaging with the market.</p>
<h4 id=""knowledge-is-power"">Knowledge is power</h4>
<p>The most important of these is the need for more information. According to David Li, “Previously depositors and treasurers would have focused on various characteristics of investment products, particularly yield vs liquidity. Now there is a sense that they need a much wider understanding, as well as depth to what lies beneath – the type of instrument, what that means for them, what the true risk is, and what due diligence was done by any investment partners. The increasingly challenges of investments, together with scarcity of generation of cash, are compelling treasurers to become much more involved than ever before.”</p>
<p>Increased accountability is an important part of the equation. The treasurer has become more visible as the financial crisis has developed and senior management is increasingly turning to treasurers to guide them through the turbulent market conditions. This has often been exacerbated where there has been an increase in the proportion of assets held in cash, rather than in non-cash asset classes which might previously have been managed by others outside treasury, such as a Chief Investment Officer. With this trend for increased visibility and accountability, it is essential for treasurers to understand and explain their investment decisions and to take responsibility for the outcome.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a greater level of understanding, investors are asking more questions. Where investment managers are involved, depositors are keen to meet those investment managers in person and are asking what funds are on offer, how those funds are structured and what investment strategies are being followed. They are also keen to know what control processes and credit evaluation due diligence processes are employed when assessing individual investments for inclusion in the portfolios being offered to the end client.</p>
<h5 id=""reviewing-performance"">Reviewing performance</h5>
<p>The demand for information does not stop with the investment decision, and depositors are increasingly requiring regular updates of their investments’ performance and condition, enabling them to adjust to market developments and amend their strategy if necessary.</p>
<h5 id=""visibility-and-control"">Visibility and control</h5>
<p>Increasingly depositors are requiring daily or real-time visibility over their investments. In the treasury context this may be achieved using a treasury management system (TMS) or using solutions offered by their banking partners. Citi, for example, offers a web-based platform, Online Investments, which gives depositors access to their investments including fund information, details of transactions and reporting tools as well as the ability to research and trade new investments.</p>
<h4 id=""flexibility"">Flexibility</h4>
<p>With the investment environment constantly shifting, corporate investors are also increasingly willing to switch between products. With an increased level of knowledge leading to a greater degree of confidence in individual products, investors are more prepared to revise their policies on an ongoing basis and to move funds between products when the picture changes.</p>
<h4 id=""diversification"">Diversification</h4>
<p>A diversified portfolio is essential with counterparty risk continuing to be a key concern and investors are looking to increase the range of products they are using.</p>
<h4 id=""weighing-up-the-risk"">Weighing up the risk</h4>
<p>Particularly for treasurers, a heightened awareness of counterparty risk has led to a shift in terms of bank relationships. Whereas previously investment allocation may have been largely determined by factors such as maintaining a positive relationship with key banks as well as a focus on yield and pricing, the awareness of counterparty risk has to some extent overtaken the sense of reciprocity. Although bank relationships remain important in the interests of maintaining access to credit, investors are having to ask what happens if there is not a happy ending and are seeking additional documentation from investment partners to protect themselves in the event of insolvency.</p>
<p>While the importance of assessing counterparty risk has been highlighted by recent bank failures, other types of risk have also come to the fore. For example, with sovereign ratings of countries such as Spain and Greece recently downgraded by the ratings agencies, corporates are paying increasing attention to the issue of sovereign risk and asking whether this should be considered.</p>
<p>Treasurers have had to consider scenarios that were previously unthinkable and to seek increased levels of disclosure on the underlying investments. Accordingly, they are asking what would happen if an investment collapsed: are governmental or other guarantees in place? What recourse would the investor have? What jurisdiction would any insolvency be under? Is the investment ring-fenced?</p>
<p>Investors are taking into account both explicit and implicit guarantees. An explicit guarantee is concrete protection offered by the government, such as the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) in the US. An implicit guarantee is a statement by the government that is interpreted as offering a certain level of protection, for example stating that a particular bank is ‘too big to fail’. Both types of guarantee can help to make particular products more attractive to investors, with the additional security compensating in some cases for lower yield.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As the financial crisis has developed, demands on treasurers have likewise increased. With treasury firmly in the spotlight, treasurers have found they have more demands on their time and more levers to pull than ever before. The risks are far greater and in the area of short-term investment the wrong decision can have serious implications.</p>
<p>As Steve Elms says, “Previously, the risk of getting it wrong was not that bad – approximately right was good enough. Now that’s changed. Corporate investors have to keep their banks happy to make sure they retain access to credit; they have to keep their company happy by making sure they’ve got adequate access to liquidity; they have to keep shareholders happy by protecting them from inappropriate counterparty risk – and while they’re at it, they are also trying to generate a bit of yield.”</p>
<p>In order to make the right investment decisions, corporate investors have to balance all of these needs. In order to achieve this, it is essential to have maximum visibility over their cash, with high speed solutions and analytics that will enable them to make business decisions quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>As investors’ priorities continue to shift, they are also taking more responsibility and looking for more information on their investments than ever before. Once made, decisions must be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to represent the company’s requirements in the changing market.</p>
