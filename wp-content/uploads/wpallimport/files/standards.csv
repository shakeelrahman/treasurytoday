<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Earlier this year, the treasury department at French utility EDF structured and sold the energy company’s first social bonds to investors. The proceeds have gone to finance capex purchases from EDF’s SME suppliers supporting generation and production activities at its nuclear fleet and electricity network, particularly targeting small businesses in areas of high unemployment.</p>
<p>In another endeavour linked to EDF’s promise to support its suppliers reduce their own carbon emissions and promised in the company’s sweeping Mission Statement, it introduced a reverse factoring programme last year. It offers preferrable discounting rates to its suppliers when they reach a certain level of ESG integration in their own business. So far, supplier uptake of the ESG-linked supply chain credit has been slow, due in part to cheap, government-sponsored bank financing to SMEs, but Bernard Descreux, EDF’s Head of Treasury believes it will pick up going forward.</p>
<p>Both treasury initiatives have been driven by EDF’s ambition to reduce its Scope 3 emissions, the carbon footprint of the components in a company’s product and of those products once in use. Scope 3 emissions are typically the biggest part of a corporate’s carbon footprint and the hardest to unravel and measure. They also reveal an important granularity: a coal mining company won’t produce huge emissions in its mining processes (Scope 1), but use of its product (Scope 3) has a profound impact on global emissions; Tesla’s production processes score poorly in ESG ratings because manufacturing the electric car is a carbon intensive process, but the product has minimal downstream emissions.</p>
<p>At EDF, Scope 3 emissions comprise the burning of gas sold to end customers as well as purchased electricity the company sells; emissions from the firm’s minority generation assets plus all purchased goods and services, explains Matthew Reed, Head of Sustainable Finance Development, part of EDF’s finance team tasked with finding, measuring and financing the reduction of EDF’s total carbon footprint. “We reduced our Scope 3 carbon emissions by 11% last year, part of a targeted 28% reduction by 2030,” he says.</p>
<p>Both Descreux and Reed link progress to the company’s overarching climate strategy for carbon neutrality across all emission scopes by 2050 where the focus is on decarbonisation rather than offsetting emissions. The group’s commitment to next zero resulted in EDF’s finance and treasury teams drawing up a Sustainable Finance Strategy to fund the company’s transition. Social bonds and ESG-linked supply chain credit are the latest tools in an armoury that includes an €8.7bn green bond programme to date used to finance the bulk of EDF’s renewable and hydro-electricity investment. “You need a clear-eyed carbon strategy,” advises Reed. “Before pulling the levers, you need to be clear of the goals.”</p>
<h4 id=""basis-points"">Basis points</h4>
<p>Banks are offering a growing array of financial products to support companies getting to grips with their Scope 3. Citi offers corporate clients a sustainable supply chain finance product that incentivises their counterparties to improve their sustainability by offering preferable rates of financing and services. Like the overlay it applied to its existing supply chain offering for German chemical and consumer goods company Henkel, seeking to nurture resilience and incentivise sustainability across its supplier base. “We created two universes,” explains Parvaiz Dalal, Global Head Payables Finance at Citi in London. “Henkel’s most sustainable suppliers received favourable pricing with a certification process while Henkel’s traditional suppliers remained on our basic product offering.”</p>
<p>Citi uses a certification agency to check and rate the sustainability of all companies in the buyer’s supply chain, segregating them into green, amber and red. Different sleeves within the programme allow suppliers to move up the ladder and tap preferential financing and services if their sustainability improves. “We find that suppliers in the programme categorised as ‘red’ typically strive to improve their sustainability and reach ‘green’ accessing the ensuing rewards for helping Henkel deliver on its sustainability goals,” says Dalal, who links the burst in client demand to the pandemic. “Since COVD, companies are looking with much more detail at their counter parties; how things are sold and where and how they source.”</p>
<p>The ability to move up the ranks is crucial to the programme’s success and embodies the proverbial ‘journey’ inherent in ESG integration. “It is not a one-time exercise,” says Dalal. In Citi’s traditional supply chain finance programme, corporate clients’ suppliers are onboarded through a light KYC process and not treated as the bank’s clients. In contrast, under its Sustainable Supplier Finance programme, Citi reviews its clients’ suppliers’ certification and ESG status every year to allow ‘red’ suppliers to improve to tap the benefits and keep already ‘green’ suppliers on their toes. Buyers typically concentrate on their biggest emitters in the first year; in the second year they dig deeper and in the third year look at their long tail suppliers.</p>
<h4 id=""getting-started"">Getting started</h4>
<p>Colour coding belies the complexity of tackling Scope 3 emissions. For many treasury teams, the biggest challenge is simply working out how to measure emissions in their supply chain. Rather than an industry standard or universally consistent metrics, the measurement landscape is populated by different ratings providers fighting for market dominance. “It is not an established market place,” says Mark Douglas, Managing Director, Strategic Accounts at supply chain finance platform PrimeRevenue, who adds that buyers and suppliers often use different rating agencies making it even more difficult to compare data.</p>
<p>Deciding what to measure is equally boggling. Companies can make the same product but with different carbon components depending on the buyer, while treasury teams struggle to feed data into their ERP systems. Finding the required data is certainly onerous. Suppliers need to detail and provide evidence of every potential sustainability credit or black mark from the source of their energy to the diversity of their workforce. It’s created a mixed level of enthusiasm. Tier 1 suppliers are quick to onboard, but Tier 1 suppliers’ suppliers are notably less willing. “This is where the conversation tends to get tougher – they don’t want to be dictated to,” says Douglas. Still, motivated by the belief it will help them win business, he notes that more companies are accepting that it is an imperfect system and taking the plunge.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Onboarding requires engagement and patience. Descreux hopes EDF’s social bond programme will become an important source of knowledge transfer, helping suppliers grasp and benefit from their role in supporting the utility’s sustainability targets. “Accessing this finance involves deep discussions on how suppliers can contribute to our goals,” he says. “Sustainable finance is something that is still very odd to many people within a company and within a treasury. It’s important to help people understand what it means.”</p>
<p>At Tesco, which became the first UK retailer to offer a sustainability linked supply chain finance scheme to its supplier base last year via a platform developed in partnership with Santander, the priority has been balancing a fair and credible scoring system with a process that is not too time consuming and complex for small suppliers. The company has tailored the methodology for SMEs so that the data ask is less onerous, explains Alex Ashby, Head of Treasury Markets for the retailer, where Scope 3 emissions make up more than 90% of the company’s total emissions footprint and where treasury came up with the supply chain concept in 2019.</p>
<p>Ratings agencies have an essential role in creating confidence in the grading system and preventing greenwashing. At French ratings agency EcoVadis, suppliers are rated and certified annually taking into account their policy, actions and results, explains Sandy Gray, Private Equity Sustainability Solutions, North America at the company. She also stresses the importance of rating agencies verifying the information they receive from suppliers to instil market confidence. “Rating providers should only utilise self-assessment questionnaires if they are accompanied with polling of that company’s policies, actions, results and verification of the information. Suppliers have to realise someone is watching them and that a rating is not a free ticket.”</p>
<p>She also notes that progress on Scope 3 reporting is still slow, partly because of the detail of information and data required. Only 15% of the 90,000 odd companies EcoVadis rates can successfully report on their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. “Companies can only begin to harness the emissions in their supply chain when they have a firm handle on how to calculate and report on emissions,” she says.</p>
<h4 id=""benefits"">Benefits</h4>
<p>A Scope 3 strategy brings recognition and rewards from investors. Speaking during a recent webinar hosted by FCLTGlobal, the not-for profit that aims to focus capital on the long-term to support a sustainable economy, Jim Fitterling, Chairman and CEO of Dow highlighted growing investor pressure on companies to get to grips with their Scope 3 emissions – and the rewards of action. Fitterling urged large corporates to “get on board” with Scope 3 and help SMEs in their supply chain reduce emissions. “We are working on our Scope 3 emissions with our suppliers, building it into our supplier partnerships with a clear line of sight,” he said. The company is also reducing Scope 3 in its products, many of which increase energy efficiency in buildings in line with emerging building codes and government policy.</p>
<p>Companies not taking action increasingly feel investor heat. Groups like Climate Action 100+, a group of global investors striving to ensure the world’s largest corporate emitters act on limiting their carbon footprint, have utilities in their sights. Like renowned laggard South Korea’s Korean Electricity Production Company, (KEPCO), monopoly owner of the majority of South Korea’s 50-odd coal-fired power plants. Climate Action 100+ investors are ratcheting up the pressure on the company to limit and exit coal and fossil fuel extraction to fuel its energy production with the threat of divestment.</p>
<p>In one encouraging trend, integrating Scope 3 is resulting in more private companies cutting their emissions. The argument goes that private companies, out of the public spotlight and free from looming regulation like mandatory climate-related financial disclosures for listed companies, are slower to cut emissions. But Gray points out that around 70% of EcoVadis’s 90,000 corporates are SMEs, the bulk of which are private. “We have developed a methodology that can work equally in public and private companies, across countries, industries and enterprise size,” she says.</p>
<p>Companies the world over have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050 but unless they get to grips with emissions in their supply chain, they’ll never meet their commitments. “You can’t be net zero as a company if your Scope 3 emissions are heading to net zero. They have to try and influence it,” concludes Prime Revenue’s Douglas.</p></div>

<p>“The average global treasury team spends more than one day per week navigating a thicket of KYC requirements. And it’s not getting any easier,” says Delphine Masquelier, Product Manager KYC Compliance Services at SWIFT. The regulatory landscape is evolving fast, making KYC processes increasingly complex. For corporates that use the services of multiple banks, the challenge of just keeping up is magnified several times over as they work to comply with the KYC requests of each one, often across different products.</p>
<p>Hurrah then for the KYC utility, centralising access to common and uniform data and documents. Well, not quite. Despite the KYC ‘industry’ lending itself to the existence of a common platform for sharing otherwise commodified data, it has yet to see a successful delivery.</p>
<p>When Bloomberg announced in April 2019 that it will shut down Entity Exchange, and Refinitiv said in June it is planning to close its KYC-as-a-service offering, low uptake was cited on the death certificate of these high profile utilities. “Many vendors had a go on their own to solve the complex challenge with limited success,” notes Masquelier. “They have inadvertently added to complexity, failed to find a sustainable economic model or, in some cases, created solutions that have not been fit for purpose.”</p>
<p>Mark Trivedi, Managing Director, Head of Client Experience and Firmwide Collateral Transformation, J.P. Morgan has a bit more sympathy for the KYC utility effort. Because AML and KYC rules are delivered as directives, they are not as prescriptive as perhaps imagined, he notes. “This leaves room for local interpretation, and so variability ensues.” Additionally, he says each institution has its own risk tolerance and profile which can also dictate how their requirements are shaped.</p>
<p>The whole process is a moving feast: even if some level of consistency and understanding is achieved, the rules keep changing, says Trivedi. “Adapting regularly to that portfolio of changes makes the establishment of a singular utility very challenging.”</p>
<p>Of course, it may just be the case that multiple utilities existing in the same space simply defeat the objective of a single source of information, or that those surfacing were competitive rather than consortia-driven exercises. This is a point made by Alan Samuels, Head of Product at global KYC process automation firm, Encompass. “They need to be driven by the data providers rather than third-parties,” he suggests. “Successful utilities arise only when industry participants work together.”</p>
<p>Samuels argues that “trying to boil the ocean by offering a global KYC solution”, when most banks and organisations are more regionalised, seems not to work for utilities (SWIFT notwithstanding). There is a clue to a possible template for success here: Encompass is part of Invidem, a KYC utility set up by a coalition of six Nordic banks in 2019, having found a way of encouraging regional KYC stakeholders to willingly participate. If others follow, a ‘network of networks’ model could cross the globe.</p>
<p>“Ultimately successful utilities are a mix of push and pull,” says Samuels. “Push comes from the regulators, maintaining standards, enforcing good practice and instilling discipline. But pull must come from the industry, working together and seeing the value in collaboration.”</p>
<h4 id="""">Pain continues</h4>
<p>But KYC has always been a slow process. In the past, governments would release lists of sanctioned entities and compliance teams would manually check new customers to make sure there were no matches. And despite the digital revolution, the process remains repetitive, lengthy and cumbersome.</p>
<p>Research has shown that it takes an average of 24 days for a company to complete a bank’s customer onboarding process. This delay is due to “poor data management”, states Masquelier, adding that the data required by financial institutions from corporates is “often incomplete, out of date and held in multiple databases”. It’s why even an existing bank customer can receive multiple KYC requests from different divisions.</p>
<p>The absence of uniformity, differing jurisdictional requirements and the lack of standardised data across the corporate KYC space puts pressure on the relationship between banks and their corporate clients. Treasury teams have naturally been at the centre of this maelstrom – confronted with demands from multiple global bankers across geographies, they have often had to scramble to update their corporate identity information, authorised signatories list and legal entity documents.</p>
<p>“In many cases, they have been asked to supply new information at a far more granular level of detail than ever before,” observes Manoj Mistry, Managing Director of IBOS (or the ‘International Banking – One Solution’ Banking Association), the trade organisation of global correspondent banking service providers. “Faced with losing valuable access to banking services, the degree of exigent coordination across an organisation to obtain current and consistent information has created a sizable burden among treasurers and their staff.”</p>
<p>Relatedly, the information burden for correspondent banking relationships is perhaps the most onerous. Use of previously ‘standard’ information is now by and large negated, with Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) rules now superseding past regulations, and bankers asking for a ‘global minimum’ standard EDD information that is substantially more critical and inquisitive about client relationships. “In order to supply this level of data, and to keep it refreshed on a periodic annual basis, it has created additional complex and time-intensive workload for smaller corporate teams,” he comments.</p>
<p>It’s true also that greater digitisation in the global payment systems has created a new responsibility for real-time authorisations from treasury. “Whilst in the past, large money transfers and payments were covered under the KYC master file, recently, many banks are requiring individual authorisations even for regular payments (such as monthly vendor invoices),” notes Mistry.</p>
<p>This is especially onerous for payments destined for regions under some type of sanction. Indeed, if one part of a global organisation needs to maintain a legitimate payments relationship with businesses in a sanctioned country, that relationship can create additional risk in the overall global banking relationship, and in so doing, increase the frequency and depth of informational refresh.</p>
<p>But with banks currently using a mix of internal and vendor tools, “getting them to agree on a single solution is like herding cats,” states Mistry. Perhaps most challenging of all though, he believes, is the ability of anyone to monitor global regulatory developments and then create a ‘global minimum standard’ that banks and regulators can agree on, and which corporates can support.</p>
<p>The failure of the KYC utility model so far, he notes, is in part driven by a “low willingness” among current data vendors to agree on a pricing schema to contribute their data to a portal partnership. But he also sees a lack of enthusiasm for (and maybe high cost-sensitivity to) creating comprehensive current-ownership and structure information around private companies.</p>
<p>Whilst Bureau van Dijk (part of Moody’s) has good coverage of EU private companies, “that’s about it,” notes Mistry. “The Americas and ROW remain a ‘Wild West’, with 100% reliance on what private companies claim is true – no independent verification is possible.” J.P. Morgan’s Trivedi further observes a general corporate resistance to uploading relatively sensitive data into a third-party source, many citing data privacy and security as a concern.</p>
<h4 id="""">Personal pain</h4>
<p>Praveen Juyal, Treasury Manager, Amway India Enterprises, has first-hand experience of what KYC compliance is like from the corporate side. Whilst he accepts that KYC has a vital role to play, he says the main pain-point for him, as a treasurer, is process efficiency.</p>

<p>The forum we created when trialling our KYC Registry enabled corporates to understand why banks ask for certain types of information, and for banks to reflect on the questions they are asking, and to assess whether opportunities exist for harmonisation through global standards.<br/>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>To illustrate his point, he reflects on a recent event. “I have exchanged 20 emails with one of our banks on this KYC. The bank wants the signature of the customers but I have told them many times that all are working from home, and that it’s difficult to get signatures at present, considering the situation with COVID-19, but the bank is still not satisfied.”</p>
<p>His ongoing frustration is palpable. “We have 15 signatories and 12 banks in our system. Every year we need to provide KYC, and it’s a pain to do it again and again for the same person. Really, how often is there a change in human behaviour and in their signatures? Do they change every year? The answer seems to be ‘yes’ since we are obliged to repeat KYC every year.”</p>
<p>The various KYC utilities offered to date have largely failed, he believes, because the pain of responding to KYC is not taken seriously. His one possible solution is that unless there is a change in circumstances for the client, banks and FIs should not repeatedly ask for KYC confirmations but instead take an annual declaration that there is no change in previous KYC status.</p>
<p>Ideally, Juyal sees a digital repository with unique reference number, as the longer-term answer. “If anyone wants it, just give that reference number and you are done.” That number could operate in much the same way a Director Identification Number, but using data masking for more security.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he suggests other treasurers could make life easier for themselves by taking a relatively simple action. “Make at least five printouts of KYC documentation, get them signed immediately by the respective authorised signatories, and make your own ‘repository’,” he suggests. “Every year, whenever necessary, just take one copy as required and provide it to your banks. That way you can save your time for five years if there is no change in signatories.”</p>
<p>That the process is still excruciating for most treasurers raises some key questions for Juyal. “I would like to understand if we are seriously looking for KYC, or if what we are doing is merely to comply with the requirements? Also I’d like to know why, if there is a proper system in place to check KYC, are there still frauds in businesses, banks or financial institutions?”</p>
<p>For him, the overarching purpose of KYC requests should be made clear by those that require it: “By all means ‘Know Your Customer’ but please don’t ‘Knot Your Customer’ with this pain”.</p>
<h4 id="""">Way forward</h4>
<p>One practical solution to the pain felt by the likes of Juyal, suggests Samuels, is leveraging the technology “which is now getting ahead of the demands of regulation”, automation helping organisations increase the productivity and effectiveness of the existing team. “As regulation becomes more demanding, it’s in every organisation’s best interest to make sure it has collected and aggregated all the available information, even from public sources.”</p>
<p>For Mistry, global corporates should make greater investment in the internal talent and skillset which could conduct surveillance on the latest regulatory updates, and then develop effective responses. “In many large corporates today, these services are outsourced to external legal firms, which have proven to not always be the best option when it comes to defining business-prudent solutions to complex regulatory requirements.” Internally keeping data accurate and easily accessible offers considerable pain relief.</p>
<p>Corporates (as well as other legal entity types) should also consider providing their banks with a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI – an ISO standard 20-character code). “It provides a tremendous uplift in our dataset,” says Trivedi. Centrally stored LEIs allow banks to pre-populate a number of KYC fields.</p>
<p>It also helps if corporates publish – and keep updated – KYC-relevant data through providers such as SWIFT, IHS Markit, and other KYC utility platforms, he adds. “And if there is no appetite to cover every legal entity in the group, at least know the ones that constantly require updating and keep those current.”</p>
<p>Banks have a role to play too, individually and en masse. “We need to make sure we have a well-defined and finite set of informational elements that we request from clients. We can do that by sourcing data from public sources, including existing KYC repositories, but where we have deep relationships with our clients, we will often already have a lot of information that we can source, eliminating the need to ask.”</p>
<p>But Trivedi acknowledges that banks should also be creating more efficient channels through which they collect data and documents pertaining to KYC, onboarding, and other relevant areas. “As an industry, the majority of our information exchange with clients is via email. Clients are becoming more sensitive to this and are looking for more efficient and secure ways to exchange information and as institutions we should provide improved capabilities.”</p>
<p>At a regulatory level, there is a growing case to be made for large corporates to exercise their substantial jurisdictional public policy lobby capabilities, “positively influencing the development of regulations”, suggests Mistry. “This could be in collaboration with banking partners or industry associations.”</p>
<p>Whilst much of the recent policy updates governing KYC and AML have focused on mitigating emerging risks from ‘bad actors’, he feels providing greater strength to regional regulatory bodies to impose sanctions on member banks has an unintended consequence. Indeed, in many instances, more stringent local interpretations of the actual risk and its related policy mandate have created an even greater burden among corporates and their banking partners to profitably comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>A specific case for lobbying he therefore suggests would be for global corporates to earn KYC relief for legal entities – even privately-held entities within a corporate group – that are 100% directly owned and controlled by a publicly-traded parent organisation.</p>
<h4 id="""">Promising engagement</h4>
<p>For Masquelier, on the regional utility front, she says the first thing to note is that they were created to meet the local needs of smaller, regional institutions. “This approach cannot solve the full problem on its own,” she states. For her, solving KYC is about getting the right industry dynamics and the right support from banks, corporates and regulators.</p>
<p>Once the correct industry dynamics are in place, fintechs can step in to solve some specific problems in areas like identity management, pattern detection and information sourcing, for example, she believes. It also becomes feasible for local registries to be integrated with a more globally focused registry so that banks and corporates can receive and provide all the information they need in one place.</p>
<p>“But if financial institutions and corporates were only to consider their own individual needs and what works for them, solving the challenges around KYC would be nearly impossible,” argues Masquelier. The future therefore must be about collaboration.</p>
<p>From SWIFT’s engagement with both parties in opening its KYC Registry (its global platform of predefined KYC data fields and document types) to corporates in 2019, it became clear that financial institutions and corporates alike recognise KYC as a necessity, and that both are keen to collaborate to create a solution that works for all parties involved.</p>
<p>“The forum we created when trialling our KYC Registry enabled corporates to understand why banks ask for certain types of information, and for banks to reflect on the questions they are asking, and to assess whether opportunities exist for harmonisation through global standards,” she comments.</p>
<p>As an active participant, Trivedi says J.P. Morgan has noticed many more requests coming from its non-bank clients who are keen to participate in a platform enabling them to publish standardised common KYC data and documentation, consumable by banks “in a more systemic fashion” (the more localised requirements being handled by the banking sector’s aim to streamline data requirements and be more proactive with its collection processes).</p>
<p>“If this engagement has revealed anything,” Masquelier continues, “it’s that there is real appetite for collaboration across the industry, and by harnessing this, the industry is on the right track to building a KYC solution that works for banks and corporates together.”</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Launched in 2017, the FX Global Code of Conduct is a voluntary set of principles designed to promote fairness, transparency, liquidity and openness across the global FX market. Vincenzo Dimase, Market Development Manager, FX – Europe at Refinitiv (the financial and risk business of Thomson Reuters is now Refinitiv) explains what the Code means for corporate treasurers and their counterparties and why treasurers should sign up.</p>

 </div>
<p style=""clear:both;"">Recent years have seen many regulatory changes in the world of FX. But while robust regulation is important, following the letter of the law can have its limits. Market participants around the world have increasingly felt that a code of conduct is needed to maintain fair and effective markets, while avoiding any repeat of the scandals of the past.</p>
<p>As a result, market participants worked together for two years to build a global code of conduct which would focus on voluntary principles rather than rules, and which would promote considered reflection rather than simply checkbox compliance. The result of this exercise was the FX Global Code. Published in 2017, the Code consists of 55 principles intended to promote transparency, fairness and integrity within the wholesale FX market. The Code is designed for a diverse range of buy-side and sell-side market participants, including banks, central banks, asset managers, non-bank liquidity providers, brokers, e-trading platforms and corporate treasuries.</p>
<p>Refinitiv has played an active role in developing the Code through our membership of the Market Participants Group (MPG), as well as several regional committees. We wanted to make sure that our platform would embed the rules, concepts and principles of the Code. We formally signed a statement of commitment in November 2017.</p>
<h3 id=""about-the-code"">About the Code</h3>
<p>The Code was written with a number of objectives in mind. The overriding goal was to create a document that would be as useful and usable as possible. Unlike financial regulation – MiFID II runs to 7,000 pages by one count – the FX Global Code of Conduct is a digestible 78 pages and is written in plain English. Much effort has been made to ensure the code is both user friendly and relevant, and that it includes concrete examples demonstrating how the principles can be employed in practice.</p>
<p>Another key characteristic of the Code is that of proportionality. This means that market participants can adopt the Code according to the complexity of their operations and their level of engagement in the FX market. So a small bank will not be expected to achieve the same type of implementation as a large bank. Likewise, the steps involved in adopting the code will look different for corporates than for banks. The Code is also designed to evolve in line with technological developments in the market.</p>
<h3 id=""gaining-momentum"">Gaining momentum</h3>
<p>Banks have been proactive in signing up: to date over 300 market participants have agreed to adhere to the Code. But the picture is somewhat different for buy-side participants. At the time of writing, corporates represented only 2-3% of the parties who have signed up, with early corporate participants including Shell, Airbus and Siemens.</p>
<p>This is likely to change as awareness grows. Corporates may have seen the Code as a matter for banks. But in practice, the global FX ecosystem is very diverse, incorporating a wide range of market participants. In order to be as relevant as possible, the Code needs to be adopted across the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Fortunately, interest in this topic is growing. During a recent webinar by Refinitiv and Treasury Today, a poll found that two thirds of attendees felt it was important that the corporate treasury community publicly support the Code. An important step in achieving this was the recent launch of a register of corporates adhering to the code by the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT), alongside existing registers.</p>
<div class=""boxed"">
<h3 id=""what-should-you-be-doing-now"">What should you be doing now?</h3>
<p>Signing up to the Code is straightforward. Treasurers wishing to adopt the code should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the Code and try to isolate the areas which are most relevant to their businesses. This might prompt the company to assess its liquidity providers, or request prices from more than one counterparty, or begin using an electronic platform instead of the phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform the relevant people. This may involve working with external parties – associations such as the EACT are offering learning courses which can provide a learning path for the relevant people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill out the statement of adherence – a straightforward document – and send it to the public register.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The company will then be listed as adhering to the Code and will appear on the public register. Being part of that list – and particularly one of the early adopters – tells the market something about the company’s values and how the company approaches FX.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""why-sign-up"">Why sign up?</h3>
<p>For corporates, the Code has much to offer. Companies which sign up to the Code are sending a clear message to the market: they are aware of the key principles of the Code; they may have adjusted their internal processes; they understand the transparency and fairness that banks need to adopt when dealing with counterparties. The following are some of the areas where benefits can be seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Market colour.</h5>
<p>The Code provides clear guidelines about how participants can provide ‘market colour’ – in other words, how they should respond when clients ask for insights into how markets are performing. In such cases, the Code stipulates that communications “should be restricted to information that is effectively aggregated and anonymised”. If corporates have a clear understanding of how counterparties are required to reply to these types of questions under the Code, they may well ask different types of questions – so the Code can play a role in reducing the risks for both parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Execution.</h5>
<p>Where execution is concerned, the Code also stipulates that market participants acting as clients should exercise a good level of scrutiny when evaluating the types of service offered by their liquidity providers. This may mean putting in place suitable analysis tools and being aware of providers’ responsibilities. The Code likewise encourages a high level of STP and may prompt participants to move from manual to electronic methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Transparency.</h5>
<p>We believe that greater awareness among all market participants will raise transparency on both sides of the market. Supporting higher levels of visibility, Refinitiv has recently launched Trade Performance Analytics for FXall users, which enables FX traders to evaluate the quality of their trade execution and understand how their liquidity providers are performing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Alongside these benefits, it is likely that corporates will increasingly pay attention to whether their counterparties have signed up to the Code, and may ultimately begin selecting liquidity providers on this basis. A bank which has adhered to the Code has signalled that they are actively working to adopt these principles and avoid reputational risks. The steps they have taken will include educating their people about the principles and adjusting their back office procedures to reduce operational errors.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-started"">Getting started</h3>
<p>For corporates, it’s important to understand that signing up to the Code is not expected to involve significant changes. The main focus is on having the tools and awareness needed to adopt the principles, rather than reinventing procedures or transforming infrastructures.</p>
<p>What could this mean in practice? Corporates signing up to the Code may wish to consider moving from manual to electronic trading methods, or moving from a bilateral to a more competitive multilateral approach. They may also wish to review some of the technology in place, albeit to a lesser extent than banks.</p>
<p>As part of this process, treasurers may wish to purchase a system that allows them to judge the quality of the service they are receiving – which is good practice in any case. Above all, the goal is to digest the principles, provide the relevant knowledge to people in the treasury department, inform counterparties that they are aware of the Code – and raise the bar when it comes to best execution.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Code offers a welcome opportunity to promote good conduct in the global FX market. It is worth noting that this is not an isolated development: last year also saw the launch of the Global Precious Metals Code and the UK Money Markets Code. Going forward, it is likely that the world of FX – and the wider banking landscape – will continue to place greater importance on conduct.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that the Code has an important role to play in driving a fairer market. While rules can quickly be superseded, principles are less likely to become obsolete or be circumvented. By having a common understanding of good practices, we can build a more transparent industry which can benefit everyone.</p></div>

<p>Whilst many participants in the foreign exchange markets had either commenced their summer vacations, or were certainly preparing to do so, almost 200 people joined a most informative webinar on 1st August to learn more about the new code.</p>
<p>The code is not just about the sell-side, nor is it about past misdeeds. As Neill Penney, MD &amp; Co-head, Trading at Thomson Reuters highlighted, it is about building a better future for the FX markets and comprises 55 principles designed around the following six key pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ethics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management and compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information sharing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmation and settlement processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Download the code: <a href=""http://www.globalfxc.org/docs/fx_global.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">www.globalfxc.org/docs/fx_global.pdf</a></p>
<p>Whilst voluntary, the new code, introduced just over a year ago, now has over 300 market organisations, mainly banks, having signed public statements of commitment. The code is already impacting market practices across the industry. Corporates are now engaging with the code too, as demonstrated by the growing (albeit slowly) number (including Shell) indicating their adherence to the code.</p>
<p>As Frances Hinden, VP Treasury Operations at Shell International Ltd stated, “Some of the code (credit risk, controls) is a good guide to how you should run an FX dealing desk and a valuable checklist. It also emphasises the importance of understanding the relationship with your banks and being clear what you expect – there’s a lot of jargon in the code but using it properly can be vital in getting the service you want. For example, being clear on the difference between agent and principal or understanding how ‘risk transfer’ or ‘pre-hedging’ affect the price you get. You should ask yourself, not “why should I sign?” but “why shouldn’t I sign?”</p>
<p>This is about two groups putting aside current frustrations and low trust to embark on a better future for the FX industry. The code could extend into other financial markets such as fixed income. A term frequently used when describing the code is ‘proportionality’, which means the code shrinks in complexity the simpler treasury operation you have, the number of trades you execute and so on.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that good quality markets don’t just happen, so the new code sets out to encourage a well-conducted, fair, transparent and effective FX environment. Further, public adherence to the code sends a strong signal to your counterparties. Frances says Shell have taken the step to write to all the banks with which it trades FX to inform them that, unless those banks commit to the code by January 2019, they will be removed from Shell’s panel of FX counterparty banks.</p>
<p>Neill concluded: “Memories of the financial crisis will fade. After all, today’s 21 year olds were just ten years old when Northern Rock collapsed. That’s why it’s so important for the industry to work together now to ensure that standards are changed permanently.”</p>
<p>Neill also advised that over 10,000 comments were initially received on the code and, whilst not all were incorporated, all were read. Almost 70% of our audience felt it is important that the corporate treasury community is seen to publicly support the code through adherence.</p>

If each participant was to produce direct bills, this could lead to excessive foreign exchange (FX) trading where individual subsidiaries may be buying and selling the same currencies repeatedly. This can result in high costs in terms of banking fees, float, FX spreads and administration. Netting is one tactic used to control and lower these costs.</p>
<h3 id=""the-driving-force"">The driving force</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, netting allows payments between business units to be made on a net, rather than a gross, basis. Netting entails collating numerous cash flows between a defined set of entities (known as netting participants) and offsetting them against each other. The result: only a single cash flow to or from each participant or the netting centre needs to take place on a periodic basis in order to settle the net of all cash flows. Most netting schemes are only open to companies with the same parent but, in some cases, it may be possible to also allow a corporate to net its third party payments from a non-group company. Common forms of netting include:</p>
<h5>Bilateral netting.</h5>
<p>With bilateral netting, each subsidiary nets its payments with each of the other subsidiaries over an agreed timeframe. At the end of this agreement, the subsidiary participant in deficit within each pair makes a single payment to its counterparty. This single payment agreement removes the risks of a large number of daily payments being made and received between the various subsidiaries. No netting centre is involved and payments still need to be made via the external banking system where fees will be charged.</p>

<h5>Multilateral netting.</h5>
<p>Multilateral netting is a many-to-many scenario where multiple parties may net off their transactions. A single netting centre acts as the counterparty to all of the subsidiaries in the group. In a multilateral netting arrangement, the business units retain their local accounts but each participant needs to hold an account with the netting centre and, if they are a net receiver, the netting centre will credit their local account. If they are to make a payment, they will send the funds to the netting centre. No payments are made within the system except to or from the netting centre.</p>

<h5>Single currency (domestic) netting.</h5>
<p>Netting is at its simplest when it takes place in a single currency. Single currency netting is open to all business units for their payments in a single currency. This will create a benefit of reducing the volume of payments in the organisation.</p>
<h5>Multi-currency netting.</h5>
<p>Multi-currency netting offers additional benefits for organisations that make many foreign currency payments. With this process, all the business units in the netting system send their payment instructions to the netting centre, regardless of the currency they originate in. The netting centre will translate any foreign currency payments into the netting currency. At the end of the netting cycle, the netting centre will make payments to or receive payments from the participants. These payments will be made through the external banking system and will usually be denominated in the operating currencies of the participants.</p>
<h3 id=""the-netting-cycle"">The netting cycle</h3>
<p>The precise operation of a netting cycle varies depending on the entities involved (whether payments to non-group members are included, for example) and the type of software used to manage it. However, the basics of all multilateral cycles are similar and include the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Data to netting centre.</h5>
<p>Participants in the netting system must forward the details of all invoices and payment requests to the netting centre. This is usually completed electronically and by direct entry into a netting system (increasingly so). A cut-off date for submissions will be in place for each cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reconciliation of data.</h5>
<p>All invoices and payments requests are processed by the netting centre’s software and when the netting process is run (normally once a month), someone will investigate discrepancies between what people are offering to pay and what the counterparty is expecting to pay. In some systems, subsidiaries may be able to query data input by other entities within the group to fix the problem without further input from other teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Information from netting centre.</h5>
<p>The netting centre can provide a variety of information to the subsidiaries. This will include the netted balance of each subsidiary’s account at the netting centre, usually available in the subsidiary’s operating currency. Some software allows the subsidiaries to access their balances via a web browser. The netting centre will also provide data that can be input into the subsidiaries’ general ledgers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>End of netting cycle.</h5>
<p>All transactions (credits and debits) will be netted to a single amount for each subsidiary in its chosen operating currency, initiating payments either to its own bank or to the in-house bank, as appropriate. Subsidiaries with negative balances at the netting centre will have to make the payment to the centre. FX rates for all disbursements are typically set by the netting centre (and therefore do not include the spreads likely to be included by banks).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are numerous types of payments that are typically included in the netting process, such as: trade, intercompany funding, debt servicing, investments, hedging or risk management contracts (internal or external), advisory or professional payments, management fees, royalty or licence payments, third-party payments, dividends and surplus or contingency cash requirements. On the other hand, payroll, tax and statutory payments are not usually included.</p>
<h3 id=""associated-costs"">Associated costs</h3>
<p>Implementing a new process will naturally incur certain costs which should be evaluated by the treasurer. These include: accounting and legal issues which can differ in complexity dependent on the location of the subsidiaries; implementations costs, if netting is run in-house, the group treasury will have to set aside management time to implement and train employees on the new system; software purchasing and licensing costs either incurred through an additional function of an existing system or the purchase of dedicated netting software and potential outsourcing costs. Any taxation on inter-company payments and central bank reporting requirements must also be considered, but are not solely linked to the netting process. Netting could actually help inter-company taxation.</p>
<p>In some cases, outsourcing the management of the netting system can work out cheaper, whilst also freeing up the treasurer’s time to focus on other issues. Multilateral netting is one of the core products offered by treasury services providers. If the treasurer does decide to outsource the netting system, it is important to remember that approximately 20% of the workload still stays in-house – processes such as confirming and sending payments. It is often the responsibility of the treasurer to weigh outsourcing up against managing netting systems in-house by implementing a TMS or buying a stand-alone solution that can be integrated into their existing IT set-up.</p>
<p>Depending on the requirements of the treasurer, these two operational options can also overlap. For example, while the corporate manages certain aspects of the netting process, a banking partner could manage the FX settlement process. What’s important to remember, however, is that the quality of inputs influences netting systems and their timeliness. It is therefore imperative to keep a keen eye on the accuracy of the numbers and report large variances or adjustments on a regular basis.</p></div>

<h3 id=""what-are-the-benefits"">What are the benefits?</h3>
<p>If an organisation does a lot of intercompany business, there is little reason why it should not be performing netting today – the benefits are many. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced administrative work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced errors due to payment matching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Known payment date and better payment discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment simplification for subsidiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced payment costs and interest payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banking consolidation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedging efficiencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced float.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""current-state-of-play"">Current state of play</h3>
<p>While the adoption of netting amongst the corporate community is far from across the board, it is a process that has been slowly developing. Netting is a simple yet effective proposition where the benefits are clear, particularly for MNCs that have a high volume of intercompany invoicing and cross-border, cross-currency transactions. Individual business units will not need to operate overdrafts or maintain idle balances to meet their short-term payment requirements. Moreover, subsidiaries can transact solely in their own operating currencies and FX exposure is no longer tracked at the subsidiary level. The netting cycle means treasurers know the specific date that they are exposed to FX risk, allowing them to hedge efficiently and effectively as it reduces timing gaps in their hedging programme.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>In addition, each subsidiary in the netting centre knows when it is going to get paid for any intercompany invoices it has issued. This brings visibility and stability to the timing of cash flows within the organisation, as well as improved forecasting. However, there remains a few variables that need to be tackled, particularly the regulatory hurdle in some jurisdictions – Thailand, for instance, allows netting but only with restrictions in place. In Indonesia permission from the central bank is required and the Philippines places notably heavy restrictions on the process. This means that benefits are being missed as some corporates, typically smaller local companies, are still doing things ‘the old way’.</p>
<p>As a general rule, currency restrictions largely determine netting regulations. Countries with exchange controls on their local currency usually have netting restrictions too. In Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, for instance, corporates cannot net in local currencies, they have to be converted to US dollars or euros to be remitted. Although these issues are not insurmountable and other countries in the region – Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, for instance – allow netting, restrictions will be a factor for not including some countries in the netting system.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>XML is so much more than the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), argues Dieter Stynen, Head of Cash Management Corporates (CMC), Western Europe, and Head of Global Transaction Banking Belgium, Deutsche Bank. Corporates need to look beyond SEPA-compliance and use XML as a way to make treasury operations smoother and more efficient across their global operations.</p>
<div class=""biography right vcard"">

<h5 class=""title"">Head of Cash Management Corporates (CMC), Western Europe and Head of Global Transaction Banking, Belgium</h5>
<img alt=""Deutsche Bank"" class=""logo org"" height=""20"" src=""/i/logo/deutsche-bank-logo-2012-133x20.png"" width=""133""/>
<p>While his first experience was in the chemicals sector, Stynen started his career in banking in 1996 with the Bank of New York Mellon as a Customer Service Officer for global custody clients. He joined Deutsche Bank in 1998 as a Cash Management Sales Advisor in the local Benelux/France sales team. After four years, he moved into the treasury solutions team and was made head of the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region in 2009. In July 2012, Stynen was appointed Head of Sales for Corporate Cash Management (CMC) for Western Europe. He holds a Masters degree in Applied Economics from the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and an MBA from the Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, US.</p>
</div>
<p>When the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) instruments were first introduced, in January 2008 for SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs) and November 2009 for SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs), the governing bodies – the European Payments Council (EPC) and European Commission (EC) – needed a uniform message format across all SEPA zone markets. They chose eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to replace domestic formats for automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, payments, collections and direct debits. Adopting XML as a standard was a crucial component in the migration to SEPA.</p>
<p>However, when the XML specifics were submitted to the banks and software vendors for integration into their products, each one began customising the format and several different XML versions appeared in the marketplace. This obviously goes against the basic premise of SEPA, which is to transact in a uniform and harmonised way across all the countries in the SEPA zone.</p>
<p>In response, various transaction banks, software vendors, corporates, SWIFT and other industry organisations came together to agree on a common XML standard, which is the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 20022. This means that if one corporate works with a specific bank and enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and another corporate works with a different bank and ERP system, they can both use the same XML format, instead of going through a tedious migration exercise and customising XML for each of these relationships.</p>
<p>This is also how the Common Global Implementation (CGI) initiative came into being in October 2009, when SWIFT hosted a meeting with various stakeholders in order to “simplify implementation for corporate users and, thereby, to promote wider acceptance of ISO 20022 as the common XML standard used between corporates and banks”.</p>
<p>The industry’s commitment to have one truly uniform format is what makes XML different from previous global standards, such as EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport) and SAP’s proprietary format IDoc, both of which come in many different flavours.</p>
<p>Today the ISO 20022 standards have been published and every bank can decide whether it will offer XML to its clients – however, it is not mandatory. The vast majority of the bigger transaction banks and ERP vendors are offering the format, following ISO standards, and the bigger corporate clients are demanding it – many are bringing together in the same room their top global banks to ensure that the format is the same across the different banks.</p>
<p>As a result, the XML format is becoming increasingly standardised at the global transaction bank level. However, the smaller domestic banks are not as far advanced in adoption levels. This may be because domestic banks view SEPA more as a costly compliance project than a revenue generator; they just do not have the critical volumes needed to justify investing in every feature of SEPA. Conversely, the global transaction banks, such as Deutsche Bank, can see the benefits and will be able to attract additional transaction volumes, so it is a win-win situation for us.</p>
<h3 id=""benefits-of-xml"">Benefits of XML</h3>
<p>Many corporates look at SEPA solely as a compliance project, as something that they are being forced to do. But it is a catalyst for transforming treasury, and XML can be leveraged for transactions beyond the scope of SEPA. As a leading transaction bank, Deutsche Bank can help corporates realise the full benefits. No longer do corporates have to grapple with multiple domestic formats – they can use XML for all their transactions across the globe. Corporates need to look beyond the compliance part of the project and use XML as a way to leverage SEPA to make treasury operations smoother and more efficient.</p>
<p>In addition to improving efficiency, adopting XML will also save corporates’ time, resources and money, as they will avoid having to keep up with multiple format changes in many different jurisdictions. Many corporates view this as a continuous change programme – today they are updating the format for Belgium, tomorrow they will change it for the Ukraine, etc. By working with the same format in all countries, a corporate’s maintenance cost will significantly go down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, XML makes the whole implementation process much easier, less time consuming and less resource intensive by standardising the information needed for each transaction type. This reduces implementation and development time: previously if a company was expanding into new countries, it had to test and developed several formats; now it only has to develop and test one format for the entire range of countries involved in the process.</p>

<h5 class=""title"">Financing and Treasury Department – Head of Project and Organisation</h5>
<img alt=""LVMH – Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton"" class=""logo org"" height=""24"" src=""/i/logo/lvmh-logo-2013-140x24.png"" width=""140""/>
</div>
<h5>When did the LVMH – Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton group start planning its migration to XML, and which particular challenges were top of mind?</h5>
<p>We first thought about implementing a group platform for bank communication in early 2010. This idea was driven by the planned closure of ETEBAC – the French bank-corporate data communications network developed in the 1980s – and the possibility to use only one format (ISO 20022 XML) together with SWIFTNet for exchanging financial instructions with most of the banks worldwide. In addition, by using the XML format we could tackle SEPA at the same time.</p>
<p>Bank communication is a complex issue, so this was a massive change for many French corporates, particularly for a major group like LVMH with a portfolio of over 60 prestigious subsidiaries, each with its own communications solution. But we also realised that building a bank communication platform for the group was a great opportunity to rationalise LVMH’s bank partners per country, improve cash visibility and establish high standard security norms across the group.</p>
<p>In March 2010, most of the group’s treasurers met to discuss this topic and decided to build and on-board a global communications solution based on SWIFT and XML. Despite each of our brands operating independently – they are not dependent on LVMH and therefore could have opted out of a global solution – securing buy-in was not difficult. We were one of the first adopters of SWIFT back in 2007, which made it a ‘pressure-free’ decision, and there are obvious treasury benefits to be gained from a global solution. For example, some of our brands – such as Louis Vuitton – are present in more than 80 countries, and any platform that can allow them to increase cash visibility and security over all affiliates can only be a plus.</p>
<p>When the solution first went live, it was only used by the holdings. The on-boarding of affiliates was a real breakthrough in the process. The main challenge that we faced was the establishment of an organisation able to support all our affiliates as they behave independently and have their own systems.</p>
<h5>What benefits will XML provide LVMH outside the scope of SEPA?</h5>
<p>For us moving to XML goes beyond the migration to SEPA. We consider SEPA to be the catalyst rather than the driving force for XML. SEPA has had a clear impact on European banks, focusing their energy on rolling out XML capabilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, XML itself goes well beyond SEPA. SEPA migration alone will be responsible for around 70%-80% of bank flows for European companies, but XML can be used for all payments/collections and countries outside Europe. When you think of the number of different local payment formats – there are over 100 in Europe alone – the ability to deal with just one is ideal from an ERP perspective.</p>
<p>Using XML means we can standardise and dematerialise our transactions, which is more efficient and cost effective. Dematerialisation through the richness of XML is a great opportunity to eliminate the last paper-based transactions, which the local formats could not support. That is why we did not offer our affiliates the option to convert their local format into XML.</p>
<h5>What were the specific operational challenges associated with XML migration? And how were the difficulties managed?</h5>
<p>The issue of generating IBANs and Bank Identifier Codes (BICs) is often cited as a challenge, but this wasn’t the case for us as we put the necessary tools in place using SWIFT repositories. The key challenge for us was the issue of bank discrepancies and dealing with local means of payments.</p>
<p>Uniformity between banks is a real challenge with respect to XML, especially in London and Hong Kong. We spent a lot of time with our banks in an effort to convince them to use the format in the same way – particularly with respect to the use of Japanese and Chinese characters and bank cheques. Banks need to work in the same way, and we had – and still have – to really push for the required uniformity.</p>
<h5>Did XML migration differ between Europe and the US? How did you time the transition and manage both internally and with external providers?</h5>
<p>The first implementation in the US was done on the 1<sup>st</sup> January 2012, by which time the major US banks were already familiar with SWIFTNet and XML. The US and Europe migration were quite similar, with a few exceptions such as the routing code in the US to perform ACH or cheques, which are still very strong in the US.</p>
<p>LVMH is a decentralised group, so our affiliates are responsible for managing their own processes. Timing was dictated by individual affiliate requirements, as long as the group had declared their banking partners ready for implementation.</p>
<p>Our XML migration process is worldwide and we’re now ready in 40 countries – the US, Canada, most of Europe and key markets in Asia.</p>
<h5>At which stages throughout the process were bank guidance and/or technical support required?</h5>
<p>Initially, we experienced a real of lack of expertise – and consistency – when it came to XML. In some countries, it had to be pushed; in others, we had to go to great effort to ensure consistency among banks.</p>
<p>As a result of this process, we have rationalised the number of partner banks we work with, which has also increased efficiency and lowered costs.</p>
<h5>What challenges remain with respect to SEPA compliance, and how are you going about addressing them?</h5>
<p>We are in a good position with SCTs, but SDD remains a challenge, although it isn’t too great a concern as it’s not a core business for us. We are working on building mandate management solutions and our efforts should be well underway by October.</p>
<p>Looking at the market’s adoption rate, February 2014 would seem to be an ambitious deadline for SDDs. Banks will be faced with a massive increase in migration projects as the end-date gets closer and that could be an additional concern. In any case, we will do our best to reach the deadline.</p>
<h5>Looking to the future, how do the efficiency gains presented by SEPA fit into your future treasury management strategy?</h5>
<p>I would enlarge the case to XML, although SEPA has played a major role in Europe to mobilise the banks. Lowering costs, increasing efficiency and heightening security are universal treasury objectives. The use of XML and SWIFT presents a key opportunity for all treasurers: XML means you only have to use one format; while SWIFT – when integrated into an ERP system – can improve straight through processing (STP) by helping to ensure that the information sent to banks is correct.</p>
<p>An extra bonus is the ability to streamline our bank relationships. Identifying key partners – reliable partners are vital given what’s going on in Europe – has enabled us to concentrate our flows and create uniformity, which is a huge help to our cash management processes.</p>
<p>Greater visibility, improved communication, increased efficiency (the result of a single payments format (XML) and subsequent dematerialisation), lower costs and access to a worldwide depositary (via SWIFT), are the cornerstones of optimal treasury management. The move to XML together with SWIFT is, for us, a milestone in this process.</p>
</div>
<h3 id=""xml-harmonisation-beyond-the-scope-of-sepa"">XML harmonisation beyond the scope of SEPA</h3>
<p>Although the ISO standards are in place today, they have solely focused on SEPA instruments – SCT and SDD – to date. Therefore for those payment and collection instruments a uniform standard, XML version 3, has been agreed upon.</p>
<p>For transactions outside of the scope of SEPA, which are also in the XML format, there is much less uniformity – and the possibility remains that different versions will be developed over the course of time. Some markets have also developed dialects of XML in order to cater to local needs. Again, it is more likely that domestically-focused banks will look to offer a local dialect of XML if it is easier to implement, but global transaction banks, such as Deutsche Bank, will not do that, because we see greater, and sustainable long-term value in offering a uniform standard across many markets.</p>
<p>This will be an ongoing exercise. There is no doubt further versions of XML will be developed in the future, however we hope the industry can look at XML beyond SEPA compliance as a means for format harmonisation for non-SEPA transactions and markets.</p>
<h3 id=""corporates-still-using-mt940s-for-reporting"">Corporates still using MT940s for reporting</h3>
<p>Today, most companies are working – or have worked – hard on rolling out XML for payment and collection files, but there has been less activity on the reporting side. The reason for this lag is two-fold. Firstly, there is already a uniform standard on the reporting side across most markets and banks – the SWIFT MT940. Companies, therefore, have set up reconciliation in their ERP systems based on MT940 statements, which is working well due to the ease of the reporting process compared to payments or collections.</p>
<p>Secondly, because so much energy has been focused on developing XML for payments and collections, less energy has gone into the reporting process. Although we have had discussions with our clients about how XML reporting statements are far richer, with additional information that MT940 statements cannot provide, they look at the switchover as a second phase within the SEPA project. Today, they are getting ready for SEPA, making sure that their outbound files to banks are SEPA-compliant and that they can migrate on time. Once SEPA is up and running then they can look at additional benefits, such as how to replace their MT940 statements with XML statements. But that will take some time and right now treasurers have their minds firmly focused on SEPA migration.</p>
<h3 id=""migrating-to-sepa-and-xml"">Migrating to SEPA and XML</h3>
<p>In order to help our clients become SEPA-compliant and migrate to XML, last year Deutsche Bank created a SEPA migration guide, which clearly identifies what clients need to do to move to SEPA instruments and outlines XML specifications, such as which fields need to be present and how this can be accomplished.</p>
<p>In addition, the bank has developed an online XML checker. For example, when a client creates a test file in XML, rather than having to send it to a person at the bank to look at the file, test it and send feedback to the client (which could prove to be a time-consuming process), our clients can upload a file onto the online XML checker site and receive immediate feedback as to whether the file is correct, or if not what needs to be changed. Companies can quickly change the file and then upload it again to make sure that it will be successfully processed.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Deutsche Bank published a vendor guide, which includes a list of vendors in the marketplace that can help clients, whether that is on the XML side, or converting local account numbers into International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), or helping with SDD mandate management. This is a great help to our clients, especially those who need outside and third-party assistance in order to be ready for the end date of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014.</p>
<p>If companies haven’t yet started to develop XML capabilities for their SEPA project, they should reach out to a third-party vendor at this stage, given that there are only a few months left to go. Their top priority today should be to ensure that they are ready – and there are a host of third-party providers who are capable of providing support. The good news is that the newest releases of the larger ERP systems have XML already embedded in them, so if a corporate is upgrading its ERP system, it will need relatively little development and testing to go live.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In many ways XML will be game-changer for corporates, because of the efficiency it brings, as the industry moves away from domestic and proprietary formats to one uniform standard. This is a significant development for the global payments market and will make life much easier for companies.</p></div>
