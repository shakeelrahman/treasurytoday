<p>Unprecedented times for sure. The successful companies in this year’s thirteenth Adam Smith Awards were announced on 8th June via a live video broadcast. For obvious reasons, the usual celebratory lunches were unable to take place this year, and so instead the videostream also heralded the beginning of the first ever Adam Smith Awards season. The season will consist of the usual case studies, which follow in this 2020 yearbook, illustrating just how corporate treasury has responded to these challenging times, as it always does. Additionally, a brand-new Adam Smith Awards podcast series is already under way, giving listeners the chance to hear about the award-winning solutions from the creators themselves.</p>
<p>Whilst nominations needed to demonstrate solutions implemented, or in the process of being implemented, from January 2019 to May 2020, the events of the last few months have certainly focused the minds. Several projects specifically respond to the impact of COVID-19 as you will see in this yearbook.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these tremendously difficult times, we received a fantastic 187 nominations spanning 24 countries with Best Cash Management Solution and Harnessing the Power of Technology categories very well supported. These awards continue to be acknowledged as the ultimate benchmark for the corporate treasury profession and competition for these coveted awards was, once again, extremely strong.</p>
<p>Reflecting the times in which we all find ourselves, we introduced a new category: Best Crisis Management Solution. Our inaugural winner, Sasha DeGracia, Director Finance - Treasury Services and her team at Holiday Inn Club Vacations worked tirelessly to mitigate the effects of the pandemic in a rapid, controlled and intelligent manner.</p>
<p>The Best ESG Solution, expanded from the previous Best Sustainable Finance Solution, received many more entries this time round. The winner is JetBlue Airways who has been working over several years to embed ESG design into every aspect of its corporate treasury operations.</p>
<p>Our 2020 individual winners are also worthy of a special mention; Woman of the Year is Deepa Palamuttam, Director, Treasury Cash Operations at Intel, whilst Tian Song, Senior Treasury Manager at Baker Hughes is our Rising Star.</p>
<p>Finally, our most prestigious accolade, Treasury Today’s Top Treasury Team 2020, goes to Amit Singh, SVP Group Treasurer and his team at Takeda Pharmaceuticals based in Tokyo, Dublin and Zurich. A magnificent effort.</p>
<p>The entire team here at Treasury Today Group wish to extend our sincere thanks to all the companies who took part and we offer our congratulations to all our winners and their partners.</p>
<p>The treasury profession has always been resilient, and this year is no different. In an increasingly digital work, it only makes sense that we adapt our processes as well, and celebrate success in any way we can – virtually is just another method of doing so!</p>

<p>When it comes to finding ‘the best of the best’, our 12th year of Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards has exceeded all expectations. In the spirit of sharing this wealth of experience and knowledge, once again we are delighted to present this Yearbook, which includes case studies on every Overall Winner and Highly Commended Winner solution in each of the 24 categories.</p>
<p>The Adam Smith Awards are universally recognised within corporate treasury as the ultimate benchmark. Competition for these coveted awards was, once again, extremely strong. The successful entries had to demonstrate to our judges exceptional best practice, innovation, the quantitative as well as qualitative benefits, collaboration, creativity, teamwork and, of course, that ‘can do’ attitude.</p>
<p>This year we received a record-breaking 244 nominations, representing 30 countries and a wide range of business sizes. A broad cross-section of industry was also evident, with pharmaceutical, engineering, waste management, airline and information technology giants to oil, travel, local government, automotive, e-commerce, logistics, manufacturing and many more sectors represented.</p>
<p>2019 marks another great year to showcase all the tremendous work going on within corporate treasury. The addition of some new award categories this year, including Best Sustainable Finance Solution, Best Fintech Solution and Best Cyber-Security Solution, also served to highlight some new areas of focus. Regional solutions were also enhanced this year with the addition of Best in Class Treasury Solution in Latin America/Caribbean.</p>
<p>Our Best Cash Management Solution and Harnessing the Power of Technology categories were again extremely popular. Furthermore, over half the nominations submitted were global in nature which perhaps goes some way to explaining why so many entered this year for the premier accolade of Treasury Today’s Top Treasury Team.</p>
<p>Our individual award winners are worthy of special mention. Catherine Portman, San Francisco-based Global Head of Treasury at Uber is our 2019 Woman of the Year. Our 2019 Rising Star is Gino Gude, Treasury Manager at Honeywell in Brussels.</p>
<p>What is abundantly clear from this year’s awards is the immense value corporate treasury departments around the globe are continuing to deliver for their companies, shareholders and customers.</p>
<p>The entire team here at Treasury Today wish to extend our sincere thanks to all the companies who took part and we offer our congratulations to all our winners and their partners.</p></div>

<p> 2018 marks the 11<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Treasury Today Adam Smith Awards. As we leave the last decade behind us, it is interesting to review just how far we have come.</p>
<p>The rise of the strategic treasurer has been a key trend over recent years, as you are all challenged to deliver better and more innovative solutions; never has the work we do at Treasury Today in objectively reporting on the trends felt more important.</p>
<p>The landscape has changed so much and the evolution of the solutions that you are all working on and delivering is a true testament to the intellectual strength and innovative thinking that is now powering the top treasury teams globally. It is fantastic to see so many companies and partners evident in the case studies that did not even exist in 2008 when we launched the Adam Smith Awards.</p>
<p>2018 is another great year full of outstanding achievement, showcasing the industry’s very best and brightest. This year’s nominations are fantastic examples of how corporate treasurers are responding to the evolving challenges they face. The programme attracted over 200 submissions from 35 different countries from Bahrain to Brazil, Canada to Cameroon and Kuwait to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – a truly international suite of solutions. What remains crystal clear is the sheer hard work, determination, teamwork, collaboration and innovation which continues to be showcased in the many nominations that were entered.</p>
<p>Some key themes are emerging too. Several entries were again driven by M&amp;A activities, treasury transformation projects involving technology and projects which deliver some impressive funding and foreign exchange as well as Middle East and Africa solutions. The geographic dimensions of the solutions are also worth highlighting, with almost half being global in nature.</p>
<p>Treasury Today wishes to extend our sincere thanks to the many corporates who took part and offer our congratulations to all our winners and their partners.</p></div>

<p>2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the Treasury Today Adam Smith Awards. Everyone at Treasury Today Group is delighted to celebrate this milestone by introducing the 2017 Yearbook containing this year’s winning case studies.</p>
<p>The tenth anniversary of our pioneering awards is a great time to reflect on where we are in our industry today. In June 2008 at our very first Adam Smith Awards Gala Presentation Lunch, none of us could have imagined the seismic shifts in the global geopolitical and economic environment that have since occurred.</p>
<p>Since the global financial crisis and over the past decade the role of treasury as a true strategic partner to the business has been established as you are challenged to deliver better and more innovative solutions. We are proud that an Adam Smith Award is the benchmark of that achievement.</p>
<p>We were truly overwhelmed by the number, diversity and sheer quality of submissions for the 2017 awards programme. Our panel of judges always has a difficult task determining the winners, however this year was particularly challenging. What resonated loudly is that treasury departments around the globe have been working on some genuinely innovative projects over the course of a most challenging 18 months.</p>
<p>With more than 200 entries received from companies spanning 30 countries – including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Hungary, Mexico, Nigeria, the UAE, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine – we can safely say that the Adam Smith Awards are truly global in their reach.</p>
<p>Even with such diversity of submissions, some major themes emerged. Many entries were driven by M&amp;A or spin-off activities and the resultant impact on the treasury function. There were a number of treasury transformation projects, the geographic dimensions evidenced being most impressive with almost half being global in their reach. Treasury structures also took centre stage in many submissions, with virtual accounts, payment factories, in-house banks and POBO/ROBO/COBO structures prominent.</p>
<p>And whilst the focus on cash flow forecasting, risk management and funding remain a top priority, some of the newer developments involving distributed ledger and blockchain technologies are also moving up the agenda.</p>
<p>Treasury Today Group would like to extend our sincere thanks to the many corporates who have taken part in the Adam Smith Awards over the years. We offer our congratulations to all 2017 winners and their partner banks and service providers.</p>
<p>We look forward to celebrating your achievements over the next decade!</p></div>

<p>2016 is the ninth anniversary of Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards and I am delighted to introduce this Yearbook containing this year’s impressive winning case studies. The programme goes from strength to strength and the judges this year faced yet another challenging task in selecting the winners. We received 219 nominations, slightly more than last year, spanning 19 different countries.</p>
<p>A number of the case studies which appear on the following pages will be presented in more detail in our popular Adam Smith Webinar Series which continues later this year and through 2017.</p>
<p>This year’s nominations saw several outstanding entries for the Top Treasury Team accolade, again demonstrating the multifaceted projects you have all been working on. Our Overall Winner and this years’ Top Treasury Team is the Etihad Airways’ treasury team based in Abu Dhabi in the UAE.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular category in which entries were submitted was Best Cash Management Solution with Best Working Capital Management/Accounts Payable/Accounts Receivable Solutions a close second. It is interesting to note that many submissions ticked the One to Watch category which is most encouraging going forward. Another trend worthy of note is the number of entries with references to external consultants being used – again, perhaps indicating the trend to employing external advice and guidance on projects.</p>
<p>Liquidity management projects, short-term investing solutions, payments and collections on behalf of (POBO/COBO) solutions and harnessing technology also feature prominently in the nominations received. It is also interesting to note some of the new technologies being investigated, particularly blockchain as evidenced by the Overall Winner in our One to Watch category this year.</p>
<p>There is some very impressive and innovative financing going on too with a green bond issuance, a Formosa bond offering and I would recommend you take a look at the Judges’ Choice case study which showcases a Diversity and Inclusion Bond Programme.</p>
<p>Fifty-seven percent of all entries received were global in their geographic reach, with many others being pan-regional in their scope.</p>
<p>All of us at Treasury Today wish to acknowledge your hard work, dedication and achievements and we applaud the many applicants who participated. We are already looking forward to our tenth anniversary with much expectation. Thank you.</p></div>

<p>This year marks the eighth anniversary of Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards which are now firmly recognised as the industry benchmark for corporate treasury achievement globally. The programme just goes from strength to strength and the judges this year faced their most challenging task yet, with a truly exceptional calibre and range of nominations received: 210 nominations from 23 different countries.</p>
<p>Looking for solutions that demonstrate the very best industry practice and innovation, the judging process has determined the winning solutions – which are showcased in the following pages as short case studies. You will notice a couple of new categories this year, which reflect the changing market in which we operate, including Best Trade Solution and Best in Class Treasury Solution in Africa. A number of the winning projects and solutions will be presented in more detail in a series of corporate Adam Smith Webinars later this year and into 2016.</p>
<p>We saw a record number of entries for the Top Treasury Team accolade in 2015, again demonstrating the multi-faceted projects you have been working on. However, there can only be one winner, difficult though this is, and this years’ Top Treasury Team goes to Hyundai Capital America based in Irvine, California, US.</p>
<p>The 2015 Adam Smith Award nominations illustrate some interesting trends happening within the industry. For example, from the submissions received, it is clear the use of cloud technology is rapidly gaining ground, a number of companies are deploying eBAM, and there are several impressive and innovative cash pooling structures being implemented.</p>
<p>Judging from the nominations in the Best Financing Solution category, there has also been much activity in the debt capital markets space. Companies have also taken the opportunity to review their financing arrangements with several restructuring their debt maturities and instruments.</p>
<p>The banks and technology vendors continue to respond to treasurers’ needs with some impressive solutions across the entire corporate treasury domain. That said, a number of submissions received this year again demonstrate that some very innovative ‘DIY’ (Do It Yourself) solutions are also being implemented.</p>
<p>All of us at Treasury Today wish to acknowledge your hard work, your achievements and we applaud the many applicants who participated. Thank you.</p></div>

<p>2014 marks the seventh anniversary of Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards which are now recognised as the industry benchmark for corporate treasury achievement globally. The programme goes from strength to strength.</p>
<p>The yearbook summarises the winning and highly commended corporates as short case studies. A number of these will be presented in more detail in a series of corporate Adam Smith Webinars later this year and into 2015.</p>
<p>Each May, our judges convene to undergo the extremely difficult task of examining and shortlisting the many entries and then finalising their decisions. This years’ Top Treasury Team is the Pfizer treasury based in Dublin and New York.</p>
<p>The most popular categories were Best Cash Management, Best Process Re-engineering and Best Working Capital/Financial Supply Chain/Accounts Payable/Accounts Receivables solutions. No doubt a reflection of what has been on the agenda for many of you over the past 12-18 months.</p>
<p>The case studies demonstrate that the responsibilities of treasury continue to expand and almost half of all entries were defined as global in their geographic dimension. Most of the benefits of the projects have accrued as impressive cost savings, productivity gains, process efficiencies and risk mitigation; again illustrating where your priorities lie.</p>
<p>Our judging panel decided to introduce a new category this year – Middle East Regional Award for Best Practice. This recognises the number of entries that we received which address issues specific to this important region. There are some innovative solutions reported in this category.</p></div>
