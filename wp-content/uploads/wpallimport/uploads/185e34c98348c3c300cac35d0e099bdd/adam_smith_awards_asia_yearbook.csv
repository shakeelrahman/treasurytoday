<p>The Adam Smith Awards Asia have been running since 2014 and this year a record-breaking 349 entries were received. This demonstrates the resilience, collaboration, creativity, cooperation, teamwork, innovation, value of relationships and sheer hard work during such unprecedented times for sure.</p>
<p>The successful companies in this year’s Adam Smith Awards Asia programme were announced on October 6th via a live video broadcast. For obvious reasons, the usual celebratory lunch we host in Singapore was unable to take place this year. Instead, the video stream also heralded the start of the first ever Adam Smith Awards Asia season.</p>
<p>The season will consist of the usual case studies, which follow in this 2020 Yearbook, illustrating just how corporate treasury has responded to these challenging times, as it always does. Additionally, a new Adam Smith Awards Asia podcast series is already under way, giving listeners the chance to hear about the award-winning solutions from the creators themselves. Whilst nominations needed to demonstrate solutions implemented, or in the process of being implemented, in 2019/20, the events of the last few months have certainly focused the minds. Several projects specifically respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as you will see in this Yearbook. To recognise this specifically, we introduced a new category this year, Best Crisis Management Solution; the overall winner is Darren Chua, VP Finance at ST Telemedia in Singapore.</p>
<p>These awards continue to be acknowledged as the industry benchmark for the corporate treasury profession and competition for these coveted awards was, once again, extremely strong. The Best ESG Solution, expanded from the previous Best Sustainable Finance Solution, received many more entries this time round. The winner is Selvan Paramasivam, M&amp;A; Analyst at Agrocorp International, who established ESG-linked facility covenants and sustainability metrics which help to provide training for farmers in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Our Judges’ Choice is Ganesh Karuppannan, Chief Financial Officer at Hetero Labs Limited, awarded by our judges for the company’s immediate, effective, and direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.</p>
<p>Our 2020 individual winners are also worthy of a special mention; Woman of the Year is Tricia Ho-Hudson, Group Treasurer at Woolworths Group Limited in Australia, whilst Pulat Yunusmetov, Regional Treasury Manager at Danone, Singapore, is our Rising Star.</p>
<p>Finally, our most prestigious accolade, Treasury Today Asia’s Top Treasury Team 2020, goes to Jayant Parande, President &amp; Global Head – Treasury, IR and TSF, Group Treasurer and the team at Olam International Limited, Singapore. A truly magnificent team effort spanning several key initiatives.</p>
<p>The entire team here at Treasury Today Group wish to extend our sincere thanks to all the companies who took part, and we offer our congratulations to all our winners and their partners.</p>

<p>Across the world, an Adam Smith Award is recognised as the ultimate industry benchmark for corporate treasury best practice. Our range of 2019 award categories is tailored to honour corporates across the Asia Pacific region for their achievements; this year’s record-breaking 300 nominations did not disappoint. Our panel of judges had the exceptionally challenging task once again of selecting the very best solutions in each category with several very hotly contested. This year’s winners are the region’s very best and brightest treasury professionals, demonstrating exceptional innovation, creativity and collaboration across Asia’s corporate treasury arena.</p>
<p>We are delighted to introduce this 2019 Yearbook showcasing all the winning solutions. We hope you find the case studies informative and that they inspire you to submit a nomination next year.</p>
<p>The most popular categories, unsurprisingly, are Best Cash Management Solution, Best Trade/Supply Chain Finance Solution and Harnessing the Power of Technology. Over half of the nominations are single country solutions, emphasising the uniqueness of the region, although 23% are regional solutions and 18% are global. Above all and across all categories, it is the innovative nature of the solutions, best practices, teamwork and sheer determination to succeed which shine through.</p>
<p>Whilst all our Overall and Highly Commended Winners are to be congratulated, we wish to note specifically the treasury team at Agilent Technologies Singapore who were awarded Treasury Today Asia’s Top Treasury Team 2019. The team of 12 manages cash, treasury and risk management activities for the Agilent entities across 29 countries. They have undergone significant transformation at a time of several acquisitions and a systems upgrade in recent years. Their efforts have created a more dynamic and robust treasury team, able to partner with the business to support the company’s expansion strategies and Agilent Technologies Singapore is a most deserving winner of the Top Treasury Team accolade.</p>
<p>Our 2019 Rising Star is Jason Weiguang Han, AVP Regional Liquidity and Banking, APAC at General Electric in Singapore. Since joining GE in 2018 he has already led the way in digitising the company’s treasury processes for the APAC region. Our 2019 Woman of the Year Overall Winner is Rashmi Joshi, Director &amp; CFO at Castrol India. Amongst her many achievements, Rashmi is passionate about empowering women and has mentored and coached many women to take up leadership roles.</p>
<p>All of us at Treasury Today Asia join our 2019 winners and their solution partners in celebrating their achievements and we offer our sincere congratulations to all of you who participated.</p>

<p>The Adam Smith Awards Asia 2018, now in their sixth year, attracted a record-breaking 221 nominations this year. We are absolutely delighted with the continued success of the programme which recognises the very best and brightest treasury teams across the Asia Pacific region. It therefore gives us great pleasure to introduce this 2018 Yearbook, showcasing all the winning solutions in each of the categories available.</p>
<p>Our panel of judges always has the difficult task of selecting the winners; 2018 proved particularly challenging due to the outstanding quality of the entries received. The innovation, determination, teamwork and creativity on show in the solutions being implemented is exceptional. Furthermore, a broad range of companies, in terms of size and industry sector participated, with every major country and territory represented. This included our first entry from Inner Mongolia which is the Judges’ Choice this year, demonstrating the sheer reach of the programme.</p>
<p>The most popular categories were again Best Cash Management Solution, Best Working Capital Management, AP/AR Solution, Harnessing the Power of Technology and Best Trade/Supply Chain Finance Solution. A new category, Harnessing the Power of Emerging Technology was also very well supported, as were Best Treasury Solutions in India and China.</p>
<p>Single country solutions accounted for 48% of entries, regional APAC solutions 29% and global solutions 17%. The remainder were multi-country, but not fully regional, solutions.</p>
<p>The Adam Smith Awards Asia truly are the industry benchmark for corporate treasury achievement. We hope you find the following case studies informative and inspiring and several of these will be presented in more detail as part of our Adam Smith Awards Asia Webinar series in 2019.</p>
<p>Of particular note is the Singapore-based treasury team at Dell – our Treasury Today Asia’s Top Treasury Team Overall Winner. Under Ng Cheng Chang, Head Global Treasury Operations, this team has excelled with its treasury transformation strategy. The team has delivered a variety of projects across three key pillars of operational efficiency, liquidity management and operational controls. This has ensured a successful integration of a newly acquired company into the group and positioned the Dell treasury team as a flagship for the tech industry as well as the wider corporate treasury profession.</p>
<p>All of us at Treasury Today Asia join our 2018 winners and their solution partners in celebrating your achievements and we congratulate all of you who participated. Thank you.</p>

<p>The Adam Smith Awards Asia programme is now in its fifth year and we are delighted to introduce the 2017 Yearbook, showcasing all of 2017’s winning solutions. The awards were introduced into Asia Pacific (APAC) specifically to recognise exceptional corporate achievement in this dynamic region.</p>
<p>Over 200 nominations were submitted in 2017 and our panel of judges had the unenviable task of selecting the very best solutions in each of the categories available. The region’s very best and brightest treasury departments have certainly demonstrated exceptional innovation in Asia’s corporate treasury arena. A broad range of companies in terms of size and industry sector participated, with every major country and territory of the APAC region represented.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular categories in which you submitted your entries were Best Cash Management Solution, Best Working Capital Management, AP/AR Solution, Harnessing the Power of Technology, First Class Relationship Management, Best Trade/Supply Chain Finance Solution and Best Funding Solution. Regional APAC solutions were most prevalent, however submissions were received from several global as well as single/multiple country solution entries and the new category introduced this year, Best Solution in India, was incredibly well supported.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges you face, there are many shining examples that evidence great teamwork, collaboration, ingenuity and innovation, developing industry-leading, best practice solutions to solve a multitude of complex problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You continue to demonstrate remarkable achievements in your treasury departments across the Asia Pacific region. Well done and congratulations to you all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Adam Smith Awards Asia are the industry benchmark for corporate treasury achievement. This Yearbook summarises these achievements as short case studies and we hope you find them informative and inspiring. A number of these will be presented in more detail as part of our Adam Smith Awards Asia Webinar series this year.</p>
<p>Of particular note is our Treasury Today Asia’s Top Treasury Team Overall Winner – Singapore-based Lenovo, led by Damian Glendinning, Global Treasurer and chief architect of the treasury function. This is a treasury project of considerable scale, deploying complex solutions for working capital efficiency with some outstanding benefits.</p>
<p>All of us at Treasury Today Asia join 2017's winners in celebrating their achievements and we congratulate all of those who participated. Thank you.</p></div>

<p>Over the past three years the Adam Smith Awards Asia, supported in 2016 by ANZ, has become firmly established as the ultimate industry benchmark for corporate treasury best practice in the region.</p>
<p>The awards were created to ensure that extraordinary achievement is recognised and celebrated and to challenge corporates across the region to deliver better and more innovative solutions and you have certainly risen to that challenge. </p>
<p>The Adam Smith Awards Asia 2016 attracted an astonishing 203 nominations from 17 different countries and a wide range of companies in terms of size, geographical location and industry sector. Indeed, the nominations we received were quite simply stunning examples of how corporate treasurers across the region are responding to the evolving challenges they face. Our judging panel commented on the calibre of the 2016 nominations and the challenge they faced in selecting the winners. In their view, this was the best set of nominations they have seen to date.</p>
<p>The Overall and Highly Commended Winners showcase the very best and brightest in the industry, and each solution demonstrates a high degree of strategic planning, collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>A particular mention goes to our Top Treasury Team 2016, General Electric, led by Vincent Liu, Asia Treasurer, Managing Director. The work of the General Electric team is truly at the forefront of innovation through the use of market-leading solutions, logical execution and business ownership and highlights the evolving nature of the corporate treasury department within businesses.</p>
<p>Within the pages of this Yearbook, the winning solutions are briefly summarised in short case studies that we hope you will find informative and inspiring. A number of these will be presented in more detail as part of our Adam Smith Awards Webinar series throughout 2017.</p>
<p>Our 2016 award winners have certainly set a high bar and all of us at Treasury Today Asia wish to congratulate you on your hard work, dedication and achievements. We applaud the many applicants who participated in 2016.</p>
<p>We are already looking forward to seeing what 2017 brings with much anticipation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div>

<p>This is the second year of our Adam Smith Awards Asia and we are delighted to have ANZ as our sponsor. These awards were introduced into the Asia Pacific (APAC) region specifically to honour corporates operating in the region for their strategies and achievements and we have not been disappointed.</p>
<p>For many treasurers it has been a tough year. Volatility in the currency markets, a slump in commodity prices, economic uncertainty in emerging markets, political unrest and growing cases of cyber-crime are but a few of the challenges that corporate treasurers across APAC have been managing.</p>
<p>Yet despite this, there are many examples of corporate treasurers rising to these challenges and showing great dedication, ingenuity and innovation, developing industry-leading solutions to solve a multitude of complex problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have witnessed a year of outstanding achievement in treasury departments across the Asia Pacific region. Congratulations to everybody.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Adam Smith Awards Asia have gained a reputation for being the leading treasury awards programme in the region. Typifying the fantastic work undertaken by treasurers this year, we received a record number of submissions from countries across the region. The quality of submissions was simply outstanding which made selecting the winners a very difficult task for our judging panel, as you might expect the decisions were not always unanimous.</p>
<p>Of particular note is our Top Treasury Team Asia overall winner – Flex Group, led by its Asia Treasurer, VP Treasury, Vivian Peng. The team's exceptional approach to collaboration drove them to achieve exceptional results in the organisation's ambitious treasury transformation project. Flex Group took home the highly coveted Top Treasury Team Asia accolade and Vivian was also honoured for her efforts leading the team, receiving the Treasury Today Asia Woman of the Year award.</p>
<p>The following pages summarise the overall winners and highly commended winning corporate submissions in short case studies and we hope you find them informative and inspiring. A number of these will be presented in more detail as part of our Adam Smith Awards Asia Webinar series in 2016.</p>
<p>All of us at Treasury Today Asia would like to recognise your achievements and we applaud all of the many applicants whether award winning or not.</p></div>

<p>Earlier in 2014, we celebrated the seventh year of Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards which are now recognised as the industry benchmark for corporate treasury achievement globally. The programme has gone from strength to strength. As a result, in January, we decided to introduce Adam Smith Awards Asia specifically to honour corporates operating in the Asia Pacific region for their strategies and achievements.</p>
<p>In September, shortly after nominations closed, our judges convened to undergo the extremely challenging task of examining and shortlisting the many entries and then finalising their decisions. This is difficult. As you might expect, the decisions are not always unanimous. Having said that, this was certainly not the case with the Top Treasury Team Asia winner – the treasury team at Bharti Airtel in New Delhi carried agreement from all our judges for their seven pillar treasury transformation project.</p>
<p>The most popular categories were Best Working Capital/Financial Supply Chain/Accounts Payable/Accounts Receivables, Best Cash Management and Best Process Re-engineering solutions, no doubt a reflection of what has been on the agenda for many of you over the past 12-18 months.</p>
<p>Most of the benefits of the projects have accrued as impressive cost savings, productivity gains, process efficiencies and risk mitigation; again illustrating where your priorities lie.</p>
<p>The following pages summarise the Winning and Highly Commended corporates as short case studies and I hope you find them informative and an inspiration. A number of these will be presented in more detail in a series of corporate Adam Smith Awards Asia Webinars in 2015.</p>
<p>All of us at Treasury Today Asia wish to acknowledge your achievements and we applaud each and every one of the many applicants whether you were successful or not.</p></div>
