The power of a good partner,"


<p><em>Having good banking relationships is a fundamental part of maintaining a working treasury – but some relationships are more effective than others when it comes to meeting the company’s needs. We went back to basics to discover what constitutes a good bank relationship, and what can be done about bad ones.</em></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>A less-than-solid bank relationship is risky for both the corporate and the bank. For the bank, a poor relationship not only risks loss of immediate business, but also reputational damage – which can cause loss of future business too. For the corporate, a weak relationship could mean that when the corporate needs it the most, the bank may be less of a resource than expected.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, treasury-bank relationships would be equal. Unfortunately, this isn’t an ideal world and so that’s not always the case. Further, some companies have more negotiating power than others: a corporate with a large cash surplus may have more freedom when choosing banking partners, whereas a small corporate that has no surplus cash may be at something of a disadvantage.</p>
<p>It’s a treasurer’s responsibility to ensure that the banking needs of the business are being met, and that operations run as smoothly as possible. However, this can become particularly difficult when companies have a presence in multiple regulatory geographies, resulting in numerous banking partners and decentralised treasury structures.</p>
<h4 id=""good-communications"">Good communications</h4>
<p>For Setareh Golchin, Senior Treasury Projects and Bank Relationship at Total Oil and Gas, bank relationships should always be tailored to the corporate. “Each has a unique desire. For a bank, it’s about strengthening loyalty to your client, getting to know your client’s particular situation and needs, and adopting to changes in their financial and business needs,” she says.</p>
<p>Golchin says banks should be focused on deepening and growing relationships with their corporate clients. Key to this, she says, is a good relationship manager “who should be familiar with the bank’s products and services in order to be able to introduce the appropriate products to the corporate.”</p>
<p>Etosha Thurman, Head of Sales and Client Engagement at Capital One Treasury Management, believes that communication is key. “An ideal banking relationship involves openness and a willingness to partner together to drive efficiency and transparency in cash and risk management processes, with the goal of supporting business growth and profitability.” Clear and meaningful communication with the right banking partner make this achievable, she says.</p>
<p>Two-way communication is imperative for a good bank relationship. But according to Golchin, the bank should be actively pursuing the corporate, keeping up-to-date with their enquiries and, more importantly, acknowledging questions when they are raised. “It doesn’t add much when you send a query to the bank and it’s not even acknowledged,” she notes. “A corporate can only do so much on their side to try and maintain a good relationship with their bank, but the bank should also be keen on maintaining it.”</p>
<h4 id=""know-the-strengths-and-weaknesses"">Know the strengths and weaknesses</h4>
<p>Understanding what a bank can offer a business is imperative to a good relationship. For example, a bank that is excellent for trade may not have the same strengths when it comes to cash management. PwC’s 2019 Global Treasury Benchmarking Survey found that ‘bank capabilities’ was the most cited criteria for selecting a banking partner, with approximately 76% of respondents choosing it. This is quite a significant jump from the 2017 survey whereby it was approximately 37% and only the sixth most selected option.</p>
<p>“On a basic level, treasurers should look for a bank that will give them access to capital necessary to support their liquidity needs,” says Thurman. However, she adds, treasurers also need to consider the bank’s ability to help drive them towards best in class cash and risk management processes.</p>
<p>Treasurers should therefore be asking themselves, “Does the bank have a roadmap for driving future cash management technologies?” and “Is the bank making meaningful investments in digital treasury solutions that meet current needs and anticipated future expectations?”, in order to choose the right partner.</p>
<h4 id=""expand-your-options"">Expand your options</h4>
<p>For Golchin, the best way to choose the right banking partner is to go through a request for proposal (RFP) process. Through the various RFP decision and implementation stages – project planning, informing RFP participants, pilot phase testing, documentation, account opening and pooling, transfer of services – a corporate can learn and establish which bank is the right one for them to have a relationship with.</p>
<p>“I think one important aspect is the pricing that comes into it, and what pricing the banks can offer,” she says. “This could be a huge competition in most banks and corporates are always looking to save costs.” Golchin continues: “Also very important during an RFP process is that banks should deliver what they promise, and the focus should not just be on winning the RFP as a competition.”</p>
<p>To get a feeling for whether a bank is looking to just win the competition, Golchin says having face-to-face meetings during the process is the best way forward. “You can analyse and judge based on the information you have received – but when you’re in a meeting you can tell if a bank is just in it for the competition to win, or if they’re genuine with their responses.”</p>
<p>Reviewing your bank relationships regularly is necessary to ensure that they are still meeting your needs. However, PwC’s survey found that 48% of respondents reviewed their core bank relationships annually, whilst 27% reviewed them ‘ad-hoc’. When it comes to secondary banks, only 30% reviewed them annually and 47% on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>The survey recommends that “treasurers should conduct systematic, regularly scheduled reviews of their bank relationships,” and that these reviews “should emphasise quantitative elements (eg the estimated wallet shared compared to the financing support received, and the investment made into new technology solutions), and qualitative elements like the level of day-to-day service.”</p>
<h4 id=""automation-of-processes"">Automation of processes</h4>
<p>A fair question to ask about banking relationships could be ‘why do they matter when everything is automated these days?’. And indeed, technology has taken on a significant role in all aspects of treasury. But human relationships do still matter. “Good relationships and automation are two different topics,” argues Golchin. “Corporate clients, firstly, rely on the knowledge, expertise and experience of the relationship manager prior to automating any service.”</p>
<p>Even when some aspects are automated, Golchin notes that human contact is still needed initially. “As much as we’re trying to step away from paper, we still have to fill in forms and file documents. We’ve always had to complete a set of documents and be in touch in person before automating any service,” she explains. For example, any documentation that needs completing and approval cannot easily be done with an automated system. “If everything has to be automated, it loses that human contact, which is just so important,” she adds.</p>
<p>Thurman agrees. “While the industry is moving towards fully automated solutions, the reality is that we are not there yet,” she says. Thurman notes that fintechs are “reigniting innovation” in the treasury and B2B payments space, but she also believes that banks are still leading the race in many areas. “Banks are driving towards comprehensive, optimised treasury management processes that are being built from dialogue and interaction with companies,” she explains. Having a poor banking relationship leaves the corporate at risk of missing out on insight and innovation that banks offer, particularly in an omni-channel, multi-modal environment, she adds.</p>
<h4 id=""hurdles-to-overcome"">Hurdles to overcome</h4>
<p>In Thurman’s experience, the thing that affects a treasurer’s relationship with a bank the most is technological sophistication and the ability to provide insight. “A treasurer should be cognisant of their bank’s technological sophistication,” she says. “A top bank will provide outstanding service to companies at various stages in their treasury technology journey, and assist them in that digital transformation if necessary.” She adds, “While any reputable bank can provide data and services, the right bank will help you glean actionable outcomes from this information.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent survey by The Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), The Business of Treasury 2019, found that technology providers were sixth in the list of external organisations that treasurers engaged with, while financial institutions stayed resoundingly at the top. The report questions whether the latter suggests that treasurers are relying on banks to provide their tech needs, or if they’re simply focused on their day-to-day banking relationships.</p>
<p>For Golchin, it all comes back to communication. “I think banks should always be proactive in exceeding expectations. Failure to notify the client prior to establishing the issue does happen sometimes, and relationships have failed because the corporate has managed to establish what the issue is and let the bank know before the bank has even reached out itself,” she explains.</p>
<p>Some communication issues, such as not responding to emails promptly, or at all, may seem small – but they can soon add up and lead to doubts about the capability of the bank, and how well equipped it is to meet the service demands of the corporate.</p>
<h4 id=""jumping-ship"">Jumping ship</h4>
<p>If a relationship with a bank isn’t working out, the logical thing to do would be to leave the partnership and find a new one. But this is easier said than done. In Golchin’s experience, corporates, and especially medium-large corporates, often have hundreds of accounts, and the process of opening accounts and going through know your customer (KYC) and due diligence checks can take months.</p>
<p>“The transitional period could take anywhere from three to six months, and if it’s a bigger project with a high number of accounts, this could potentially last up to over a year,” she explains. Rather than go through with the lengthy, and sometimes costly, process, she has found that some corporates occasionally just tolerate the bad relationship with the existing bank instead.</p>
<p>This isn’t the norm, of course; nor should it be. “Switching should be easy,” says Thurman. She suggests that if a treasurer believes that a bank cannot meet the company’s needs, they should initiate a conversation with the bank to first see if there is anything additional that could be done. “If you remain unsatisfied, your bank should make it easy to move somewhere else,” she says. “Banks are not interested in hindering their clients’ progress or in penalising them for finding the right solution for their business,” she adds.</p>
<p>Golchin agrees that switching should be easier, noting in particular that the process should not be long-winded. “Account opening processes should be reduced. I think in this day and age, documentation needs to be reduced, the processes need to be improved to at least reducing account opening from, say, a month, down to a week or two weeks,” she explains. Strong relationships are important for both corporates and banks, so it makes sense that both parties should work together to make them as successful as possible.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">The art of communicating</h2>
<p>Communication, by definition, is a two-way process, with every message requiring a sender and receiver. Being a skilled communicator is not natural; it comes with practice. For many treasurers, the extension of the role into the wider business – and the inclusion as a strategic partner – means sharper communication skills are essential.</p>
<p>We’ve all had the experience of getting it wrong, so how can communication be improved? According to web resources such as Mindtools, Entrepreneur Europe and Lifehacker, there are several quite simple steps we can all take to improve our chances of getting our message across in a positive way.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assertiveness not aggression</strong> – assertiveness means having the confidence to say ‘no’ when necessary, yet still helping to maintain relationships on an even keel. Assertiveness, as with all communication skills, comes with practice. Begin by confronting mildly tense situations where you perceive the threat as minimal yet worth tackling. Learn to set reasonable limits and how to say ‘no’. Respect yourself and let go of the guilt of saying no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tackling difficult conversations head-on</strong> – avoiding an issue can allow it to take on a life of its own. When communicating a difficult issue, such as when dealing with a problematic relationship, using a tool such as the Situation – Behaviour – Impact (SBI) model can help focus the conversation and give it a positive direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Face-to-face matters</strong> – written communication channels can fail to soften the blow of difficult messages because they cannot carry non-verbal cues, such as body language or tone of voice, that in-person communication offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preparation is key</strong> – any communication that is intended to have an impact should be subject to proper planning and preparation. Communicators should plan what they are going to say and how they are going to say it. We can’t all be great orators or writers, but we can all take the time to prepare a credible, intelligent, and hopefully compelling message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Everyone is different</strong> – bear in mind that in a globalised business, cross-border trade can mean cross-cultural communication. Don’t make assumptions; learn about your audience. An understanding of the people with whom you wish to communicate may suggest a rethink of your message, tone and approach, timing and even expectations, to avoid mis-communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn to listen</strong> – the key to successful listening is to tune into the speaker’s motivators, values and beliefs. Conversations should be used to learn from others, not as a platform to demonstrate your own intellect.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the years, bank accounts proliferated throughout World Vision International (WVI) due to convenience and necessity, without much thought to an overall cash management strategy. This untenable situation posed potential risk to the organisation in the form of fraud, liquidity, inefficiencies, controls and cost.</p>
<p>To address this problem, WVI Global Treasury started the Bank Rationalisation Project with the goal of reducing the 200+ banks to seven global partner banks and to rationalise 2000+ bank accounts.</p>
<p>Recognising that these changes would be disruptive to our finance operations, we developed an approach that addressed change management with emphasis on collaboration and communications amongst all impacted offices, the global partner banks and global treasury.</p>
<p>To begin, this saw each global partner bank visit our local offices to learn and see how each office was using banking services and listen to the challenges they faced. We named this our ‘due diligence’ process. Through the due diligence process, we learned that most of our bank accounts simply existed to access cash to fund operations and pay vendors. Consolidating these proved an opportunity to create greater efficiencies and safety to staff.</p>
<p>Once the due diligence process was completed, the global partner banks crafted cash management solutions customised to each World Vision office with guidance and broad objectives provided by WVI Global Treasury. The new solutions consolidated all bank accounts in each country to one partner bank and maintained only those bank accounts deemed operationally necessary.</p>
<p>Where applicable, the new cash management solutions provided more efficient payment methods such as electronic, mobile, and prepaid cards in lieu of cash and cheques. The new solutions also included centralising all payments to one office and eliminating the need for separate accounts payable accounts at each project location. The result: World Vision is saving money by making our banking processes more efficient and manageable.</p>
<p>Another important step in the rationalisation project was the use of a three-stage iterative approach in forming the best cash management solution and account structure. The banks provided the new solution to the global treasury team, the regional finance directors, and finally the national finance directors. This process allowed the solution to be vetted multiple times to meet project objectives and operational requirements and include all stakeholders in the process. By including as many parties in the decision-making process as possible, our bank rationalisation solution is a team effort rather than a top-down management approach.</p>
<p>Rationalising banking partners and bank accounts is a time-intensive project. In hindsight the benefits far outweigh the time and energy cost. Efficiency, security for employees, visibility, transparency, cost savings, and improved account management are just some of World Vision’s successes realised through our bank rationalisation project.</p>

<p>Globally active corporates often have a high number of bank accounts which are held with a variety of banking partners around the world. This creates complexity in their banking landscape, an increase in the amount of paid banking fees and cash management inefficiencies such as trapped cash on stand-alone bank accounts. So how can corporates rationalise their banking landscape?</p>
<p>While historically a corporate could have a few or even one single ‘house bank’ that would take care of all its regional and/or global banking requirements, from a counterparty risk and diversification point of view this is no longer acceptable. Wallet distribution is a frequently used methodology for evaluating multiple banking partners. In this methodology, the amount of corporate banking business assigned to a banking partner (measured in both direct and indirect banking fees) is compared against the provided credit commitment of that banking partner. This allows corporates to evaluate if each banking partner’s reward is in balance with the commitments and to compare the relative performance of different banking partners.</p>
<p>The wallet distribution methodology can provide a corporate with valuable insight into the revenue expectations of its banking partners and bring objective arguments to the table during discussions. It is however important not to limit the discussion to this ‘revenue versus credit commitment’ trade-off. A banking partner can underperform in terms of wallet distribution, but can provide complementary value-adding services or have a high level of overall satisfaction. Overall, corporates should make sure their banking partners understand where they fit into the general treasury strategy.</p>
<p>Following the wallet distribution methodology, a corporate ends up building mutually beneficial relationships with its core banking partners who are committed for the long-term and rewarded accordingly. On the other hand, one needs to remain bank-agnostic to maintain flexibility in case there is a need for a change in banking partner. Many corporates have implemented bank-independent connectivity via SWIFT which improve the visibility compared to multiple, proprietary bank interfaces. Remaining bank-agnostic will mean a change in banking partner can be implemented more quickly, and more importantly can also be a catalyst to harmonise internal banking processes. For instance, the use of a central payment platform will allow standardised payment processes and further efficiencies.</p>
<p>Recently banks have also been offering virtual account solutions. Multiple virtual accounts are linked to one ‘real’ bank account and help to reduce the number of external bank accounts held. A corporate can have one real bank account per currency with an unlimited number of virtual accounts linked to them, significantly reducing the complexity in the banking landscape and facilitating the centralisation of receipts and accounts receivables reconciliation processes. Since cash is concentrated on a limited number of bank accounts, this will also have a positive impact on cash and liquidity management.</p>
<p>A corporate’s banking landscape will also be impacted by changes in the regulatory environment. The Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) or the Open Banking initiative in the UK will oblige banks to provide access, with consent of the corporate, for third parties to extract statement information and initiate payments. This will create a stimulus for the offering of bank agnostic applications which can consolidate the information of all bank accounts via the use of application programming interfaces. This will enable new entrants to offer innovative, value-adding services which challenge the traditional bank services.</p>

<p>There is not a one-size fits all approach to rationalising bank accounts. The number, location, type and funding structure of bank accounts can vary widely across companies, even companies that are in the same industry and regions. In the lifecycle of many treasury organisations, the natural growth, acquisition and other factors tend to lead to a bloat in the number of accounts used to conduct the business. Among the myriad of strategies for rationalising a particular bank account structure, we will focus on rationalising the expense of maintaining those accounts.</p>
<p>Every bank account that a company maintains represents a cost. Often, those costs can be greatly reduced by eliminating accounts and not only rationalising the existence of each account, but also rationalising the services that are being used. While a significant reduction in the number of accounts will certainly reduce the fees associated with cash management operations, we often find even greater savings by rationalising the types of services used within accounts to effectively manage cash.</p>
<p>In order to perform a service rationalisation on our cash management accounts, we require some new treasury abilities. We need to establish visibility into our true costs of managing our accounts and performing cash management transactions. To achieve visibility, we first must gain accessibility to the bank fees we are being charged. One of the reasons that visibility into bank accounts and their costs is so difficult is that many banks have simply not reported the details of the charges levied. This has led to significant expenses to the treasury bottom line with no way to validate the accuracy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the global banking industry has developed a solution that allows any bank in any part of the world to accurately report the monthly accrual of bank service usage and charges. The ISO 20022 file format known as the Bank Service Billing (BSB) standard can be used by any bank, anywhere in the world to report the monthly aggregated balances, service usage, pricing and charges for any account to any client.</p>
<p>Through the use of the BSB or other industry standard reporting formats, banks are able to help their clients close gaps in both the rationalisation of the cash management services they are using as well as maintaining control over their entire inventory of accounts by automatically identifying new accounts opened. It is the automated visibility into our accounts that the BSB file gives us that can help us solve the account rationalisation problem once and for all.</p>
<p>By monitoring the whole inventory of accounts in real time, we can eliminate the sporadic need for a review project every year or two. Even in the most decentralised treasury operation, the near global availability of the BSB file format offers us the opportunity to rethink the entire need for account rationalisation. Automated BSB review gives us visibility into the cost, the usefulness and the rationale for every account in our inventory and they are now available from banks in many countries around the globe.</p>

<p><em>As companies work to grow their businesses, many turn their attention to opportunities overseas. However, international expansion is not without its challenges – particularly where corporate treasury is concerned. While companies need to put appropriate banking structures in place in order to operate in new markets, the company’s existing banks will not necessarily operate in the required countries.

<p>Finding suitable banking partners can be a challenging and time-consuming process – and the difficulties do not end once a bank has been selected. In the current regulatory climate, the onboarding process can take considerable time and effort, both in terms of meeting legal regulations and putting the technical connectivity in place. As such, there is a growing need for solutions which can streamline these processes and support companies as they move into new markets.</p>
<h3 id=""bank-connectivity-challenges"">Bank connectivity challenges</h3>
<p>Corporates need to consider many different factors when choosing a new banking partner, from a bank’s offerings and services to its fee structure and risk rating. Identifying the right partner is an exercise which may take many weeks, particularly when the company does not have prior experience of the market in question. In some cases, companies will seek support from consultancy companies – but inevitably the selection process is cumbersome.</p>
<p>Once the company has selected a bank, the next step is to begin the legal onboarding process, including Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance. With banks facing increasingly rigorous regulatory demands, this has become a complex and time-consuming process.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard from a corporate treasurer who wanted to open an account with a bank in Austria,” says Sebastian Niemeyer, Head of BELLIN GTB Services at treasury software and services provider BELLIN. “After six months, the company has still not fulfilled the KYC process because no one really knows exactly what they need to provide.” Compounding the challenge, the KYC process can vary considerably depending on a number of factors. “The experience in the market is quite different from bank to bank, from corporate to corporate and from country to country,” says Niemeyer, noting that even within a single global bank, KYC requirements can differ from country to country.</p>
<p>As Niemeyer points out, banks’ KYC requirements are evolving over time, so even once all of the requirements have been fulfilled, further documents may be requested a couple of months later. As such, the more international a company’s footprint, the more complex the challenges become.</p>
<h4 id=""technical-considerations"">Technical considerations</h4>
<p>A further challenge is that of establishing the technical connection between the company and its chosen bank. A number of options are available when it comes to connecting to banks. Companies which need to connect to multiple banks at a global scale may opt for SWIFT for Corporates, while other banks may choose to build a single window to each of their banks by setting up a host-to-host connection. Other connectivity options include EBICS, a domestic standard in Germany and one which is being introduced in other countries such as Austria, Switzerland and France – although the ‘flavour’ of EBICS does vary from country to country.</p>
<p>In other cases, companies will opt to use different banks’ e-banking solutions, although this is not without its challenges. “You have a lot of different tokens that you have to use to identify yourself and release payments, so this may not be the way to go if you are banking in 30 or 40 countries,” says Niemeyer.</p>
<h3 id=""a-new-approach"">A new approach</h3>
<p>With so many challenges involved in the bank selection and onboarding processes, the market is ripe for solutions to help treasurers set up new bank relationships in a more streamlined way. One notable development is the new virtual network bank concept developed by BELLIN. By incorporating a virtual network of banks, the solution enables BELLIN’s customers to identify suitable banking partners and set up relationships with participating banks in a streamlined and standardised way.</p>
<p>“We are expanding our network of local champions, which will include the financial institutions that are leading the market locally in different countries,” explains Niemeyer. “We will reach agreement with them on the services to be offered, the points of contact within the bank, the processes involved in KYC and the technical onboarding arrangements. The idea is to make it as easy as possible for our corporates to open an account with those financial institutions, while facilitating all the different processes involved in onboarding.”</p>
<p>How will this work in practice? Niemeyer explains that banks will be able to join the network in order to offer their reach and experience in particular countries to BELLIN’s customers, while providing full transparency and predictability over the cost of services. BELLIN will also work with participating banks to achieve clarity over the processes involved in opening an account, as well as establishing the technical connectivity between bank and corporate.</p>
<p>“Once a corporate says they would like to open an account in a particular country, they just need to choose a bank from the list which is already a member of the virtual network bank initiative,” says Niemeyer. “The corporate will know what to expect and we will facilitate the whole process because we will know who to talk to at the bank and will have the contractual framework at our fingertips. The charges will be transparent and known up front. There will also be a standardised contract. This will greatly ease the process of finding the right banks and opening an account.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-benefits"">The benefits</h3>
<p>The unique model being developed offers considerable benefits both for banks and for their corporate customers. For one thing, the concept will unlock a customer base which some banks may not currently be able to access. “There are a number of corporates that due to their size, local footprint and internal process may be limited to working with global transaction banks,” says Niemeyer. “In many cases, strong local banks may not have the opportunity to establish a bank relationship with these corporates due to the complexity of choosing a specific bank for each country and opening an account.”</p>
<p>As such, Niemeyer says that the virtual network bank concept will enable these banks to make contact with corporates that may not previously have been on their radar. “As we have more than 400 clients, ranging from large scale multinationals to mid-size corporates, I believe that the buying power from the BELLIN community is big enough to attract banks to join this,” he adds.</p>
<p>For corporates, meanwhile, the network will save time, effort and costs. As Niemeyer explains, “With the virtual network concept it will be much cheaper and more efficient to set up banking relationships, compared to spending six to eight months going from bank to bank and undergoing different contractual negotiations.”</p>
<p>Niemeyer believes that this ground-breaking model is different to anything currently offered by other TMS vendors. “Other providers tend to be focusing on the technical implementation and on the ability to have their systems running with the financial institutions – but they do not cover the rest of the process or treat each bank onboarding as a company-specific, custom consulting project, which leads to high costs and long implementation cycles,” he says. “If you look into the whole process of onboarding a bank and establishing connectivity, the technical connectivity is just the tip of the iceberg. So this is quite unique, and as well as being bank and system agnostic, it covers the whole process from A to Z in a highly standardised way. The corporate treasurer can choose a bank from the listed banks which form part of the virtual network bank initiative to be onboarded in no time.”</p>
<h3 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h3>
<p>BELLIN plans to roll the solution out globally in order to attract as many banks as possible to the virtual network, focusing in particular on markets where opening an account is particularly difficult. That said, the solution is already attracting interest from some unexpected quarters.</p>
<p>“We are currently in talks with the first banks about adopting this solution,” says Niemeyer. “Surprisingly, it is not only the small local hidden champions of the banking industry which are interested, but also the large players who don’t want to lose market share.”</p>
<p>As the concept gains momentum, Niemeyer hopes that it will help companies establish treasury processes while alleviating the burdens of the onboarding process. This, in turn, will support companies in conducting international business activities. As Niemeyer concludes, “If you have the ability to spread your business across different banks which are acting locally, you can break the chains and overcome the limitations of bank connectivity today.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>The global financial crisis brought an unprecedented shift in the global transaction banking landscape and an end to the era of the ‘global bank’. For some corporates, this has resulted in the need to find a new banking partner. Here, two treasurers who have recently had to change transaction banks share their experiences.</em></p>
<p>Ten years ago, transaction banking was going through a period of expansion. Banks around the world were extending their footprints and product suites to support the requirements of a wider array more business.</p>
<p>For the corporate treasurer, these were good times. Banks were queuing up to provide services that covered the full gamut of corporate activity, leaving treasurers well positioned to obtain the best solutions at a competitive price.</p>
<p>Today the landscape looks very different. Banks have reversed their expansionist policies, focusing their attention on geographies and products that remain profitable. This has been demonstrated by some of the world’s largest financial institutions pulling out of certain markets and products in both the corporate and retail space in recent years. For the corporate treasurer this has made finding a bank with the necessary product suite and footprint increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Perhaps most challenging, however, is that in this environment nothing is certain. A bank’s strategy can change and treasurers must be prepared for the possibility of losing a key relationship bank – and should have a strategy in place for such an event. Here two corporate treasurers recently impacted by RBS’ decision to withdraw from transaction banking outside of the UK and Ireland – as part of its strategy to create a simpler, stronger and more sustainable bank – share their experiences.</p>


<h3 id=""why-are-banks-retrenching"">Why are banks retrenching?</h3>
<p>“Banks around the world are facing regulatory reforms and capital and profitability pressures in their home markets,” says Jan Bellens, Asia Pacific Banking &amp; Capital Markets Leader and Global Emerging Markets Leader at EY. The result is that banks are looking to unwind investments and re-define what is most important to their future business.</p>
<p>“Compliance, anti-money laundering, know your customer and sanction requirements are further pushing banks operating on a global scale to consider reputational issues when evaluating which business lines, territories and customer groups are core to the business,” Bellens adds.</p>
<p>The macroeconomic environment is also piling pressure onto the banks. “Consequently, fewer international brand banks are now aspiring to be truly global and more are re-evaluating where to continue to operate internationally and why,” concludes Bellens.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""an-unwelcome-surprise"">An unwelcome surprise</h3>
<p>“It is not something that you can ever fully prepare for,” says Han Hoestra, Director Cash Management Europe and Capital Markets at Prologis, when reflecting on the day that he was told by RBS that the bank would be pulling out of European transaction banking. “It was certainly a surprise to the corporate community.”</p>
<p>Like many in the market, the Prologis team had heard the rumblings of change at the UK lender – the company’s sole European cash management bank at the time. In fact, the bank had already exited from some European markets, such as Slovakia and Romania, in the months beforehand. However, it was not anticipated that the bank would exit more major markets. “We had no contingency plan in place for such an event,” Hoestra adds.</p>
<p>Multinational publishing and events company, Informa, was also impacted by the bank’s decision. Again, the company was aware of the issues at the bank, but the decision still came as a surprise. “There was no indication beforehand that the bank would be heading down this path,” notes Charley Edwards, Assistant Treasurer at Informa.</p>
<p>Both organisations had long-standing cash management relationships with RBS – and the bank’s decision was to have a significant impact on their operations.</p>
<h3 id=""initial-impressions"">Initial impressions</h3>
<p>Changing cash management bank can be a complex and onerous undertaking. The impacts of such a move ripple far beyond the treasury department, forcing other areas of the business to make adjustments.</p>
<p>“Having been informed of the decision, our first thoughts were that this was going to be a big job and require a lot of work across the organisation,” notes Edwards. “We weren’t oblivious to the fact that this would dominate our schedule and require us to put many other projects on hold. What was especially frustrating was that initially we couldn’t see much value that it could add – it was just something that we were being forced to do. We also have a fairly new team at Informa, which made the prospect of the task ahead that more daunting.”</p>


<blockquote>While this unexpected change created significant challenges for treasury, it also presented a tremendous opportunity to re-examine the company’s banking relationships and think about what we would like this to look like in the future.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Han Hoestra, Director Cash Management Europe and Capital Markets, Prologis</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the Prologis treasury department, Hoestra and his team were facing their own challenges. This was mainly due to the company having over 1,000 legal entities in 14 countries – all of which had one or two bank accounts, depending on the currencies used. Moreover, the legal structure of the company is not static and bank accounts are frequently opened and closed.</p>
<p>“Aside from having a vast number of accounts, there were lots of nuanced historical exceptions that had developed in our banking arrangements over time,” Hoestra explains. “Switching banks would not be a simple job and we needed to do this as quickly and seamlessly as possible, while maintaining business-as-usual processes for the organisation.”</p>
<h3 id=""identifying-the-opportunities"">Identifying the opportunities</h3>
<p>While the situation presented considerable challenges, treasurers often thrive on turning challenges into opportunities. This was certainly the case at Prologis.</p>
<p>“While this unexpected change created significant challenges for treasury, it also presented a tremendous opportunity to re-examine the company’s banking relationships and think about what we would like this to look like in the future,” says Hoestra. “We quickly began to outline a banking strategy that would help drive greater treasury efficiency.”</p>
<p>The view that this was an opportunity more than a challenge was also adopted at Informa. “Our banking arrangements were quite fragmented, with numerous local cash management structures in place across Europe; it worked but it wasn’t ideal,” says Edwards. She explains that Informa had two options: either to shift accounts to another bank, or to review the existing banking arrangements and build a regional banking strategy that better matched the company’s needs.</p>
<p>The treasury decided on the latter approach and leveraged awareness of the bank’s decision across the company to build support for the project. As Edwards explains: “The public nature of the RBS withdrawal meant that we were able to obtain buy-in for our project because people understood the urgency of the situation. If we were to launch such a big project under any other circumstances I am not sure how easy it would have been to get the same level of support.”</p>
<h3 id=""issuing-an-rfp"">Issuing an RFP</h3>
<p>With a plan in place not only to switch banks but also to drive numerous process efficiencies, it was time for the hard work to begin. For both organisations, this included mapping out their current banking arrangements, deciding what was required from their new partners and reviewing a host of other factors such as banks fees.</p>
<p>A request for proposal (RFP) then had to be drafted outlining these requirements by both organisations (see the <a href=""/2016/11/in-a-decent-proposal-ttb2b"">Back to Basics article</a> for more detail on how to draft an RFP). This was then sent out to a shortlist of banks.</p>
<p>“Five of the seven banks that were issued an RFP could meet our requirements,” says Hoestra. “After scoring their responses, we could not decide between them. We therefore decided that the best way to proceed would be to meet them all in person.” Rather than having the banks visit the Prologis office, Hoestra and his team visited them in order to “get a feel for the bank, rather than simply be pitched to.” Following this process, the banks were scored again and, after some negotiation around pricing, a final selection was made.</p>
<p>A similar process took place at Informa. “Given that we wanted to do more than simply lift and shift banks, we constructed a new RFP that incorporated all the elements of the efficient structure that we wanted to build and issued that to the banks,” says Edwards, adding that the subsequent decision was quite straightforward based on the responses received.</p>
<h3 id=""decisions-decisions"">Decisions, decisions</h3>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, counterparty risk was a significant factor in the final decision for both companies.</p>
<p>“We wanted to use a bank whom we did not have a cash management relationship with in the US to ensure that we have a diverse banking arrangement,” notes Hoestra. “It was therefore decided that Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan would win a 50/50 share our European business given the product suite, footprint and commitment to the market of both banks.”</p>
<p>ING would also hold management accounts in all the countries in which Prologis operates. “A large part of the thinking behind this structure was to enable us to have flexibility,” explains Hoestra. “In today’s banking landscape nothing is certain, so while we hope that our new banks will remain committed to the market, if they do decide to pull out we would be able to switch fairly effortlessly to another bank.”</p>
<p>Informa, while opting for a less complex banking structure, also put counterparty risk at the centre of its decision making process. “We chose BNP Paribas as our core regional cash management bank,” says Edwards. “They best matched our geographical footprint and because Europe is their home market we don’t believe that they will retrench. The other bank in contention was American and we couldn’t be as sure about their future plans. And even if the worst did happen, we have found with the RBS experience that we have sufficient time to move. There was no need to reduce efficacy by using more than one banking provider.”</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Informa’s decision was made independently of the much publicised referral agreement between RBS and BNP Paribas. The arrangement was put in place to provide support to those RBS customer seeking a new bank and was reported to create streamlined migration process. However, Edwards reports that this was not her experience. “There was no difference using the process outlined by the referral agreement, nothing was directly handed over,” she says. “The only impact I saw this having was that it made BNP Paribas very busy as they were dealing with lots of implementations at once.”</p>
<h3 id=""taking-the-time"">Taking the time</h3>
<p>At the time of writing Informa is in the middle of its migration – a process that Edwards says has not been as quick as she would have liked due to numerous factors, including needing to provide a host of new KYC information. “As well as this, we are also having to make sure that all of our customers are aware of the change,” she says. “This process can be quite slow and it is just a case of continuous education.”</p>
<p>Prologis, meanwhile, has completed its migration, but this also took longer than was first anticipated. “We made the move ahead of the market, but there are always unanticipated delays due to KYC and so forth,” Hoestra explains. “My advice to anybody in a similar position would be to make sure that you give yourself enough time to account for these delays without creating any unnecessary risk.”</p>
<p>Edwards likewise advises that extra time should be taken throughout the process. “Make sure that you know how busy the bank you are switching to is and then take a step back and extend your timelines accordingly,” she says. “Also, it would be prudent to talk to peers going through a similar process to hear about their experiences of switching to the banks that you are considering. This can help to build a clear picture of what to expect.”</p>
<h3 id=""looking-to-the-future"">Looking to the future</h3>
<p>Given the pressures on the banking industry at present it would be optimistic to assume that others will not follow the move taken by RBS to withdraw from transaction banking outside of its core markets at some stage. It will therefore be vital for corporate treasurers to keep abreast of what is happening in the banking industry to ensure they are not caught off guard.</p>
<p>Treasurers may wish to maintain constant dialogue with key banking counterparties to get a better idea of their long-term strategies. Treasurers should also be honest and open around their own strategy to ensure that their bankers fully understand what is expected of them and to ensure they can continue to support their operations moving forward.</p>
<p>In the short term treasurers should also expect banks to become increasingly unwilling to accept non-operating deposits and to lower the rate of return. Planning for such changes should now be something that all corporate treasury departments have in place.</p>
<p>To do this Bob Stark, VP of Strategy at Kyriba advises that treasurers be proactive in their approach and begin by understanding their cash balances. “Separating cash balances into operating and non-operating tranches is a must,” he says. Following this, he advises that treasurers speak to banks to understand what is important to them. “Banks care about two time periods: 30 days (for the liquidity coverage ratio requirements) and one year (for the net stable funding ratio). Corporates need to think of these timeframes when planning how to manage their cash,” he adds.</p>
<p>A prudent next step is to improve cash flow forecasting. “The old excuse that I’m cash rich so I don’t need to forecast goes out the window,” notes Stark. “If you are cash rich then you have excess non-operational cash and the banks banks value it differently than before, so it is important to know how much cash you will have on the books at any particular point in time.”</p>
<p>The final step is to consider other investment options. “Money market funds, tri-party repos, separately managed accounts all generally stay within existing investment policies,” says Stark. “In addition, some treasurers will look at more creative options such as collaborating with A/P and procurement to take advantage of higher yielding supplier discounts.”</p>
<p>Whether it is a bank withdrawing from transaction banking, reducing its presence in certain geographies, or simply being unwilling to accept non-operating cash deposits, it is clear that these are challenging times for the corporate treasury. Indeed, when speaking about banking relationships the questions that were typically hypothetical and prefixed with “what if” have now become real issues that have to be dealt with today.</p>

<p>This has been an unprecedented exercise and, once completed, approximately 7,000 customers across 32 countries will have moved to a new bank.</p>
<p>Our focus has been to ensure that we treat all our customers fairly. We have taken steps to ease the transition to new providers, including signing a referral agreement with BNP Paribas and exceeding contractual notice periods.</p>

<p>If your organisation was being served by one of the major European and US banks that have recently withdrawn from certain geographies, this may then call for a review of your banking providers for treasury and transaction banking services.</p>
<p>Tedious as that process may be, there is reassurance that even as (what were previously) international behemoths reassess and redefine their Asia operations, regional and local institutions are scrambling to fill the void left behind and reposition their corporate relationships. For instance, while UK institutions withdrew from South Korea, Asian counterparts including China Everbright Bank, State Bank of India and Bank Negara Indonesia made forays into the same market, focusing predominantly on corporate and trade finance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the inevitability of a more integrated and increasingly barrier-less region with the ASEAN economic integration has already witnessed the creation of pan-regional strategies by DBS, Maybank and CIMB (positioning themselves as pre-eminent Asia/Southeast Asia-based banks). Australian banks ANZ and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as well as the Japanese megabanks have also expanded across the region. Many of these institutions actually have ambitious plans to eventually generate over half of revenues outside their domestic markets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although these banks typically have strong and localised corporate banking relationships, not all possess the size or holistic product and service suite to serve the complete requirements of large corporate customers with far reaching regional operations. What many Asian banks have done, rather than try to be all things to all corporate customers, is to focus on developing their strengths and expertise to deliver best-in-class services in niche areas.</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than consolidate engagements for economies of scale and scope, corporate treasurers might now have to extend relationships beyond their historical one or two primary corporate banks and appoint a broader pool of financial providers. Such a tiered-relationship hierarchy would see top banks that possess broader capabilities perform the majority of services, while smaller peers provide local support or specialised services in territories where the bigger institutions have either withdrawn operations or have never developed strong enough scale and reach.</p>
<p>The other challenge we foresee corporates facing arises from the competitive advantage enjoyed by global banks (vis-à-vis their Asian counterparts) in having standardised data for their risk management and reporting activities. These data infrastructures are already optimised (possibly partly forced, or driven by regulations such as Basel III, Sarbanes Oxley, Dodd Frank) and in turn yield higher data efficiencies which allow for more credibility in pricing, what-if analysis, and other predictive analytics capabilities that are increasingly crucial in transaction banking. And since not all treasury services at regional banks are up to par just yet, corporate treasurers reviewing their financial providers should be prepared to accept some inconsistencies in data quality and fit, services, and pricing across geographies and deal with temporary teething issues before the dust settles.</p>
<p>One of the additional outcomes of re-evaluating banking relationships is that corporate treasurers may now be more open to alternative service offerings from fintechs. While it will take time for these players to go mainstream, many corporates are increasingly open to alternative service providers, are willing to hear them and try them out, for instance within the increasingly competitive domain of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>While Asia corporate banking is going through a phase of transition, corporate treasurers should ultimately be beneficiaries. For every institution that is exiting, several others are keen to step in to fill the potential gaps.</p>

<p>It probably does not come as a surprise to anybody that the concept of the traditional bank is gone. The banking industry is being transformed as it struggles to find avenues for growth, regain trust and rise to the challenge of non-traditional players. Fiscal pressures and rising customer expectations are forcing the banks to make tough choices about which customers and markets to serve. As banks cut costs and adjust to an era of capital constraint, it is very possible that you are no longer a part of their plans. Not that I am suggesting that banks are neglecting their customers; but rather that you may be just one of their competing priorities!</p>
<p>Geographically, we are seeing shifts from global to local banking. National and regional institutions are now more visible where we might not have noticed them before. Banks in the EU have been retreating to their home markets since the crisis and we believe this trend will continue. The once perceived advantages of global banks, such as pricing and coverage, are now less important as regulatory constraints (matching lending with deposits) force the banks to compete on a local basis.</p>
<p>In product terms, where we once tended to give our ancillary business to those banks that extended their balance sheet, the divorce between relationship and credit will mean that selecting banking partners will be driven increasingly by product need and jurisdiction. Similarly, new industry players are emerging, an example being how insurance companies offer products to replicate bid and performance guarantees at a competitive price.</p>
<p>Competitive advantage is now influenced more by technology than a physical network, and customers are being forced to adapt. This also presents an opportunity if we accept that the new world reality features low cost banking providers, with every product having to be profitable on a stand-alone basis. Credit, best practice, innovation, service and product offering might all be found at different institutions. We need to be both more creative and more focused in our choice of partners within our bank group.</p>
<p>In summary, an increasingly constrained banking environment is forcing existing players to focus on the markets and/or the products that best serve their strengths. With fewer players, who exit from domiciles where they are subscale, you will need to look at the applicability of your bank group or syndicate as it relates to your country coverage. Knowing what you need, how to change from what you have and how to design your “go forward” strategy will all become part of a core skill set.</p>

<p>In corporate treasury, we have been conditioned to believe that our business is valuable to our banks. Traditionally, treasurers have had to say “no” to their banking partners more often than “yes” as corporate lenders tried to parlay their participation in a credit facility into more cash management and trading business.</p>
<p>The events of 2009 changed this landscape. The fallout of the credit crisis combined with the effects of Basel III has shifted the way banks evaluate where they do – and do not – want to do business. This can also read “and with whom” they want to do business because some customers may be more profitable than others for a financial institution.</p>
<p>While the massive pullout of RBS from cash management banking has thus far been unique, it would be optimistic to assume that others will not follow suit, in whole or in part. A treasurer, who is also a risk manager these days, must therefore plan for the possibility that their bank’s strategy no longer includes them. The most obvious scenario is within cash management.</p>
<p>For background, Basel III requires banks to hold liquid assets to offset corporate deposits. There are two categories of deposits (operating and non-operating cash), each with different collateral requirements as measured by the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). This model assumes non-operating cash, those deposits that are not required for short term working capital, has a higher probability of leaving the bank in a runoff scenario and therefore the bank most hold more collateral to offset this possibility. In plain terms, this costs the bank more money to hold this type of deposit.</p>
<p>While there will be examples where banks no longer accept your non-operating cash, it is more likely that the bank’s strategy is to lower the rate of return offered. This would be in the form of earnings credits (where applicable) or a lower rate of interest, in some cases dipping into negative returns.</p>
<p>Fortunately, treasures can be proactive by focusing on these three initiatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand your cash balances – separating into operating and non-operating cash is an absolute must.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know what is important to your bank – banks care about two time periods: 30 days (for the LCR) and one year (for the net stable funding ratio or NSFR). Corporates need to think of these timeframes when planning how to manage their cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perfect your cash forecast – the old excuse that I’m cash rich so I don’t need to forecast goes out the window, banks will charge to hold this excess cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider other investments – perfecting your cash forecast will help identify other types of investments with higher yield that can be committed to, given that the improved forecast visibility allows more confident longer-term investing. Money market funds, tri-party repos, separately managed accounts all generally stay within existing investment policies. In addition, some treasurers will look at more creative options such as collaborating with accounts payable and procurement to take advantage of higher yielding supplier discounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Treasurers have been keeping a keen eye on the financial press of late, and for good reason. It seems that not a week goes by without one of the world’s banking institutions announcing either staff cuts, a restructuring, the closure of their business in a certain market or, in some very high-profile cases, a nearly complete exit from certain lines of banking all together.</em></p>
<p>This is perhaps not that surprising; after all, it has been an especially challenging time for banks around the world. In the wake of the global financial crisis, banks have been bailed out by governments, seen credit ratings decline and also been hit with a glut of regulation. Combined, these factors are limiting the ability to act as they once did.</p>
<p>But banks are not only being pressured by the regulators. In recent years, technology has progressed to the stage where non-traditional players can enter the financial industry, offering products and services that can sometimes go above and beyond those offered by established financial institutions. In the retail space, payments and funding are two prime examples of where these fintech firms are having a big impact and disintermediating banks, and there is no reason why this couldn’t happen in the corporate sphere.</p>
<p>Despite all these changes, one statement remains true: corporates need banks, just as much as banks need corporates. A bank remains a critical counterparty to any corporate operation and a key tool in ensuring the business operates smoothly, day-to-day. But the recent changes in the financial services industry has certainly placed a renewed focus on bank relationships and the risk these can pose to the business. And it is very likely that this will only intensify and evolve over the coming years.</p>
<h4 id=""seeing-banks-differently"">Seeing banks differently</h4>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that the global financial crisis changed everything when it comes to the banking sector and how it is perceived by corporate treasurers. As Ricky Thirion, Group Treasurer at Etihad Airways outlines, the biggest change for treasury in the wake of the crisis, has been around how Etihad perceives the safety of its counterparties, especially the banks.</p>
<p>“As you enter into a global crisis, you ask yourself fundamental questions about risks you are facing, especially with financial institutions where it profoundly changed people’s views on credit risk,” he says. “I think for many of us that will, in our lifetimes, be the biggest thing we remember about that time.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the crisis provided a severe wake up call to corporates with regards to the over-reliance that many had on their banks for funding. The larger names, almost instantly, began to diversify their funding strategies and other companies soon followed. This point is highlighted by the below chart taken from the 2016 Allen &amp; Overy Corporate Funding Monitor study. As it clearly depicts, during the years of the crisis, bank lending fell dramatically, whilst bond issuances increased. More recently, however, bank lending has increased, returning to pre-crisis levels in 2015 – at the same time bond issuances have also steadily increased.</p>

</figure>
<p>Yet, Craig Kennedy, Partner at EY, is keen to point out that despite the recent increase in bank led funding this doesn’t mean that there has been a return to the status quo. “Corporates are now obtaining their funding from broader, more diverse sources,” he says. “Moreover, in many cases, funding isn’t provided as traditional loans but rather through alternative products such as supply chain finance.” Indeed, this nuance is highlighted in the study which states: “Companies (in 2015) found they could raise money more cheaply and in more ways than ever before. The new normal that is emerging for corporate funding is a lot more complex than it used to be, but it’s working.”</p>
<h4 id=""evolving-expectations"">Evolving expectations</h4>
<p>However, it is not just funding dynamics that have changed for corporates. The whole spectrum of what corporates expect from their banks and the price that they are willing to pay for this has also altered.</p>
<p>To highlight this, David Kelin, Director, Academy at treasury consulting firm Covarius, outlines how in the days before the crisis the banking sector was largely homogeneous and commoditised, particularly in respect of the global banks and the products and services they offered. Price, therefore, was often the main differentiating factor.</p>
<p>Today, this has changed significantly. “Corporates are using a multitude of different selection criteria that goes much deeper than pricing,” says Kelin. “Banks today are quite different from one another in terms of what they can offer, so corporates are looking to see if the banks can provide suitable credit, if the bank has a sophisticated product suite, if it is committed to certain markets and the business more broadly and so forth.”</p>
<p>Price, of course, remains important, but there is a willingness to pay more should they excel in the areas important to the corporate. “No corporate will say they will pay more to their banking partner, but I have worked with clients recently who have paid more for a service simply because they thought the bank offered much more in other areas, or was the only bank offering that service,” adds Kelin. “This is a complete change from the pre-crisis days.”</p>
<p>Michelle Dovey, former Director of Treasury at Informa, echoes this point: “I think that value is important. For those companies outside of the top tier, it is necessary to conduct a robust cost-benefit analysis to ensure that you are getting the best deal for your money. I wouldn’t necessarily always select the cheapest provider, if I didn’t think their offering could live up to expectations.”</p>
<p>What is it therefore that corporates expect? For Dovey, her key expectation is for the bank to be loyal and look to forge a strong working relationship with her company. Making reference to the changing business plans of banks she says: “I want to work with a bank that will be there for us in the long-term and who understands our business and the direction we are heading in. This is an absolute must in today’s environment.”</p>
<p>Of course, the products and services that the banks offer are also important and Lesley Rogers, Regional Treasury Manager EMEA at AT&amp;T, lists other criteria that must be delivered which include: robust products and offerings, a host to host facility; competitive tariffs and products to help reduce charges; electronic banking capabilities which are secure and have self-administrative offerings; one team for global documentation and customer services that are responsive and act in a timely fashion. Robust digital security has also been noted by treasurers as being an ever important consideration.</p>
<p>Yet, in similar fashion to Dovey, it is a relationship and honest two-way communication that is the key criteria for any bank wanting AT&amp;T’s business.</p>

<h4>Brocade Communication Systems – Scoring your banking partners</h4>
<p class=""management-summary"">Being open and forthright with your banking partners can be challenging if the internal mechanisms for evaluating these are not well developed. Here Brocade outlines how it solved this challenge and derived numerous benefits from creating greater effectiveness around evaluating and communicating with its banking partners.</p>
<p>In the past, the relationships between Brocade and its banking partners were less than optimal. The existing process for bank relationship management was not structured, nor was it comprehensive. In fact, the evaluations on banking partners were mainly produced from fragmented feedback among the treasury staff.</p>
<p>Chris Hanson, Assistant Treasurer, explains: “Brocade was not able to effectively assess overall connections between our banking partners and establish meaningful bank relationships.” As a consequence, the other business units in Brocade could not properly select the right banking partners for their specific needs because they were lacking an accurate assessment on their banks. The following issues needed to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of systematic tracking of corporate banking expenditures vs revenues received from each banking partner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gap between how treasury views their banks and how business owners view their banks.</p>

<h4 id=""the-scorecard-solution"">The scorecard solution</h4>
<p>In 2014, Brocade’s treasury established a bank relationship scorecard – an internal tool to determine strengths and weaknesses of each bank. Within the scorecard, specific cash management services by each banking partner were categorised into groups including bank products and customer services, capital management, administration, pricing, geographical footprint, and banking technology. The treasury staff graded the banks on a sliding scale from one (below expectation) to five (above expectation) and final scores were then calculated. Any time, if a bank rated below satisfactory, detailed reasons were given on a separate summary report. The results were communicated to the banks for follow-ups and improvements. Ultimately, it significantly improved bank services and relationships, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Angie Qian, Senior Treasury Analyst, explains: “we used the tool to communicate with our banks regularly. It helped to objectively communicate positive and negative feedback and supporting documents to our banking partners. Our banks appreciate our candid feedback and re-committed when necessary to improve their services and pricing where possible.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, treasury developed a wallet distribution model to analyse banking expenditures and revenues with each banking partner. The wallet distribution is an effective tool to provide the company insight into the expense and revenue expectations of a specific banking partner. It facilitates quicker decision making around selecting the right partnership for major services such as debt refinancing and stock repurchases. The company is now confident that the decisions made involving banking partners maximise all of their banking relationships.</p>
<h4 id=""relationship-results"">Relationship results</h4>
<p>The treasury team was able to conduct intensive reviews and evaluations of its banking processes because of this holistic banking relationship solution. The successful rollout of the scorecard and wallet distribution was achieved within a short period of time. The solution enabled Brocade to quickly eliminate one of their domestic banking partners and enhance international bank structures, resulting in $300k annual savings in bank fees. It also played a key role in selecting the right banking partner for a cash management optimisation project.</p>
<p>Treasury’s leadership at Brocade in innovating a comprehensive scalable global banking relationship management solution has improved all areas of the organisation. Brocade’s treasury is changing the way the company is thinking about the banking relationships, by getting all areas of the company to work together proactively evaluating and managing their banking partners. “Our goal is to implement a creative and efficient solution that leads to optimal decisions and results for the business,” notes Hanson.</p>

<h4 id=""relationships-or-partnerships"">Relationships or partnerships?</h4>
<p>It is clear that corporates are calling for a relationship with their banking partners, but this is a fairly abstract term with multiple meanings. So, on a granular level, what is it that treasurers are expecting from this relationship?</p>
<p>For Chris Donohoe, Assistant Treasurer, Ingersoll Rand Plc. he is expecting the banks to understand his operations and objectives and work with him to meet these. As he highlighted last year at an industry conference, too often banks are coming to him with off-the-shelf products that don’t really meet the needs of a complex business. “What I’d like to see,” he added, “is banks taking the time to really get to know us.” Donohoe hoped that banks would then be in a better positon to offer a more educational approach when interacting with their clients, enabling treasurers to get the most effective use of a solution.</p>
<p>This point was echoed at the conference by Adam Boukadida, Deputy Treasurer at Etihad Airways, who said: “Banks have to understand our business and become a strategic partner rather than just looking at us as a sales opportunity.” With Etihad operating in more than 75 countries it has a complex business approach; banks must be able to understand the fundamental processes of their clients’ businesses as well as its technical treasury function.</p>
<p>Based on these statements, it seems that corporates are perhaps looking for more than just a relationship and are asking for the bank to be a business partner, almost akin to an extra member of staff in the treasury.</p>
<h4 id=""delivering-on-expectations"">Delivering on expectations</h4>
<p>Indeed, banks are recognising this need and in recent years many have pushed forward their advisory capabilities with similar gusto to their products. But market realities can sometimes curb even the best of intentions and the aforementioned regulatory burden under which the banks are currently operating is, in many cases, limiting their ability to offer the necessary products and services, let alone be a strategic partner to the business. As EY’s Kennedy points out: “Banks are altering the services they provide to their corporate clients. And some are pulling out of certain services and/or areas even when there is significant client demand.”</p>
<p>Kennedy goes on to highlight how, in recent months, he has had conversations with numerous treasurers who have found that no bank is willing to offer them a certain product or support them in a certain area. “This is not because there is something wrong with the corporate client, it is because there is simply nobody providing these services anymore.”</p>


<blockquote>I want to work with a bank that will be there for us in the long-term and who understands our business and the direction we are heading in. This is an absolute must in today’s environment.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Michelle Dovey, former Director of Treasury, Informa</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>This has also been a trend noted by Dovey. “There is less choice for treasurers today,” she says. “Banks are retreating into the same products and markets where they make the most money whilst taking on the least risk.” She provides US private placements as an example of this trend. “Before the crisis, this was purely the domain of the US banks. Now every bank is pushing this product, whilst, on the other hand, there are very few banks now offering European cash management solutions.”</p>
<p>This is, of course, a big issue for corporates. “The treasury and cash management operation is business critical,” says Kelin. “And if a bank pulls out, it creates numerous issues around payments and collections, which the business is dependent on. As a result, even rumours of a bank pulling out puts fear into corporates and may make them take a closer look at their banking group.”</p>
<h4 id=""managing-the-relationship"">Managing the relationship</h4>
<p>Taking a closer look at banking groups is, in fact, something that many corporate treasury departments are currently doing and many are switching. As a study produced earlier this year found, the key challenge for European treasurers in 2016 has been finding a new banking partner.</p>
<p>If you are a corporate treasurer with a stable banking group at present, you may be the envy of your peers. But, this is not a time to rest on your laurels, as shocks do happen. So how best can corporates and banks come together to create a healthy long-term relationship?</p>
<p>For Covarius’ Kelin, the key is communication. “Whilst corporates are demanding that their banks be honest with them, banks are also wanting to have frank and honest discussions with their clients to better understand their strategy. Given the limitations placed on banks at this present time this is important to ensure that they continue to offer the right products and services to each individual client. I don’t think banks are afraid to say ‘we can no longer help you’ anymore.”</p>
<p>Also, being open and honest can have additional benefits. Kelin, for instance, has had numerous conversations with treasurers from middle-market corporates who are looking to work closer with their banking partners, more so than ever before. “In this Basel III world, there is a real risk that banks may not have as keen an appetite to work with some clients,” he says. “Treasurers of these companies want to be proactive in managing the relationship by having a continuous dialogue to ensure the bank will continue to provide them with banking facilities.”</p>
<p>The need to have honest communication with banks is a point also noted by AT&amp;T’s Rogers. “I think a good bank will understand that if they can’t deliver on a specific requirement, the corporate will have to go elsewhere for this, as long as this is correctly communicated.” It works both ways, and Rogers highlights that it is only by telling the bank what you need that they will they be able to ensure they deliver.</p>
<p>Aside from simply talking to your banks, there are other steps that corporate treasury teams can take to maintain a healthy relationship. For EY’s Kennedy, nothing is more effective than a bank rationalisation project. “This sends a clear message of intent to remaining banking partners that there will be a larger wallet to share across a smaller number of relationship banks, on the basis that the bank continues to deliver exceptional service and products to the client.”</p>
<p>Other treasury teams have employed more innovative methods. American multinational, Brocade, for instance, suffered from a poor, unstructured management process with its banking partners that delivered less than adequate results for the treasury department. The company therefore initiated an innovative scorecard project that would allow them to better evaluate their banking partners and improve the relationships (<a href=""#case-study-brocade"">see Brocade case study</a>).</p>
<p>Microsoft is another company that has looked at this area closely after finding out that it met with over 40 banks on a regular basis just for debt capital markets and share buyback work. This equated to four months a year in bank meetings, roughly a third of their working hours. To work out the return on investment (ROI) of all this work, Microsoft have built a solution that enables them to track their bank relationships by recording the time spent working with them and the outcome of these meetings. The bank relationship tracker has delivered many benefits including ensuring that their banking group develop value-add ideas and solutions for the team.</p>

<h4 id=""case-study-kerry-group"">Case study</h4>
<img alt=""Kerry"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/kerry-logo-2015-90x32.png?h=32&amp;w=90&amp;la=en&amp;hash=C1D5D844F4B45C93C6B8EDBAD5C1A871"" style=""width: 90px; height: 32px;""/> 
<h4>Kerry Group – The RFP as a relationships tool</h4>
<p class=""management-summary"">While some treasurers may simply see the RFP as a functional tool that allows the treasury to understand its different options and make an informed decision when implementing a new solution, Trevor Horan, Treasurer, Global Cash &amp; Liquidity at Kerry Group, believes it can be more than this – and, in fact, that it can be an effective relationship management tool.</p>
<p>For Horan, the key to achieving this is to make the RFP process open and transparent. The openness derives from ensuring that the tendering process is open to all banks (something which some may argue is ill-advised given the additional workload this creates for the treasury). For Horan, this is misguided. “I believe that all banks the company has a strong relationship with should be offered the opportunity to win the business. By doing so, we demonstrate that we value their support and the relationship we have. We are also not limiting our options.”</p>
<p>Of course, like all treasurers, Horan does not want to have to sift through endless RFPs. So instead of not inviting banks to take part in the RFP process, Horan has built in a mechanism that reduces the amount of responses the treasury gets to its RFP. “At the start of the RFP document, just after the index, we include a list of key criteria that has to be matched,” he says. “If this criteria cannot be matched then we suggest that the rest of the document is not completed. This is where being transparent about the process prevents the banks from wasting time filling out the document and also reduces our workload when it comes to analysing the responses.”</p>
<p>We also make sure that those involved in the tendering process know who else has been invited, who has made the shortlist and who we are moving the process forward with,” he adds. “By doing this there are no secrets between us and our key counterparties, something that is appreciated by all involved.”</p>
<p>After the RFP process has been carried out each respondent is also given the opportunity of a full de-brief of their proposed solution in due course. “The feedback from banks to this de-brief has been extremely positive, it helps them understand why their solution was not selected and maintains strong relationships, something that is very important to Kerry Group,” says Horan.</p>

<h4 id=""ebbs-and-flows"">Ebbs and flows</h4>
<p>Whilst these strategies may provide corporates with the tools to manage banking relationships as they stand today, there are many changes that continue to happen in the industry. Even some of the most prominent bankers are claiming that the industry will shapeshift and look very different in the years to come. And these are changes that may profoundly impact the relationships corporates have with their banks.</p>
<p>It is technology, and more specifically the rise of fintech, that will pose the biggest threat to banks. Indeed, we have already seen fintech companies picking off the profitable areas of the banks business in the retail space – is the commercial space next?</p>
<p>Anthony Eldridge, Financial Services Leader at PwC Singapore, certainly thinks that this could be a real possibility. “The question is not can technology companies replace banks, it is, do they want to? These companies are very happy to be picking off the profitable areas of financial services but once you become a fully-fledged bank you step into a quagmire of regulation and compliance.”</p>
<p>There may need to be a change in approach, to ensure banks maintain their position. “Banks are often asking the question ‘what can fintech do for us?” says Eldridge. “But I am increasingly of the belief that banks need to be asking what can we do for the fintechs.” In his view, the landscape is changing so quickly and these firms are developing highly sophisticated technology so readily that a situation could exist where banks end up as simply a utility service behind fintech, providing compliance and risk management.</p>
<p>This is certainly an interesting picture being painted, but do corporates also believe this could happen? Views seemed to be mixed. Dovey, for instance, foresees big changes coming. “I do see banks being disintermediated by technology firms in the future,” she says. “Companies like PayPal make it so easy for our customers to make a payment that they force you as a corporate to take that payment method seriously – you don’t have any choice. If a fintech company can win the hearts and minds of the general customer, they are everyone’s customer. Corporates will have to follow.”</p>
<p>AT&amp;T’s Rogers is less convinced, but highlights that there is a need for banks to move quickly to avoid being cut out. “I think the banks realise they have to develop and move quickly to offer products for the future; they need to talk to corporates to understand needs and how the future may change and what requirements are needed,” she says. Again it is the regulatory environment that may create difficulties for banks in this endeavour.</p>
<p>Either way, it seems certain that we are set for more changes in the financial services industry to take place over the coming years and it will continue to be imperative for the treasury department to stay abreast of these to ensure that the company has a banking group that is fit for purpose. For now, clear and honest communication, both ways, will be key to ensuring that this happens.</p>

<h4 id=""the-kyc-challenge"">The KYC challenge</h4>
<p>Recent events have shown that regulators are becoming increasingly serious about KYC. And this is having a detrimental impact on corporates and their banking relationships.</p>
<p>Compliance is a concern for banks, with know your customers (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules for example requiring constant attention. This is having a knock on effect on their corporate customers.</p>
<p>The growing burden was highlighted in a recent global study conducted by Thomson Reuters, who polled 822 decision makers around KYC related matters. The headline finding: 89% of those corporates surveyed have not had a good KYC experience in recent years.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is those corporates with multiple banking relationships who are feeling the most KYC-related strain. The main reason for this being the lack of standards. As a result, banks are asking for differing documents based on their own interpretations of the regulation.</p>
<p>Whilst it is quite understandable that banks are being highly cautious around KYC – as we have seen it is costly to fall foul of the regulators. What is less understandable, from a corporate perspective at least, is that the burden is being added to by the banks own internal shortcomings. To highlight this point, 40% of respondents said that they had to deal with many different people within an individual bank and 34% said they were asked for different documents by different people within that bank.</p>
<p>The result of this being that corporates are spending more time than ever on KYC-related activities, with 63% of respondents saying this has increased over the previous 12 months. 21% of these said it has increased significantly.</p>
<h4 id=""bad-experiences"">Bad experiences</h4>
<p>So what does this all equate to in real terms for Christopher Emslie, Singapore Treasurer and his team at ABB? “As a large corporate with multiple banking relationships we spend a large amount of time on KYC, especially when there are changes to our organisations or our banking relationships,” he says.</p>
<p>The worst experience for ABB was an account opening process that took a staggering nine months (34 days is the typical average time at present). “The issues were on delays from all sides,” he explains. “This biggest was a change in regulations in the banks presiding country which were not communicated effectively.</p>
<p>“A few years ago, I could probably have countered this poor experience with some examples of better ones, but these are very few and far between, even though some banks really do go out of their way to be accommodating they are still bound by their internal rules and things beyond their control.”</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts by the banks, corporates are beginning to vote with their feet when they encounter overly complex and burdensome KYC requirements. “In some instances it is easier to walk away than to try and overcome some of the issues, this is not good business practice but in some instances it is just impossible to comply,” explains Emslie.</p>



","Treasurers have been keeping a keen eye on the financial press of late, and for good reason. It seems that not a week goes by without one of the world’s banking institutions announcing either staff cuts, a restructuring, the closure of their business in a certain market or, in some very high-profile cases, a nearly complete exit from certain lines of banking all together.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/banking/bank-relationships/business-people-meeting-commuter-greeting-handshake-concept-ss-338371244-1920x1080.jpg,2016-09-01,Bank Relationships,False

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Bank account management (BAM) is a key preoccupation for corporates. Opening and closing accounts, and maintaining updated mandates throughout the whole lifecycle is both time consuming and costly, as well as a primary source of risk of error or fraud. It has to be handled in a structured manner to support compliance and audit requirements – particularly in Asia Pacific where local bank relationships are still required which results in a large number of bank accounts, thus increasing BAM-related challenges.</p>
<p>The set-up of treasury centres (TCs) has allowed corporates to have global visibility on their liquidity through the consolidation of all accounts in their web banking or treasury management systems (TMSs).</p>
<p>The next step involves getting control of the end-to-end payments and collections process through a payments and collections factory. This can be achieved through a central ERP, which drives the harmonisation and standardisation of internal processes, associated with a central connectivity solution with all their banks. This set-up allows the TC to monitor the usage of local accounts while the corporate subsidiaries can keep their financial independency. Some corporates create shared service centres (SSCs) to streamline these processes further, starting from the invoice approval stage.</p>
<p>The ultimate control level is the in-house bank (IHB) which holds all accounts and acts on behalf of the other group legal entities. This type of structure requires full intra-company accounting and implies the financial disintermediation of the subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In Asia Pacific, some corporates have established a TC and some have initiated a centralisation process but very few use IHB as most of the countries do not allow ‘on behalf of’ instructions. This leaves open the challenge of BAM.</p>
<p>BAM begins with account opening, which is often considered a cumbersome process by corporates. In order to simplify and facilitate this process, BNP Paribas has harmonised its legal documentation across Asia and designed a web interface, ‘My Accounts’, accessible through its global centric portal, which facilitates the completion of requested forms, sign-ups to transaction banking products as well as guides on the documents to be provided for KYC requirements. This user-friendly solution can be used both by the treasury centre and its affiliates.</p>
<p>BNP Paribas is also addressing the corporate treasurer’s concern on mandate management through electronic bank account management (eBam) solutions adapted to the connectivity solution chosen by the corporate. These solutions are currently being piloted in Europe and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connexis eBam: a module of BNP Paribas international web banking, which allows corporates to request paper mandates changes across countries and download detailed reports for internal audit purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eBam File Transfers: leveraging XML messages newly designed by the Common Global Implementation (CGI) for corporates using SWIFTNet to communicate with all their banks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>eBam can only be achieved with collaboration among the treasury community (corporate, banks, vendors, consultants) for the benefit of all stakeholders. BNP Paribas is very supportive of eBam, bringing its strong expertise in XML formats as well as its long-standing culture of standardisation to the initiative.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In Asia it is not uncommon for companies to have several hundred if not thousands of bank accounts and many different bank relationships. This somewhat unique circumstance presents geographically unique challenges brought about by the number of countries that are in varied states of economic development, each with its own regulations governing the flow of cash across borders, making it difficult to be serviced by just one bank.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the volume of M&amp;A activity in the region bringing more bank accounts, more bank relationships and new connectivity issues into the mix, the complexities financial professionals face are compounding. For these reasons, it seems like a good time for growing companies to take stock of best practices in bank account management and the value that a common treasury management system in the cloud provides companies that want to operate easily and securely across all of their banks and all of their bank accounts.</p>
<p>M&amp;A activity is a driver of better bank account management. By the end of 2015, the total value of M&amp;A deals in Asia was up 49% year-over-year, with Japan up 48% during that same time period, according to Dealogic. While this activity demonstrates tremendous growth, it also paints a picture of post-merger treasury operations, where teams grapple with integration issues, increasing bank relationships and accounts, broken processes, and increased opacity of cash positions and exposures. It becomes more time consuming and risky to move from bank portal to bank portal, using several different dongles to piece together a cash position, which then is dangerously out of date. More bank connections and lack of controls increase the risk of financial fraud, most of which happens internal to the organisation. This issue is currently front and centre in the minds of financial professionals.</p>
<p>All of these challenges impact bank account management, but they can be addressed by implementing best practices and standardising treasury on a common cloud-based technology platform, accessible from any location where treasury and its subsidiaries operate. Fast-growing companies can implement the following best practices:</p>
<h5>Centralise bank account management.</h5>
<p>Deploy a systematic approach to managing company-wide bank accounts and centralise bank account administration, including bank account activities, such as openings, closings, and signatories.</p>
<h5>Create an authorisation matrix.</h5>
<p>Define signatory and approval workflows to control bank account activity. Implement an appropriate segregation of duties, a clear policy for the use of local and foreign currency bank accounts and audit trails to prevent internal and external fraud.</p>
<h5>Review bank connections.</h5>
<p>As banking relationships are managed centrally or through regional treasury centres, the finance team can do a thorough review of the entire bank portfolio and decide how to best connect to bank partners.</p>
<h5>View cash and risk positions in real time.</h5>
<p>Consolidating cash positions and obtaining a clear picture of the cash on hand can be time-consuming and error-prone. However, treasury technology can provide intra-day visibility into cash positions and related exposures, while optimising working capital at the same time.</p>
<h5>Analyse cash flows.</h5>
<p>Analyse the consolidated cash data in order to make short-term investment and financing decisions. Do this by entity, currency, country, cash-flow category and business unit.</p>
<p>Implementing best practices in bank account management will bring increased visibility and control to cash, liquidity and operational risk management as companies adopt a systematic approach. Furthermore, it will reduce bank fees from transactional and operational costs as companies rationalise bank accounts and relationships.</p>
<p>As companies continue to scale their treasury operations to support future growth and M&amp;A activity, using a cloud-based treasury management system will bring more value to the bank account management process. Companies will gain efficiencies by automating bank statement collection instead of manually logging into multiple bank portals to oversee bank accounts in different geographies. This not only improves security and compliance, but because software delivered as a service is always current and continuously monitored, it mitigates the threat of cyber fraud.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Best practices in bank account management deliver visibility into and control of global bank accounts.</p>
<p>The challenge for most treasury teams is when organisations expand internationally and control of the opening of accounts becomes decentralised to non-treasury users in local markets. Without a single system of record for all accounts and signatories on those accounts, there is no centralised control over how accounts are opened, closed, and maintained. This introduces risk for the entire organisation, as funds within those accounts can potentially be at risk as well as the possibility of new accounts being opened, unknown to treasury and finance. While the most serious scenarios involve fraud, the issues for the organisation may be as simple as treasury not having visibility into idle cash balances because they didn’t know the bank account existed.</p>
<p>To solve these issues, organisations will use a central technology platform – often in the cloud and in many cases part of their treasury management system – to ensure that details of all accounts are centrally managed in addition to a separation of duties for opening, closing, and making changes to authorities on bank accounts. It is this separation of roles – into front and back office functions – that offers the requisite control so that treasury can confidently say they have complete control over bank accounts and the funds within them.</p>

<p><em>With bank strategies less certain in today’s regulatory environment, the task of selecting a new banking partner has never been more demanding. But what are treasurers looking for in a transaction bank today? We asked treasurers and bankers for their take.</em></p>
<p>Selecting a new transactional banking partner will be on the agenda for many treasurers this year, and here in Asia the requests for proposals (RFPs) the banks are seeing are becoming ever more complex.</p>
<p>Just under half of the Asia Pacific treasurers that participated in the Association of Financial Professionals’ (AFP) 2015 Transaction Banking Survey confirmed they plan to review strategy with their banks in the year ahead. One in five indicated that they will be renegotiating their banking contracts, while a quarter are either actively seeking new banking partners in key areas or have plans to move their business accordingly.</p>
<p>Some of this upheaval can be accounted for by organisations looking to benefit from economies of scale through consolidating their banking relationships. In the search for optimal process efficiency, many corporates in Asia – of all types – still aspire to introduce standard banking structures and move away from in-country treasury processes.</p>
<p>But treasurers know that uniformity cannot come at the expense of local operations; they need banks that can get the job done at the domestic business level too. In-country capabilities will therefore be figuring high on the list of considerations of those treasuries now moving to a regional model. And it’s the tension between these two demands, in-country capabilities and global reach, which is seemingly giving rise to some of the more nuanced RFPs the banks have been seeing.</p>
<h3 id=""local-know-how"">Local know-how</h3>
<p>“I am seeing a bit more complexity in the RFPs coming through now as corporate treasury becomes much more involved in the day-to-day operating needs of the business,” says Jason Batman, Asia Pacific Product Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “Some of them are becoming incredibly complex and contain a large number of very specific domestic requirements.”</p>
<p>The trend can be partly explained, says Batman, by reference to the evolving role of the corporate treasurer. With treasurers becoming more involved in driving operational efficiency initiatives, more attention is being given by companies tendering their cash management services to how certain services – payroll, tax, for instance – are delivered at the local level. The service received from a bank in one country, they often discover, is not the service provided in another. “There is much more specificity around what the bank can really do in the domestic market space,” Batman notes. “Treasurers want to know a bank can do what it says it can do at the local level.”</p>
<p>Sometimes banks with very sophisticated global structures simply do not live up to the treasurer’s expectations – or the bank assurances – in certain markets. “Banks sometimes tend to over-promise their local capabilities based on high service levels in major countries,” says Christopher Emslie, Country Treasurer, Singapore, at ABB. “Unfortunately a bank’s capabilities and structures in smaller countries cannot always facilitate or replicate the needs of those countries.”</p>
<p>That is why the most important question during the selection process, for Emslie, is delivery. The escalation process to resolve issues, should any arise, is key. “If the bank’s structure has an ultimate responsible party to assist the customer and a clear process for guidance, a solution can be found.”</p>
<p>Although a bank’s ability to deliver new innovative solutions and, of course, the cost of those solutions remain important considerations when selecting a bank, Emslie says finding a bank that has a footprint that works for the company will always be paramount.</p>

<p>“We look for banks that can be aligned with ourselves and can service our needs,” he says. “The usual parameters come into play such as price and value-add, but it also comes down to footprint and global compatibility for the organisation.”</p>
<p>This focus may explain the current vogue amongst the treasuries of multinational companies (MNCs) in opting for regional banking strategies. As Carole Berndt, Head, Global Transaction Banking at ANZ, notes: “Treasurers are looking for best in breed in a geography – and nobody can be the best everywhere.”</p>
<p>It is something Berndt has heard a lot since she joined ANZ in May 2015. She commented on this a few months into the role: “The first three client meetings I had here were all with MNCs who started the conversation by saying that they were talking to us because they were exploring a regional bank strategy,” she says. “Historically we would have had to pull clients in that direction, but now there is a trend towards it – and it is one which we are ideally placed to leverage.”</p>
<h3 id=""testing-the-banks"">Testing the banks</h3>
<p>For the treasury team at General Motors (GM), who recently implemented a regional bank strategy (for which it won an Adam Smith Award Asia), in-country capabilities are literally one of the first considerations of the selection process. It’s not merely a question of solutions and connectivity, however; treasury is also keen to ascertain the competencies of the shortlisted candidates on matters such as the local regulatory environment.</p>
<p>“For us the main purpose of that first RFP round is to truly understand what the banks’ local capabilities are in different countries,” says Ying Cao, Treasury Manager, International Operations at General Motors. “We will look, for example, at whether there is SWIFT connectivity in certain countries, whether they can support different languages, different ERP versions.”</p>
<p>Understanding what a bank can do at the local level is critical for treasury teams – including GM – because there are often limitations to what banks can do in countries, dependent on the bank’s strategy and organisational setup. For instance, some services might require the bank to have a physical branch; indeed foreign banks that are not fully licensed in countries like India and China are restricted from providing certain services. It is important to fully understand banks’ knowledge and expertise across different markets.</p>
<p>“We use the case study to test the banks’ knowledge of such things as local regulation,” says Cao. Although GM’s treasury do not typically see a huge difference in the responses that come back, it is the degree of confidence with which the bank answers the question that can often be telling. “Sometimes there are banks that answer the questions very clearly, whilst other banks would need to check and come back to us. Eventually they all come back with the right answer – but you have a sense with some that they are not quite so certain.”</p>




<h3 id=""rbs-exit-continues-to-reverberate"">RBS’ exit continues to reverberate</h3>
<p>When RBS announced last year that it would be dramatically scaling back its corporate banking network across the world, a large number of corporates were left searching for a new cash management provider. Today, it seems a few of those companies still are.</p>
<p>Responding to a recent Treasury Today article on how the bank’s pullback has shaken the competitive landscape in transaction banking, RBS confirmed that some customers needing to switch – including corporates in Asia – appear to be behind schedule.</p>
<p>“We have clearly communicated the timelines for switching to all our customers, and they understand that our operations are scaling back,” Jerry Pearce, Head of Cash Management, Global Transaction Services at RBS commented.</p>
<p>“With this in mind, we are encouraging clients to accelerate their exit well ahead of their final termination date. A large number of our clients have already found a new provider and many others are well on their way to doing so, with a few still having much to do if they are to meet the deadline.”</p>
<p>Of course, RBS will have done all it can to assist those clients in the search for a new cash management provider. But even so, having to find a new bank and implement a new regional cash management solution on a tight deadline is not an experience many treasurers would like to go through often. Perhaps the desire to mitigate operating risk is another reason more treasuries are splitting APAC between two banking partners.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""the-bigger-picture"">The bigger picture</h3>
<p>A renewed focus on what banks can do from country to country means that the single-regional-bank aspiration must sometimes give way to a more pragmatic approach. Treasurers still wish to rationalise bank structures across different countries; eliminating inconsistent accounting and treasury processes where possible. But when a single bank cannot be found that aligns well with the corporate’s structure and footprint, there is a tendency to split the region.</p>
<p>This ensures that the efficiency benefits of rationalisation are not offset by the loss of in-country capabilities. “It means that treasurers are now evaluating banks more extensively at the country level when making buying decisions in Asia,” says Citi’s Batman. “Depending on their business model and growth strategy, they could be picking different bank partners for North Asia or China, India, and ASEAN. Having said that, multinationals with a large, balanced global footprint continue to favour banks that are able to offer global connectivity with strong in-country capabilities. This provides the regional treasurer with optimal visibility and control to efficiently navigate the fast-evolving business environment across Asia’s heterogeneous markets.”</p>
<p>Splitting the region between multiple banks was the approach taken by GM when it began implementing a regional banking model several years ago. Before embarking on the project, treasury was using a handful of local banks for payments and cash management services across ten different countries in Asia. Multiple accounts were held with different banks in countries like Korea, Thailand, India and China; with a structure of such complexity core treasury activities had to be carried out by in-country treasury teams. Meanwhile, without a TMS in place, processes were largely manual, creating inconsistent accounting and treasury processes from country to country.</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of GM’s footprint in the region, a high level of uniformity was ultimately established by replacing local banks with two regional partner banks. Many core treasury activities are now performed at the regional level, rather than in-country. Information, meanwhile can be accessed via a TMS instead of consulting a number of different systems and teams.</p>
<p>“Before we started the project, we had different bank account structures in different countries,” says Niyant Shah, Manager, International Operations, GM. “Some countries had over 30 bank accounts with different counterparties. We wanted to make sure we were using a standard structure in each country.”</p>
<h3 id=""best-of-both-worlds"">Best of both worlds</h3>
<p>The story of GMs treasury transformation project in Asia demonstrates that a balance can be struck between the efficiencies treasuries can gain from having a global banking partner, and the flexibility and domestic competitiveness of a local bank. Regional banking arrangements often work well from a strategic standpoint for MNCs like GM because they mirror business organisations that are managed on a regional basis; regional management centres can, for that reason, serve as a natural point of contact for the bank. The model also avoids the fragmentation that can occur through local banking, while still offering a degree of counterparty risk diversification at the global level.</p>
<p>In terms of getting the implementation of a regional banking model right, there are a few things treasurers can learn from GM. First and foremost, when picking a regional bank it is vital to carefully assess the local, in-country capabilities of the banks, and the expertise of their teams. The service a bank delivers in one country is not always the same as it delivers in another country. Furthermore, should regulatory issues arise, treasurers will want a banking partner that knows the local market and can help them resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Secondly, look at the technological strengths of the selected candidates. As GMs story attests, it has become increasingly possible to have a one-bank-experience with several banks; and a TMS can serve as a single conduit to access reporting, payment services, credit and FX and commodities transactions across multiple banks.</p>
<p>Finally, in a region like Asia Pacific, made up as it is of a number of highly diverse markets and regulatory regimes, selecting one bank to cover an entire region may not be in treasury’s best interests. No bank is equally strong in all markets, and treasurers will want the best fit for whatever country they are operating in.</p>
<p>Providing the treasurer remembers these key points, treasurers should find themselves in a position to combine, like GM, the synergies of centralisation with local banking capability and expertise. One global transactional banking partner may not be as practical an ambition as it once was for every company, but there are many variations and alternative ways to centralise treasury operations. A regional banking model is evidently one which is proving especially popular with corporates in Asia Pacific at the moment.</p>

<p>In the past, the relationships between Brocade and its banking partners were less than optimal. The existing process for bank relationship management was not structured or comprehensive. Therefore, the evaluations on banking partners were mainly from fragmented feedback among the treasury staff. The other business units in Brocade could not properly select right banking partners for their specific needs because of lacking of an accurate assessment on their banks. Chris Hanson describes the Bank Relationship Scorecard they have developed at Brocade.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, it has never been more important for corporate treasurers to maintain strong relationships with their core banks. As it is with any type of relationship, however, stability and longevity are largely determined by the abilities of both parties to understand each other’s needs. Here, treasurers, bankers and industry consultants offer their views on how this can be best achieved.</em></p>
<p>Despite the altering nature of institutional relationships in the new, emerging regulatory and market environment, banks are still mainly seen by their corporate clients to be doing a good job, according to the 2015 AFP Transaction Banking Survey. A clear majority of the 784 global business executives that responded (68%) said that they are highly satisfied with the services offered by their main banking partners, a slight decline from the 70% who responded that way in last year’s survey.</p>
<p>That still leaves us, of course, with a significant number (32%) of financial executives who are less than highly satisfied with their banking relationships, a figure which, when evaluated against the results from the previous year’s survey, is gently increasing. This should not be too surprising to anyone who has followed banking issues these last few years. Banks have taken some serious reputational blows over recent years – state bailouts, the various benchmark manipulation exposés and sinking credit ratings, to name but a few. Add to that regulatory constraints forcing banks to revaluate their financing and deposit-taking activities, and perhaps the real wonder is why corporate satisfaction has held up so well.</p>
<p>In this article, we explore in detail just how these and other issues have been driving changes in bank relationships before offering some tips that will help treasurers – even those who say they are highly satisfied – to get more out of their banking relationships in the future.</p>
<h3 id=""safety-in-numbers"">Safety in numbers</h3>
<p>There is something almost paradoxical about the relationship expectations corporates have of their banking partners today. Carole Berndt, Head, Global Transaction Banking at ANZ explains it well. “Corporates are not looking for proprietary systems and connectivity: they prefer bank agnostic solutions and mobility across their banking partners,” she says, adding that this is a strategy that has been made increasingly possible through technological developments in recent years. That is not all, however. “They want mobility, but they also want deeper relationships that bring value.”</p>
<p>Part of the push towards greater diversification of banking relationships stems from what the credit crisis revealed about the fragility of once seemingly stable banking institutions, but has been reinforced more recently by the decisions of some well-known banks to reconsider the scope of their regional footprints. By way of an example, a treasurer whose core relationship bank recently pulled out of European markets to focus on their domestic business recently told Treasury Today why, when the business was once again put out to tender, the decision was made to select two banks to cover a region once catered for by one. Her position is not difficult to understand. “The very last thing I want is to be left in the lurch again,” she explained. For almost time immemorial the ‘holy grail’ banking structure all corporates were working toward was to have a single global transaction bank or, at the very least, a single bank for an entire region. As the above comment reveals though, that paradigm has now been all but turned on its head.</p>
<h3 id=""keeping-everyone-happy"">Keeping everyone happy</h3>
<p>“Historically, corporates that could have one bank across the globe or across regions would be very happy, because it offers economies of scale, and good service from one trusted provider,” says Nick Diamond, Head of Global Corporates, Transaction Banking, Europe, Standard Chartered. However, what we are beginning to see now, is that in order to manage concentration risk and get best in class solution and service, some of the more forward looking companies are beginning to look to meet their transaction banking needs from a currency by currency basis rather than geographical.”</p>
<p>The challenge for treasurers is how to foster those ‘deeper relationships’ ANZ’s Berndt speaks of whilst simultaneously implementing a regional or even currency banking model, perhaps with several banks selected for contingency purposes. Ultimately, corporates and banks want the same thing: stable, long-term relationships that bring value (which today, Berndt says, is all about providing aggregating data, insights into markets and, naturally, a partner that is going to support them in the good as well as the bad times). But if the corporate doesn’t think about what it can offer the bank in return, however, it may not obtain all or indeed any of these things. “It is not about the size of the client and their industry,” adds Berndt. “It is about do they need what we have and do well, and can we deliver it to them in a way that brings value to them, but also brings returns to our shareholders. It has to be a balanced equation.”</p>
<p>“Corporates need to consider how to best engage their transaction banks to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship” says Standard Chartered’s Diamond. “It is not especially attractive to only to be a contingency bank.” It is a task compounded by the regulatory pressures now baring down on banks. “The regulatory environment around the cost of capital and capital efficiency and management will mean that capital will become ever scarcer and the banks will require the appropriate return levels on capital commitment,” Vanessa Manning, Head of Product Management, Transaction Banking, Europe, Standard Chartered contends. “Operational balances are becoming increasingly important from a banks perspective only arising when you have the transactional business underneath giving rise to them. The core operating liquidity those activities provide is exactly what the regulators want to see.”</p>
<p>Given the difficulties associated with satisfying a large number of banks, all demanding a piece of that same transactional business, and the imperative to balance such demands with the management of concentration risk, how do corporate treasurers decide what the right number of banking relationships is? What is the optimal balance? The answer will, of course, vary considerably between companies and will be influenced by multiple factors including the type of organisation, its footprint and even its culture.</p>
<p>Some things are universal though. “It’s really dependent on our needs for credit, and how many banks are involved in that,” Matthew Venardi, Corporate Treasury Manager, Treasury Systems and Operations at Toyota Financial Services told delegates during a panel session at EuroFinance’s recent International Cash and Treasury Management conference in Copenhagen. “We have a scorecard that shows how much we feel we have paid in return for the credit that has been provided for us, and we try to make sure that we are compensating all our banks – there is always give and take.”</p>
<p>Once the corporates’ credit needs have been met, then the treasurer must ensure that the banks providing it are, like Diamond reasons, being adequately rewarded for their efforts (a negotiation which Venardi says is not always easy given that the banks in any given syndicate are typically after the same things from their corporate client). Here, sometimes, it might help to consider what other financial services the company is using that could be provided by a bank. “We absolutely have to understand banks’ needs and compensate them for that,” says Venardi. “To ensure there is no leakage out of treasury, if there are services that banks provide and we are doing them with non-banks, we should try to convert those.”</p>
<h3 id=""its-good-to-talk"">It’s good to talk</h3>
<p>Both treasurers and bankers agree that, as the nature of their relationships with one another continues to evolve, it is important for both parties to make a conscientious effort to understand each other’s strategies and priorities – and, of course, where the mutual benefits reside.</p>
<p>“I think it is really critical for us to work closely together and try to understand what the mutual benefit is,” Jennifer Boussuge, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s (BofA Merrill) Head of Global Transaction Services for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told EuroFinance delegates. “From a bank perspective, if corporates can be more transparent around what their strategies are and how they allocate business, they will get more in return.”</p>
<p>Agreeing with Boussuge on the importance of an open, transparent dialogue, Jean-Michel Harlepin, Treasurer for Vinci Finance International, told EuroFinance delegates that he feels communication is even more vital in the post-Basel III world. “We expect a long-term relationship – we don’t want to be changing frequently – so transparency and communication is really important,” he told delegates.</p>
<p>That cuts both ways, however, and especially on the matter of regulatory impacts, he believes this could be improved on the bank side. “And that is something we lack recently with some of the banks. We understand the difficulty of the regulations being imposed on the banks. But we would like to have a better understanding of how this impacts the strategy of the banks we deal with, so a mutually favourable solution can be found.”</p>
<p>Banks are working increasingly hard on establishing more transparent lines of communication with clients though, especially on the matter of how services and solutions are priced. “We see increased demand for transparency around banks fees being charged,” says Standard Chartered’s Manning. “The key is in simplifying the way fees are communicated, to make ease of comparison between the banks for the services they provide.”</p>
<h3 id=""armed-with-the-facts"">Armed with the facts</h3>
<p>If the secret to getting more from one’s relationship banks is really all about effective communication, as Boussuge contends, then what can treasurers like Harlepin do to enhance that dialogue and help banks to better understand their strategies and where they can add value? Daniel Blumen, Consulting Partner at the Treasury Alliance Group, shared a few ideas on this. Blumen recommends a four-part process which includes the drafting of an impact assessment and a counterparty review, performing a Risk Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC) analysis and devising a banking continuity plan.</p>
<p>Through the impact, assessment should help treasurers get a full picture of their company’s banking footprint and the services which are required, within which special attention should be given to obtaining full visibility over liquidity (without this it can be difficult to accurately ascertain which banks are critical to the business and which are not).</p>
<p>But Blumen adds that checking the validity of the credit rating assigned to the company is also a worthwhile endeavour to include in the process, considering that this is one of the principle things banks use to evaluate their corporate clients. “Believe it or not, people do make errors,” he says. “It is not a bad thing to go back to a ratings agency and tell them you think the assigned rating is incorrect and that you would like it to be re-evaluated.”</p>
<p>The next step is to carry out a counterparty review. Here the treasurer should be looking to document each banking relationship and the level of the company’s exposure. Critically, though this should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis, not filed in a draw somewhere and subsequently forgotten. “I hate the cliché ‘living document’ but it really should be something that is maintained in a dynamic fashion,” says Blumen.</p>
<p>The third step, the RAROC analysis, is more data driven and objective. “It has been around for some time,” he says. “I can promise you that is the way banks look at corporates, and what we are suggesting is that if that’s the way banks are going to look at you then that is the way that you should be looking at your banks.” Essentially, the formula for RAROC (risk adjusted return divided by the risk adjusted capital needed to generate that return) allows corporates to assess the value of their business to their banks. Often what value the corporate comes up with using RAROC will differ considerably from what the bank has calculated. But this is not a bad thing. It means that the treasurer, now armed with all the facts, is able to start a discussion with the bank. “It gives you a way of aligning your business with the people who are helping you,” says Blumen. “You want to make sure that the banks who are devoting risk weighted assets to you are getting the return they deserve.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Finally devising a workable banking continuity plan is of absolutely critical importance. “You want to take a look at your banking activities in terms of the services that you have, the services that you must have, the services that are good to have, and the services that are not entirely critical,” he says. “Then you work out where you can go next should a certain banking partner say they no longer want your business, ensuring that you are prepared for that scenario.”</p>
<h3 id=""better-together"">Better together</h3>
<p>The things which corporates and banks respectively look to get out of their relationships with one another remain, in many respects, what they have always been. Banks want relationships with their corporate clients to be profitable; in other words a reasonable share of the corporates wallet on things such as derivatives transactions and debt capital market activities. Corporates, meanwhile, want long-term reliability, expertise, technological sophistication and, naturally, competitive prices.</p>
<p>What has changed though – and what is likely to continue to change in the coming years – is the context in which relationships are forged. The new demands presented by the emerging regulatory and risk environments are undoubtedly making it more difficult for the wants and needs of both parties to be satisfied.</p>
<p>It should not be impossible, though, to find ways of ensuring corporate-bank relationships continue to be mutually beneficial. It would seem from the perspectives offered above that, to this end, both bankers and treasurers agree that communication is critical. With the list of treasury responsibilities growing longer by the day, meeting personally with that growing list of banking counterparties might not seem that appealing to the treasurer. Neglecting to do so, though, might be very costly from a relationship perspective.</p>


","As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, it has never been more important for corporate treasurers to maintain strong relationships with their core banks. As it is with any type of relationship, however, stability and longevity are largely determined by the abilities of both parties to understand each other’s needs. Here, treasurers, bankers and industry consultants offer their views on how this can be best achieved.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/banking/bank-relationships/2015-11and12-tt-03-ia-flamingo-on-lake-naivasha-rises-into-the-air-ss161010755__1920x1080.jpg,2015-11-01,Bank Relationships,False

<p><em>Bank-bashing is a favourite hobby of the unenlightened. But what do those who know and understand the role that financial institutions play think of the service they get? Treasury Today assesses the lay of the land.</em></p>
<p>Bank customers may get the feeling sometimes that financial institutions are run on the kind of principles espoused by Mr Bumble in Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist. In order to discourage paupers from asking for relief he suggests giving them “exactly what they don’t want; and then they get tired of coming.”</p>
<p>Indeed, companies faced with a range of issues that variously includes managing currency controls and the volatility of FX and commodities markets, the upheaval of centralising processes, the threat of geopolitical instability and a raft of new regulatory and central bank reporting demand, and even the threat of cyber-fraud, will necessarily seek help from their banks. But whilst the banks fully understand that they have a vital role to play in oiling the machinery of commerce, do they really deliver the goods and services required or are they dodging the issues faced by their customers?</p>
<p>Back in December 2013, a meeting of Chris Skinner’s networking group, the Financial Services Club, led by Colin Tyler, CEO of the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), pondered whether banks were indeed meeting their corporate customers’ needs. According to Skinner’s summary of the event, the conclusion was ‘not really’.</p>
<p>Most corporates, Tyler suggested, want banks to show them how to get the most from their assets, enhance and unlock shareholder value, improve their working capital and ease the supply chain. “What they tend to get is product sales-focused bank relationship managers, who focus upon the bank’s needs rather than the customers.”</p>
<p>The issue of whether banks are meeting corporate needs is certainly not a Euro-centric discussion. EuroFinance’s Cash and Treasury Management Asia 2014 event, held in Singapore, witnessed one lively discussion entitled ‘The customer will define the bank of the future’. Scott Engle, Group Treasurer for Hong Kong-based insurance company, AIA Group Limited, pulled no punches when he told delegates that “banks significantly overvalue their value to a corporation,” adding for good measure that “the only reason I need banks is because I pay money and I collect money.”</p>



<blockquote><p>Not every corporate has the necessary level of experience; they look to banks to bring that knowledge to the table.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Kerry Saunders, IT Lead for Treasury, Constellium</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>A year is a long time in the financial services sector, so has anything changed? Seemingly not. In March of this year, delegates at Fundtech’s ‘Insight EMEA’ conference held in London listened as Chris Donohoe, Assistant Treasurer, EMEIA, for the global diversified industrial company, Ingersoll Rand, told of his experience to date. “Too often we’ve seen banks come to us with off-the-shelf products that don’t really meet the needs of a complex business,” he said. “What I’d like to see is banks taking the time to really get to know us.” In taking the time to understand a client’s strategic goals, technical and technological capabilities, Donohoe believes banks have the opportunity “to align with customer expectations.”</p>
<h3 id=""know-your-customer"">Know your customer</h3>
<p>Over the years, banks clearly should have accumulated a great depth of experience and knowledge about what works and what doesn’t; in theory, they should know where the “sweet spots” are, commented Donohoe. As such, he’d like to see more of an educational approach from them, enabling clients to get the most effective use of a solution. Under the guidance of local regulators and tax authorities, financial institutions should also try to support the changing structure of a product throughout its lifespan. They should not just “put it in and walk away.” Indeed, he is adamant that banks should become more proactive in their delivery of strategic and relevant advice.</p>
<p>Adam Boukadida, Deputy Treasurer of Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, also speaking at the Fundtech event, agreed. “They have to understand our business and become a strategic partner rather than just looking at us as a sales opportunity,” he stated. With Etihad operating in more than 75 countries it has a complex business approach; banks must be able to understand the fundamental processes of their clients’ businesses as well as its technical treasury function.</p>
<h3 id=""know-your-product"">Know your product</h3>
<p>Boukadida’s fellow panellist, Kerry Saunders, IT Lead for Treasury at Constellium, a global producer of aluminium semi-products, naturally looked at bank service from a technology perspective. She noted that whereas some banks have a very structured approach to what should be a ‘commoditised’ IT project such as a SWIFT implementation, with others “it feels like we are the first customer to ask for it.” But she said banks should not only be alerting treasurers to the benefits of structures such as SWIFT, but also then helping them through the implementation. “Not every corporate has the necessary level of experience; they look to banks to bring that knowledge to the table.”</p>
<p>Banks are in a position to understand certain aspects of a client’s business, such as its overall payments activities, better than the client itself, simply because the bank has access to so much more data. Armed with that data, rather than waiting to be asked, banks should be proactively helping corporates (especially smaller and mid-sized firms) to better manage their process costs and efficiencies.</p>
<h3 id=""are-banks-attracting-the-right-people"">Are banks attracting the right people?</h3>
<p>To be able to deliver the right services, banks rely on bringing in the right people of which education is an important factor. Most bankers have undertaken a business or finance-related degree such as accounting, business or economics, prior to entering the financial sector according to Emolument.com a ‘salary benchmarking site’ which recently surveyed more than 700 London-based bankers. Whilst this route represents the highest proportion (34%) of the banking population, business graduates are not the best paid. At director-level, banks value mathematics and statistics graduates over their business, finance and accounting colleagues, the former earning on average around £398,000 pa versus the latter’s £265,000 pa This may reflect the aptitude for more scientific minds to rise to the technical challenge of structuring deals or trading in an environment using increasingly complex financial products. It may equally indicate the current value banks are putting on individuals with the capacity to get to grips with this complexity.</p>
<p>Commenting on the differences, Thomas Drewry, CEO at Emolument.com, said that in the last few years, with mounting pressure for efficiency and the capacity of young bankers to hit the ground running, banks have tended to favour candidates armed with technical degrees. After all, he noted, spending time teaching an analyst about yield curves, balance sheets and volatility is a costly exercise so from an HR point of view at least it makes sense to opt for the individual with three years of relevant study under his or her belt. However, Drewry does point out that trading floors and corporate finance departments “are likely to keep becoming less diverse when it comes to education,” the impact of which is yet to be revealed.</p>
<h3 id=""right-to-reply"">Right to reply</h3>
<p>The London Fundtech panel did give the banking community the right of reply, lining up a brace of seasoned experts. “I think banks do need to have a better understanding of how their clients operate,” admits Des Twort, Treasury Specialist, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). It should not be a case of the bank turning up with its line of products and services and hoping that the client will buy something, but about understanding where the client sits on the spectrum of sophistication, where its challenges and needs are, and whether it needs a strategic or tactical solution to meet those needs.</p>
<p>Jonathan Parker, VP Cash Management Sales, Global Transaction Services, Santander, acknowledged that banks must have an openness to the client’s objectives and what the pressures and demands are on treasury within the organisation. “It requires building up a fact base so that we can position the right services to the business at the right time and present a view of what is coming down the line by way of services, functionality and trends in the market.” But Parker believes there is a responsibility on the treasury’s part to be “open and communicative” with its bank so that the bank has the ability to react when it needs to and with the appropriate speed.</p>
<p>In this respect, Twort observed that “eight times out of ten you never get to speak to an IT person” when going through an RFP for an integrated banking solution. When it gets to the implementation, he observes that it will often fall down because the IT people “straight away see that what has been bought will not work in the existing infrastructure.” The key for the corporate then, said Etihad’s Boukadida, is to align all project stakeholders and contributors, including the bank and the system and service providers. In this way, the process becomes transparent “and everyone understands the end goal and is working towards it.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-shared-experience"">A shared experience?</h3>
<p>Compliance is a concern for banks, with KYC and AML rules for example requiring constant attention. It is a bank issue in that they are the ones that are fined and take the reputational hit if something goes wrong. In this respect, an interesting observation raised by ACT’s Tyler at the aforementioned Financial Services Club meeting was the notion that banks are increasingly asking their corporate customers to help them with the regulators. “The regulators should be focused upon the corporate needs but rather than this being the case the corporations are being caught in the bathwater being thrown out by the regulator in their sweeping changes to trading operations.” This effect had been previously noted at a Nordic Financial Services Club meeting. The very idea that banks are asking their corporate customers to help them face up to the regulators is something that Edward Harkins, an independent consultant specialising in the public and not-for-profit sectors, felt compelled to comment on Skinner’s blog that it “somehow gives me a queasy feeling.”</p>
<p>Not so for Ingersoll Rand’s Donohoe who feels that compliance should be tackled as a partnership and believes the responsibility ultimately lies with the corporate to ensure the correct procedures are followed. His company manufactures compressors for the oil and gas industry that will at times be sold in countries with a very dynamic geopolitical climate. “It’s hard to say to the bank that it owns the sanctions when we are responsible for who we are selling to and who will pay. Of course, there is a limit to what Ingersoll Rand can know about the eventual user of its products but it has a highly active compliance department to prevent transgressions as far as possible.”</p>
<p>It is true that trade compliance and financial compliance can be two very different matters; a firm can sell its product in a certain country but might not be able to receive payment. It may be that, for example, a bank from the US may not be permitted to handle a contract for a deal in Cuba whereas a European bank will have no such issue. Because compliance tends to be very fluid, with policy changing quite quickly, Donohoe said there has to be an ongoing relationship between bank and corporate and that the corporate has to take ownership of who it sells to and who it is paid by. Indeed, few companies want money arriving in their bank accounts that will cause a major compliance issue. But banks must keep clients up to date on sanctions matters and where bank policy potentially affects the handling of payments.</p>
<h3 id=""earn-your-keep"">Earn your keep</h3>
<p>What corporates really want from their banks, it seems, is a more up-front approach. Corporates will engage more than one banking partner but when a bank wins the business it can’t just sit back; it has to earn its fees. To win and retain a share of wallet requires proactivity where banks come forward with business solutions and propose opportunities for greater efficiency. The appearance of more ex-treasury personnel in the bank consultancy line-up is, he feels, a sure sign of progress. “We select the topics we want to discuss, but if that is offered, we will definitely take that up,” stated Boukadida.</p>
<p>For Saunders, knowledge is the key to banks offering value-added services. Having worked with two mid-sized corporates she noted that it is relatively easy to switch banks, SWIFT allowing an almost bank-agnostic state to prevail. “Banks need to make us want to stay with them, bringing their knowledge and tools so they stand out from the crowd, because for us it looks like a very level playing field.”</p>
<p>The ideal situation for Donohoe is to have someone at the bank that feels as if they have actually worked for the team for years before moving to the relationship bank. “Sometime treasurers can be afraid to mention they are working on a certain project because they know they will be inundated with bank sales people. It’s about getting the right person that knows and understands your business and who is proactive and will talk to you about relevant issues.”</p>
<p>In offering his view on corporate requirements from their bank, the ACT’s Tyler presented the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fairness: more open and transparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarity: plain language and clear communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevance: tailored to the needs of the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation: continual delivery of next generation financial management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choice: recommend and provide the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keenness: proactive service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect: do your research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidentiality: keep it quiet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future-proof: ensure the bank covers the long term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Banks may have progressed in their quest to meet the needs of their corporate clients but in reality that quest is never-ending as corporate needs keep changing in their own ongoing struggle to accommodate the push and pull of the commercial world.</p>
<p>Treasurers are looking for a banking community that is ready, willing and able to co-operate not just when diagnosing problems and offering solutions but also by improving connectivity with and accessibility to information held by those banks.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, Damian Glendinning, the Singapore-based treasurer at multinational computer technology company, Lenovo, amuses with his trenchant remark made in a recent conversation with Treasury Today. As a treasurer of significant experience he is still drawn to comment that “nobody has ever accused the banks of understanding what corporates want.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>The means by which banks generate profit has in the past few years been forensically analysed and some of the outcomes have made for rather depressing reading. But whilst some may say the raft of regulation they now face in response to their more creative practices are of their own doing, it should be acceptable for banks to generate profitable revenues from the products and services they provide to customers. “Banks should, however, clearly and transparently communicate the fees and conditions under which these will be levied,” says Dinesh Krishnan, MD of Global Product Development for financial technology firm, Zafin. “Customers should also be guided towards using the most appropriate products and channels.”</i></p>
<p>In preparing this article it is interesting to note that several banks declined the opportunity to comment (the help offered by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and SEB is therefore that much more appreciated). Whilst this apparent reluctance is not indicative of anything in particular, it does suggest that, for whatever reason, the topic of fees remains a sensitive subject for some banks.</p>
<p>Fee levels are affected by a combination of external and internal factors. External factors include significant components like the markets and countries in which banks operate, local banking models and customs, the prevailing regulatory framework, competitor activity, customer expectations, and technological advances. “Internal factors can, in part, then be considered as a reflection of how banks manage the external factors and translate these into product and pricing propositions for their clients,” notes Krishnan. Banks offering differentiated fee propositions will base decisions on such factors as customer segment or type, geography, committed balances, breadth of customer relationship across products and lines of business, longevity of relationship and the volume of business.</p>
<p>However, according to Bruce Meuli, Global Business Solutions Executive, Global Transaction Services, EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), “fairness is in the eye of the beholder”. Whilst this is absolutely true of almost any transaction, he acknowledges that ‘fairness’ can also translate as ‘market value’. Sometimes though, “fairness is relationship driven”.</p>
<p>In practice, Meuli is a firm believer that value, not price, is the major driver behind fair pricing. In this context, he notes, most people recognise that “the cheapest is not always the best”. However, Olle Durelius, Head of WCM Process Management at SEB, adds that even for a commoditised product, ‘value’ may still be generated, allowing the corporate to make significant savings in other parts of its organisation; just consider the upstream process and cost benefits of straight through processing for simple payments, he says.</p>


<blockquote>If the bank knows it is getting a fair share of the corporate wallet, relative to other banks in the group, it will be more amenable to offering improved pricing.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The theme of adding value is something picked up by Linda Wade, Product Manager, Billing, at SEB. She believes banks should not just do what they are paid to do but must also provide a genuine benefit for customers; only then is it possible to talk about fairness. “When we are creating value for our customers then it is fair to charge for that added-value,” she says.</p>
<p>‘Value’ can of course be derived in many different ways. Wade points out, for example, that an effective bank will earn its fee if it can step in and save the day when something goes wrong. The “soft factor” of quickly being able to turn a situation around to the customer’s advantage makes all the difference. She argues that if that ‘soft’ element is removed, many banking products can be seen as the commoditised processes that they really are; often indistinguishable from bank to bank and adding no real value beyond their functional remit.</p>
<p>According to Durelius, the managed delivery of core products and services always ranks highly on the priorities list of SEB’s clients when they are surveyed. “If the day-to-day business does not work, it quickly becomes far more important than any strategic dialogue with us,” he states, adding that “SEB acts accordingly to solve the issues promptly”. Indeed, it might be said that it is only when something goes wrong that the treasurer finds out the true depth and value of its banking relationships.</p>
<p>But fairness in such a relationship must be a two-way street. Most banks operating in the corporate space look at the ‘share of wallet’ they are awarded by a client across a product set from a relationship pricing and relationship revenue point of view. If the bank knows it is getting a fair share of the corporate wallet, relative to other banks in the group, it will be more amenable to offering improved pricing. “For a specific product we can look at volumes or how deeply we are engaged with the customer across the bank,” explains Wade.</p>
<p>Most treasurers will have a method of working out the share of wallet to give to each bank, notes Meuli. Such a model will typically be led by an actively managed treasury policy. The discussion around which institutions should or should not be used is often one between the treasury HQ and its group entities, he notes. Indeed, prescription by HQ of which banks can be used may cause a “profound” discussion where, under the influence of the wallet-share programme, a long-term relationship is no longer supportable at a local level.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-a-better-deal"">Getting a better deal</h3>
<p>Local issues aside, it is important that bank and client reach a fair deal. “Just because a bank is a good customer service provider does not mean it is actually giving the client value for money,” says Wade. “I think it is quite normal, if you are paying a lot of money for a service, to know what you are paying for and to make sure you are paying the correct amount.”</p>
<p>When seeking a better deal, a certain amount of treasury tact and guile is required. “It does not make sense to haul your bank over the table; that does not work,” states Hugo van Wijk, a former banker and, for the past 15 years, CEO and founder of Vallstein, a vendor of ‘wallet-sizing’ and bank relationship management technology. But, he adds, there is also absolutely no need to give the bank an “excessive return”.</p>
<p>Typically, fees are set within the system and charged automatically to an account on a ‘local billing’ basis. In isolation they may make little impact on corporate cash, en masse the amount seems rather more consequential. The realisation of just how much it is paying in fees may lead the treasurer to try to negotiate costs. For Krishnan, key leverage items for corporates typically include the ability to commit large volumes of transactions and to maintain significant net daily or average balances.</p>
<p>The key to success in any quest for fee reduction, says van Wijk, is to understand that it makes no sense to try to drive down the fee for every single item (not least because there may be upwards of 1,000 different price points in a bank’s international cash management offering alone). “Only pick out the most relevant,” he advises. “If a company uses a lot of international wire transfers or domestic direct debits then these will be the components to negotiate on – just accept the others.”</p>
<p>How much of a reduction to expect is a moot point. “We are often asked what ‘best practice’ pricing is for certain products,” says van Wijk. “Our standard reply is ‘zero’, because sometimes a corporate can get its bank to waive fees on an individual product.” However, he adds, “it is very important for a treasurer trying to get a grip on banking fees to negotiate only in the context of the overall relationship”. Fairness is, after all, relationship-driven.</p>
<p>The problem here is that whilst the total relationship has a value – how much the client spends in a fixed period – checking and analysing every billable item is essential to be able to accurately plan the share of wallet and conduct an assessment of fair pricing. This is more complex than it first seems, particularly where non-standard pricing is applied.</p>
<p>Out of the hundreds of billable items a bank will offer (and potentially thousands of price points), where a client negotiates a lower price on, for example, just 20 of these, if that client has accounts with the bank in five different countries across 15 different legal entities, billing complexity soon mounts. “Historically, the structuring of banking fees has been constrained by the capabilities of the underlying core systems,” says Krishnan. “Hence, when it comes to introducing new products, banks have to add yet more product variations because they cannot flexibly handle these through product parameterisation; their product real estate has become increasingly unwieldy and complex to manage.”</p>
<p>SEB has a single billing platform (miRevenue from Zafin) and is progressively migrating business units, customers, products and billing data onto it. Such an investment, says Wade, is about gaining control over the process which is good news for bank and client because where previously there was a somewhat “scattered” approach to pricing and billing, now it is unified. “Everything now is much more transparent; customers should expect to see exactly what they are paying for.” In addition to improved pricing flexibility across the bank’s business, Durelius explains that it also enables customers to import and export billing data into and out of their own systems with greater ease.</p>
<h3 id=""unified-billing-codes-twist-afp-and-camt086"">Unified billing codes: TWIST, AFP and camt.086</h3>
<p>For a corporate to know precisely what it is paying for, importing detailed electronic reporting from a bank directly into an ERP, TMS or Account Analysis package is beneficial. There are currently two models of detailed electronic statement that banks may adopt: the TWIST (Transaction Workflow Innovations Standards Team) Bank Services Billing (BSB) initiative and US EDI 822. The Association of Finance Professionals (AFP) domestic AFP Service Codes is used with the EDI 822 and its broader counterpart, the AFP Global Service Codes (the latter was designed specifically to work with the BSB format).</p>
<p>General Electric (GE) was the first corporate to use the BSB back in 2007, receiving billing data from Danske Bank. To date 14 major banks (BofAML, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Danske Bank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, J.P. Morgan, RBS, SEB, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered Bank and UniCredit) and around 100 corporates use it.</p>
<p>With the appropriate software at the corporate end, data using AFP and BSB models can be received, reconciled and analysed right down to individual line items. Most of the major ERP and TMS vendors (and a couple of specialist IT firms) can configure their systems to process the extra data.</p>
<p>In explaining the benefits of a common billing code, Paul Burstein, formerly managing director of GE’s Treasury Strategic Initiatives team and for many years a leading light behind the TWIST initiative, says the bottom line is that it “allows for all kinds of checking on what banks are charging”. The level of insight goes beyond a treasury’s bank relationships, reaching into other operating units within the company – payroll, procurement or operating units for example. This, he notes, affords a view of how those other functions are using banking services, enabling treasury to optimise all bank relationships in line with policy and share of wallet, and enhancing the company’s understanding of its total level of exposure to each of its banks across the enterprise – an obvious risk management benefit.</p>
<p>Banks require a system to produce BSB data but corporates must have the right tools to process it too – treasurers could use an XML editor or Excel but to really get value out of BSB data Burstein says specialist software can be used to validate the billings and to analyse them.</p>
<p>The BSB is currently available in two versions: the original TWIST version (Version 3.1) and the ISO 20022 camt.086 version 1 message. The ISO 20022 BSB is currently undergoing a facelift, with many banks, corporates and vendors involved in an assessment of issues that have arisen in the version 1 implementation by banks and the message’s use for electronic invoicing. The current BSB version (3.1) is now fixed, Burstein says any future enhancements will only be made to the ISO 20022 version.</p>
<h3 id=""transparency-is-the-key"">Transparency is the key</h3>
<p>SEB’s Wade talked earlier about how shifting the billing function to a central platform could afford more transparency (and flexibility), but this is just one bank’s action. A more fundamental issue arises out of the debate around the fairness of bank fees – and that is whether it is desirable for banks and corporates to agree to a simplified fee structure. “Why should there be so many billable items in cash management? This is complexity from the past,” states van Wijk. The problem, he feels, could be removed altogether with a simplified approach to billing. Whilst any conversation must of course be mindful of the whole bank relationship picture, the real aim, he says, “is to eventually make the entire relationship transparent”.</p>
<p>This point is perhaps contentious and TWIST’s Burstein argues otherwise. “I think you will find that most banks would not want to limit how they bill and what they bill for – and most major corporates with a large relationship with a bank would want to be able to negotiate at a detail level.” The capabilities of a bank’s existing computer systems might also play a role in determining what can be billed and how. At the treasury end this is where bank relationship management software, such as Vallstein’s own ‘WalletSizing’ solution, Kyriba’s ‘Bank Relationship Management’, Zafin’s ‘miRevenue’ or Chesapeake’s ‘SmartAnalysis’, can help prepare the ground.</p>
<p>The ‘WalletSizing’ system, explains van Wijk, starts by examining where the corporate stands today in terms of bank fees, capturing total costs for the corporate and revealing the extent of its global wallet. The next stage indicates if fees agreed are indeed the fees applied – the BSB and AFP codes are clearly useful tools here too. The third stage assesses whether the best possible fee structure is in place or if certain inefficiencies exist in the way the wallet has been divided between the banks.</p>
<p>However it is achieved, analysis of bank billing should be ongoing, perhaps taking place every quarter or half year. “But don’t try to renegotiate every time,” warns van Wijk. It is also important, once a new pricing structure is agreed, that treasury monitors and controls it tightly, he adds. Far from creating tension between partners, he argues that the whole process actually creates stability in the relationship. “Once partners have this level of transparency, the corporate knows it is paying a fair price and that the agreed price is being observed, there is no need for it to shop around; for the next few years at least the bank is assured that it has a fair share of the corporate wallet.”</p>
<p>Clearly it is not all about the price. When seeking to explain how a corporate can derive value from a banking relationship, Durelius believes that the discussion should broaden out beyond a simple question of ‘how much’, to reach into areas such as how a certain product or solution can deliver upstream or downstream process efficiencies. “It might still be good value for money even if the naked cost is perceived as high,” he states. In this light, perhaps a refocus of priorities is required. “A company will pay a consultant hundreds of euros an hour in the blink of an eye, but an annual fee for a service from a bank may be deemed more challenging, even if it saves so much more over time.” This is the crux of the issue when considering fair fees: don’t just look at the price tag, consider the real value for both sides of the deal.</p>

<br/>
<p>Mark Tweedie has been with Citi for over 14 years and is the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Head of Corporate and Public Sector Sales, for Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS). EMEA is the largest region for TTS with a presence in over 50 markets. Tweedie is responsible for addressing the cash management, working capital, treasury and trade service /financing needs of clients across all sectors, through the mobilisation of the Citi infrastructure, resources and TTS solution set.</p>

<p>From Basel III to payments reform, the financial world is undergoing substantial change. While the need for a more stable regulatory environment that addresses the shortcomings of the pre-crisis years is undisputed, the impact of these changes on both corporates and banks is significant. Well-intentioned regulation is in many ways making it more difficult and more expensive to do business, and is threatening the ability of companies to leverage growth opportunities. Illustratively the new credit conversion factors in Basel III have been raised markedly forcing banks to keep more risk capital for Export Agency Financed transactions and Letters of Credit, in turn making such instruments more expensive for the end-client. Moreover the cost of compliance (relative to revenue) for smaller banks has gone from 5% in 2009 to 7% in 2013, with larger banks seeing their compliance cost: revenue ratio going from 1% to 2% in the same period.</p>
<p>The question, then, is how can corporates and banks work together to lessen the burden of the new regulatory order? How can collaboration create a stable future for transaction banking, thereby safeguarding companies’ financial and commercial flows? In a world of increasing digitisation and globalisation (heightened cross-border mobility of capital, labour and goods), national ring-fencing of balance-sheets and financial transaction taxes create inherent policy and practices conflicts.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-impact"">Regulatory impact</h3>
<p>Over the last five years, financial reform has been driven by two aims: achieving financial stability and improving consumer protection, standards and harmonisation. Under the ‘financial stability’ banner, the main measures include Basel III, bank recovery and resolution planning; whereas the latter covers everything from the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). The result is both opportunity (treasury transformation to maximise standardisation under SEPA XML with greater availing of payment on behalf of account and operating models) and threat, in the form of funding access and increased cost, with banks facing higher risk capital limits and Return on Risk Capital requirements.</p>
<p>Under Basel III, banks must rightly shore up their balance sheets, whilst certain reforms are decreasing attractiveness and thus returns on short-term cash. Trade finance is increasingly concentrating with the global leaders who have proven “supplier onboarding” pedigree and large asset distribution capacity.</p>
<p>While at first glance the outlook may seem bleak, positives are emerging from this change, says Mark Tweedie, Head of Sales EMEA, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Corporate and Public Sectors at Citi. “Basel III may be altering the availability of lending, but it’s also improving the quality, transparency and dialogue of lending decisions. It is critical that both borrower and lender are clear on what factors make the facility attractive. All parties realise that balance sheets have finite capacity and that returns are driven by ancillary flow and episodic business awards,” he explains.</p>
<p>“Banks and their corporate clients are being brought closer together through open discussion around the need for reciprocal relationships. Indeed, discussions between banks and their clients are going deeper than ever before and looking more at the genuine needs of each client’s business. Banks are now strategic partners, working ever more closely with the corporates to whom they lend, with wide relevance across multiple constituencies in the client office eg for full-service transaction banks; finance, treasury, procurement, sales finance, credit control, Shared Services, marketing, travel and business development.”</p>
<p>Basel III is prompting treasurers to keep a closer eye on their bank facilities ie revisiting the size of unused credit facilities and diversifying beyond overdrafts and general purpose loans, in order to avail of finely priced/shorter tenor working capital assets. “Corporates and banks are sitting together to determine the most appropriate way to fund operations, which can only be a positive step. At Citi we are collaborating with our clients’ treasury and tax teams to map legal entities, asset and cash flow exchanges, in order to better refine cash management and foreign exchange solutions,” says Tweedie.</p>
<h3 id=""a-stable-future-for-all"">A stable future for all</h3>
<p>This dialogue creates a more sustainable and meaningful business relationship for both parties. The business world recognises that transaction banks grease the wheels of global commerce. “It is our job to support complex client ecosystems by managing clearing, settlement and liquidity, therein enabling global buyers and sellers to facilitate international trade,” Tweedie notes.</p>
<p>“We provide liquidity through the supply chains of companies – upstream and downstream – and ultimately facilitate the free movement of cash which is the lifeblood of the global economy,” he adds. “Our aim is to provide a low-cost, highly efficient environment which allows businesses and society to prosper. There is a great deal of mutual benefit in what we as transaction banks, and our clients, are trying to achieve.”</p>
<p>In fact, says Tweedie, “corporate banking which encompasses transaction services, is at the core of the ‘socially useful’ banking concept, which has been the subject of much debate since the global financial crisis.” To illustrate this point, he cites two examples of Citi’s engagement in society.</p>
<p>The first is the bank’s work with Italy’s Istituto Nazionale per la Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the primary Italian government pension fund. INPS has 410,000 pensioners in 131 countries and is one of the largest pension funds in Europe in terms of overall pensions paid. The fund’s management team wanted to improve efficiency and control over these payments.</p>

<br/>
<p>“Governments have recognised that a number of their citizens relocate post-retirement to pastures new. We are working with the Italian pension fund, as we are with a number of governments, to provide adjacent services that help them to better manage their cross-border payment flows to expats,” he outlines. “We provide a complete payment service suite to INPS, based on Citi’s WorldLink global payment platform, along with value-added services including Proof of Life certification, central pensioner database management and an interactive website and call centre for INPS’ pensioners.</p>
<p>“In other words, we are enhancing the service provision and going beyond mere payment settlement business. Just look at the Proof of Life example – to prevent payments going out to deceased individuals, we issue annual forms for certification and manage the approval process to ensure that payments are only made to active beneficiaries. This saves the Italian state the time and inconvenience of having to recall the funds. Against a backdrop of ongoing fiscal austerity, we certainly see this as a socially useful service.”</p>
<p>The second example Tweedie refers to takes us from Italy to Africa, where Citi is working with almost 200 development sector organisations. “The Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in Africa are looking for more efficient ways to ensure that foreign aid and investment is being used effectively. They want to be satisfied that the donor flows are both tracked and monitored in terms of effectiveness,” he explains. In a banking context, this means increasing visibility, which creates greater accountability; and shifting from paper to electronic instruments, leading to increased control. “We are seeing the same needs in the Corporate space where illustratively in Nigeria we are assisting the airlines move from an instance of online booking with offline (physical) cash settlement, to an integrated model leveraging the new digital Faster Payments instant settlement system.”</p>
<p>Citi already has experience of doing this in other developing economies and is therefore well-placed to do so across Africa.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study"">Case study</h2>
<h3 id=""acf-and-citi-join-forces-to-support-flood-victims"">ACF and Citi join forces to support flood victims</h3>
<p><em>Action Against Hunger|ACF International (ACF) is a global humanitarian organisation committed to providing communities with access to safe water and nutrition. The organisation runs life-saving programmes in around 40 countries benefiting five million people each year.</em></p>
<p>In 2011, tropical storm Washi swept through the Philippines, bringing flooding and rainfall that killed more than 900 people. As part of its emergency intervention programme for the families affected by the storm, ACF needed to disburse funds within one month to more than 2,000 victims on behalf of a major donor. The funds were to be used exclusively to purchase food items from a specific retailer in order to ensure that donations were channelled towards alleviating hunger and preventing misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p>A customised Citi Prepaid Card programme, based on a closed-loop system, ensured that cards could be used only at the designated grocery store. In order to comply with the Philippines Central Bank’s Know Your Customer requirements, Citi and ACF developed a simple process whereby photographs of beneficiaries were used for identification.</p>
<p>The cards provided essential support to vulnerable families. While compliance with KYC rules can be frustrating, particularly in the absence of government issued identity cards, the solution suggested by Citi was convenient and could be implemented quickly, whilst complying with the relevant regulations.</p>

<h3 id=""improving-infrastructure"">Improving infrastructure</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, Tweedie says that Citi is seeing more and more global RFPs from clients wanting to understand how developments such as common monetary zones are leading to borderless banking. “Companies are looking to explore opportunities for rationalisation of bank accounts with global systemically important banks that have footprints across the key growth markets and a mantra of technological innovation and solution delivery.”</p>
<p>Citi has invested across Africa and was proud to be a lead sponsor of the March EuroFinance Africa, London Event. “We have also invested heavily in helping national banking bodies, and customers within the local markets to make the most of new technology and evolving payment methods.”</p>
<p>Citi acted in an advisory capacity around the Nigerian central bank’s move to a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS). And in Kenya, Citi has enabled both B2C and B2B mobile payments through advocating mPesa. According to Tweedie, “Banks such as Citi are helping the developing economies to leverage technologies for processes improvement, while enabling them to leapfrog the legacy steps and constraints that many developed markets are still struggling with.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-catalyst-for-change"">A catalyst for change</h3>
<p>The same rationale around seizing the opportunities that change brings – whether regulatory or innovation-driven – also applies to Citi’s work with corporates across the globe. “Right now, we are helping clients to use SEPA as a catalyst for change,” says Tweedie. “By educating clients on the wider benefits of SEPA, we are able to help them to streamline their euro bank account structures, improve their reconciliation rates, maximise DPO through payment warehousing, and improve their supplier’s experience via beneficiary advising.</p>
<p>At the same time, since SEPA uses the XML format, which is an industry standard, we are working with clients towards the adoption of a common interface. This will not only allow for vastly streamlined bank-to-corporate connectivity, but at a time of immense regulatory and political reform, will assist in lowering the cost of doing business.”</p>
<p>In addition to working towards standardisation of messaging formats, Tweedie believes that transaction banks have a responsibility to streamline and standardise client documentation, making it far more intuitive. This statement of intent is certainly being put into action at Citi. “In EMEA, on the back of our clients’ feedback, we have consciously and systematically reduced our local account conditions by 50%. We are also working to automate and digitise as many paper processes as possible. Working with our technology partners and our innovation labs we have created a common document taxonomy and internal search capacity to reduce duplicative client document requests. These changes will save time and money, while improving tracking and monitoring for everyone.”</p>
<p>“To that end, Citi is also introducing additional value-added services for clients, such as online audit certifications. “Clients need to provide certified statements at the end of the financial year and we have recognised a need for specialisation in that area. As such, we have a Direct Debit styled self-service site which provides audit confirmations. In the EMEA region this process only applies to Western Europe.”</p>
<p>This, says Tweedie, is all part of the bank’s increasing focus on self-service technologies. Such an approach minimises the need for contact with bank support staff and empowers clients to help themselves. “A lot of the queries we receive are around payment confirmations and statements and we are working very hard to equip clients with the answers to those queries via our technology. It is quicker, more efficient, more direct and leads to an improved client experience.”</p>
<p>Upgrades have been made to the Citi Direct e-banking platform. “Citi has upgraded the platform to enhance its functionality and improve its self-service elements. Rather than forcing clients to migrate with all the associated disruption, upgrades are less invasive but show clients rich new features in a controlled fashion. We recognise that clients have challenges interfacing with large banking institutions such as ourselves and we are committed to delivering the highest level of customer experience, so this is a key priority for us.”</p>
<p>“It is partially as a result of the regulatory environment, redefining rules and operating frameworks, that more candid and in-depth discussions have been taking place between banks and their clients. And as a result of these increasingly transparent relationships, corporates are providing more detailed and honest feedback to their banks around their end-to-end propositions. So, by driving collaboration, regulation is ultimately contributing to a better transaction banking experience. We know we have much work ahead but there is an institutional conviction to delighting our clients.”</p>

<h5 id=""gavin-jones-vice-president-deputy-treasurer-ahold"">Gavin Jones, Vice President, Deputy Treasurer, Ahold:</h5>
<p>At Ahold, our relationship bank group is based on the 14 banks participating in our revolving credit facility. To proactively manage that relationship we deploy two tools: a bank performance scorecard and a share-of-wallet calculation. Both are integrated into our six-monthly bank relationship reviews.</p>
<p>Our share-of-wallet calculation focuses on the revenue each bank has earned, broken down by product category, including payments, card and cash management, investments and derivatives, through to the more highly-prized capital markets transactions or merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) advisory. We either calculate the transaction fees actually paid to a bank or, in the absence of a fee, we have used a conservative assumption on what a piece of business is worth. For example, for a money market fund (MMF) investment, we’ll use the asset manager net fees to calculate an actual revenue stream. Whereas for a term deposit, we’ll make an assumption on how much a bank saves by taking our deposit, compared with borrowing the equivalent from the market.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange (FX) and interest rate swaps (IRS) derivatives are product areas where we use a revenue assumption. Our wallet model does not consider profitability, largely, as each bank has very different approaches on what costs and risk-adjusted returns they attach to a specific piece of ancillary business.</p>
<p>The main objective of the wallet is for us to proactively manage the relationship, so we classify banks into three categories: underfed; on target; and overfed, using revenue run rate approach. Critical to this is establishing a revenue target for each bank, so an integral part of the wallet process is having a transparent dialogue with our banks on their revenue expectations. We do this once a year with the relationship managers. Whilst our revenue calculation may not exactly match the banks internal assessment, we typically find we are in the same ball park.</p>
<p>Our share of wallet does provide useful insight in the structure and flexibility of our wallet, which strategically has allowed to shape the size, capability and composition of our bank group to ensure that banks revenue expectations can be serviced. Operationally, using both the model and performance scorecard, we can identify whether an increase or decrease in banks’ revenue can be attributed to a change in the product teams performance. Our relationship managers have reacted positively to the transparency and directional insight we can give, and this year we will be distributing the performance heat maps, so they can visually see how they are performing.</p>

<h5 id=""didier-vandenhaute-director-pwc-treasury-consulting-practice-belgium"">Didier Vandenhaute, Director, PwC Treasury Consulting Practice, Belgium:</h5>
<p>Over the past few years, banks have increasingly squeezed their corporate clients in order to secure a bigger share of their overall wallet. This has been a way for banks to meet the expected levels of return on capital employed imposed by their own boards. Quite often, corporate entities have not been in a position to provide banks with quantifiable arguments against further wallet sharing or have a constructive dialogue.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen corporate entities investing time and money in developing solutions to be able to actively manage wallet sharing, to different degrees of complexity. We have simplified below our view of the market into three categories, taking an incrementally more complex approach to the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Country allocation</h5>
<p>At the most simplistic end of the scale, corporate entities will allocate their business on a country/regional basis and compare the percentage of sales allocated to one bank to its share of the overall credit support provided to the group by all banks (participation in syndicated credit, bilateral committed lines, working capital and trade lines, FX lines, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Balanced allocation</h5>
<p>The corporate entity will go a step further and quantify the value of the wallet allocated to each bank per product (transactional fees, commissions, trade finance fees, etc). They will also actively balance the quantitative elements of the relationship against the quality of the relationship through a balanced scorecard (customer service, in-country support, implementation services and liquidity management). Finally, some corporate entities will use or set up their treasury management system (TMS) in a way that will better enable them to actively track the overall business and fees passing through the banks (using FXall or SAP, for example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Tactical asset allocation</h5>
<p>In this case, the corporate entity will put themselves as much as possible in their bank’s shoes and try to analyse the value of the relationship from the bank’s point of view. Corporate clients realise that Basel III has an impact on all banks, but in different ways depending on their balance sheet composition. As a result, the same corporate product might be priced differently from one bank to another. Based on these factors, the corporate client will make their own analysis per bank of the overall profitability generated through the relationship, and each product will be allocated to the bank that is best able to manage it, understanding the real value of this asset to each bank (‘golden asset’ management).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h4>
<p>If banks are not ready to open their books and share the revenue generated through the relationship and the return on capital employed, corporate clients will have to find ways to estimate their wallet and analyse how to best share it among their core banking partners. The better the corporate entity is able to value its wallet, the better they will be able to establish a longstanding and reciprocal relationship with their bank.</p>

<h5 id=""sander-van-tol-partner-zanders"">Sander van Tol, Partner, Zanders:</h5>
<p>The first division you can make is between direct fees and expenses and indirect ones. The direct fees are something for which you would normally receive an invoice, for example an agreement with the bank for cash management services that they deliver to you. Indirect fees, on the other hand, are those that are earned by the bank when you are, for example, trading derivatives.</p>
<p>This can make it difficult to see the actual fee. If you are depositing money with a bank, normally the bank may take a certain yield on that deposit, so you will assume a number of basis points on that deal. Therefore, the first thing that corporates are looking at is the split between direct and indirect fees.</p>
<p>A deeper analysis would involve not only looking at the gross fees or gross revenue that you pay to the bank, but to also consider the profitability of the revenue for the bank – and that can be very challenging to establish.</p>
<p>Another determinant could be whether the treasurer has a complete overview of all the business done with the banks. For example, if you look at multinationals it is quite difficult to have complete oversight of all the different banking relations, first of all, but also to see what your operating companies are actually doing. What you often see at the operating company level is that there are bilateral contracts between the operating company and the bank which are not known to the treasurer.</p>
<p>There are also contracts with banks which are not within the remit or scope of the treasurer – insurance is one example, but there are a lot of other services offered by banks that make it difficult for the treasurer to get a complete overview. Treasuries that have a more centralised structure can usually achieve a reasonably good overview; but for those who are organised in a more decentralised way, it is much more difficult to assess the total wallet.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>A banking relationship can be likened to a marriage: it is a long-lasting commitment, built on shared objectives, trust and respect; usually involves an extended selection process, or courtship; and both parties need to benefit in order for it to last. “And in both cases you should have a full prenuptial agreement in place,” quips a Senior Treasury Manager from a large consultancy firm, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers normally fall into two categories with regards to how they engage with their banks. There are those who have viewed banks solely as vendors of products and services, a ‘marriage of convenience’ in essence. Price is the sole driver in the relationship and they commonly play banks against each other in order to get the lowest fees possible. These corporates keep their business operations close to their chests and their banks very much on the outside.</p>
<p>The second type is comprised of those corporate treasurers who have taken a more holistic and forward-looking view of their businesses and relationships. These treasurers want to promote open and honest information sharing with their banks, and bring their relationship banks deep into their organisation. In addition, they are well aware that there needs to be a ‘win-win’ element to the relationship and that banks need to turn a profit too.</p>
<p>“In good times, those corporates that took a ‘vendor approach’ to their banks arguably had the upper hand,” says Carole Berndt, Head of Global Transaction Services EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill). “However, in tough times it’s the corporate treasurers who invested in the relationship that have the advantage. Their banking partnerships have brought more to their organisation by providing information, resources and consulting services, such as help with euro crisis planning and Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) readiness.”</p>
<p>Berndt believes that if previously the split was 60/40 in favour of the banks-as-vendors model, since the onset of the economic crisis the relationship model has become the prevailing one. This conversion has largely been driven because banks are now directly connecting corporate working capital credit facilities to cash management transactional business.</p>
<p>This is a knock-on effect of Basel III and return on capital pressures, which are forcing banks to review certain business areas. They find cash management a particularly attractive business because it is transactional and fee-generating. Therefore it stands to reason that if a bank is providing much-needed credit to a corporate, then they will also want a share of the corporate’s cash management business.</p>
<p>And credit is considered ‘much-needed’ by many corporates. Refinancing/ensuring availability of long-term funding and credit lines is treasurers’ top concern, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Treasury Survey 2012; therefore when a corporate is choosing a new cash management bank, it often picks one that is part of its credit relationship in order to give some business back.</p>
<p>Many corporates are now taking a keen interest in how they can deliver bank relationship information. In order to guide their decisions, today’s “savvier” treasurers are pulling together a much more detailed picture of their wallet, believes Steve Dwyre, Managing Director Global Corporates, Lloyds. “The most productive discussions we have happen when we perform account planning with a client, mapping out their entire banking wallet, where they spend their money and where financial institutions make money.”</p>
<p>Treasury consultancy Zanders also works with clients to map out their wallets, for example Royal FrieslandCampina, with striking results. The ‘wallet sizing’ model developed jointly included all the company’s worldwide banking partners and helped it to extend its €1 billion general purpose syndicated credit facility in the last quarter of 2011. FrieslandCampina used the model to prepare itself for one-on-one negotiations with its syndicated banking partners and resulted in its facility being extended out to August 2015 at substantially lowered margins.</p>
<p>However, as many are finding out, if the wallet is not proportioned out fairly, then this can lead to a difficult conversation when a corporate comes to renegotiate its credit lines, as the bank may decide to place its credit elsewhere.</p>
<p>The bank/corporate relationship is complex but if both sides can hit the right balance, it can prove to be a powerful stabilising and strengthening force in the current turbulent market.</p>

<h3 id=""a-how-to-manual-for-a-strong-relationship"">A how-to manual for a strong relationship</h3>
<p>It is worth noting that some banking relationships last longer than many marriages. One Assistant Treasurer from a large global food company reported that its banking relationships have been fairly stable over a number of years. “For example, our cash management providers have been unchanged (except for mergers) for more than 25 years,” he says. “Our top lenders have been the same since 2001.”</p>
<p>The company has a large banking group of more than 25 banks. “We see value in having a lot of relationships because it reduces the hole to fill if a bank drops out (in the case of a merger) or changes strategy,” he explains. “A downside to a large bank group is keeping them all happy from a fee perspective and the time it takes to meet with such a large number of banks.”</p>
<p>According to a June 2011 Financial Director Bank Survey, the majority of corporate clients that have maintained a stable relationship for at least five years (73%) are significantly less likely to switch banks. Asked why they did not intend to change banks, 54% explained that their loyalty was a result of general satisfaction with their banks, but there was also a sizeable number (51%) who cited the difficulties of switching as their reason to stay put. Almost one in five (19%) felt that switching banks would complicate transactions, while 13% thought the cost of switching was too high.</p>
<p>If breaking up is hard to do, what steps can treasurers and banks take to get the best out of their relationships? Dr. Mark Goulston, founder of CouplesCompany.com, argues that the foundation of a lasting partnership – although he means marriage, this can be applied in a corporate/bank relationship context – rests on six building blocks that form the acronym CREATE:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Chemistry.</p></li>
<li><p>Respect.</p></li>
<li><p>Enjoyment.</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptance.</p></li>
<li><p>Trust.</p></li>
<li><p>Empathy.</p></li>
</ol>
<h5 id=""chemistry"">Chemistry</h5>
<p>Chemistry is all about how well suited counterparts are in terms of business goals and approach. “Fit is a key element for a good banking client relationship,” explains Lloyds’ Dwyre.</p>
<p>In order to truly understand how well they fit together, corporates need to be open about their total wallet, business operating model and where the opportunities are. In return a bank also has to be clear as to what business lines are important to it and where it is operationally committed, as well as what it can and can’t do well.</p>
<p>In the turmoil caused by the economic crisis, many banks retrenched to home markets and have focused on just one or two core competencies. Honesty as to where the business is concentrated is much appreciated by corporates. For example, if a corporate is splitting its business between Europe and the US, a bank may decide to only bid for the US cash management business. Most corporates will not see this as a sign of weakness but an acknowledgement of where the bank’s strengths lie. Being honest and straightforward fortifies the relationship.</p>
<h5 id=""respect"">Respect</h5>
<p>Respect is demonstrated by how well a party listens to the other. Dwyre agrees that the quality of a relationship directly correlates to the richness of dialogue. “In a marriage, if you are not talking then things aren’t going to go well. A good quality relationship allows for the two parties to connect, identify what’s really vital and work through it together,” he says.</p>
<p>For a treasurer it is essential to have a bank that understands the corporate, its business processes, drivers and operations. Importantly, this includes listening to what it needs. “Corporates say that the best banks are the ones that really make an effort to understand what their business is and to be proactive in offering advice,” according to David Kelin, Partner at Zanders UK LLP.</p>
<h5 id=""enjoyment"">Enjoyment</h5>
<p>Enjoyment is all about the people and very often it is key bankers that really cement the relationship – those people that go the extra mile and show the same level of commitment in a client’s business as the corporate itself. Corporates want to have a hotline to one person at the bank that can make things happen when something goes wrong – and most admit that they would pay extra for this immediate responsiveness.</p>
<p>If those key people leave, then that could potentially pose a problem for the relationship. The consultancy’s Assistant Treasurer says: “Stability of personnel is important. As they begin to understand your needs, it is crucial that the team remains in place to continue to provide suitable ideas over an extended period.”</p>
<!-- nextpage -->
<h5 id=""acceptance"">Acceptance</h5>
<p>Acceptance is about feeling welcomed as you are, as opposed to having to prove yourself. It is essential to get to the place where both corporate and bank are able to speak openly and frankly (within the parameters of the business). Sharing information avoids misunderstanding, as things are not left unsaid or implied.</p>
<p>“Through that frank exchange of information, which only happens when you trust each other and this comes back to partnership and relationship, you can then broker an agreement or understanding of where value exists for both parties and what mutual support is needed to make it work,” says BofA Merrill’s Berndt.</p>
<h5 id=""trust"">Trust</h5>
<p>Trust is a dominant theme in any relationship. It takes seconds to destroy trust and years to rebuild it.</p>
<p>With the current climate in mind, treasurers are placing more emphasis on the reputation and overall positioning of their banking partners. “Corporates want to see a credible strategy, a strong balance sheet and commitment from their banks,” says Dwyre. “They need trust in the individuals they’re dealing with but also the bank as an institution, particularly in this market environment – corporates want to be sure that their banking partner is here to stay.”</p>
<p>It is trust that gets a relationship through the rocky patches. “The true test of a relationship is if one stands by the other when the going gets tough,” says Berndt. “There are times when we have to make tough decisions around client selection and support. And without exception when we reached the brink of a critical decision, the tenure, transparency and depth of relationship are the biggest factors as to whether or not we are able to commit to the transaction.”</p>
<h5 id=""empathy"">Empathy</h5>
<p>Empathy is about understanding, attention and care. When corporates put business out to tender, some ask that a relationship bank be brought into the tender process, even if the bank isn’t known for that specific task. In this sense, the bank is not excluded from the process but given the opportunity not to tender.</p>
<p>From a relationship point of view, it is important that a bank is shown what a company is doing in its tender process and also gives it a chance if it has recently expanded its offerings. “For example, if a traditional cash management bank creates a debt capital markets team and wants to lead a bond deal, when normally we wouldn’t have seen them in that role,” explains the food company’s Assistant Treasurer. “Banks may not like to be pigeon-holed for certain services, but our return model is based on banks earning fees in some areas and leaving fees to other banks in other areas.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-spark-innovation"">The spark: innovation</h3>
<p>What is omitted from the CREATE model is innovation, which is vital for a lasting and durable relationship. A happy marriage is not just about the boring, everyday routine, but also continual change, development and spontaneity in the relationship.</p>
<p>In the corporate world, treasurers probably look more for proactiveness in their relationship banking partners than spontaneity per se. As treasurers are busy doing their day-to-day work, they would like their relationship banks to think ahead and proffer advice for future challenge, or in the case of a sudden event, to respond swiftly to help them through the crisis. For example, when the Arab Spring uprisings spread to Egypt, Citi reacted by setting up a response team to bridge the gap between in-country teams and overseas parent companies. From a technological perspective, the bank linked all the local systems, so that the team could see any transactions that were delayed or stuck due to infrastructural changes on the ground, which allowed the bank to give informed responses crucial to its clients’ business.</p>
<p>A corporate with a strong banking relationship in place can take advantage of such bank-led innovations, as well as working together with the bank to develop new initiatives. For the Assistant Treasurer at the food company, “innovative ideas that reflect our needs and understand our situation” is the single most important factor for him when deciding on core relationships.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the shift to a more relationship-focused model is also driving co-operation between banks. “In response to a major client, we are now working with one of our competitor banks to architect a solution unique to that client,” says BofA Merrill’s Berndt. “This is only possible when a corporate treasurer is open with its banking partners, by engaging and bringing us into what is happening in his business. He is effectively getting more from the two banks working together to solve the problem, than he would were he to deal with us individually. Plus he will obtain a solution that is game-changing for his business.”</p>

Choosing a treasury management system,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When it comes to choosing a treasury management system (TMS), the treasury team is faced with a number of decisions. In this article, we explain how to get the best out of the selection process.</p>
<h3 id=""the-systems-landscape"">The systems landscape</h3>
<p>If ever proof were needed that keeping tabs on cash is imperative for businesses both large and small, the credit crisis provided compelling evidence. It has never been more important to maintain visibility over cash and liquidity positions than it is today.</p>
<p>Whereas in the past the humble spreadsheet was often used for this purpose, treasurers today have access to a more sophisticated range of treasury management systems. These systems consist of a suite of software applications that facilitate the management of all aspects of treasury – from cash and liquidity management to FX and transaction accounting. The big three providers of TMSs are SunGard, Wall Street Systems, and IT2, but there are a number of smaller, regional players operating in the market.</p>
<p>In addition, ERP systems like Oracle and SAP offer treasury modules which can provide much of the functionality of a TMS. When selecting a TMS, treasurers of companies which are already using an ERP system may wish to consider the ERP treasury module alongside standalone treasury management systems.</p>
<p>TMS vendors offer both client-hosted and vendor-hosted solutions so it is useful to have in mind the architecture of the required system. Although the client-based solutions are still the standard means of deploying a TMS, corporates are increasingly turning to vendor-hosted systems – namely, application service provider (ASP) and ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) solutions. With these vendor hosted solutions, the TMS doesn’t physically reside at the client’s premises. As the name suggests, they are hosted by the vendor.</p>
<p>While the two solutions share this characteristic, they differ in one important aspect. ASP solutions provide the user with their own TMS software and are hosted on a per-customer basis. With a SaaS solution, on the other hand, the software and the associated database are shared by a pool of the vendor’s customers. Their individual data and instance of the TMS software are separated by security software.</p>
<h3 id=""know-yourself"">Know yourself</h3>
<p>Once the IT budget has been secured and the go-ahead has been given, the preliminary commissioning stages can commence. In these early stages it is important to carry out a full review of the company’s treasury department, systems, and its technology.</p>
<p>Whether the treasurer is choosing a TMS for the first time or reviewing the current system, it is important to keep a few key points in mind. A thorough assessment of the current system is essential. This will allow the project leader to get a good feel of the current set-up and its benefits and drawbacks. It is at this stage, too, that an inventory of the technology within the department might be done.</p>
<p>Once the failings of the current TMS have been identified, the next step is to consider carefully what the future needs of the department will be.</p>
<p>“What a lot of corporates do is look at their existing process and ask, ‘what am I doing now?’ They send out laundry lists of requirements on what they’re doing right now. They’re not stepping back for a minute and realising they’re going into the market for a reason,” says Tom Nelson, Cash Management Specialist, Wall Street Systems.</p>
<p>Without a good understanding of the current system’s failings and the ‘must-haves’ for the new system, it is easy to botch the process at an early stage.</p>
<p>“The last thing you want to do is put a band-aid on today’s problem as before you know it, you’ll be looking for a new system,” says Brent Callinicos, VP and Treasurer at Google. “It is harder, of course, to define your longer-term strategy and choose a system based on that. It is also harder to sell this internally, but it is very much worth the effort.”</p>
<h3 id=""defining-requirements"">Defining requirements</h3>
<p>If these preliminaries have been carried out properly, a requirements definition document should be easy to draw up. This document will provide an outline of the treasury’s requirements and provides an opportunity to flesh out the company’s TMS needs. It is important to speak to stakeholders on the periphery of the treasury department, too, in order to establish a well-rounded picture of the current system.</p>
<p>Once the requirements have been determined, the next step is to start looking at the TMS market to see which vendors might be able to meet the company’s requirements. The number of vendors from which information is solicited at this initial stage really depends on the company’s specific requirements. However, four to six prospective vendors is usually about right.</p>
<p>Between drawing up the requirements definition and the next stage, the request for information, it is important to glean as much information as possible about the solutions offered by short-listed suppliers and how successfully they have bedded-in at other companies. Conferences and trade literature are the best source of this information.</p>
<h3 id=""request-for-information-rfi"">Request for information (RFI)</h3>
<p>An RFI is typically a short document that invites TMS vendors to provide more information about their solutions. The RFI should include an overview of the treasury function, including details of its needs, and a brief description of the larger business.</p>
<p>At this stage, those providers who are unable to meet the company’s key requirements can be eliminated from the process.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, vendors can be invited to demonstrate how their systems work in the flesh. This is typically a half-day presentation in which the vendor shows their TMS operating under real-life circumstances and gives the treasurer an opportunity to ask questions while the system is up and running.</p>
<p>For example, if an FX web interface is required for the company’s subsidiaries, then the treasurer should ensure that the look, feel and functionality of the interface are suitable for the company’s needs. If this is not the case, the vendor can be removed from the shortlist.</p>
<p>The responses received during this process will give the treasurer a better appreciation of the TMS landscape. At this point, it should be possible to draw up a shortlist of two or three vendors. It is then time to move on to the next stage of the TMS selection procedure: the request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<h3 id=""request-for-proposal-rfp"">Request for proposal (RFP)</h3>
<p>The RFP is a more comprehensive document than the RFI. It should describe in some detail the treasury’s specific requirements and should outline the strengths and weaknesses of the current system.</p>
<p>Questions that may be asked in the RFP include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How will the implementation be managed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What sort of team will install the system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long will the implementation take?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who will lead the implementation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of systems support do you provide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where are your support centres situated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you issue updates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of TMS training do you provide?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Define how much customisation you need,” suggests Brent Callinicos. “There are more vendors that offer one-size fits all models than those that customise. Time spent fully vetting the flexibility of the vendor upfront will avoid frustration later.”</p>
<p>It is a good idea at this stage to draw up a scoring matrix which can be applied to the responses received. This will make the final decision that much easier.</p>
<p>The scores of the competing TMSs are usually tallied up on a spreadsheet. It is often the case that a treasury team will draw up a set of weightings that they can apply to the various scores so they can keep an eye on their priorities.</p>
<h4 id=""workshop"">Workshop</h4>
<p>At this stage, it is good practice to set up a workshop in which the treasurer can test-drive the shortlisted systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This workshop should be built around the treasury’s specific needs and should follow a predefined agenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vendor should be given ample time to set up the workshop so that the test systems are ready to process the required data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify which TMS modules you are particularly interested in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the kind of data you would like to see the modules fed with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TMSs can be vast systems with numerous modules and plug-ins, so it is important to keep them focused on the specific areas that are being evaluated in order to avoid being overwhelmed with too much information.</p>
<p>The workshop should include all stakeholders, not just the treasury team. This means that it might be a good idea to include the CFO and IT department at this stage of proceedings so that they can have their say in the direction the system is taking.</p>
<p>During the workshop it is important to ask questions about the TMS while it is working, about how the vendor expects to execute and manage the implementation of the TMS.</p>
<p>The end of the workshop is an opportune time to ask the vendors for references from companies who are already using the TMS. These can provide a good understanding of how the system bears up under real-life conditions. In order to be relevant, the references should be from companies in a similar industry.</p>
<p>The issue of updates and support should also be addressed at this time. If 24 hours a day TMS support is needed, is the provider able to meet your needs? Does the vendor have support centres in the countries in which your treasury department operates?</p>
<h3 id=""outside-help"">Outside help</h3>
<p>Navigating the waters of TMS selection can be a daunting task for a treasury department. It is therefore sometimes advisable to bring in outside help in the shape of an external TMS selection adviser.</p>
<p>He or she will know the ins and outs of selecting and installing TMSs and should be in a position to help the treasurer to optimise the RFI and RFP processes. Importantly, too, the consultant will also be able to cut through the sales patter of the vendors and pinpoint which of the prospective providers meets the treasury’s requirements.</p>
<h3 id=""reaching-a-decision"">Reaching a decision</h3>
<p>After the workshop, the information submitted in the RFP responses should be evaluated, together with feedback from the workshops and the supplier’s pricing proposals. The treasurer should now be in a position to select the most appropriate TMS for the company’s needs.</p>
