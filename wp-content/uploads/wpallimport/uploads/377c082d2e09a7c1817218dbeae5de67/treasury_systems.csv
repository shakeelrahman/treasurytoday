<p>Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase commercial banking published an article suggesting that many treasury and finance organisations assume a TMS can solve all their operational cash management issues and referring to the availability of niche alternatives that can alleviate the cost burden and long implementation timelines associated with a traditional TMS.</p>
<p>Even TMS vendors accept that standalone components make sense for addressing specific issues, which is why Kyriba has opened its unified platform to third parties. However, they also suggest that clients see software proliferation as a pain point, particularly in relation to security and data management.</p>
<p>In simple terms, multiple standalone components are generally seen as more relevant for large organisations which handle specific types of transactions that can be quite complex and involve large volumes.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized corporates tend to handle simpler transactions with less volume and their financial resources are more limited. As a result, they are more likely to opt for a single treasury management system.</p>
<p>Many of the reasons for using a single TMS platform (convenience, cost, lack of internal IT skills) are as relevant now as they have ever been and likewise there have long been corporates with the motivation and resources to supplement their core TMS with specific standalone components.</p>
<p>“As such components become more freely available, cheaper and easier to connect, they will appeal to more corporate treasuries,” says Adrian Rodgers, Director of treasury consultancy ARC Solutions. “However, the number of treasuries that need to assemble a boutique suite of applications will remain relatively small.”</p>
<p>Patricia Hines, Head of Corporate Banking at Celent refers to two distinct trends in this space – TMS providers expanding their functionality into adjacent spaces (such as Kyriba supply chain finance); and adjacent players expanding their functionality into TMS (for example, HighRadius receivables automation and Coupa payables automation offering TMS features, and Axletree SWIFT Service Bureau offering treasury automation).</p>
<p>Anil Khurmi, Manager at treasury consultancy Zanders describes the option of using a stable of best of breed standalone treasury solutions as an increasingly viable alternative to the established model of using an all-in-one TMS.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Case study</h2>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/zurichinsurancegrouplogohorizontalsvg2.png?la=en&amp;hash=95BCF937D686E3BDB836C657221AC05B""><img alt=""zurich logo"" height="""" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/zurichinsurancegrouplogohorizontalsvg2.png?la=en&amp;hash=95BCF937D686E3BDB836C657221AC05B"" title=""zurich logo"" width=""150""/></a></p>
<p>From working with a simple set of accounts and a small number of banks – taking data from a number of internal entities – Zurich North America’s treasury function underwent rapid growth. This resulted in the function becoming the shared centre of excellence for cash and banking activities across the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The treasury function now supports numerous business divisions with cash across half a dozen core banks. This growth created challenges establishing cash positions on a daily basis and underlined the value of the payment functionality provided by the treasury management system supplied by GTreasury.</p>
<p>“The system has reduced our dependency on using individual bank websites and enabled us to manage corporate loans and short-term investments as well as payments,” explains Sandra Telles, Treasury Operations Manager at Zurich North America.</p>
<p>The attraction of working with a single TMS was its ability to be a hub for cash management activities such as payments, cash forecasting, bank fees, and cash accounting activities.</p>
<p>“The breadth of the functionality allowed us to eliminate a bank fee vendor, import investment balances from multiple partners, and support the implementation of cash postings, all which contributed to reduced expenses and centralisation of data and processes into one simplified solution,” says Telles. “We like the ability to do our treasury funding and investment payments within one system whilst also booking the activity within a single system.”</p>
<p>As head of operations, Telles says she is regularly approached by other TMS vendors as well as fintechs offering standalone solutions. The company actively supports fintechs that have developed relationships with its TMS and ERP systems.</p>
<p>“Supporting new vendors through our treasury management system will make it easier to implement data feeds and/or payment files in a more cost-effective way at an accelerated pace,” she says. “Most organisations have resources constraints when it comes to IT support, so being able to use a single TMS solution to support new business needs will continue to keep Zurich agile with respect to automation and reduces the work effort needed from our ERP system.”</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“This evolution is driven by an increasing number of fintechs disrupting the market with competitively priced standalone products, coupled with technological advances which help to mitigate the risks previously associated with running multiple systems,” he says.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the TMS vendor market continues to go through significant consolidation. Some of the key drivers for this include the fact that large scale clearly supports, amongst other things, the ability to deliver niche capabilities on top of the core solution.</p>
<p>Whilst newer, smaller vendors face challenges – not least those presented by the ever-changing regulatory landscape – the accelerating pace of technological advance is having a significant positive impact on the supply of lower cost, specialised solutions available to corporates.</p>
<p>That is the view of Andrew Hollins, Director of Corporate Treasury Proposition at Refinitiv, who identifies two notable trends that have emerged from these developments.</p>
<p>“On the one hand we have seen growth in cloud-based, full service TMS solutions targeted at mid-sized, often regional corporates,” he says. “Common features of these SaaS solutions include low cost, standardisation of capability, and the absence of customisation. This can be sufficient for a company with less sophisticated, less complex treasury requirements.”</p>
<p>It is also apparent that larger corporates are examining their deployed TMS spend far more rigorously. With a deployed system, it can be the case that multiple modules provide support across a range of critical treasury functions such as cash and liquidity management, payments, and risk management.</p>
<p>With the growing availability of agile, cloud-based solutions which are able to supplant certain deployed TMS modules, companies are increasingly able to make a call regarding the degree to which certain modules are ‘core’ to their particular operation and business model. As a consequence they may choose to replace a costly deployed TMS module with a lighter, cheaper, and more targeted alternative.</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source"">Adrian Rodgers, Director, ARC Solutions</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>According to Hollins, hedge accounting, cash flow forecasting, benchmark interest rates transition, and even collateral management can be candidates for a lighter alternative, supporting capital markets and hedging portfolios.</p>
<p>“By adding an interface to the company’s ERP system it is also possible to consider enterprise-wide risk analysis encompassing value at risk, cash flow at risk, liquidity/working capital optimisation, and supply chain financing solutions,” he says. “On the latter point, there is a notable trend towards the automation of receivables and supply chain financing leading to a growing number of disrupter platforms supporting this workflow.”</p>
<p>Where they are available, APIs simplify setup and are lower cost connectivity channels. Finastra uses APIs to connect its treasury management solution with FX dealing platform 360T and its confirmation matching service, for example.</p>
<p>The use of APIs enabling data sharing between systems has had some impact on the resources required to manage interfaces between these individual treasury solutions according to Hines, who notes that SAP has improved its connectivity tools and SaaS-based TMS providers including Kyriba and GTreasury are beginning to launch API portals.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous opportunity for those solutions that support open banking given that they can leverage APIs to incorporate data from multiple solutions into a single dashboard suggests Manoj Mishra, Vice President of Consulting Services at CGI. “Institutions able to leverage APIs to provide a unified experience using niche fintechs wherever it makes sense will emerge as the ultimate winners,” he says.</p>



<blockquote><p>The concept of an all-in-one treasury solution was a nice idea decades ago but that model and strategy is no longer scalable.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>But API readiness still varies by bank and technology provider, creating a general lack of global standardisation and maintaining demand for channels such as SWIFT. In addition, the buyer will still be working with multiple suppliers for installation, integration and ongoing product support cautions Ken Lillie from treasury consultancy Lillie Associates.</p>
<p>“Every system project and requirement definition is different, so corporates need to complete a thoroughly researched requirements definition,” he says. “They should also look at the market to see what products are available to meet those requirements – including TMS and standalone – examine each option for functionality and efficiency, and compare the overall price and ongoing cost of ownership.”</p>
<p>When asked whether the lower cost of using an all-in-one system outweighs any compromise involved in using systems that don’t deliver all the required functionality at a time, Khurmi says corporates need to balance total cost of ownership against functional fit.</p>
<p>“The use of multiple solutions is often assumed to be more costly and cumbersome, although recent developments – such as SaaS cloud deployment, single sign-on and the use of APIs for data integration between systems – means this may no longer be the case,” he says.</p>
<p>Additional considerations in the choice of approach include training requirements, user experience, vendor support and relationship management. “These are all areas that are adversely impacted when using multiple platforms, so it is important the benefits of enhanced functionality outweigh these factors,” adds Khurmi.</p>
<p>In some cases it makes sense for TMS vendors to expand functionality, for example in areas such as cash forecasting where ION Treasury has applied machine learning to its treasury forecasting capability. In other cases, providing integration with specialised solutions will be the preferred option, such as if a company is looking for greater automation of its investment activities.</p>
<p>Specialised solutions put pressure on treasury management providers to strengthen their own functionality in those areas, says Steve Wiley, Vice President of Treasury Solutions at FIS.</p>
<p>“In evolutionary terms, treasury management systems which have received continual investment over the past 20 years have evolved to a point where they can do most or all of what specialised or best-of-breed solutions can do,” he explains. “Newer treasury management systems struggle and are forced to partner with ecosystem players to establish stronger integration.”</p>
<p>Treasury management providers are focusing on both building and partnering according to Tracy Kantrowitz, Vice President of Market Treasury at Bottomline Technologies.</p>
<p>“The concept of an all-in-one treasury solution was a nice idea decades ago but that model and strategy is no longer scalable,” she suggests. “Treasury management system providers must invest in both core treasury functionality and digital services that allow them to integrate and cooperate with other solutions.”</p>
<p>Treasury management systems need to support wider functionality as the market trend amongst banks, TMS providers and fintechs is to aggregate and consolidate financial services offerings with the systems used to support the business, adds Eric Aillet, Product Manager Fusion KTP at Finastra. “The distinction between each will reduce over time as the value chain is consolidated,” he says.</p>
<p>The trend for fintechs to develop solutions focused on specific treasury functions might suggest that treasury management systems need to offer wider functionality, but that is not the only factor in purchasing decisions. Hines concludes that a corporate might choose a standalone component because of its lower cost of ownership.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Ensuring that the optimal treasury systems and processes are in place is an exercise that requires continuous effort. Even if a treasury’s processes are efficient to start with, complexity and fragmentation can arise over time as a result of M&amp;A activity or organic growth, leading to a collection of manual and inconsistent processes. Likewise, technology infrastructures that evolve over a number of years can result in a collection of disparate systems that may not integrate well with each other.</p>
<p>Outdated processes can make it difficult to move forward with other initiatives to improve treasury. The EACT’s 2020 Treasury Insights survey, which gauged the views of 200 treasury professionals across Europe, identified difficulties in standardising processes/controls as the top challenge when it comes to treasury centralisation, cited by 43% of respondents. And as well as being inefficient, suboptimal processes and systems can also leave treasury teams vulnerable to the risk of fraud and human error.</p>
<p>Added to this, the COVID-19 pandemic and the switch to working from home arrangements have prompted many treasurers to look critically at the systems and processes currently in place, and to ask whether these are robust enough to support treasury activities during this period of significant change.</p>
<h4 id=""optimisation-in-a-covid-19-environment"">Optimisation in a COVID-19 environment</h4>
<p>Keeping on top of existing systems and processes requires time and effort from the treasurer – but as the pandemic continues, treasurers have been focusing squarely on the need for processes that are not only effective, but also flexible enough to serve them in a working from home environment. At the same time, recent developments in technology are bringing new opportunities for optimisation that may not have been available a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Among the many implications of the COVID-19 crisis on treasury teams, the widespread adoption of home working has curtailed opportunities for in-person collaboration. As Paul Bramwell, Principal &amp; Founder at Treasury Tech Advisory, explains: “One of the aspects of business life that was immediately impacted by Covid was the ability to scrum a problem in the office where a team could easily just jump into a meeting room and troubleshoot a problem.” He adds that while there are “some great tools” available, none is as effective as being able to collaborate in person – “and this has led to a greater reliance on systems to simply get it right first time.”</p>
<p>Likewise, says Bramwell, old paper-based workflows have “become somewhat obsolete and difficult to maintain” when treasury staff can’t readily step into someone else’s office to go through a report or analyse data quickly. “To cope with the fact everyone has been remote, and the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) became permanent, there has been a significant focus on improving systems, workflow and, just as important, controls,” he comments.</p>
<p>Carl Sharman, Head of Treasury Technology Advisory at Deloitte, likewise notes the impact of the crisis on treasurers’ optimisation efforts. When it comes to finding ways to reduce costs or save time, he says, “It’s now less about what a business can gain operationally, and more about protecting what a business cannot afford to lose.” Where specific examples are concerned, Sharman cites the inability to get fast, accurate and reliable decision-making data on cash positions, as well as the risk of unsecure processes – “especially regarding payments, as more and more staff work outside the office and on portable devices.” As such, he says, the decision is not only about the potential costs involved in optimising systems and processes, but also “whether you can afford not to invest.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-goals-of-optimisation"">The goals of optimisation</h4>
<p>When setting out to optimise processes, it’s important to have a clear understanding of what those processes are intended to achieve in the first place. “The goal of creating and documenting processes within the treasury function is to make sure data flow for decision making is consistent and holistic,” says Bramwell. “Processes are also a means of ensuring efficiency and adequacy of controls to prevent error and fraud.”</p>
<p>In the past, processes have tended to be paper-based with a heavy reliance on physical sign-offs – but as Bramwell notes, this is much more difficult to achieve in a working from home environment, which has pushed companies to “rely far more on their technology to manage the processes within treasury. As processes have been revisited in the new Covid environment, the technology underpinning them has needed to be agile to accommodate any changes,” he adds. “This is where a lot of companies have realised that what they have is sub-optimal.”</p>
<h4 id=""optimisation-in-action"">Optimisation in action</h4>
<p>So what does optimisation look like in practice? Sharman argues that in the past, companies often focused on achieving a ‘world class’ approach – but today, the emphasis is more on adopting systems and processes that are ‘fit for purpose’, or the best fit for the organisation. “Treasurers want to sleep at night knowing that the assets of the business are secure, and threats are minimised,” he adds.</p>
<p>Where specific opportunities for improvement are concerned, Sharman cites back office-type operations which may previously have been outsourced to reduce costs – “either internally (shared service centres) or externally (outsourced).” He adds, “The opportunities for automated matching, reconciliation and posting are growing – therefore giving treasury departments the opportunity to improve and harmonise data and processes, and re-integrate ownership back to the centre.”</p>
<p>Bramwell points out that policies and procedures are typically signed off by a governance group, and audited for efficiency on a regular basis. “Whilst Covid has been incredibly disruptive, the underlying principle behind most firms’ processes has remained sound, whereas the technology supporting them has found to be lacking,” he says. “Technology, therefore, yields the greatest opportunity to optimise workflow, reporting and controls.”</p>
<p>He notes that most vendors, system integrators and advisory firms offer services to rationalise and improve the technology within a treasury function – “very often even managing to generate a positive ROI, while simultaneously improving the technology landscape, process adaptation and controls.”</p>
<h4 id=""obstacles-to-optimisation"">Obstacles to optimisation</h4>
<p>However, treasurers may have to overcome certain obstacles before optimisation can be pursued. According to Bramwell, the most common of these is budget: “There are external and internal costs associated with reviewing the existing landscape and putting into place any recommended solutions and actions.”</p>
<p>That said, one silver lining of the Covid work environment is that treasurers and CFOs have “a heightened awareness of the power of technology and, most importantly, the need to have the right solution, properly implemented and managed.” This, says Bramwell, “has released budget constraint.”</p>
<p>Deloitte’s Sharman adds that resistance to embracing change and new technology can also hinder companies’ optimisation efforts – and that leading the way by adopting the latest technology in an innovative way is rarely smooth. In addition, he says, “a simple ‘fear of the unknown’ of new innovations such as machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) leads to layered approval processes, and decision makers not willing or confident enough to release budget. This can limit treasury investment in innovation, or even as a ‘fast follower’.”</p>
<p>For George Dessing, Executive Vice President, Treasury &amp; Risk at Wolters Kluwer, most of the challenges that arise in changes to systems or processes “can be explained by the people who use them being unwilling to change their behaviours.” He adds, “Some people fear optimisation, but we in Wolters Kluwer welcome it, and we embrace change. There is a great culture towards continuous improvement and innovation within Wolters Kluwer, which is more than half of the battle.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-path-to-optimisation"">The path to optimisation</h4>
<p>When it comes to embarking on an optimisation initiative, Bramwell says his advice would be to take external counsel. “This external counsel can be obtained through peer groups, local treasury associations, and more specifically the many advisory and consulting firms that exist in the treasury space.”</p>
<p>The world of technology is continually changing due to new entrants to the market, developments to existing vendor solutions, and the wider acceptance of digital technologies such as BI, RPA and APIs – and as Bramwell points out, this makes it very difficult to stay on top of all the changes in the market. As such, he says, “there is significant value in taking counsel to think outside the box, evaluate options that you weren’t aware of, and even challenging existing processes and technology assumptions.”</p>
<p>Sharman, meanwhile, notes that it is “vital” at each stage of a project to analyse what is and isn’t working, and what can be learned for the future. He adds that any investment a treasury team makes should be viewed not as a one-off expenditure, but as the beginning of a rolling programme.</p>
<p>Above all, process and system optimisation needs to be approached with a clear goal in mind from the outset. As Dessing concludes, “I believe that every system or process change needs to enhance the collaboration between treasury and the rest of the business to help the entire company be safer, more streamlined and more efficient, as well as identifying opportunities that drive operational and financial agility.”</p>

<p>“It was a balancing act, but the global team’s agile response to the pandemic helped us deliver important financial, strategic, and ESG results last year,” states George Dessing, Executive Vice President, Treasury &amp; Risk at professional information, software solutions and services company Wolters Kluwer. “While the pandemic diverted us from our original financial plan, especially in terms of organic growth, it has fully reinforced many elements of our strategy.”</p>
<p>In particular, says Dessing, the company is “more committed than ever to evolve towards digital and expert solutions” – the latter being the term the team uses for the company’s products that combine “our deep domain knowledge with advanced technology”. In addition, he notes that the pandemic has reinforced the trend towards cloud-based software platforms, as well as making clear the importance of strong internal systems and infrastructure.</p>
<p>“An example of an improved internal process is our cash flow management, which is a complex process – and increasingly so within the dynamic and continuously changing international environment that we deal with at Wolters Kluwer,” he comments. As such, Dessing explains that adopting one of the company’s products, CCH Tagetik, “will help us to receive information from our business in a more structured, transparent and efficient way, with automated updates and a central repository showing the impact of business changes on the company’s cash flow plans.”</p>

<p>A purposeful company should have its purpose resonate through every aspect of its strategy and operations. A purposeful company understands how the core process by which it makes money is aligned to its purpose. It understands which stakeholder relationships are most important to its purpose and how it impacts all stakeholders. A good purpose, well-articulated, will flow through into everything the company does, including the treasury function.</p>
<p>Treasury decisions that might have been based on optimisation of the balance sheet come out slightly differently when a company looks through a purpose lens. Purpose could play out in treasury strategy through strict rules on how quickly to pay suppliers. It could manifest in conditions a company won’t accept in loan covenants to stop creditors doing things that damage the purpose. Elsewhere, purpose could be aligned to employees. For a company where the key purpose is to provide a secure livelihood for employees, for example John Lewis, this could impact how aggressively it negotiates on pension covenants. In another example, a renewables company focused on the transition might look carefully at its banking partners and the extent to which they finance activities that contribute to CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Unilever, and its purpose to make sustainable living commonplace, is the archetypal example of a purposeful company. The company has unpacked what this means in terms of the way it makes money and how it integrates across its business operations. It actively invests behind the brands it believes are aligned with its purpose and divests from brands that don’t align because they believe purposeful brands create faster growth.</p>
<p>Unilever also looks at the whole ecosystem in which it operates. For example, it works with its supply chains to enable them to deliver products in a sustainable way, which has had treasury implications: the company offered €500m of cash flow relief to support livelihoods across its extended value chain during COVID.</p>
<p>One of the problems that arises is where a company feels that the purpose can only describe the good things it does, and therefore ignores the bad. This can undermine purpose. Discussions about purpose must be grounded in the reality of what the core business is. There are businesses that do messy, difficult things and face genuine conflict with certain stakeholders, but they can still be purposeful. It lacks authenticity if a purpose statement is contrived and does not face up to the reality of the company’s business. It is a good idea to be honest, otherwise it creates dissonance and backfires on relationships. Employees are particularly engaged and motivated by purpose and attuned to hypocrisy.</p>
<p>There are now an increasing number of companies looking at purpose with serious intent. But it is difficult to do, and a multi-year process with pitfalls along the way. But we have already seen that organisations that have figured out what their purpose is, and how they impact their key stakeholders, have been better placed to respond to COVID.</p>

<p>Danone has integrated purpose since 1972, enabling the company to create both shareholder and societal value. We aim to inspire healthier and more sustainable eating and drinking practices and believe that the health of people and the health of the planet are interconnected. This is now pegged in our ‘One Planet One Health’ vision.</p>
<p>This purpose and vision is embedded across the business, and our treasury and finance divisions are empowered with the tools to match that purpose. This is particularly evident in our funding strategy.</p>
<p>We are a component stock of leading social responsibility indexes including the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, Vigeo Eiris, MSCI ESG Ratings and the FTSE4Good Index. Inclusion in these indices involves a long assessment process and this transparency and credibility can drive our investment decisions.</p>
<p>Our goal is to contribute positively to all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but we have prioritised three particularly: SDGs 2, 3, and 6 around Zero Hunger, Good Health and Wellbeing and Clean Water and Sanitation, respectively.</p>
<p>Two years ago, we partnered with our core 12 banks in a facility that lowered our cost of borrowing if we increased our positive impact, all verified by a third party. We raised US$2bn in a syndicated credit facility whereby our ESG performance directly impacts – upwards and downwards – the margin payable to the banks over the entire duration of the facility. So far, our external metrics have shown that we are improving our ESG performance.</p>
<p>We have also done a social bond in line with our purpose to create and share sustainable value with all our stakeholders. In 2018 we were the first multinational to sell a social bond in line with the new Social Bond Principles set out by the International Capital Market Association. We had really good results, and a strong reception from investors. I believe this is because we are credible; we were able to demonstrate to investors that this topic has been a long journey for us.</p>
<p>Proceeds from our social bond have gone towards research for specialised nutrition. Funds also support entrepreneurs and start-ups, communities, and healthcare in emerging markets. Proceeds from our social bond also finance mangrove planting in Senegal to create carbon credits, and we support farmers in our supply chain to guarantee stable income for farmers and long-term collaboration on sustainability issues.</p>
<p>When it comes to putting in place this kind of financing, we must partner with banks that really believe in our purpose. It involves a great deal of discussion and collaboration and involves working with banks that are well connected with ESG investors. We find that our purpose also attracts investors to our traditional, or classical debt. I believe investors like our paper also because of our purpose.</p>

<p>Nearly every conversation we’ve had with corporate treasury teams and finance officials in recent months has included discussions around sustainability, and increasingly, purpose. The typical questions we ask include how the company is integrating sustainability into procurement and labour practices, or we might ask for more insight into their energy and water conservation policies. More often than not, the response is positive, but the person tasked with sustainability isn’t just the treasurer. It is usually a combination of roles split between the chief sustainability officer and treasury.</p>
<p>The push towards sustainability and broader purpose is being driven by growing concerns emanating from a company’s stakeholders, particularly employees. Employees are driving companies to push the envelope and become more responsive. There was a time a company could say they didn’t know anything about purpose. Now most companies realise that purpose and sustainability make a big difference in employee engagement and how they are perceived by the outside world. It is also right for companies to try and make a difference in society and, of course, COVID has also played a factor.</p>
<p>There is a clear difference between integrating purpose and sustainability. In companies that are clear about their purpose in society, the commitment of employees across the board is more tangible. It is easy to determine corporate purpose when talking to employees. You can ascertain whether it is a new fad or something that lies at the core of corporate strategy. Companies that have a sense of purpose have a direction driven from the top of the house. They are not just giving lip service to the concept.</p>
<p>In the supply chain, purpose usually manifests around procurement and what a company is asking its suppliers. Purposeful treasury teams will look beyond basic regulatory needs to truly analyse their sourcing and supplier selection processes; they will ask for compliance from their suppliers and get tough on them to improve the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>In fact, purpose isn’t exclusive to green endeavour. An oil company can be purposeful by, for example, working with local communities and contributing to society. A company’s core products may not be sustainable, but their practices could be contributing and giving back to society in multiple ways. There is no one right answer in the approach to this.</p>
<p>Companies with a purpose anchored in societal benefits often find it easier to attract investment - investors have a clear preference for companies in this category. In fact, much of the drive for purpose is coming from institutional investors and pension funds increasingly asking companies what motivates them. However, purpose doesn’t lower a company’s cost of borrowing and the PR benefits of integrating purpose are modest.</p>
<p>The benefit comes from the fact employees are much more motivated to work for a purposeful company. The next generation is far more conscious of purpose than previous generations. Consumers are also motivated by purpose. It allows consumer-facing companies to tap a demand pool based on their sense of purpose.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>In today’s challenging climate, digital transformation has never been more important – and leading treasuries are playing a key role in expanding the possibilities of what can be achieved.</p>
<p>The opportunities offered by new technologies in treasury have been a topic of discussion for some time, but increasingly this talk is turning into action. Leading treasuries, particularly those in faster paced industries, are increasingly adopting technologies like robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>By embracing new technology, treasury will be better able to support the business. In some cases, treasurers can even help create new business models by suggesting new ways of paying or receiving funds for e-commerce or digital customer channels. Digital transformation can also take away a lot of the mundane work in the treasury, making it easier to attract and retain more qualified employees. And technology also helps the treasury to be more agile, change faster and take on more volume without needing to add more resources.</p>
<h4 id=""harnessing-technology"">Harnessing technology</h4>
<p>Where specific treasury activities are concerned, a traditional treasury would typically use spreadsheet based cash flow forecasting to identify an upcoming funding gap, or excess cash that needs to be invested in the near future. In contrast, more advanced treasuries are using tools that look for patterns in data to forecast much further ahead. Once you can forecast months ahead, there are opportunities to bring in data from sales and production forecasts to gain a greater understanding of the relationship between customer demand, manufacturing, and inventory. From there, companies gain the ability to undertake working capital forecasting, and understand what funding the company is going to need in three, six or nine months into the future.</p>
<p>Forecasting is not the only area that is being transformed with digital technology. As treasurers sharpen their focus on technology, it is becoming clear that there is so much more that can be automated. In the past, there was an assumption that functions like payments processing and foreign exchange execution needed to be done manually, but many companies are now seeking automated solutions in these areas. Technology, and the ability to access more information and underlying data, is also enabling treasurers to do things that they haven’t attempted before, such as algorithmic trading.</p>
<p>Companies are also looking to gain more insights from their data, for example by seeking greater insights into which customers are paying late or early, and how important this business is to its customer or suppliers. Meanwhile, with clearing systems increasingly moving to 24/7 models, treasurers also need to start thinking about how to deal with cash flows that come in outside of normal working hours, and what technology solutions are needed to support this.</p>
<h4 id=""a-shift-in-mindset"">A shift in mindset</h4>
<p>These opportunities are not only open to new companies which have built treasury functions in the digital era. Traditional treasuries are also embracing digital technology – although this may require a shift in mindset, both within the treasury and across the business.</p>
<p>For one thing, treasury is often viewed narrowly as a risk management and governance function in traditional organisations. More advanced treasuries are increasingly thinking about how they can add value to the business. Companies embracing digital transformation may also need to upskill their employees, either through training or in some cases by hiring new talent, in order to gain the necessary expertise in areas such as data analytics and RPA process management.</p>
<p>Treasuries that embrace technology are more likely to partner with the business on its own digital initiatives. For example, a traditional manufacturer that previously sold via distributors might decide to begin selling directly to its small and medium sized customers using online channels. The company will need a whole different infrastructure to support that, and where treasury is concerned, there are opportunities to help the business make that transition by exploring online real-time foreign exchange, payments gateways and different ways of interacting with customers.</p>
<p>Conversely, treasuries that don’t embrace these opportunities won’t be able to support the business of tomorrow. As a result, the traditional treasury risks becoming less relevant to the business. So instead of working with treasury, the business will seek out external service providers, meaning that the role of the treasury shrinks over time. This is something we’ve seen in companies that have a big online presence. Often they have dedicated payment teams within the business that focus on things like electronic collections, payment gateways, wallets and P2P systems. If those teams are driving those decisions themselves, treasury is not actually at the table anymore.</p>
<h4 id=""embracing-innovation"">Embracing innovation</h4>
<p>While some treasuries have yet to embark on a digital transformation journey, there is plenty that can be done. For more traditional treasurers, this is likely to mean embracing self-education and learning in order to grow and develop. This might include talking to banks and fintechs about the possibilities or carrying out some selective hiring to bring fresh ideas into the organisation.</p>
<p>To some degree digital transformation involves a behavioural change, as the most innovative companies are those that are comfortable with experimenting and failing fast. Whilst Treasury has always been about risk aversion rather than risk taking, experimentation does involve a certain level of risk taking. While there is a balance to strike here, treasurers can start by undertaking some limited experimentation in order to bring about a change. This can be challenging, as the finance function is not normally the first place where you think about innovation, so some groundwork might be needed in order to present these ideas internally and get buy-in.</p>
<p>Some treasurers may struggle to gain support for transformation from their CFOs, while other CFOs may be proactive about including innovation in treasury key performance indicators (KPIs). Two or three years ago, it was quite common for treasurers to be given a KPI by the CFO to implement RPA, AI, or blockchain. Now, instead of having a KPI focusing on a specific technology, treasurers are becoming more expansive in thinking about what is possible, because they hear other treasurers talking about what they have delivered. Hence, today the focus is less on figuring out how to use blockchain or AI, and more about deciding where treasury is going and what it should look like.</p>
<h4 id=""rise-of-the-connector-bank"">Rise of the connector bank</h4>
<p>As treasurers aim for digital transformation, banks and other external partners also have a role to play in advising and guiding their clients. This can range from knowledge sharing to looking holistically at the client’s processes and delivering end-to-end solutions. At Standard Chartered, we are developing a lot of new solutions and capabilities, sometimes with fintechs, and sometimes on our own through our SC Ventures business. These include APIs, QR codes, payment gateway solutions for internet banking and virtual accounts to name but a few areas.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the role of banks has long been to act as an intermediary. In the digital world, this is still the case – but as that role evolves, our institution is increasingly becoming what we call a connector bank. In essence, corporate clients like the idea of fintechs and bank agnostic platforms – but they don’t want to take the risk on the fintech. So increasingly banks are becoming part of different platforms. For example, Standard Chartered is connected to over a dozen trade platforms, which means that clients can connect to the bank through these platforms to provide working capital finance and other trade related services.</p>
<p>We are beginning to see a similar movement in the cash management space. Some of the TMS and ERP platforms are evolving to become financial marketplaces in their own right, with certain financial services embedded in their platforms. Likewise, we have connected to mobile money payment systems so that corporate clients can reach a bigger consumer base in Asia and Africa, and make payments to suppliers in remote locations. By connecting to these platforms, we are extending our role as an intermediary in the digital world, and we’re giving clients the comfort that the risk and technology has been properly engaged.</p>
<h4 id=""impact-of-covid-19"">Impact of COVID-19</h4>
<p>Alongside these developments, it’s clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the move towards digital technology. Retailers have significantly increased their online sales, while corporates dealing in the B2B space have also had to adapt. Receiving and depositing a cheque, for example, may be impossible during lockdown conditions, with shared service centre staff working remotely and bank branches closed. As a result, we are seeing a wholesale shift to electronic payments and collections.</p>
<p>In this difficult environment business digitisation is accelerating, even though the vast majority of people in treasury and banking are working from home. Many major corporations have issued RFPs in order to revisit the way they are doing cash management across an entire market or region. Treasuries have had to eliminate their paperwork quickly, so a lot of things have become digitised by default – and that’s leading to a broader change in people’s thinking.</p>
<p>To give one example, the pandemic has driven demand for e-signatures. This isn’t only about the signature itself. People often need to go backwards and forwards a number of times in order to agree a document, so there is also demand for electronic workflows and real-time collaboration. Again, this is a behavioural change, and a shift that is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years.</p>
<p>Finally, real-time information has become even more important in this climate. Forecasting is more challenging at a time when nothing corresponds with previous years’ sales patterns, so having access to real-time or near-real-time information is an increasingly important component of liquidity management.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>There is nothing like a crisis to focus the mind on the fundamentals. Coralie van Zyl, Head of Product Development Payments and Receivables, and Wim Grosemans, Global Head of Product Management, Payments &amp; Receivables, Cash Management, BNP Paribas, spoke to Treasury Today amidst the backdrop of the global pandemic. With remote working testing corporate treasurers’ resolve across the world, the discussion homed in on the impact that the current environment is having on the visibility of funds, and the advantages of centralisation and virtual account management.</p>
<h4 id=""new-normal"">New normal</h4>
<p>van Zyl is responsible for product development within cash management. She explained how, in a time of crisis, when enforced remote working is the norm, visibility of funds has rapidly risen up the agenda. “When it comes to forecasting cash flows, taking a decision on whether to execute a payment run or not, requires far greater visibility and control.”</p>
<p>Of course, managing within the pandemic is a challenge faced by most corporates. But van Zyl noted that BNP Paribas’ clients felt one of the biggest shocks came from simply being forced to work from home. “Everyone was dispersed, and so it’s a process of trying to ensure that everyone is equipped at home with the right tools to do their work,” she explained. “And having the family at home too involves having a really good balance, just so you can proceed with your work.”</p>
<p>This is where the product-set strength of a partner comes into play. Grosemans’ role is all about product evolution, ensuring solutions are aligned with industry developments. The task, he said, is focused on “trying to change clients’ lives, keeping them comfortable and making them the most effective in their roles”.</p>
<p>One of the vital developments BNP Paribas has been working on is its Virtual Account Management (VAM). VAM, said van Zyl, “has been one of the keys to helping clients towards centralisation and visibility”. Systems such as VAM form one of the three pillars of successful centralisation, she said, the others being ‘people’ and ‘knowledge’.</p>
<p>Knowledge demands investment in and development of different elements in order to be able to centralise. There is a pressing need, for example, to understand how payments in other countries work, she explained. “Centralisation is not ‘one size fits all’; you need to be able to understand the chain.”</p>
<p>Of equal weight is the ‘people’ pillar, with van Zyl noting that “specific profiles” of personnel are necessary to ensure operational effectiveness across the business. Achieving balance requires effort and she acknowledges that working on centralisation is indeed “a long journey, with steps that can help you to work towards your future solution”.</p>
<h4 id=""taking-control"">Taking control</h4>
<p>As part of centralisation, the treasurer must typically aim to reduce the number of accounts held. This, said van Zyl, provides improved oversight of positions, assisting with cash visibility and control. But enhancing deeper elements of treasury through centralisation depends on what target the company has in mind.</p>
<p>It is, noted van Zyl, a matter of “how far the organisation wants to go with its centralisation journey”. Each company must assess this in light of its own needs. There is, she noted, a deep-thinking process around centralisation, and many elements to consider. As such, its execution requires extensive planning, and considerable time.</p>
<p>Although Grosemans said BNP Paribas truly believes in VAM and its power to further enhance the bank’s digitisation offer, like centralisation itself, it is not a ‘one size fits all’ product, needing to be placed “in the reality of where clients are”. Each constituent of the bank’s product suite is, he continued, “an add-on that will work symbiotically with the local realities that exist”. It is, he believes, a complement to the fact that clients operate in many different countries.</p>
<h4 id=""evolving-space"">Evolving space</h4>
<p>Despite the tumultuous experience for businesses across the world, Grosemans envisions continued digital evolution. “The crisis is forcing us to be able to function in different ways, and it’s working. Across the board, we’re seeing new extensions of the digital journeys that banks are providing their customers.”</p>
<p>van Zyl adds: “People will feel more confident as they accelerate towards digital and take that leap; we have all been forced to move forwards”. She sees more engagement with digital solutions, and reflection on structures and setups, as companies seek clarity on how they are organised.</p>
<p>However, Grosemans elaborated, the future isn’t one of dystopia, where client contact is usurped by full automation. “It’s important to keep in mind that digitalisation doesn’t mean that everything is becoming self-service and that banks are trying to move further away from clients: we want to increase proximity.”</p>
<h4 id=""seeing-cash"">Seeing cash</h4>
<p>Of course, proximity includes bringing corporate cash closer. Mariya Tretyak, Head of Global Cash Pooling Products, BNP Paribas, explained how recent events have impacted corporate liquidity management.</p>
<p>Working on global liquidity management solutions, heading up the bank’s physical and notional cash pooling offerings, she outlined recent developments. Although centralisation, she said, can certainly help to optimise group liquidity, a full centralisation “remains not always possible from regulatory, legal, tax and accounting perspectives. Moreover, the recent crisis has reminded that companies benefitting from state aid might face some additional limitations for centralisation, such as, for example, restrictions in terms of cross-border transfers of subsidised liquidity.</p>
<p>With improvements in liquidity management dependent upon the level of centralisation, companies with a highly centralised treasury and a fully-integrated ERP can benefit from structures such as ‘collections on behalf of’ and ‘payments on behalf,” Tretyak explained. But, for many companies, a physical cash pooling structure remains by far the most effective way to get cash visibility across the accounts held around the world. It also provides direct access to liquidity which, she noted, is the ideal basis for a treasurer’s daily funding and investment decisions.</p>
<h4 id=""multiple-options"">Multiple options</h4>
<p>The pandemic has also impacted corporate investment decisions, Tretyak observed. With the right balance between yield and security becoming even more important at this time, increasing attention is being paid to the risk and duration of investment instruments. She is also seeing increasing adoption of automated parameter-based solutions assisting treasurers in their daily investment actions. “This is one of the co-creation initiatives that we are currently working on with our client group that we call the ‘Treasury Board’.”</p>
<p>For many, the past few months have seen a rise in the overall importance of effective liquidity management. “Centralisation has undeniable advantages in terms of liquidity management but it cannot always be reached,” said Tretyak. “Depending on the maturity of the organisational model and its level of centralisation, different combinations of liquidity products can be considered to optimise the visibility and the access to cash, also including notional pooling or domestic or cross-border interest optimisation solutions in more regulated countries,” she concluded.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“We believe the improvements we’re making today on CashPro Assistant will fundamentally change the client experience.” It’s a bold claim but Bank of America’s (BofA) Jennifer Boussuge, Managing Director, GT&amp;O;, Treasury FS&amp;O; Executive Global Banking &amp; Markets, truly believes that, following months of research and design, the introduction of new online service dashboard and authority management tools will “dramatically simplify the lives” of the 500,000 users spread around the world, and in some cases working remotely, who access CashPro for their daily treasury needs.</p>
<p>The two new tools, which are now being rolled out by BofA through its self-service platform, CashPro Assistant, itself a component of the bank’s CashPro suite, will automate, and validate in real-time, both account opening and authorisation management activities allowing clients to be nimble as they adapt to working outside of their offices. The bank’s confidence in these enhancements stems from what Tom Durkin, Global Head of Financing and Channels in GTS, BofA, describes as a “thematic approach” to its investments in innovation. It is, he adds, one that is “powered by people and driven by technology” and focused on “bringing intelligent treasury to our clients”.</p>
<p>BofA has a well-developed sense of innovation across the organisation. “We’re always thinking about what we should be investing in to help our clients operate more efficiently,” says Durkin. Certainly, this restless approach sees the bank exploring emerging technologies. But he says it always applies a pragmatic lens that defines the application of solutions in terms of enhancements that can be delivered to the client, not least in the fields of risk management and fraud protection.</p>
<h4 id=""transforming-experience"">Transforming experience</h4>
<p>Tradition has it that the bank onboarding process for corporate clients is manual and slow; managing documentation for AML and KYC takes time and it’s a common pain-point. But Boussuge says BofA is transforming that experience into one that is “secure, simple, transparent and fast”.</p>
<p>As such, the service dashboard and authority management tools represent significant developments in terms of the client experience and, indeed, the creative processes that have been called upon to bring them to fruition.</p>
<p>Throughout the development process, the emphasis has been on end-to-end automation, a goal that sits well with the bank’s holistic vision for CashPro. The results represent a full front and back office overhaul within CashPro Assistant, taking out manual rekeying and hand-offs for clients.</p>
<h4 id=""onboarding-control"">Onboarding control</h4>
<p>“We have literally re-designed the entire end-to-end onboarding process for our clients, creating a faster, simpler, more transparent experience for them,” says Boussuge. The new service dashboard enables clients to quickly open and clearly view all implementation and service requests. But this is not just a visualisation tool, she insists; it is one designed for action, with end-to-end workflows and status alerts driving client progress, with the dashboard also acting as the nerve-centre of client/bank communications throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>It is now possible, in just one place, to see all the actions needed on every aspect of onboarding documentation, including those for legal and AML/KYC processes. In offering what Boussuge describes as a “clear visual guide for all the requirements”, it empowers users to respond to and manage those requirements, and electronically sign them (e-signatures can even be captured on the integrated CashPro Mobile app).</p>
<p>In centrally displaying all request details, the dashboard reveals to every individual with appropriate access rights, the full request scope, the necessary contacts, the required documentation, and the process status of each action. All of which can be done at any time the client chooses, not just in the office or during normal business hours.</p>
<p>The level of transparency the dashboard offers should be a major source of comfort for clients. This is complemented by the added security of knowing the precise status of every request at any given moment: status view shows clients the level of progress made for each action, helping them to expedite proceedings wherever needed. Such control is likely to be especially beneficial to clients with sophisticated treasury requirements across multi-regional accounts.</p>
<p>In practice, when accessing the front-end of CashPro Assistant, users can enter the servicing dashboard and drill down into their servicing and fulfilment requests. From here they may also communicate with the bank throughout the entire onboarding process. This is where clients will be able to see what actions are required, download, digitally sign and exchange documents, and track the progress of every stage throughout.</p>
<p>By automating aspects of back-office processing, manual re-keying and signoffs have been removed for the client. Now, for any onboarding action, the moment a client’s request is entered into the system, an automated search is made for all required documentation already held by the bank. The search is executed across the bank’s entire data store, so that repeat presentations of current documents, for a KYC refresh for example, become a thing of the past; the document list presented to the client consists only of what BofA does not already have.</p>
<p>The fluidity of the process allows for significant efficiencies to be created. Where something as simple as account number reservation was made more cumbersome by traditional manual processes – which required a mix of emails, phone calls, branch visits and spreadsheets – the new CashPro Assistant tools defy tradition. Clients no longer need to reach out to local branches and contact points to gather the information, explains Boussuge. “And through the new secure digital automation that we’ve created, we’ve reduced the time it takes from days to just minutes.”</p>
<h4 id=""consolidated-authorisation"">Consolidated authorisation</h4>
<p>The adoption of a holistic profile of client activities within CashPro Assistant means managing signatories for CashPro users has been turned on its head too. The traditional thinking around signatory management – by account and by entity – often saw information variously stored on different databases and unrelated spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The employment of a new treasurer, for example, required contact with service advisors across every country and region, often necessitating the provision of different supporting documentation. Every subsequent change to a signatory demanded a repeat performance. In short, signatory management has often been viewed by companies as both an administrative and a control challenge (the implications for security and fraud management alone are huge).</p>
<p>The new way, using the CashPro Assistant authority management tool, places the individual at the centre of the process. In being able to view in one place each authorisation profile across all entities and accounts, it gives the client control to modify or delete any existing profile quickly and efficiently, explains Boussuge. Indeed, clients can now set up, review and action authorisations at any time, with reports easily created at a company or single profile level, as and when required.</p>
<p>BofA says it marks the evolution of simple signatory management into holistic authority management. It certainly means that, as part of the wider system, with its audit trails and workflow capabilities, CashPro Assistant can, for example, allow clients to manage escalation of action to the required level of authorisation, and even provide specific bank personnel contact details for direct issue management. This has real practical value.</p>
<p>“With new personnel, if you want them to be responsible for the same set of accounts as the person they replaced, that can all be set up online,” explains Durkin. “They could even self-onboard, in terms of securely sending all the required documentation for KYC. They could digitally sign using DocuSign, and then quickly be set up with the approved level of authorisation for accounts the client holds with Bank of America.”</p>
<p>Contact management, too, is positively impacted. Durkin notes that many companies still maintain contact data across all their banks, on spreadsheets. If, for example, the bank receives an ACH file from a client that is subsequently rejected or fails for some reason, the ACH team will need to contact the client. To do so, it will use the information on file.</p>
<p>Although this is information provided when the service is first set up, the challenge of updating through traditional channels often means the details remain unchanged. If that information is not current, it could seriously impact the bank’s ability to repair that file. For an urgent payment, this could become a major issue. The ease with which the new tool allows contacts authorisations to be updated helps ensure that such issues are not encountered.</p>
<h4 id=""it-all-starts-with-cashpro"">It all starts with CashPro</h4>
<p>The new service dashboard and authority management tools complement the wider CashPro suite of products that includes Online Banking, Mobile, the CashPro Connect client access channel. As of January 2018, it has also been delivering APIs (which, as the bank continues its work with ERP and TMS vendors on integration, is driving uptake in the adoption of CashPro Connect).</p>
<p>CashPro Assistant commenced with transaction research and investigation, offering clients a set of analytics tools. This afforded anyone wanting customised reporting and enhanced cash flow management far greater visibility into all of their accounts and balances, even across third-party bank accounts.</p>
<p>CashPro Assistant users were then offered an enhanced experience around push alerts, enabling them to set up email or text warnings guided by their own parameters. Further progress saw the inclusion of e-signature capabilities across different devices, provided via DocuSign in CashPro’s secure document storage and exchange facility.</p>
<p>As might be expected where ground-breaking developments are delivered, Durkin says BofA is committed to offering user support and education. This includes demonstration videos, training activities and other resources, to help users get the most out of the CashPro platform. Clients also have the option to connect via live chat with the fulfilment and service teams led by Boussuge.</p>
<h4 id=""leave-no-stone-unturned"">Leave no stone unturned</h4>
<p>Of course, investing in CashPro Assistant is about allowing clients to take control online as a key part of their BofA services experience. The innovative thinking that delivers this goal is not something that is left to the chosen few: it can, and does, manifest right across the bank. BofA has a procedure it calls ‘Speak Up’. This allows anyone with an idea to submit it for closer scrutiny by the relevant expert team.</p>
<p>Through client engagement, employees with day-to-day customer contact often have the greatest insights into what those clients want and need. All ideas are taken onboard and examined in the light of known customer expectations.</p>
<p>Being inspired by real-world client challenges is an essential part of the process. Having the ability to ‘test and learn allows BofA to take on an idea and pursue it to its natural conclusion in the most efficient manner, says Durkin. This can lead to engagement with the fintech community, at both a collaborative and an investment level.</p>
<p>What steers this engagement is the well-developed understanding of client pain points, drawn from BofA’s strong customer contact and tools such as ‘Speak Up’. This has shone the spotlight on a clear primary target expressed by most clients, says Durkin. “Organisations are telling us directly – and through segment-specific CashPro Advisory Boards and validated third-party industry benchmarks – that ease of doing business and responsiveness to service requests are key drivers for client satisfaction.” These advisory boards, he adds, necessarily represent segments drawn from across business banking, commercial banking, financial institutions and large corporates.</p>
<p>BofA infers an ‘innovation mandate’ from these conversations, underpinning its whole client-centric philosophy. It’s able to understand that innovation can strike at many different angles and that this may mean working at the cutting edge of technology, developing products and solutions that are entirely new, but may equally mean exploring and leveraging its own existing functionality within the wider CashPro platform. Generating efficiencies from these can ultimately help clients do the business they want to do, how they want to do it, notes Durkin. “If you put a collective package together that makes business easier, more nimble and offers fast service – then you have banking solutions that can be truly transformational in today’s environment,” he explains.</p>
<p>This is why BofA’s Treasury Fulfilment Service Operations (TFSO) team is dedicated to providing onboarding and service to its treasury clients across the globe. It is, he says “in the business of making the client experience fast, simple and secure – every step of the way – from onboarding, to every day service needs”.</p>
<h4 id=""new-thinking"">New thinking</h4>
<p>The ongoing technical design process within CashPro calls upon ‘user interface’ and ‘user experience’ (UI/UX) experts to ensure the coherence of the whole package. This expertise is only useful when guided by strong client feedback. Collected by BofA in conjunction with its service partners and directly with clients, the process is sustained across the life of the product, enabling the technology to reflect the dynamism of client needs and the market environment</p>
<p>But banks have not necessarily been known for adopting a human-centred design approach, notes Boussuge. Indeed, she acknowledges that the ‘Field of Dreams’ build-it-and-they-will-come model has long been the industry preference. The way CashPro Assistant, and the new service dashboard and authority management tools in particular, have been delivered appear to mark a new chapter in banking solution design.</p>
<p>Rather than fixating on the UI and just delivering a glossy front-end, working with clients on the full end-to-end proposition through an interactive feedback loop has enabled the bank to completely eliminate friction points in both bank onboarding and authorisation management.</p>
<p>With traditional processing models requiring considerable manual input into multiple systems, physical documents and wet signatures, these practices would not be possible in the current environment. “In re-building the end-to-end process, our guiding principles were the digitisation and automation of the client experience, delivering transparency and giving users more power,” comments Boussuge. “These principles have effectively seen each process being completely re-mapped; we are finally putting an end to re-keying and hand-offs.”</p>
<p>BofA’s CashPro Assistant is a solution built around real-world client needs, placing the individual, not the account or entity, at the centre of a fully digital chain of events, says Boussuge. What elevates it above the norm is the fact that it takes a holistic approach to meeting these needs. Functionality that sits in, and is accessed from, one place, corresponds with “how clients really work”, not how banks would like or believe their clients to work.</p>
<h4 id=""rolling-out"">Rolling-out</h4>
<p>Whether on-boarding or managing account authorisations, the new CashPro Assistant now promises a fast, simple, secure and transparent experience for users when exchanging documents and communicating with the bank.</p>
<p>Full platform pilots are currently under way across EMEA. The onboarding experience will be phased in for all clients in EMEA throughout 2020. Additional phases will then be rolled out across other regions. The authority management piece will be phased in across EMEA and the US in 2020.</p>


","Faster onboarding of clients, enhanced visibility on service requests, and easy online updates to account authorisations are key drivers for two new ground-breaking features of Bank of America’s self-service tool, CashPro Assistant. With the service dashboard and authority management tools, the promise of a friction-free, end-to-end experience is now a reality — in the office and remotely.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/20200512tt00sfbofacreativewebdesignerplanningapplicationdeveloping11822707181920x1080.jpg,2020-05-01,Treasury Systems,True

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Process control risks remain in almost permanent evidence for treasurers but priorities change. A decade ago, RFPs to TMS core system vendors focused on information exchange and transparency; payments processes were of interest but not critical. Today, where multiple e-banking applications can expose organisations to increased levels of control risk, payment processes and connectivity are far more important as companies struggle to manage targeted cybercrimes, such as SEPA direct debit and redirection fraud.</p>
<p>Treasurers have raised awareness of the risks amongst other functions, yet despite constant reinforcement of their message, few can be certain that their mitigation processes are being adhered to fully by non-finance colleagues.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that, with the rise of cyber-criminality, finance and treasury teams are increasingly seeking control, through greater transparency and connectivity, across their entire organisations. This is evident through changing RFP priorities.</p>
<p>Today, reducing fraud risk can be facilitated by centralising systems and process definitions, and putting control in the hands of smaller, centralised teams. In practice, this could mean simply requiring all banking to be managed through a single application, where static payments data and watchlist monitoring can be validated across the entire organisation.</p>
<h4 id=""automation"">Automation</h4>

Key to the idea of enabling greater control is the understanding that this is not about withdrawing local responsibility – most treasuries are too small to manage that anyway – but about using automation to enable transparency across remote-user activities, and being able to take immediate action where necessary.
With treasury departments remaining small despite increasing workloads, the adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) alongside single-platform access to data will be crucial to success here both in terms of defeating fraud and in delivering a competitive edge for the organisation. 
AI can minutely, and in real-time, check bulk or individual payments flows, allowing treasury to manage by exception; this is a huge help for small and large organisations alike. BELLIN has developed AI that can detect and raise an alert concerning even the subtlest of changes in user behaviours and payments activities across an entire multi-national organisation. The parameterisable system also deploys the BELLIN Vendor Verification whitelisting and blacklisting tool, letting treasury focus on real threats whilst allowing centrally validated transactions to flow unhindered. 
Central control, enhanced by AI and validation technology, gives even the most far-flung businesses control over their payments processes. But leveraging this set-up is not just about deploying cutting-edge technology.   

<h4 id=""optimisation"">Optimisation</h4>
<p>Beginning the process of optimisation through centralisation first requires exposure and definition of the company’s risks. It may then set out its goals, detailing how those risks will be mitigated. This should be a collaborative effort, with treasury working alongside other functions such as IT and accounting, to ensure all potential weak points across the business are acknowledged and understood.</p>
<p>One key decision at this stage could be where best to host centralised core systems. Third-party engagement may be most appropriate; BELLIN, for example, offers mirror sites, distanced from its internal networks and main servers, ensuring client process security and continuity. The provision of core system backups on different servers, using encrypted data, can be the difference between getting back online quickly or not at all.</p>
<p>In operation, every company must ensure all personnel know how to respond when, for example, data access has been blocked by an attack. Here, process control documentation is vital. An internal task force should be established to ensure every required step is acted upon efficiently.</p>
<p>Documentation also ensures that even if key personnel are working from home or on sick leave, or leave the company, everyone – including new personnel – understands the different departmental risks, and how to tackle them. The document itself should include an easily accessible and readily available contact list for all relevant third-party providers (such as banks and vendors).</p>
<h4 id=""taking-action"">Taking action</h4>
<p>Defining risks across the organisation, and correlating these with existing systems and processes, reveals the security gaps. This allows prioritisation of the highest risks, and decisions to be made, around which applications should be deployed to mitigate those risks.</p>
<p>The end result may be most effectively achieved through a single, centralised platform, where multiple e-banking applications can be eliminated, and static data in different core systems can be easily consolidated and validated, eliminating the risks one by one.</p>
<p>Where this is deemed the most appropriate pathway, and a TMS is the solution, the treasurer’s understanding of the risks and how to mitigate them will suggest certain RFP questions. Open questions as to how the system can support the business in eliminating process control risk are advised.</p>
<p>More specifically, treasurers should ask about the inclusion of automated whitelist/blacklist checking, and whether or not the proposed system is ERP-independent. The vendor should also explain its reasoning for using either in-house or third-party applications to deliver risk mitigation. After all, in the treasury landscape where process control efficiency is now all about transparency and connectivity, adding complexity can only equate to increasing risk.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For businesses the world over, COVID-19 has triggered many things that are by and large negative: economic anxiety and uncertainty; crushed sales figures and expectations; and disrupted processes and workflows. But opportunities are starting to emerge from this crisis that may benefit companies long after the world is back to normal. Remote treasury management consulting is one of them.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current remote consulting boom may be born out of necessity, but it comes with a number of general advantages that are entirely unrelated to COVID-19 and its aftermath. Of course, there are some aspects to personal consultation that are hard to replicate in an entirely digital world. But the benefits of receiving support through digital channels far outweigh its limitations, both now and in the longer term.</p>
<h4 id=""bridging-time-and-space"">Bridging time and space</h4>
<p>The reason why so many companies are turning to remote consulting in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis appears straightforward: their workforces have been driven into home-offices, separated from one another both through social distancing and different time zones. It’s a scenario that rules out traditional consulting setups, even though this is a time when good advice is crucial. Remote consulting, delivered using state-of-the-art video conferencing technology, offers the obvious alternative.</p>
<p>Even taking away the extraordinary conditions that pass as normal working life at the moment, remote consulting appears to be a viable option for many companies with teams on different continents and in different locations. It may currently be a ‘must’, but for many it is surely an option worth considering even once we are through these challenging times.</p>
<h4 id=""flexibility-and-efficiency"">Flexibility and efficiency</h4>
<p>Treasury management can be hectic and challenging at the best of times. Not only are treasurers expected to maintain an overview of all the financial happenings in their group at all times, they’re also called on to put in place and monitor strategies and contingencies. This is a truth that COVID-19 has definitely hit home. Now, more than ever before, companies all over the world are relying on their financial gatekeepers to see them through these troubled times.</p>
<p>Treasurers need reliable system support and sound guidance and advice to meet these expectations. The nature of the role also means that they have to be incredibly flexible and efficient; the current crisis has emphasised this need too.</p>
<p>Indeed, whilst on-site consulting workshops, scoping sessions or project management meetings do bring great value to companies, their framework can feel constricting in times when ‘all-hands-on-deck’ is the order.</p>
<p>Treasurers are currently under enormous pressure and cannot afford to take their eyes off the ball for too long. A few well-timed and clearly structured three-hour video calls might therefore meet their needs better than an event that ties up capacities all day, including time spent on small talk or coffee breaks.</p>
<p>Again, this clearly applies in the current extraordinary scenario, but stands strong in ‘normal’ times too, especially in smaller companies where fewer staff carry more day-to-day responsibilities.</p>
<h4 id=""focus-meets-speed"">Focus meets speed</h4>
<p>Remote consulting presents information differently, yet delivers the same results. The ability to break down advice and enable treasurers to focus more intently on fewer topics at one time can be invaluable – now and in general.</p>
<p>It’s easier to maintain concentration during shorter sessions, and treasurers can immediately return to their desks, taking care of everyday business and implementing what they’ve just learned.</p>
<p>By having more but shorter and more focused interactions, treasurers will see a direct impact, be able to ask targeted follow-up questions where needed, and adapt their work accordingly. The consultant also receives rapid feedback from which they can fine-tune their advice.</p>
<h4 id=""greater-discipline-faster-response"">Greater discipline, faster response</h4>
<p>Another positive side effect of holding meetings remotely is that attendees tend to show more discipline when it comes to timing. On-site coffee breaks or lunches routinely overrun by at least five to ten minutes, cutting back the general agenda or prolonging the process.</p>
<p>Conversely, video conferencing streamlines the process, encouraging attendees to stick to the agreed times, few wishing to keep anyone waiting on a call. What’s more, consultants delivering their guidance and support remotely cut out a lot of travel time. This frees up capacities and means advice is available faster, with more flexibility.</p>
<p>A consultant can easily have a video conference with a Russian prospect in the morning, and talk to a client in the US in the afternoon – an impossible physical-world scenario. This means more companies can benefit and their requirements can be met with greater flexibility.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-limitations"">Treasury limitations</h4>
<p>It should be clear that remote treasury consulting is a viable option, particularly in times of social distancing and the rise of the home office, but more generally too. The outcome may be the same, but it is hard to ignore the feeling that COVID-19 is robbing us of an important aspect of our work. Despite the many obvious benefits of remote consulting, face-to-face meetings offer one irreplaceable element: the social and emotional side of human interaction.</p>
<p>At a functional level, it’s just as easy to deliver information through technology as it is in person. But it can be much harder to gauge people’s reactions from a distance. Body language and facial expressions matter. Whilst they can come across in a video call, it can be harder to interpret their nuances, especially in a new business relationship.</p>
<p>What’s more, for the individual consultant, speaking to a few people online may prove no match for meeting the whole team in person, seeing their setup firsthand, and experiencing a day in the lives of these people.</p>
<p>In the ‘real world’ – and given the option – it is advisable to hold ‘in-person’ meetings at least at the beginning of the consultation process, half-way through and at the end. Current circumstances dictate that, for many, this is simply not an option, remote treasury consulting suddenly becoming more than just an alternative.</p>
<h4 id=""pathway-to-success"">Pathway to success</h4>

Here are a few easy-to-follow guidelines that providers should be using to make remote consulting just as successful as in-person guidance:

<ul>
<li>
<p>Serve the same information but serve it differently: smaller, more focused packages (no more than three – five hours at a time) spread over a few days will be most beneficial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define and implement a clear framework with structured timelines, deliverables and responsibilities. Communicate this upfront.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on one topic at a time. Deliver targeted, immediately implementable answers that can be revisited in the next session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use flexible, state-of-the-art technology throughout the entire process. Never compromise on security, and always respect the company’s own IT requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use video technology to maintain the social and emotional aspects of consulting as much as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""lasting-solution"">Lasting solution</h4>
<p>Remote treasury consulting could not be more topical. It brings many benefits that can see a company through the current crisis and will continue to hold their value once the skies clear again.</p>
<p>But with structured guidelines and great sensitivity towards all aspects of business relationships, remote treasury consulting is more than an emergency solution. It is a flexible, efficient, fast and successful solution fit for 21st century treasuries, especially in combination with a <a href=""https://www.bellin.com/solutions/treasury-management-system/payments/"" target=""_blank"">web-based treasury management system</a>.</p>

<p>When an airline is seen as being at the forefront of connecting Africa to the world, and the world to Africa, it had better make sure that its treasury operations can keep up. So it is that Kenya Airways (KQ), which for over 40 years has been the flag carrier airline of Kenya, has a financial function characterised by its progressive approach to digitisation.</p>
<p>Carrying over four million passengers every year to 54 destinations worldwide, 41 of which are in Africa, demands a nimble multi-banking operation. Notably in October 2018, Kenya Airways made history as the first African carrier to initiate non-stop flights between Nairobi, Kenya and New York. Given the expectations of its customers, many of whom want a fully digital booking experience, its treasury has been moving away from its traditional service role towards that of a “strategic player in the business”, explains Geoffrey Langat, Head of Treasury &amp; Corporate Finance, KQ.</p>
<p>Improving the efficiency of treasury, strengthening its internal controls, and bringing about closer integration with the rest of the business, has been a long-term project, adds Benson Muhoro, Treasury Manager, KQ.</p>
<p>Driven by the desire to improve the customer experience, and thus the airline’s corporate image, he says the aim has always been to secure near real-time information sharing, enhancing treasury’s internal and external business partnerships and, of course, supporting revenue growth opportunities for the airline.</p>
<p>Langat explains that the ‘big picture’ view fully emerged once provisional ‘needs analysis’ had established a hierarchy of priorities. A dedicated project team, drawn from treasury and its various internal customers, set a project scope spanning areas such as automated shared services in Nairobi, multi-bank account visibility, and, more recently, online and mobile ticketing. For each core component, he says the team issued RFPs.</p>
<h4 id=""key-partner"">Key partner</h4>
<p>One of the most important ‘quick wins’ was driven by the airline’s expansion into several new territories across Africa, and its subsequent additional banking requirements. With online access necessary for each relationship, payments presented a challenge, recalls Langat.</p>
<p>“We needed a solution with a simple login, that could issue payment instructions across all our banking partners and, on the same login, retrieve daily statements from these banks,” he says. For this, KQ selected Citi’s InfoPool, helping treasury make faster, more accurate cash management decisions, and CitiDirect BE<sup>®</sup>, enabling multi-banking transaction initiation.</p>
<p>In fact, with KQ having worked with Citi for many years, the evolution of the airline’s treasury into one of the more sophisticated players in the region, has seen the bank play a big part in delivering balance and value-creation across KQ’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>“The requirements of their evolving business tests treasury’s capacity to manage its traditional responsibilities with new technologies and market intermediaries,” notes Geoffrey Gursel, Treasury and Trade Solutions Head for Zambia and Sub-Saharan Africa Sales, Citi. “Our partnership continues to be about implementing products to help manage treasury-related risks and ensuring the traditional areas are as efficient as possible, but it’s also about facilitating KQ’s revenue growth through digitisation.”</p>
<p>For Gursel, the application of technologies such as AI and machine learning allows clients such as KQ to better analyse its data and offer more bespoke products to its customers. With KQ “at a critical moment in taking its next leap forwards”, he says Citi is offering its continuing support.</p>
<p>Having helped tackle payments and collections, Muhoro says that the next stage with Citi required host-to-host connectivity with KQ’s ERP system. This was completed in 2018. Currently, he says, the focus is on finessing the passengers’ online ticket purchasing experience, again in partnership with Citi, enabling customers to pay using mobile wallets such as M-Pesa. A confirmations tool is also set to be implemented, commencing end February 2020, adds Langat. This, he notes, will deploy AI, automating a hitherto entirely manual reconciliations process.</p>
<h4 id=""expectations"">Expectations</h4>
<p>The outlook for this ongoing programme of digitisation at KQ is that the airline will benefit from improved efficiencies and cost reductions across all its operations, in treasury and beyond, says Muhoro. But he is also anticipating a stronger control environment to be achieved through real-time risk management, with treasury acquiring increasingly accurate and timely financial data. “And with our customer-centric approach, the customer experience will continue improving too,” he adds.</p>
<p id=""video-interview"">With KQ set to continue meeting passenger expectations, Gursel comments that “it’s our increasing aim at Citi to help our clients become their industry first-choice by providing data-driven insights to essentially help them better connect them with their end-consumers”.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The EU’s revised payment services directive (PSD2) has forced European banks to set up standardised interfaces, so-called APIs, to enable third parties’ technological access to bank accounts. This is an attempt to break up the banks’ monopoly and boost competition amongst payment service providers.</p>
<p>When it comes to payments, PSD2 APIs are currently limited to single Euro payments area (SEPA) single payments. Simply put, they are generally ill-suited for corporate payment processing. Nevertheless, open access to customer and transaction data for third parties represents a radical change that threatens traditional banking business models.</p>
<p>While in the past, banks reigned freely over their customers’ financial data – often keeping them in the dark about margins, fees and transaction routes – open banking makes banking fundamentally more democratic and gives companies much more freedom and flexibility.</p>
<p>How does a company want to handle its payment processing? With open banking, it will be of little relevance to corporates exactly how their payments are processed. As long as the payment goes from A to B, the back-end technology being used is up to the service provider. What will be more significant for corporate treasury departments when it comes to payments is how quickly this information becomes available to them.</p>
<h4 id=""open-bankings-impact-on-cash-management"">Open banking’s impact on cash management</h4>
<p>Today, treasurers are blind when it comes to intraday cash flow movements. Depending on the bank, they only receive balance information a few times a day at specific times. This has always been as real-time as it gets. Treasurers who would like to know their account balance at any time and in ‘real, real-time’ need to request this information. But how can you know when to best inquire about your account balance when you have no idea when money will be credited?</p>
<p>Some companies make use of automated requests, managed in their treasury management system (TMS). The system sends scheduled requests to the bank, for example every minute, to check if any new information is available. An analogy would be sending round a company postman to empty the letterbox every few minutes without knowing if anyone has actually posted a letter. This leads to enormous amounts of data and clogs up communication channels and systems, without really solving the issue.</p>
<p>A much more intelligent solution would be to not request the information until it is actually available. For that to work, there would need to be some kind of signal that data has come in – just like the signal flag on American letterboxes. New technologies, such as APIs and WebSockets, enable this kind of reversed order. The bank signals that a new balance is available as soon as money is credited to or debited from an account, and treasurers and other finance professionals can then take action. The same is true for payments, where status notifications for a transaction would be available straight away.</p>
<h4 id=""the-future-of-apis"">The future of APIs</h4>
<p>What will the future look like for banking communication? Will APIs relegate existing technologies, such as electronic banking internet communication standard (EBICS) or SWIFT, to the sidelines? APIs’ greatest downfall is their lack of standardisation. Conversely, complete and powerful standardisation across the SEPA area is the biggest asset of these established communication channels.</p>
<p>In the context of PSD2, there have been various European initiatives to achieve standardisation, for example those of the Berlin Group. However, there is no comparable global initiative, and when BELLIN recently analysed the open banking offering of the ten most relevant banking groups, the discrepancies were staggering. What is needed are suitable enhancements of established technologies that could then be combined with new technologies, for example combining the EBICS protocol with API technology.</p>
<p>And this future is not far off. Massive changes that will impact treasurers’ day-to-day work significantly are just around the corner. Large retailers have already implemented instant payment solutions using APIs that not only enable them to transfer money, but also to receive notifications when a payment has come in as soon as it does. This has enabled them to fully connect payment processing, real-time balance information and customer service.</p>
<p>Direct communication of data between companies and banks is likely to have other, far-reaching consequences for treasury, for example when it comes to FX and risk management. Real-time corporate-bank communication definitely brings challenges for cash management. Banks will have to solve how cash pooling is handled in the future whilst also determining the time on which interest calculations are based. However, with new standards for speed, efficiency and data quality, open banking will continue to revolutionise treasury far beyond 2020.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The rapid development of new technologies and market forces is leading corporates to disrupt their own businesses. For most, staying relevant and competing with new entrants demands action now, because the pressure to perform is mounting.</p>
<p>In our personal lives, digitisation is becoming all-pervasive. We expect to interact with business quickly and efficiently, often through online sites and apps to order goods or services, track delivery, raise service issues or source advice. In our role as consumers we draw upon this experience and are increasingly asking why the same type of real-time and efficient execution cannot be achieved in business to business transactions.</p>
<p>This expectation is also seen inside many organisations. Business managers are all too aware that their business processes are often too complex and disjointed and their own experiences as e-commerce consumers are likely to confirm this state of affairs.</p>
<p>With seven of the world’s biggest companies now drawn from the e-commerce sector, traditional companies have a battle on their hands. New players are perfectly positioned to find the niches and exploit them quickly, leaving slow-moving traditional companies in their wake.</p>
<p>Whilst many businesses are evaluating or launching online, real-time business models, the timing is now critical. The response to digital is no longer a matter of ‘if’ but ‘how’. To drive this change, many large corporates have appointed a Chief Innovation Officer to help transform their interaction with customers and suppliers through new channels.</p>
<h4 id=""real-time-opportunities"">Real-time opportunities</h4>
<p>Many traditional companies now have a clear choice of either innovating or being disintermediated by newcomers. Taking positive action now affords an opportunity to reduce the cost of doing business through process simplification, and allows businesses to reach customers in new ways, even segments that previously may not have been accessible.</p>
<p>This could be as simple as launching an online business that reaches small and medium sized customers directly rather than through traditional channels. Alternatively, it could be more sophisticated, like a traditional manufacturing company incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) technology into their machinery, thus enabling their machines to call ‘back to base’ when parts and consumables need replacing or servicing is due. This provides customer convenience and automated cross-selling opportunities for the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Having a direct and more immediate connection with the customer changes the relationship and the nature of the interaction from reactive to proactive. The same level of interactivity can be applied right across the manufacturer’s own supply chain, bringing about a true Just-in-Time supply chain, potentially reducing or removing costly inventory holdings.</p>
<p>Regardless of sector, most businesses today sell to their biggest customers directly. Lower down the scale, sales tend to be through agents or distributor networks. Enabling online real-time commerce cuts out the middleman, facilitating 24/7 direct customer access to products and services by even the smallest customers. Re-engineering the way product-lines are distributed in this way makes it possible to meet business expectations – buying online and in real-time – expectations that consumers are increasingly bringing to the operation of their own businesses.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is strong evidence that these types of buying behaviours and expectations are working their way up from the consumer space to firstly SMEs, and then to the larger corporates. It’s a natural evolution. Progress is slower at the large-corporate end of the scale, with legacy infrastructure often presenting an obvious obstacle to selling products and services in a new way. But, by piloting new channels in select markets before rolling out enterprise-wide, even multinationals are able to meet the needs of new market dynamism.</p>
<h4 id=""treasurers-role"">Treasurer’s role</h4>
<p>There is a significant part to play for treasurers in the roll-out of these new online and real-time business models. The first port of call is to meet with front-line business colleagues. This should be about exploring and understanding how the business interacts with customers, and how subsequent processes flow internally.</p>
<p>It is vital too for treasurers to step outside of established thinking on cash management, at least as far as invoicing, collections, matching, reconciliations, payments and customer interactions are concerned. Real-time commerce will introduce a completely different toolset. Exploiting it requires re-education; treasurers must understand the applicability of new models and technologies, and firmly grasp how treasury can support and sustain its adoption.</p>
<p>For example, if a large corporate moves to sell online directly to SMEs, it will need payment gateways to process a wide range of payment types used by these customers. This could include instant payments, mobile money or peer to peer payment instruments commonly used by consumers and small businesses alike. Some corporates may also wish to deploy a proprietary business wallet that enables small businesses to buy from them online. Moreover, if these transactions are cross-border and a product is priced in a base currency but sold in a local currency, then real-time FX solutions that enable the dynamic pricing and settlement of these transactions between the base and local currency will also be a requirement.</p>
<p>In building a map of how real-time commerce can be supported, treasury becomes a critical partner for supporting a new way of doing business. Treasurers who do not become closely involved in the roll-out of real-time commerce will eventually have it imposed upon them. The risk for the business – and certainly for treasury – is that systems and processes put in place without consulting with treasury will not function optimally from a risk and liquidity point of view.</p>
<h4 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h4>
<p>Shifting towards a real-time operating environment is a huge undertaking. Treasurers should begin by sharing insights with their colleagues about the different models and tools available. This should be about exploring the strengths and weaknesses of the options, and how each might best serve the business.</p>
<p>Historically, new systems and services have been acquired through a standard RFP. Whilst this might contain a request for ‘innovation’, its delivery is typically stilted, failing to take into account the developing needs of the wider business. However, the idea of ‘co-creation’ in this space can facilitate creativity and the most beneficial outcomes for the corporate.</p>
<p>Prototyping and piloting concepts with technology vendors and banks, using agile development techniques, can enable a business to build solutions that meet the changing market dynamics. This process is based on a true partnership and understanding between the provider, the treasury, and the rest of the business.</p>
<p>Having engaged with and understood the needs of the business, treasury should start a conversation with its proposed external banking or technology partners. Asking each to meet and take part in an innovation workshop should reveal levels of awareness and understanding of new technologies and appropriate business models. The process should also expose the individual bank or vendor’s commitment, capability and readiness to helping the business reach the right outcome.</p>
<p>This often becomes a self-selecting exercise as the banks or vendors that really understand the issues become quickly apparent. It’s then a matter of how well teams on each side gel; co-creation is a close partnership that requires honesty, integrity and flexibility.</p>
<p>Of course, if the best outcome requires more than one partner, so be it. After all, thriving in the real-time world is all about making the right connections, both digital and human.</p>

<p><em>From AI to APIs, new technology is poised to transform treasury processes. But how can you decide which developments are really relevant for your organisation – and is there still an argument for a spreadsheet-based approach to treasury?</em></p>
<p>Choosing the right technology has long been part and parcel of the treasurer’s job. But with the technologies available becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse, some of the developments on the horizon may be more valuable than others. Given the pace of development, how can treasurers best identify which areas of innovation can provide real value for their organisations? And conversely, is there still scope for treasuries to operate effectively without embracing the adoption of sophisticated technology – or even by sticking with the humble spreadsheet?</p>
<h4 id=""rise-of-technology"">Rise of technology</h4>
<p>Thomas Stahr, Interim Treasurer and Managing Partner of Stahr GmbH – Treasury Consulting, notes that the landscape for treasury technology has evolved considerably in recent years. While the market for ERP is large, he says, “the market for treasury technology was dominated for many years by just a few market players, with solutions for large and very large corporates.” Even today, Stahr says, “there are just about 50-60 vendors of professional treasury software – and just a handful of them are real market players with global distributed customers.”</p>
<p>At the same time, treasurers themselves have become increasingly focused on technology. “Treasury as a whole is facing a revolution in terms of technology,” says Leonardo Orlando, an executive in Accenture’s Finance and Risk practice. He notes that while this applies to both the corporate world and to financial services, the two areas are moving at different speeds, not least because of the regulatory pressure applied to banks. “In the corporate world, the focus is more on how organisations can embed technology to become more efficient,” he adds.</p>
<p>And Erik Åkerlund, Head of Sales at Treasury Systems, argues that there is a bigger emphasis than ever on the role of technology in treasury. “Technology is essentially solving the same kind of problems as 20 years ago, but it’s much more autonomous and easy to use today,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""areas-of-opportunity"">Areas of opportunity</h4>
<p>So where are the most interesting areas of development? Research carried out last year by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) on behalf of Deutsche Bank asked treasurers which technologies they believed would be most beneficial for their organisations moving forward. In first place was big data analytics systems (56%), followed by AI/ML systems (42%) and instant payments (34%). At the other end of the scale, blockchain and open APIs were cited by only 13% and 8% of respondents respectively.</p>
<p>That’s not to say these developments lack promise. Nick Armstrong, CEO of Identitii, outlines some of the benefits arising from developments in blockchain and tokenisation. “The benefits of blockchain have been proven – unalterable, completely auditable and time-stamped,” he says. “What treasurer wouldn’t want a completely auditable record of all activities, payments and documents at the push of a button?”</p>
<p>Armstrong also says that tokenisation – in the form of “unique identifiers that can collect, connect, reconcile and report on payables and receivables” – offers numerous benefits, such as reconciling incoming payments more rapidly and simplifying reporting by providing regulators “with secure access to parts of those records on the blockchain.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Armstrong notes the opportunities arising from open banking. “Platforms that enable settlement data to travel along with clearing, remittance and regulatory reporting data are now able to link into payment engines, banks and networks,” he says, noting that this can “improve data integrity and create direct sharing of information between buyers, sellers, banks, regulators and payment networks.”</p>
<h4 id=""what-problem-are-you-trying-to-solve"">What problem are you trying to solve?</h4>
<p>Of course, any new technology has to have a purpose. Aurélien Viry, Global Head of Cash Management at Societe Generale, says that when seeking out new technology, treasurers typically focus on achieving specific business objectives. He adds, “Nobody embraces technology for technology’s sake.”</p>
<p>According to Viry, the goals that treasurers are focusing on have evolved considerably in recent years. “At a recent industry event, everyone was talking about change – and treasurers increasingly see change management as the centrepiece of their jobs,” he says.</p>
<p>Consequently, he says that the goals treasurers are looking to meet with new technologies include addressing areas such as fraud and security, which might be tackled using developments in data analytics or biometrics. But he says treasurers are also looking to leverage developments like SWIFT gpi to gain more transparency over their international payments.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""barriers-to-adoption"">Barriers to adoption</h4>
<p>While the benefits can be attractive, treasurers aren’t always in a position to embrace technology wholeheartedly. Åkerlund points out that the need to change routines and processes to fit a standard technology can lead to some resistance. He adds, “There is also a fear amongst the treasurer’s team colleagues that technology is rationalising their job away, when in fact it should be appreciated as a better way of working and not necessarily taking jobs away.”</p>
<p>Other barriers to adoption include cost – as Stahr notes, not every treasurer has the budget for a system that could range from €20,000 for implementing a small tool to over €1m for a comprehensive system. “Even treasurers have to show the return of every investment before they get the budget,” he says. “Fortunately, it is easier for treasurers to calculate such a return than it is for other departments, such as accounting.”</p>
<p>A further barrier that may need to be overcome is that of internal resistance from elsewhere in the organisation. “Treasurers have to convince and sell the technology investments in-house and are probably still facing a lot of resistance,” says Åkerlund. “They may get push back, with people asking: ‘Can’t you do this routine in Excel?’ or ‘Can’t we use existing tools to accomplish the same thing?’”</p>
<h4 id=""sticking-with-spreadsheets"">Sticking with spreadsheets?</h4>
<p>Despite all these benefits, is there still an argument for a spreadsheet-based approach to treasury? “No,” says Armstrong, explaining that “reporting requirements alone make this untenable.” In addition, he says that spreadsheets inject too much operational risk in the form of human error or ‘fat fingered’ mistakes – and he notes that spreadsheets also lack automation, needing manual input “at almost every level.”</p>
<p>Others may be less emphatic when ruling out the possibility of a spreadsheet-based treasury. But while Orlando says that a spreadsheet-based approach to treasury “is always an option”, he also says the question is to what extent a treasurer can rely on their spreadsheets at a time when there is a growing need for real-time information.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have any FX risk because you are just trading your own currency, and you don’t have any interest rate risk because you don’t have any variable interest rate debt or investments – do you really need to be at the very top end of technology?” says Orlando. “Maybe you really don’t need that, and can still rely on your spreadsheets for cash management, or even outsource cash management to an external provider.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Orlando also notes that this is an extreme example, adding that a purely spreadsheet-based approach is unlikely to be the best option. “The ultimate driver must be competitiveness – in other words, how competitive you can make your business,” he says. “To be seen as an enabler of this, treasury needs to work in an efficient manner, and in a way that is optimal for the business.”</p>
<h4 id=""what-about-smaller-treasuries"">What about smaller treasuries?</h4>
<p>Åkerlund does say there might be room for a spreadsheet-based approach in really small corporate treasuries – but he adds that this is slowly diminishing. “Even though the operation is small, the risks aren’t – and that calls for technology to manage the operational risks that come with using spreadsheets.”</p>
<p>But that’s not to say that spreadsheets are likely to die out any time soon. Stahr argues that spreadsheets are “still the number one tool in nearly all treasury departments”, other than insurance companies and banks.</p>
<p>He notes that even companies with a dedicated treasury management system often use spreadsheets for reporting purposes: “In larger corporates with big databases it is still a kind of ‘last mile’, making information visible, for instance, with power pivots out of very large SQLs.” He also says that adoption of a fully-fledged TMS is still rare in small and medium sized corporates, which still tend to use Excel as their “one and only database and calculating tool.”</p>
<h4 id=""making-the-most"">Making the most</h4>
<p>While most would argue that technology has much more to offer than spreadsheets, it’s also important to note that simply purchasing a new system may not be enough to achieve the intended benefits. Åkerlund says that new technology has to be easy to set up and use on a day-to-day basis – otherwise treasurers may find they end up with the same output as with older technology. “I would bet that there are so many corporates out there sitting on great existing technology today which may not be the latest – but they haven’t bothered to investigate the possibilities and benefits of starting to use it,” he adds.</p>
<p>And of course, the technologies available are becoming increasingly diverse. How, then, can treasurers weigh up the available options and choose the approach that is the best fit for their organisations? The experts have some suggestions to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify business goals.</strong> Pinning down the specific problems that need to be addressed is a prerequisite. “Treasurers first need to understand and prioritise their business goals – whether those relate to cost, fraud prevention, cash concentration or optimising payments,” says Viry. “They can then look for the right technology and the right innovations that will best serve their priorities. This includes being able to identify which technologies can further their goals – and which ones are more of a diversion.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider best-of-breed solutions.</strong> Likewise, Åkerlund recommends that treasurers should be open to the new API landscape and define exactly what kind of problems they need to solve. “Then look out for specific point solutions and their respective partners on what they can offer, since it will probably be the most cost-effective way to go. Basically I think you should consider best-of-breed over all-in-one.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weigh up the benefits of the technology under consideration.</strong> Stahr advises that treasury “should carefully qualify and then quantify the benefits of treasury technology.” He adds that from a treasury perspective, these benefits may include having the various exposures and liquidity under control, reducing the risks of inaccurate reporting and reducing costs by introducing better efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get buy-in.</strong> Viry also notes the importance of getting buy-in from stakeholders and top management. “When I talk to treasurers, they always say this is an important task – and sometimes it’s more challenging than the implementation itself. So getting everyone on board should be a priority.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimise the impact on existing systems.</strong> Armstrong says that as well as focusing on the business benefit, companies also need to minimise the impact of new technology on existing systems. However, he notes that this isn’t always easy, with existing systems often interlinked with multiple other systems. “There are technologies and companies out there that are working to enhance the systems already in place for treasurers,” he says.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, few would argue in favour of a spreadsheet-based approach to treasury. With many treasuries now having to get more done with fewer resources, technology has much to offer when it comes to efficiency and the ability to generate greater insights from data. And while the evolving technology landscape can be challenging to navigate, many treasurers will relish the opportunity. As Viry concludes, “I would tend to think that treasurers who are reluctant to embrace change will have long since made a career change.”</p>

<p>When Richard Shaw joined Prudential Corporation Asia in 2014, the company’s decentralised treasury operations were reliant on spreadsheets and manual processes, with a degree of inconsistency between the models used by different business units. The company has over 1,000 bank accounts – and as Shaw observes, keeping track of cash using spreadsheets was a complicated manual process.</p>
<p>In a project that was highly commended in the 2018 Adam Smith Awards Asia, Shaw led treasury through the adoption of a cloud-based solution provided by Reval. As a result, the company has been able to automate processes and standardise best practice controls across the region. While each business unit manages its own daily cash, the new tools optimise liquidity and automate the creation, approval and transmission of payments via SWIFT. The benefits of the project also included releasing material levels of liquidity to be invested in higher yielding assets and automating daily cash visibility across Asia.</p>
<p>Given these achievements, Shaw is a firm believer in the importance of technology to the treasurer’s role. “When we were using spreadsheets, we only received high level data from our business units once a month. In contrast, the treasury now receives detailed data and on a daily basis. “Under the old operating model this would have been very difficult to achieve,” Shaw says. “The only option would have been to apply more resource in our business units to produce and submit detailed daily reports, with central resource required to write and maintain macros to consolidate the information. This would not have been as cost-effective, robust or scalable as a systemised solution.”</p>
<p>Given the benefits that treasury has already gleaned by harnessing technology, Shaw is keeping an eye on developments that could bring new opportunities in the coming years. For one thing, he’s interested in the potential benefits of using robots to automate repetitive daily processes, although at this stage he argues this is not a cost-effective option for some treasuries. Other areas of interest include using APIs for bank connectivity, as well as the use of data visualisation tools for reporting purposes.</p>
<p>Shaw also notes the importance of taking the time to evaluate which technologies can really benefit treasury. “What we’ve done is really quite leading edge, but we’re pretty measured in what we’re doing,” he says. “We’re aware of these new developments, and it’s in our plan to consider them – however at the same time, you need to make sure that what you’re adopting will add tangible value to your operations and has longevity. The world is rapidly changing, so you need a good sense that you’re going to get a sufficient return on your investment before adopting new technology.”</p>


","From AI to APIs, new technology is poised to transform treasury processes. But how can you decide which developments are really relevant for your organisation – and is there still an argument for a spreadsheet-based approach to treasury?",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2019-07-08-tta-08-t__business-technology-software-development-iot-concept-1187255977__1920x1080.jpg,2019-07-01,Treasury Systems,False

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Similar to what has happened recently, where operational and transactional tasks have been streamlined and partly automated, the evolutionary phase we are seeing now is focusing more on what automation is yet to achieve; making it more pervasive and better integrated within the full treasury platform, while helping to more effectively manage risk.</p>
<p>These factors may have the following immediate effects on the daily activities of the treasury function:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As automation starts delivering on multiple aspects of treasury, the creation of bandwidth will allow teams to focus on strategic aspects and less on manual tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New data processing techniques will continue to grow and, as such, these skill sets will develop within treasury, leading to more data-assisted decision-making across treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury will be part of business strategy discussions. The main benefit will be the reciprocal understanding between ‘business’ and ‘treasury’ where key decisions will take into account the treasury perspective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To facilitate the shift from the current semi-automated treasury status to the fully-automated version, one ingredient is essential: the right ‘culture’. Often, those who work in treasury don’t have the time to consider how best to innovate treasury and its processes, despite having the in-depth knowledge required to envision such a change. Hence, the overlaying framework and organisation in which they operate is critically important. A company culture fostering advancement will be the ‘secret ingredient’.</p>
<p>The expectation is to have treasury converging toward a more automated organisation. To achieve this status, treasury teams will need to evolve accordingly (and this includes development of new specific skills). Working on this assumption, it is likely that a radically different set of skills – such as those of the data-scientist, developer or IT professional – will be as prominent as a traditional grounding in economics and finance.</p>
<p>However, whilst the emerging technologies will deliver actionable intelligence and predictive analytics, with the potential to significantly reduce the manual overhead, there is still no expectation that machines will replace humans, as our oversight will still be required.</p>
<p>Before embarking on a digitisation journey, there are many things that treasury organisations must consider. These include which technologies to invest in, and how the organisation will approach the implementation process. It’s critical that organisations adopt a well-balanced approach, matching the benefits of any new technology with the readiness of the business to adopt them.</p>
<p>Understanding external factors, such as regulatory requirements and the evolution of the banking infrastructure in specific contexts and/or geographies, is another important consideration when making decisions about technology.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that we are living through some of the greatest changes in business; not for nothing has our time been dubbed the ‘fourth industrial revolution’. The most likely effects of this period on treasury are two-fold. There is the growing relevance of treasury in the core-business decision-making process, thanks to the bandwidth created by process automation. But there is an increased risk that treasury’s shift toward automation may bring about an uncontrolled ‘revolution’.</p>
<p id=""infographic-video"">With the pros and cons in mind, it is clear that careful planning, a balanced approach and a future-oriented culture, alongside closer partnerships with key banks, is the solution to a smooth transition into the treasury of the future.</p>

<p><em>The adoption of technology in corporate treasury is reaching a tipping point. Bottomline’s latest podcast with Treasury Today unveils the meaning of payments innovation.</em></p>
<p style=""margin:2em 0 2em 0;""><a class=""button--red-stroke"" href=""/bottomline-payments-innovation-podcast"">Listen to the podcast</a></p>
<p>The way corporate treasurers pay and get paid has evolved rapidly in recent years; enabling this change is cloud technology, says Bottomline’s Marcus Hughes.</p>
<p>The widespread use of data transformation, and the growing adoption of APIs, are making it easier for systems to communicate. This alone is resulting in the highest levels of straight through processing. But new regulations, compliance requirements and payment instruments and formats are further encouraging innovation and competition so that real-time payment systems are now a reality.</p>
<p>“Such progress is also helping treasurers to reduce complexity and enhance visibility, security, speed, connectivity and efficiency,” notes Hughes. “Opportunities abound for treasurers, enhancing their role and relationship within their organisations.” Cloud, he believes, is at the forefront of treasury progress.</p>
<h4 id=""single-view"">Single view</h4>
<p>Improving cash visibility remains a top priority for treasurers, having assumed greater strategic importance. Cloud-based technology accelerates this goal, providing accurate, up to date often real-time information, supporting enhanced decision-making.</p>
<p>In creating a single, cloud-based payment and cash management platform, treasurers can streamline processing across all applications, payment types and banks, explains Hughes. A treasury management system could do this, but even the best are not designed to handle large bulk payment files and Direct Debits. “A more practical solution is a separate payments and cash management platform, designed for the full range of payments, and accessible by a wider group of users,” he offers.</p>
<p>Cloud-based payment and cash management platforms are particularly well suited to organisations with multiple ERP/TMS systems, he adds. “Creating a central hub with multi-bank connectivity is quicker and cheaper than trying to migrate all systems onto a single ERP.”</p>
<p>Payments is perhaps the area most disrupted by technology. With Request to Pay, new ways of forwarding remittance data, and payment status checking coming on-stream, the shift to real-time payments means real-time cash management is now possible.</p>
<p>Cyber fraud and financial crime are a constant threat here. But there is considerable progress in developing technology to detect and prevent fraud, and even identify AML breaches. Machine learning, advanced analytics and profiling payment patterns, for example, enable systems to capture, learn and distinguish between normal and suspect activities, flagging and blocking potentially fraudulent payments in real-time. Just knowing this system is in place is a powerful deterrent, says Hughes.</p>
<h4 id=""helping-hands"">Helping hands</h4>
<p>Regulation is helping treasuries to benefit from technology. PSD2 enables open banking through APIs, creating a more competitive payments landscape. A business can instruct its bank to share balance and transaction data with regulated Account Information Service Providers. These can aggregate that data across multiple banks, making multi-bank cash visibility easier.</p>
<p>Businesses can also require their banks to accept payment instructions via regulated Payment Initiation Service Providers. With functionality like cash flow forecasting, bank-fee analysis and cash allocation, managing payments across multiple banks also becomes easier.</p>
<p>However, says Hughes, the roll-out of APIs under PSD2 only covers the EEA. Other regions are announcing initiatives, but progress is slow. In response, Bottomline offers a hybrid solution, combining PSD2 APIs with its own SWIFT BIC capability. Designed for mid-sized corporates which do not want SWIFT membership, he says this solution offers “significant advantages” over fintechs restricted by the slow roll-out of APIs.</p>
<h4 id=""cloud-peace-of-mind"">Cloud peace of mind</h4>
<p>Cloud-based technology means treasury peace of mind, says Hughes. “Provided the right technology partner is selected, their platform offers lower TCO and future-proofs against regulatory change and new payment schemes. Cloud also ensures reduced operational risk, with proven resilience and Disaster Recovery, and 24/7 support.”</p>
<p>Selecting a software partner which is also an accredited SWIFT service bureau gives access to value-adding services like data transformation and reconciliation, removes the need for internal SWIFT expertise, and future-proofs connectivity, he continues. “It also makes sense to leverage access to multiple protocols and connectivity options – such as host-to-host, EBICS, Bacs and Faster Payments – from a single provider, rather than a separate bureau, software provider and third-party hosting provider.”</p>
<h4 id=""future-days"">Future days</h4>
<p>“I’m confident it will be a more efficient business world, with more secure and smarter payments and intelligent cash management,” predicts Hughes. “This will come from technology providers listening to their customers and delivering solutions that solve their real-world pain points.”</p>
<p>Wider adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is on his specific technological horizon, especially where current processes are slow, complex and manually intensive. Use of tokenisation and DLT, as in Visa’s B2B Connect, has potential to make cross-border payments in conventional currencies more efficient and trackable.</p>
<p>Across the podcast, Hughes’ ultimate message is this: treasury technology is rapidly evolving, and treasurers need to consider how best to leverage innovation. “Only by doing so, will you be able to play an even greater role in helping your organisation capture new growth and investment opportunities.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For James Lee, Citi’s EMEA Sector Head Tech, Media and Telecoms, Treasury and Trade Solutions, the impact of the 5G revolution will be felt far and wide. The active participation at MWC of companies from not just the traditional mobile tech and infrastructure sub-sectors, but increasingly from associated sectors such as automotive, social media, e-commerce, FinTech and gaming, is testament to the potential transformational impact of 5G. It also means treasurers from many sectors will be at the financial forefront as businesses all over the world begin leveraging the opportunities and meeting the challenges set by this new age of communication.</p>
<p>This may sound grandiose, but the technological difference between 4G and 5G is night and day in terms of volumes of transmittable data and the latency of transmission, explains Lee – Gbps vs Mbps today. 5G adoption is heralding a new industry dynamic as many smaller, high-growth companies see opportunities through 5G, and some unexpected partnerships form among the major players.</p>
<h4 id=""prospects"">Prospects</h4>
<p>Opportunities include greater potential for remote industrial monitoring systems, further development of autonomous vehicles, and the expansion from virtual reality (VR) to augmented reality (AR). The latter will, for example, be seen in the consumer space, in live gaming applications, and in real-time ‘tele-mentoring,’ such as 5G remote mentoring for complex surgeries between one surgeon and another, as was demonstrated at MWC this year at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.</p>
<p>Naturally, as new ground is broken, challenges arise. The telecoms industry is heavily regulated, says Lee, and recurring fees for 5G licencing and mobile ‘spectrum’ costs are a heavy burden for the mobile network operators (MNOs), who are also facing major capital investments to deploy 5G-capable infrastructure.</p>
<p>5G represents a conflicting opportunity for MNOs – by 2025, data consumption is forecast to grow 400% from 2018 levels; however corresponding revenue growth is forecast at 1%. Mobile telecoms is a huge enabler for commerce – data-driven value creation is estimated to be US$4.6trn by 2022; however it is forecast that 95% of the value created will be taken by over-the-top (OTT) end-user experience providers such as Alibaba, Amazon, Google and Facebook, with only 5% enjoyed by the MNOs.</p>
<p>Driven perhaps by such metrics, MNOs like Vodafone and O2 recently announced the sharing of 5G-enabling infrastructure in the UK; with partnering clearly in vogue, Mercedes and BMW used their MWC platform to announce a US$1bn all-electric autonomous mobility JV programme.</p>
<p>The huge growth in mobile wallets, particularly in developing markets, is also seeing some exciting new partnerships. African MNO giants MTN and Orange announced in November 2018 the pan-African JV, Mowali, enabling mobile wallet payment interoperability between MNOs, it brings together 100 million mobile money accounts and mobile money operations in 22 sub-Saharan African markets.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-calling"">Treasury calling</h4>
<p>Treasurers in the midst of this evolving environment have the opportunity to deliver new efficiencies and to support the business, says Lee. This is seeing the rise in adoption of tools such as virtual accounts, and companies leveraging payments- and receivables-on-behalf-of (POBO and ROBO) structures to truly deliver efficient in-house bank structures. There is renewed focus too on working capital management, with sector players deploying trade solutions such as supply chain finance and sales financing solutions (to support sales growth) to great effect. Virtual Card Accounts (VCA) solutions are also providing working capital benefits as well as helping clients leverage detailed payments data to better analyse B2B spend.</p>
<p>Indeed, says Lee, a key focus at Citi is to give clients across all sectors more timely and usable data and insight. In launching CitiConnect API, for example, Citi is supporting the two-way flow of real-time payments and collections data between Citi and our clients, he says.</p>
<h4 id=""strong-support"">Strong support</h4>
<p>With innovative technologies facilitating the growth of new trading models, such as direct-to-consumer, and the expansion of instant ‘micro-payments’, there is increased pressure on treasurers to support the underlying businesses evolving needs. Fortunately, the quest to become more efficient in supporting these new models and financial flows is strongly buoyed by banks as they roll-out API and real-time payment concepts.</p>
<p>Citi is taking it further, states Lee, partnering with the fintech HighRadius for the delivery in 2018 of Citi Smart Match, a sophisticated auto-matching reconciliation tool for receivables that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning. Recently Citi announced the development of a Digital Consumer Payments Business to enable institutional clients to collect from consumers through a wide variety of payment methods (including cards, e-wallets, Request-to-Pay and Open Banking), reflecting the growing shift towards direct B2C sales.</p>
<p>With these advanced tools, and the disruptive concept of ‘Industry 4.0’ much in evidence at MWC, notions such as technology-assisted financial inclusion in emerging territories gain ground. With the impact of Industry 4.0 and the 5G opportunity, Lee reasserts his belief that “treasuries should continue to develop a deeper understanding of and support for their underlying business.” With support from banks such as Citi, doing so will lead to the emergence of the next generation of “true business-enablers,” not just in tech, media and telecoms, but across the board.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>How, in an age when new technologies are offered with unprecedented frequency, can treasurers benefit from progress whilst avoiding failures? A treasurer, a vendor and a banker offer tips on future-proofing.</em></p>
<h4 id=""the-treasurers-view"">The treasurer’s view</h4>
<p>The idea of future-proofing for Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer, Ferguson Group means “having the ability to grow with a solution for the foreseeable future”. Although at some stage it is inevitable that existing systems will have to change, when that time comes – and it may be driven by commercial or regulatory pressure, or simple obsolescence – he maintains that treasurers today have, as never before, the chance to experiment with new solutions where, if something doesn’t work out, “it doesn’t have to be a disaster”.</p>
<p>Certainly, with the rise of the fintechs and their disruptive offerings, there have been some interesting partnerships formed with banks where the ‘sandbox’ approach to development has enabled safe and lower-cost exploration, in some cases with regulatory blessing to use real-world data (such as the FCA’s regulatory sandbox). But what is on the menu?</p>
<h4 id=""rich-pickings"">Rich pickings</h4>
<p>It will have quickly become apparent to most treasurers attending conferences these days that the main technology discussion points are APIs, AI, blockchain and cloud-based solutions. Perhaps the main enabler of progress here is a cloud-based environment. Indeed, Da Costa feels Ferguson’s roster of 14 such solutions is helping to future-proof the group’s treasury, simply because whenever a new cloud solution is considered, its compatibility across the board is assured.</p>
<p>However, the approach Da Costa takes with any of these technologies is one of pragmatism. “I’m always on the lookout for any new tools that would add value to our business but I’m not going to lose sleep over whether we adopt them or not,” he states. “Technology is not my core responsibility; it is the responsibility of the suppliers that are looking to develop these solutions, to come up with viable proposals.”</p>
<p>He attends to the market closely, playing an active development role with some vendors and banks. “Developing the right solutions demands that they know their clients’ pain points and goals,” he explains. Although this inevitably leads to conversations about ‘exciting’ new technologies, he remains rational, adding that “a solution could be based on blockchain, or some other technology; to me, ultimately, it’s about solving the problem, not using a specific technology”.</p>
<p>When seeking a solution, in every case, Da Costa says treasury must first identify and understand what it is trying to achieve. From a business-case perspective he advocates considering all options. “Sometimes it may well be a case of ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’.” That said, whilst there may be little advantage in implementing technology for the sake of it, he believes that “having a system is usually better than not having one”.</p>
<h4 id=""engine-of-growth"">Engine of growth</h4>
<p>In explanation, he says a business needs to be efficient and agile to grow. Its processes must therefore be underpinned by systems capable of facilitating and keeping up with that growth. New technologies such as AI and blockchain may well be subject to much hype, but the hype, he feels, often has some basis in truth.</p>
<p>For Da Costa then, the treasury issue around future-proofing should not necessarily be about judging the right time to jump or whether to jump at all. Instead he argues that as long as common sense, due diligence, and appropriate checks and balances prevail, it is more a question of whether treasury “can afford not to take that leap”.</p>
<p>Ferguson’s first ever move into the cloud in 2015 was accompanied by some understandable hesitancy. As such, it went through a lengthy internal process of ensuring that all the right boxes were ticked for engaging with the provider, to the point where it looked at the company’s financials and even arranged for penetration testing of the system, to see how resilient it was to cyber-attack.</p>
<h4 id=""rapport"">Rapport</h4>
<p>Although happy to embrace the technology revolution, Da Costa knows that, in his position, he cannot move without first ensuring he has all the facts. He has access to a helpful IT department but where this resource is not available, he suggests either appointing an external consultant, or simply talking to the banks for whom “it is in their interest” to ensure their clients are using secure technology.</p>
<p>Of course, not every new solution has the wow factor. In keeping clients up to speed, whilst banks tend to be “more proactive”, Da Costa feels it will be a vendor’s business model that dictates its willingness to help customers with specific requirements. Many will look at the nature of the issue and how many customers it affects (and which particular customers) before deciding the commercial viability of investment.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a change is required by all, especially where regulation is the catalyst. In such a case, treasurers may feel that vendors should be taking the initiative. However, Da Costa recalls how the sparsity of ready-solutions following the introduction of EMIR reporting on derivative contracts in 2013 caught some treasurers by surprise.</p>
<p>In both cases, keeping the channels open and bringing up pertinent issues at monthly meetings, ensures there can be no doubt as to what is expected some way into the future. “If you really want to keep up with or ahead of your competition, then it’s incumbent upon you to build a truly dynamic relationship with your vendors and banks; and it has to be two-way.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-vendors-view"">The vendor’s view</h4>
<p>Future-proofing is not a matter of being technologically advanced, but one of being able to flexibly use technology in order to meet the future needs of treasury and the business, says Bob Stark, VP Strategy at Kyriba. As long as treasury fully understands what it needs, and will need, “it is in a position to find the right technology to be future-proofed”.</p>
<p>The need for understanding amplifies the importance of treasury opening up the discussion to other parts of the business. Historically, treasury has made technology decisions independently, notes Stark. When treasury makes its own decisions, its focus will naturally be on meeting its own functional requirements.</p>
<p>Whether treasury needs to talk to further flung functions – such as procurement or sales – before undertaking a technology upgrade depends on the business and how treasury relates to those other functions. But, says Stark, it is worth considering that for a core treasury responsibility such as building a cash forecast, execution in isolation may not give treasury the perspective that relates, for example, to how sales team expenses play out in the field, or what new markets are being prospected.</p>
<p>Indeed, he argues, lack of visibility over such aspects makes it harder for treasurers to gain an accurate assessment of their own cash and liquidity expectations, with all the negative consequences this has for working capital management. As such, he urges treasurers to maintain “openness to collaboration” to ensure the “smoothest possible flow of information across the business”.</p>
<p>At some point, new or updated technology will be necessary. In terms of ‘future-proofing’ that technology, one pitfall to avoid is the solution that has a “shelf-life”, warns Stark. If treasury’s technology is built only to meet today’s requirements, its obsolescence is a problem-in-waiting.</p>
<p>Currently, the cloud delivery model appears to be the model most capable of offering resilience to obsolescence, simply because product development and integrability is the business, and indeed lifeblood of the technology provider; its own survival is, after all, contingent upon continued delivery of appropriate technologies.</p>
<h4 id=""red-flag"">Red flag</h4>
<p>Avoiding the pitfall requires treasurers to probe the details, says Stark. How is the system future-proofed? What is the vendor’s vision for incorporating AI or blockchain into the platform? Can it point to hard use-cases for these new technologies? Is it innovating in-house or using third-parties?</p>
<p>By exploring the innovative capacity of the vendor, it will become apparent if it has any appetite to pursue advanced technologies or if it is merely watching and waiting or, worse, ignoring them. Any indication of vendor-unpreparedness in respect of how it intends to tackle the future needs of its clients should be a “red flag”, he warns.</p>
<h4 id=""joint-decisions"">Joint decisions</h4>
<p>Treasurers should task themselves with keeping up to speed with technology developments, suggests Stark. Expertise is not necessary but a deeper curiosity will allow the treasurer to start asking the right questions, steering them towards an understanding of how AI, robotics, blockchain and any other advancement might be useful in their own function.</p>
<p>“It’s about being curious enough to find out what those technologies might mean for treasury,” he comments. “The treasurer’s responsibility is to understand what their requirements are today – and what their value and impact are – so they can prioritise needs as far forwards as they can sensibly predict.”</p>
<p>If treasury’s collaboration with the business proves useful during the technology discovery and mapping phase, then it will surely benefit to take the same approach within the organisation during system selection and deployment, says Stark.</p>
<p>Treasurers who are in touch with the market will know what products answer their own technical needs, but in-house experts drawn from other disciplines can help guide the process towards solutions that meet the needs of the whole business. What’s more, that deeper pool of expertise can better explore and define future-proofing by revealing how the organisation’s own clients, suppliers and other partners are engaging with technology.</p>
<h4 id=""time-to-jump"">Time to jump</h4>
<p>Of course, no one wants to be burdened with obsolete or incompatible technology. However, says Stark, the rapidly evolving nature of the industry means there are many opportunities to improve treasury technology incrementally, rather than wholesale. It is still necessary to know the value of switching technologies, he states. “Every function can point to needs that are not being met, but when asking ‘when is the right time to jump’, the correct response is ‘when treasury can identity value that can be derived from deploying new technology’.”</p>


<blockquote><p>I’m always on the lookout for any new tools that would add value to our business but I’m not going to lose sleep over whether we adopt them or not. Technology is not my core responsibility; it is the responsibility of the suppliers that are looking to develop these solutions, to come up with viable proposals.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>If, for example, there is quantifiable value in being able to produce more reliable long-term cash forecasts but technology is required to do so, a business case for new technology can be made. The strength of this case increases in proportion to the ROI, especially if that technology delivers more ROI than competing business cases (and typically there will be many).</p>
<p>Treasury may make a quantifiable case for the technology it needs to do the ‘day job’. But if it works collaboratively on building out a future-proofed technology landscape, it should also be able to quantify the value it brings to the rest of the business. Indeed, as Stark notes, “the more value you can prove, the more you can future-proof yourself”.</p>
<h4 id=""the-banks-view"">The bank’s view</h4>
<p>“We are witnessing the most radical change treasury has seen,” notes Rajesh Mehta, Head of Trade and Treasury Solutions, Asia Pacific, Citi. “The industry is rapidly moving towards real-time transactions, emerging technologies including AI and ML for forecasting, blockchain for information security and storage and the integration of platforms into banking services. While it is difficult to generalise how ready a treasury function is, generally speaking, a function that is more efficiently organised and already leveraging technology for transformation will be better prepared for the future.”</p>
<p>It is, he notes, also important to recognise that as the industry is changing, so is the role of the treasury function. “With the capabilities technology offers, treasury is evolving from being primarily efficiency-focused to being more business-focused.”</p>
<p>Indeed, organisations are increasingly transforming their business models to be consumer-facing as they seek to capture growth. The rise of e-Commerce, especially in Asia, continues to be powered by technology, high smartphone-penetration and the prominence of digital ecosystems, as well as the development of instantaneous payment infrastructure across various markets. This development has also turned its attention on supply chain convergence and how technology can be used to create a supply chain model that better corresponds to changing business models, says Mehta.</p>
<p>With a direct view of these shifts and resulting flows, the role of the treasurer is increasingly much more of a “business enabler”. The ability to evolve with appropriate talent also factors into how future-ready a treasurer or treasury function is.</p>
<h4 id=""evolving-treasury"">Evolving treasury</h4>
<p>For Mehta, future-proofing “is about taking actions, step by step, to bring different elements together to build a treasury that is fit for purpose for the future shape of the business it serves”.</p>
<p>This, he explains, involves having an investment plan that reflects the organisation’s strategy and priorities, being attuned to evolving treasury best practices and related governance, policies and technology given that they are the foundation of treasury. “It also means evolving treasury alongside key banking partners and having senior management recognise the changing and critical role of treasury.”</p>
<p>It is possible to plan ahead today, suggests Mehta. “At Citi, we have a Treasury Advisory Team that advises clients on how treasury is evolving for the future. The team counsels clients who are on their own transformation journeys, giving them a deeper understanding of relevant developments and helping them embrace the ongoing tech revolution.”</p>
<p>The plan, as Citi advises clients, needs to incorporate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Putting in place an organisation digital strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a digital strategy for treasury that aligns to the corporate digital strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrading and managing the evolution of skillsets for treasury employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging key banking partners to stay up-to-date and align.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""timing"">Timing</h4>
<p>“There is a fine line between being an early adopter and a beta-user/tester and sometimes the latter can have its advantages,” says Mehta. Being future-ready does not necessarily mean always being an early adopter. Whether or not to jump in with new technologies should depend on how relevant the expected benefits will be to the treasury function.</p>
<p>Those technologies that can produce a considerable competitive advantage and address various points of friction should be pursued, he says. There are specific technologies, like blockchain for example, that would completely change the ecosystem should adoption become widespread.</p>
<p>“While investments into these types of technologies sooner rather than later would make sense, it is important to again ascertain relevance and define use cases for initial use and implementation, possibly through learning focused pilots.”</p>
<p>But is there a way that treasury can make better judgements on what technologies are being offered or promised? For Mehta, there is no “instant recipe”. Better judgments can be made with comprehensive knowledge of the technologies being considered and thorough assessments on potential use cases and benefits, he advises.</p>
<p>However, there are a few factors to keep in mind. These, notes Mehta, would include understanding the fundamentals behind various technologies and assessing which would be most beneficial for the actual treasury set up. He continues: “Evaluate potential costs against expected benefits – taking a step back to re-examine the treasury set-up and evaluating whether it can be further optimised before making additional investments, and talking to banking providers to benchmark treasury technology to that of best-in-class peers.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>The payments space has for some time been a hotbed of innovation. Much of what has been brought to market is consumer-driven so should treasurers watch and wait or act now?</em></p>
<p>It’s hardly surprising that most of what is written and spoken about in terms of payments innovation eventually boils down to delivering the right ‘customer experience’. And why shouldn’t it? Giving customers the best possible user experience when it comes to meeting the fundamental need for every business – being paid – makes perfect sense. An effective payments experience may not be the main reason for using one business over another, but frustrate that process with poor technology and, rest assured, customers will go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Increasingly, there is a blurring of the distinction between the user experience expected by consumers, where most new technology is launched and proven (or killed off), and that of the corporate community. After all, every commercial user is at some point a consumer and will have a view on what is good and what is not. As consumer-style payments innovation reaches further into the corporate space, so expectations rise amongst companies and their customers of a similar experience.</p>
<p>Consumer and business needs “for a better experience, for simplicity and security” are commonly in the driving seat, with regulations such as PSD2, initiatives such as the UK’s New Payments Architecture (NPA), and the roll-out of more real time gross settlement systems globally, propelling the market forwards. For Dino Nicolaides, MD, Head of Treasury Advisory UK&amp;I, Redbridge Debt &amp; Treasury Advisory, companies that keep pace with the right innovations will be dodging a bullet marked ‘competition’.</p>
<p>The kind of innovation that is meeting this need is rarely a bolt from the blue. Instead, it is typically the result of evolution, notes Nicolaides. It is the adaptation of existing technology and knowledge “to provide something extra that serves or creates a need”.</p>
<p>In practice, this usually means being able to offer corporate customers a tailored version of mobile, online and real-time payments services and, vitally, the user-friendly experience they have come to expect in the consumer space.</p>
<h3 id=""mark-of-success"">Mark of success</h3>
<p>There is no shortage of new payments products vying for corporate attention. For Nicolaides, meeting the wants and needs of customers through these systems seems like a “no-brainer” given the competitive nature of most commercial sectors. If a solution “ticks all of the boxes” then its success is, or should be, inevitable.</p>
<p>However, he recognises that not all innovations tick all the boxes. Sometimes new solutions fall foul of over-complexity or lack end-user confidence, the latter despite the emergence of new ‘RegTech’ solutions to help businesses combat fraud and comply with KYC and AML requirements. But for corporates, he reports persistent concerns over how a new solution will be adapted and integrated into an existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>For vendors, it is a hard market to penetrate, and uptake of any innovation depends on many other factors, not least cost of ownership and the degree of need it is satisfying. Some solutions manage to create their own need but for most, the future is uncertain, notes Nicolaides. “If it is a nice-to-have, then it is competing with many others and may struggle. If it meets a real need that nobody has satisfied before, only then will it become a no-brainer.”</p>
<p>The agile fintech community has a hard time getting innovation accepted, but banks are not immune. For Phil Beck, Head of Treasury Management at Capital One Commercial Bank, there are three main issues that can hold back progress, at least from a commercial banking standpoint. The first is the age of the underlying technology across many institutions. Legacy mainframe technology (which in most cases is over 20 years old) was not built for the demands of mobile channel provision and real-time data access, he says.</p>
<p>Secondly, the needs of corporate clients are vastly more complicated than for individual consumers. “When an individual logs into a banking platform, generally speaking, they have full authority to do everything they need to do. In the corporate environment, different people have different access rights and processes span across organisational boundaries. That complexity makes the development and adoption of innovation a challenge.”</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is often an end-user change management challenge. Modernisation can sometimes be slower or less comprehensive than users expect, especially given the underlying technologies many institutions are working with and the relatively simple consumer experience most critics use as their reference point.</p>
<h3 id=""fit-for-purpose"">Fit for purpose</h3>
<p>Of course, the threat of cybercrime is never underplayed in the corporate space and innovation in fraud prevention is developing in parallel with payments solutions. “Solution providers have to keep one step ahead of the fraudsters,” says Marcus Hughes, Head of Strategic Business Development, Bottomline Technologies. “By using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), they are making sure both banks and corporates have the means of monitoring transactions and behaviours, looking for anomalies.”</p>
<p>In what appears to be a difficult set of circumstances for most commercial payment providers, Beck says services being delivered today are “adequate” and rarely of the quality a corporate might expect, given the raised expectations they have from their experience as consumers.</p>


<blockquote>Blockchain too has great potential but the agenda is so full there is almost project-overload, meaning delivery of some of the opportunities for treasurers are still years away.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Marcus Hughes, Head of Strategic Business Development, Bottomline Technologies</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For Nicolaides, the notion of whether current tools are fit-for-purpose is not so clear cut. What may be unsuitable for one business, sector or even country, may be perfect for another. It may be that hard currency is the only appropriate payment type in countries where there is black economy and little trust in the banking system.</p>
<p>Mindful of the constraints on progress, treasurers still want their own payments experience to be as simple and as easy as possible. Having the fingerprint or face ID-type log-ons that make life easier in the consumer world are being used in the commercial space “but nowhere near as broadly as they could be”, Beck notes.</p>
<p>Having the ability to log into one platform and see all account activity across an entire enterprise – versus the painful reality of using multiple tokens (50 or more is not uncommon in a large treasury) – is another ‘emerging’ corporate user experience. The relatively slow progress here suggests that current corporate solutions have some way to go, but Hughes rightly points out that the adoption of cloud technology “has brought major benefits” in terms of a quicker go-live, lower cost of entry and ownership, and indeed of future-proofing the organisation.</p>
<h3 id=""people-driven"">People-driven</h3>
<p>When it comes to innovation, the starting point is finding a genuine need for end-users, notes Nicolaides. Most innovations then require those users to adapt to how they will be used. So, is technology driving the way people think about their payments experience? Or is the way people think about payments driving technology?</p>
<p>“There are definitely some solutions out there – mostly on the periphery – that are looking for problems,” notes Hughes. The idea of using cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments being one example – one that he says already has regulators pondering the implications. “Blockchain too has great potential but the agenda is so full there is almost project-overload, meaning delivery of some of the opportunities for treasurers are still years away.”</p>
<p>Beck shares this view of blockchain. “Look at the amount of publicity that it receives; it is a great example of how technology is trying to drive an agenda,” he says.</p>
<p>In most cases (blockchain may be the exception), Beck feels this ‘innovation-first’ approach has limited success. “Despite a lot of hype, the impact is usually much more muted than what people might think is happening out there.” On the other hand, he believes there is a “significant amount of business-led innovation” that is pulling technology into leveraging change in the customer experience.</p>
<p>Real time processing sits somewhere in the middle. Instant payments tools have been successful in the consumer space, but for corporates, “the jury is still out”, says Hughes. Many treasurers are content with batch processing for most payments (and the three-day cycle in the UK will be ending over the next few years under NPA; other jurisdictions will surely follow just as they have with instant payments).</p>
<p>What treasurers really want, he notes, is real-time information. “It is more important to get the data showing what the payment relates to, and to know the payment is on its way or has been received by the beneficiary,” he explains. SWIFT’s gpi seems to answer the ‘track and trace’ need for certainty and visibility in single bank-to-bank transactions: its function in a multi-banking context is understood to be on the SWIFT agenda.</p>
<h3 id=""expectations"">Expectations</h3>
<p>If, within a new technology, its security is a given (and it should be), it offers a genuine and easily realisable benefit to the user, and there is a realistic cost of ownership, the other key requirement for corporates has to be ease of deployment, says Nicolaides. Any new system needs to integrate straightforwardly into existing business operations, not demand that its users undergo major technical surgery and process change. Indeed, Beck notes that “our customers want software to fit their needs now; they don’t want to have to build new processes for where a solution falls short”.</p>
<p>However, notes Hughes, it is possible that the deployment in the banking sector of certain technologies, notably APIs, will lead to the commoditisation of some processes. Standardisation will be great for corporate efficiency – especially when allied with AI and data aggregation tools to give vastly improved data sharing and analytics – but it does raise a question around service provider differentiation.</p>
<p>“If connectivity becomes commoditised, it will be the value-adding solutions that count,” he suggests. “That means processes such as cash flow forecasting, netting, spend analysis, cash allocation and bank fee analysis will need to become easier and quicker for treasurers.”</p>
<p>Of course, in reality, not all technologies are created equal and it is the adoption of the right technology that makes the difference, adds Beck. Backing the wrong horse is never good for business (Betamax anyone?). As such, it may seem counterintuitive, but competition and collaboration must become the norm.</p>


<blockquote>In most sound business relationships, technology is only ever an enabler. It should be driving tighter collaboration. For treasurers, I see a future where innovation actually brings the parties closer together.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The more payments systems and carrier channels are connected, the 
better the user experience. But as technology becomes more 
interdependent and complex, providers will have to accept that they 
cannot do everything, notes Nicolaides.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Alexa can automate home lighting, heating or entertainments 
systems but Amazon does not make these systems; it leaves that to the 
experts in their fields. The positive outcome is one of necessary 
collaboration, because offering a better user-experience is only 
possible when specialists work together. “It is an analogy that applies 
to payments because to work well, payments need to integrate with ERPs 
and TMSs and be compatible with a host of other corporate systems, each 
built by specialists. That can only come from collaboration.”</p>
<h3 id=""disintermediation"">Disintermediation</h3>
<p>That banks can differentiate through the adoption of the right 
technology is going to become more important. Regulatory change is 
paving the way for new payment providers to fundamentally transform the 
way this industry works and banks need to up the game.</p>
<p>Open banking, for example, is going to make multi-banking easier, 
especially for the midcap corporates, says Hughes. “Most of the news so 
far about open banking has been consumer-focused. There is a big 
opportunity for corporates here but more education is needed as not 
everyone is fully aware of the possibilities.”</p>
<p>With the roll-out of the APIs that facilitate open banking making 
headway (many banks at least have some programme in place), the idea 
that banks would somehow be disintermediated by the onset of 
PSD2-fuelled non-bank payment service providers is perhaps misguided. In
 fact, for Hughes, the early hype that promised a new breed of 
fast-moving fintechs “so innovative that they would eat the lunch of the
 incumbent banks” has largely dissipated.</p>
<p>Banks do not have the agility to develop cutting-edge solutions but 
they remain largely well-trusted. Fintechs have that agility but are yet
 to earn the trust. Herein lies the basis of a perfect partnership (one 
often resulting in the bank’s acquisition of the fintech). For Beck 
then, the future “will be nothing like how the market seemed to think it
 would be, with banks relegated to being relatively dumb back-end 
pipelines”.</p>
<p>Most banks today also understand that any business that is 
marginalised to the point where it cannot directly engage with its 
customers, or collaborate with them to drive innovation, is in trouble. 
They know that disintermediation from their customers is bad for them, 
obviously, but also for their corporate customers.</p>
<p>Long-standing relationships would be weakened. In treasury, these 
relationships extend way beyond just the transaction banking components;
 think about the impact on credit facilities and access to liquidity in 
stressed times. Clearly there is cost-benefit analysis to be undertaken 
when considering service portability versus strength of relationship.</p>
<p>“In most sound business relationships, technology is only ever an 
enabler,” states Beck. “It should be driving tighter collaboration. For 
treasurers, I see a future where innovation actually brings the parties 
closer together.”</p>
<h3 id=""early-adopter"">Early adopter</h3>
<p>By implementing the right tools, corporates and their treasuries have
 an opportunity to become part of an ecosystem where the whole is 
greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Although some of the current crop of innovations could be 
transformative, potentially having an immediate broad appeal 
(blockchain, for instance, if it gets past the hype phase), most new 
ideas will initially find their place in a retail or consumer context 
before transferring to the B2B environment. Request-to-pay, for example,
 will likely evolve into an e-invoicing system for business, with 
essential add-ons such as multiple levels of approval and access to 
supply chain finance helping to automate the financial supply chain with
 the integration of payments and documents.</p>
<p>The ‘consumer before corporate’ pathway is no bad thing. Taking this 
route allows each innovation to organically take root and build scale 
before being migrated into the vastly more complicated and far less 
homogenous corporate environment. Business users, including treasurers, 
will know what works for them as consumers, and they can see new 
technologies rise to the top or fall by the wayside under this harsh 
real-world scrutiny.</p>
<p>The providers of these technologies – banks, fintechs and vendors – 
are naturally keeping close tabs on every outcome. Where a corporate use
 case can be found, the need for every provider to differentiate in this
 competitive market will ensure innovation continues to be delivered.</p>
<p>But ‘innovation’ status doesn’t last forever. Treasurers need to stay
 alert to movements in the consumer payments space and know when the 
time is right to move. Customers have great expectations and stealing a 
march on the competition with the best payments experience is a good way
 to keep those paydays coming.</p>

<p><em>Big data has much to offer corporate treasurers – but at this early stage, most of the possible benefits have yet to be realised. Treasury Today Asia reviews the current state of affairs, the possible applications of this technology, and the pitfalls that treasurers should be aware of.</em></p>
<p>How big is big data? The short answer: not as big as it’s going to be. A report published by big data consultancy WHISHWORKS found that while only 18% of UK companies have fully adopted big data, 47% have tentatively started initiatives and 29% are actively investigating the opportunities. Meanwhile, Wikibon predicts the worldwide big data market will reach US$103bn by 2027, up from about US$40bn currently.</p>
<p>As far as treasurers are concerned, big data has plenty to offer. Research by the Economist Intelligence Unit on behalf of Deutsche Bank found that over half (56%) of treasurers believe big data analytics systems will be beneficial to their organisation in the future, ahead of AI/ML systems, instant payments, RPA and blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>Where specific areas of interest are concerned, a 2017 survey by Euromoney and J.P. Morgan asked which areas of treasury big data would impact the most. In first place was customer behaviour insights, cited by 30% of respondents, while 27% opted for cash forecasting. Other areas of interest included real-time visibility/tracking of payments (18%) and reporting (14%).</p>
<h3 id=""the-story-so-far"">The story so far</h3>
<p>In practice, though, most of the potential benefits are yet to be realised. “‘Big data’ is certainly a real buzz word,” comments Andrew Marshall, Managing Partner at Covarius. “But treasurers aren’t really aware how it can be utilised and how it can benefit their organisation.”</p>
<p>There is certainly plenty of talk around this topic. “I really think we are just scratching the surface in terms of what could be done with data in the treasury space,” notes Peter Fox, head of Data and Insights for GTS at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We have been involved in hundreds of conversations with treasury team members – this topic tends to come up in strategic reviews with customers and is a very common topic at our advisory boards.”</p>
<p>Where practical applications are concerned, progress is happening, albeit more gradually. “Where progress has been made so far by treasurers is in automating certain processes,” says Magdalena Mielcarz, EMEA Head Channel and Enterprise Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “So I’ve been hearing a lot from the clients about deploying robotic process automation (RPA) into processes. But when we think about big data, what we are talking about is taking this to the next level.</p>


<blockquote>It’s about using artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver insights, predict the future or detect certain future risks.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Magdalena Mielcarz, EMEA Head Channel and Enterprise Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Mielcarz explains this is not just a question of robotising repetitive steps that are already being carried out by a human – “it’s about using artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver insights, predict the future or detect certain future risks”.</p>
<p>“We think the low hanging fruit lies in the area of operational efficiency,” adds Fox. “In our interactions with customers, we have been able to see first-hand the power of sitting down with a broad set of individuals within a client’s organisation, aggregating their data into one dashboard and benchmarking against similar companies. The conversations that can lead to, and the immediate actions that customers are able to take, are frankly astounding.”</p>
<p>The next frontier, Fox adds, will be to look at activities that are characterised by underlying patterns. “So when you think about cash forecasting, understanding the underlying pattern of when you get money and when you pay it out is an area that is very ripe for data analysis. Fraud detection and error recognition are other areas that data analysis is very well suited to solve.”</p>
<h3 id=""practical-applications"">Practical applications</h3>
<p>Where practical applications are concerned, Mielcarz cites the example of Citi Payment Outlier Detection (CPOD), which uses AI to detect transactions that are outliers compared to clients’ historical flows, so that clients can confirm whether or not a transaction is legitimate.</p>
<p>“We also deploy big data analytics into our current processes at Citi,” she says. “For example, we use certain biometric-related features that can indicate suspicious activity.” This could include analysing different users’ typing patterns and judging whether the person currently using a computer is the same person who has been enabled on the system.</p>
<p>In addition, Mielcarz says the bank draws upon big data to generate client relationship insights and thereby help clients optimise their treasury operations. “For example, we can analyse clients’ existing cash management structures with Citi alongside external or public sources,” she says. “This enables us to advise the customer that in the context of Brexit, for example, we would make certain recommendations for an efficient structure in the future, based on the company’s account structure, currencies and flows.”</p>
<p>She explains that these insights could be based on different topics such as accounts structure, liquidity structure, working capital analytics or transaction flow optimisation. Benchmarking can also be deployed to provide further recommendations. “While we can’t include every type of data in light of the current regulatory framework – especially GDPR – we can still provide some benchmarking and peer analytics, comparing certain structures, flows or corridors to those of the customer’s peer group,” she comments.</p>
<h3 id=""too-much-data"">Too much data?</h3>
<p>Embracing the power of big data can bring many benefits, but treasurers also need to understand the risks. Fox notes there is a real risk of spreading a particular team’s focus too thinly across too many objectives. He adds, “There is a lot you can do with data that can be a double-edged sword – so it makes sense to find the problems you really want to focus on and resolve these.”</p>
<p>Treasurers should also consider some other possible pitfalls:</p>

<p>For example, Fox says that while there is a lot of attention on data infrastructure development and the use of data lakes to collect data, this should not come at the expense of focusing on new processes and new data products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Losing sight of the human element.</h5>
<p>In addition, Fox says it can be easy to lose sight of the human element of big data. “In many cases, your new dashboard, product or analysis will change how other people do their jobs,” he says. “So it’s important to recognise that these developments bring changes, and address this via good management processes and excellent storytelling.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Poor quality data.</h5>
<p>Data quality is another consideration. The data that companies use is of little value unless it is complete and accurate – which can be a challenge in some cases. “You have to make every effort to improve the quality of the data you are using in order to get the right outputs in the future,” notes Mielcarz. “That’s a challenge that everybody faces, which can be tackled by identifying the lower quality elements and improving quality over time.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Enrico Camerinelli, Senior Analyst at Aite Group, highlights another possible barrier to adoption: “Ironically, the companies that could benefit the most from this are the ones that may not have the budget needed to afford the necessary investments.”</p>

<h3 id=""plunging-into-data-lakes"">Plunging into data lakes</h3>
<p>One challenge where big data is concerned is for treasurers to be able to access data in a way that is genuinely useful. Data lakes may provide an opportunity to achieve this.</p>
<p>Simply put, a data lake is a repository of raw data which can provide more flexibility than a more traditional data warehouse. Andrew Marshall, Managing Partner at Covarius, observes that the “big data dream” is typically driven by IT, and that it tends to involve creating large, accessible data lakes which treasurers can use to extract data – in contrast to ERP data sources, which are typically locked down.</p>
<p>“This may give the treasurer visibility across historic and future data (such as invoices) running to millions of transactions, which in theory can be used in all manner of ways to provide forecasts and predictive analytics,” comments Marshall. “However, the role of IT usually stops at the data lake/reporting level. This puts serious limitations on the value of the data to the treasurer.”</p>
<p>More recently, Marshall says that bigger players in the TMS space are beginning to invest in bringing data across from the data lake and into their reporting and analytics tools. “This will enable some seriously impressive and powerful output, from which the treasurer can make complex decisions,” he adds.</p>
<p>However, one obstacle around the data lake model is that static models may mean that changes to the underlying data in the ERP system will not flow quickly across the data lake, meaning the treasurer may be using out-of-date information. Such changes could include corrections for inputting errors, updates based on trading performance and changes to credit terms.</p>
<p>“To combat this, TMS vendors are looking to build real-time connectivity – for example, via APIs – between the ERP, data lake and TMS such that changes to underlying data are instantly updated in the TMS, with status codes updated via messaging services to reflect the changes,” explains Marshall. “This gives the treasurer that level of confidence that the data is good to work with and never out of date.”</p>

<h3 id=""where-to-start"">Where to start?</h3>
<p>Given the potential benefits, what should treasurers be doing now to take advantage of big data?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Focus on a specific business problem</h5>
<p>Fox notes the importance of focusing on a specific business problem in the first instance. “Pick out a moderately sized pain point and start to use different data visualisation tools and different data science tools within your own organisation to chip away at that problem,” he suggests. “I think people will be surprised at how quickly you can get momentum if you bring the tools and the people together around the common problem to try and solve it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Translate initiatives into actionable data</h5>
<p>Likewise, treasurers should ensure that any big data initiatives result in actionable data. “For example, a company may always have problems with specific suppliers when they send invoices, resulting in delays in accounts payable,” says Camerinelli. “You can carry out an intelligent analysis to find out which suppliers are the best and worst performance – but then you have to translate this into actionable items that someone else has to follow through on.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Appoint a data champion</h5>
<p>Mielcarz, meanwhile, emphasises the importance of having the right people available to test new opportunities. “At Citi, we have data scientists in our labs – and we also identify data champions across our current teams to ideate and feedback from discussions with clients about what types of insights clients are interested in seeing.”</p>
<p>She recommends that corporate treasurers should likewise appoint data champions within their organisations in order to provide insights from a data perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Engage with partners and the treasury community</h5>
<p>In addition, treasurers can engage with technology and banking partners to discuss the problems they are trying to solve and learn more about the relevant opportunities. There is also much to be gained by engaging with the treasury community and finding out how different groups are currently using data to tackle similar challenges.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""future-developments""></h3>
<h3 id=""future-developments"">Future developments</h3>
<p>Looking forward, it will be important to monitor the impact of the evolving regulatory climate and the expectations regarding privacy and data security. While GDPR is a European regulation, other jurisdictions are beginning to follow a similar approach – California, for example, has adopted a similar law covering data privacy. “We need to be mindful of the fact that we need to keep embedding an infrastructure that makes it easy for us to comply with all those regulations, existing and upcoming,” Mielcarz notes.</p>
<p>Where future opportunities are concerned, another notable area of opportunity is the way in which different data sets can be combined. “From having conversations with clients and studying the industry more broadly, some of the more interesting developments in the data space have come from unique combinations of data sets that are related but distinct,” says Fox. “So that might include GPS data in the logistics space, or weather data in the farming space. It’s one thing to mine your own data, but being able to combine your data with related third-party data could lead to tremendous insights.”</p>
<p>Fox says that marrying bank data with a company’s internal accounts receivable data, for example – and potentially layering in external data – could lead to greater efficiencies and automation within customers’ systems. This could also result in a situation where treasurers increasingly adopt different workflows and ‘manage by exception’.</p>
<p>“In the future, we think that leveraging data could help automate a significant number of repeated activities – freeing up the treasury team to focus on exceptions and contribute more to the broader strategic objectives of the organisation,” he concludes.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Talk of technology and digitisation in treasury is hard to escape. Whilst it is enhancing treasury operations in some leading treasuries, it could be doing so for many more.</p>
<p>For this to happen, sooner rather than later, the talk must turn to action. For Victor Penna, Head of Cash Management, Europe and Americas, Standard Chartered, a good place to start the journey is to build an image of what their treasury will need to look like in five or ten years. Not just building a more efficient and sophisticated treasury but fundamentally to respond to the needs of the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>“If you have a vision of being able to operate treasury around the clock, using real-time information, then certain building blocks will be needed,” he says. “Operating in the cloud becomes essential, treasury technology needs to be upgraded to operate in real-time, software needs to be able to connect via APIs, and thoughts really should be turning to automation and AI.”</p>
<p>With traditional treasury technologies, such as the TMS and ERP, evolving along these lines, forward-looking treasurers should be going on a similar journey, seeking the features and functionality that ease integration, automation and real-time processing.</p>
<p>Treasury will need to create a ‘roadmap’ to complement that vision; it needs to be able to benchmark new technologies against it, questioning each time if it is fit for future purpose.</p>
<h3 id=""business-context"">Business context</h3>
<p>In developing treasury’s digital future, the key is to frame it within the wider context of the enterprise, says Karin Flinspach, Regional Head of Transaction Banking, Europe, Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>The precise nature of the vision and roadmap is dependent on the business model and the degree to which treasury sees itself as an enabler within that model, she says. A consumer-led business, may decide to digitise its sales channels, for example selling directly to consumers online. As a result treasurers then need to decide how treasury evolves to support the rest of the business and its customers.</p>
<p>It should be understood that whilst there are many treasury-specific processes that can be aided by automation – from managing FX trading and cross-currency flows, to handling payment factory processes – there are many more beyond treasury that can also benefit.</p>
<p>The huge growth in B2B e-commerce and its supporting channels and infrastructure, is a case in point. “The reality here is that business is forging ahead of treasury, changing the way it operates with customers and its own supply chains to a more direct model,” notes Penna.</p>
<h3 id=""becoming-an-enabler"">Becoming an enabler</h3>
<p>For treasury to become a true business enabler, it requires a broad understanding of market activities and trends to value add in these discussions. Treasury needs a firm grasp of the evolving operational models and financial support processes deployed by the wider business, such as online instant payments for example, to respond to these scenarios.</p>
<p>“If treasury is trying to help the business change, it means not only re-working its own platforms and processes, but also its skills and capabilities need to change,” says Penna. “It’s now about process re-engineering, understanding different real-time systems and platforms and how they operate, and how these shifts impact core elements such as working capital, payments, funding and liquidity.”</p>
<p>For most treasuries to grasp the possibilities of tools such as APIs, AI and blockchain, it is important to invest in the development of existing staff or bring in new people with different skills sets. The hiring of a software engineer or data scientist within treasury is not unheard of. “You don’t have to commit to a complete change overnight,” says Penna, “you just have to commit to investing in some new capabilities and knowledge, evolving as you go along”.</p>
<h3 id=""experiment-to-progress"">Experiment to progress</h3>
<p>Indeed, where treasury feels it is perhaps too soon to invest in the future state vision now, experimentation is the key, says Penna. “The cost of technology is falling so companies don’t necessarily need to make a huge investment to learn about tools such as robotic process automation, data analytics and visualisation or artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>Experiments can start by applying some of the basic offerings to select treasury processes; there is no need to reconfigure the entire operation. “Just start the journey and keep building those capabilities and skillsets,” he adds.</p>
<p>Consider relatively simple software to manage bank account mandate reviews, for example. By enabling comparison between the latest HR records and the bank account signatory database, such a system can detect leavers, and then generate and send necessary instructions to banks on signatory changes, removing manual effort altogether.</p>
<p>Slightly more involved is the automation of low-value FX deals. This uses a portal enabling different entities to enter their requests which are subsequently automatically aggregated at the treasury level, pushed through to the dealing platform and executed at best price, within the limits or risk tolerances set in the risk management policy.</p>
<h3 id=""wider-vision"">Wider vision</h3>
<p>“The challenge for treasurers is to manage the enormous amount of change which is happening in the market,” notes Flinspach. Payment systems in particular are undergoing a huge revision, with new channels and real-time options a reality for many, notably in the consumer space.</p>
<p>But as payments channels are restructured and businesses begin experimenting with new ways of collecting – through virtual accounts, instant payments, or mobile wallets, for example – treasury thoughts should also be turning to leveraging complementary mechanisms being developed by banks, such as payment gateways.</p>
<p>Of course, the impact on sales of new payments and collections technologies, and concepts such as big data and behavioural analytics, is only half of the story. The same progress imperative exists on the supply chain side, notes Flinspach.</p>
<p>She believes that companies, under the guidance of treasury, should at least be exploring the range of technologies on this side, from bank and third-party trade platforms to front-line supply chain tools such as location-emitting chips capable of tracking goods and automating working capital financing at different points of the supply chain.</p>
<h3 id=""supercharging-treasury"">Supercharging treasury</h3>
<p>Nothing will change without action and, says Penna, “if you do nothing else you must understand what’s going on in the market”. He warns that if the treasurer does not understand the need for progress, “business units will approach banks and technology vendors directly and will structure their own solutions; they can’t wait”.</p>
<p>Within ten years, traditional treasurers won’t necessarily exist; they will need to have a broader skillset, cautions Penna. His notion of the “supercharged treasury”, where backgrounds in technology and consulting are becoming additional requirements, should be taken seriously if the role is to remain relevant.</p>
<p>To help treasurers attain the status of being a value-adding partner to the whole business, ‘The future of the digital treasury’ workshops have been developed by Standard Chartered. If necessary, these can lead to further engagement where the bank – which, like all progressive institutions, is on its own process of digital discovery and development – helps define and build a client’s unique vision. Of course, the treasurer needs to take that first step sometime; now seems like a good time to start.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I never guess. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data,” said Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. It’s hard to argue the validity of this comment. Yet in business, most decision-making happens without the support of data – or at least complete data. In fact, research from PwC shows that two-thirds of companies say their own companies’ decision-making is only somewhat or rarely data-driven. This leaves businesses making important decisions largely on gut feeling and intuition.</p>
<p>This isn’t always a problem. Gut feeling and intuition are the foundation of many successful businesses. Take Apple, for example. Steve Jobs often made decisions without first consulting fact-based data. By luck or judgement, many of his decisions were successful.</p>
<p>It doesn’t always work this way, however. Ignoring the facts can lead to mistakes and less than optimal outcomes. Indeed, there are many examples of businesses failing due to executives disregarding facts.</p>
<p>Either way, failure to use data is costing businesses money. IBM suggests that poor data costs US businesses and government US$3.1trn a year. Meanwhile, Forrester Research says a Fortune 1000 company can achieve US$65m in additional net income with a 10% increase in data accessibility.</p>
<p>It is about more than money, however. In a globalised and competitive marketplace, margin pressure is increasing. One bad decision can have catastrophic costs. So it’s risky to depend on instinct alone.</p>
<p>The good news: today businesses don’t have to rely on instinct. The gradual digitisation of companies and the arrival of new technology is allowing them to use data like never before. By doing so, businesses can arm themselves with the facts and make informed decisions to ensure long-term commercial success.</p>
<h3 id=""agents-of-change"">Agents of change</h3>
<p>While data is impacting all aspects of the organisation, it’s particularly important for the treasury. This is because treasury teams are no longer just a custodian of the company’s cash; they are strategic partners and agents of change. This new role requires treasurers to pinpoint problems across the organisation, quantify the value of solving these, and then use these insights to become a centre of innovation within the organisation.</p>
<p>The only way to do this is by harnessing and analysing data. Peter Cunningham, Consumer &amp; Healthcare Sales Head for EMEA in Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions, says that treasury sits at the heart of all commercial flows within an organisation. “All these flows carry data,” he explains. “And by using this data, treasury can build a unique view of the workings of the enterprise. This puts treasury in a privileged position to innovate and be a catalyst for change.”</p>
<p>Cunningham is not just talking about innovating within the walls of the treasury department. “This data provides insights that impact all areas of the business,” he says. “Armed with these insights, treasury can break down operational silos by helping other departments meet their KPIs. The value this creates for the enterprise is transformational.”</p>
<h3 id=""setting-objectives"">Setting objectives</h3>
<p>Of course, treasury cannot conjure insights from data out of thin air. Collating, structuring, interpreting and analysing the data requires work – and can be difficult, given the volume of data companies create. Indeed, the same amount of data is created every two days as was created from the beginning of time up to 2003. Just knowing where to start on a data-driven initiative can seem an impossible challenge.</p>
<p>So, what should treasurers be doing? Magdalena Mielcarz, Channel &amp; Enterprise Services Head for EMEA, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, says treasurers must first define a set of focused objectives and support a ‘fail fast to innovate faster’ philosophy to assess the real world application of these objectives. “Data isn’t a panacea,” she comments. “It’s a tool which is only effective when used correctly. Also, defining objectives enables treasury to focus on a finite data set. This makes the project less daunting and should enable treasury to deliver value faster.”</p>
<p>In fact, the importance of using data to solve a genuine business problem, and not just for data’s sake, cannot be emphasised enough. Research from NewVantage Partners shows that while most companies are attempting to be ‘data-driven’, only 37% of companies are successful in meeting their goals. The key reason: executives lack clarity around the project’s objectives. When this occurs, a business can become overwhelmed by the data and lose track of its goals.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-and-structuring-data"">Getting and structuring data</h3>
<p>With the objectives defined, treasury must consider how to obtain and structure the data. “All companies will have this data sitting somewhere in the business,” says Cunningham. “The challenge is that often this data is in disparate systems. This makes it challenging for treasury to collate all the data it needs.”</p>
<p>The solution to this is pooling all the data into a single instance of a TMS or ERP. However, Cunningham recognises that this is not an easy exercise, especially in a multinational corporation. It will also only provide half the picture. He therefore suggests that treasurers speak to their banks. “We are custodians of so much data,” says Cunningham. “And it is likely that the data a client needs is within our systems.”</p>
<p>In recognition of this, Cunningham explains that Citi has been working hard to structure its data to make it useful for clients. This work enables the bank to provide insights it couldn’t before. For example, Citi can show a client the dormant or duplicate accounts it has. “This is useful information because these accounts can be closed to save costs and mitigate risk,” he says.</p>
<p>Thanks to its global footprint, Citi can offer insights that couldn’t be found using proprietary data alone. For example, the bank can compare how one client pays a particular supplier vis-à-vis other clients that pay the same supplier. “This helps the client understand how that supplier likes to receive payment and if there are any more cost effective or efficient ways they can be paid,” says Cunningham. “We can use similar data to find out if there are opportunities to extend payment terms or offer supplier financing.”</p>
<p>Citi is also using data to help treasury plan for the future. For example, Cunningham says the bank is working with clients around various Brexit scenarios. “We can show our customers the impact various Brexit scenarios will have on their cash management structure,” he says. “This is invaluable information, especially around something as complex as Brexit.”</p>
<h3 id=""cultural-shift"">Cultural shift</h3>
<p>Becoming a data-driven organisation isn’t only an exercise in technology – it also requires a cultural shift. “Business leaders must promote innovation from the top down,” says Mielcarz. “This empowers individuals to use the insights derived from data to drive change. And businesses cannot be slow in doing this. Those that will be most successful will act nimbly and take advantage of opportunities when they arise.”</p>
<p>Treasury itself must also evolve. Most crucially, it must be able to understand and analyse the data it has. “Data science skills will become increasingly important to the treasury,” says Cunningham. “But it is not enough to understand and analyse the data. For treasury to truly to be at the centre of the organisation, it must use the insights it has to break down silos and promote new ways of working. As a result, soft skills will come to the fore and be crucial in the years to come.”</p>
<h3 id=""value-adding"">Value-adding</h3>
<p>The use of data will also be decisive if treasury is to reach the holy grail of complete straight through processing. And banks like Citi are already building tools that leverage AI and robotics that promote this. “For example, we have built a Payment Outlier Detection Service,” says Mielcarz. “This uses data and AI to analyse the flows through our system. It then compares this to historical client data. If anything doesn’t conform to the routine patterns and behaviours, it triggers a real-time alert. This provides a layer of protection against cyber-fraud. It also removes the need for treasury to eyeball every payment, leaving them to only deal with the exceptions that follow criteria defined by the client.”</p>
<p>These technologies, combined with the emergence of APIs as a new connectivity channel, will change the relationship between banks and corporates. “These technologies will allow us to be more proactive in advising our clients,” says Mielcarz. “For example, when there is news about a client moving into a new market, we can send the treasury team information about that market before they have even asked us for it. This is revolutionary and enhances the value we can provide.”</p>
<h3 id=""data-is-king"">Data is king</h3>
<p>Finally, a caveat. For all the excitement around data, we must remember that data is not infallible. Data will sometimes suggest non-optimal solutions or solutions that may not meet future needs. Only a skilled treasury professional can recognise this.</p>
<p>It is therefore the treasury teams that utilise data to the fullest advantage that will have the real transformational power. “Treasury used to say cash is king,” says Mielcarz. “This is true no more. Cash has abdicated and data is the new king.”</p>

Question Answered: Use of spreadsheets in corporate treasury,"

<em>“Can corporate treasury live without Excel spreadsheets?”

<h5 id=""arkava"">Cale Bennett, Former Group Treasurer of Tatts Group, Cofounder, Arkava:</h5>
<p>At the heart of every treasury operation sits a file system stuffed with spreadsheets, most likely created in Microsoft Excel. A category killer that is equally powerful and versatile, Excel is the go-to application in treasuries for everything from complex financial modelling to issuing payment notices. Yet, despite their benefits, spreadsheet errors have been implicated in several significant financial failings.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Excel’s strengths ensure its weakness. Versatility and power together can be unwieldy and as the complexity increases the probability of being error free falls. Highly skilled practitioners only have one significant spreadsheeting advantage over newcomers: they know there are errors in their spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that many treasury professionals are highly skilled spreadsheeting practitioners. Very few problems are unable to be solved within the confines of those cells and therefore when presented with a problem, firing up Excel is the first thing any treasurer thinks of.</p>
<p>Numerous online applications are springing up to replace Excel and spreadsheets in general, with cloud-based alternatives attacking everything from financial modelling to time tracking and everything in between. Investors are clearly believers in the new offerings with one alternative, Smartsheet.com, having raised over US$100m alone.</p>
<p>However, these applications are only replacing parts of what Excel can do. Admittedly, some are likely better than Excel at their niche (which Excel was probably not intended for anyway). That said, it is impractical to split Excel into its use cases and begin using individual applications as substitutes – particularly for power users such as those typically found in treasuries.</p>
<p>If it is impractical to remove Excel from treasuries globally, what does the future of Excel look like? There are two possible trends that could be anticipated to play a larger role in the next evolution of Excel. They can be summarised as internal and external extensibility – fundamentally extending the functionality of Excel to better account for the use cases being implemented in the up and coming cloud-based Excel substitutes.</p>
<p>Internal extensibility includes third-party add-ins that improve the functionality of Excel. These extensions could be used for improving governance or increasing productivity. Add-ins like Modano, which increases productivity and governance when creating financial models in Excel, is an excellent example of an internal extension of Excel. Modano restricts some of the versatility of Excel but rewards the user with increased productivity and reduced ability for structural errors within their models.</p>
<p>External extensibility fundamentally involves enabling Excel to interact with the internet. As more and more systems move to be cloud-based and the application programming interface (API) ecosystem expands, the ability of systems to talk to each other improves. Whilst dealing with API’s via Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is quite difficult, the integration of languages that more naturally do so, such as Python, is likely to increase. This will enable Excel to sit in the middle of many systems, dragging in and manipulating data in a way that treasury people love so much.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the well-known failings of spreadsheets and the challenge of new systems to the dominance of Excel, it appears very unlikely that treasuries will relinquish their use of spreadsheets.</p>

<p>One-word answer: no.</p>
<p>My reasons do not focus on the wonderful yoga-like flexibility of the spreadsheet and the other many reasons we can find as to why the spreadsheet will live on. However, my reasons are more aimed at the general approach and attitude to technology adoption and the subsequent poor track record defining and maintaining suitable ownership and roadmap strategies.</p>
<h4>What does this imply?</h4>
<p>Treasury has proved to be a rather poor owner of technology and the number of treasuries who have implemented ‘multiple’ TMS is testament to this. The initial investment in a TMS is a significant one across many levels (financial and resource). It is therefore surprising to learn how many treasuries are ‘looking for a new TMS’. In many cases, this can be occurring in timescales as short as the standard five-year contracts that are signed at the outset.</p>
<p>I see this as being down to two key factors.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At go-live, many treasuries think that the ‘job is done’, and the TMS is then left to fight for its own survival with minimal oversight, management and worst of all, maintenance. A loose approach to addressing issues on a timely manner, logging bugs with the relevant vendor and a failure to maintain the system at the highest levels (using vendor consultants) is a sure fire way to ensure that the TMS’s operational effectiveness will begin to deteriorate from the levels achieved at the outset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the causes of this is a lack of a clear roadmap (ie defining upgrade policies), and a lack of an annual budget to invest in ongoing maintenance and also to drive new initiatives that will lead to greater automation/efficiencies (or at least to maintain those levels previously attained).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Why does this impact the humble spreadsheet?</h4>
<p>Failure to invest and maintain a TMS at its optimum level, over time leads to a decrease in efficiency, an increase in system complexity (ie no clear strategy around configuration/standardisation) and leads to decreases in performance and a confusion amongst users as for how best to implement new processes into the TMS. This ultimately leads to user dissatisfaction and the end result of this is that users become quickly disillusioned with the TMS, and this, in turn, leads to users taking processes ‘offline’ (not in the TMS). This invariably means ‘Excel’, as it often becomes the path of least resistance/pain to help deliver a solution. Hence, its assured place in the treasury technology for many years to come!</p>
<p>In summary, I believe Excel will live on in the treasury space as long as treasuries fail to protect their investments fully into the future by designing and adhering to strictly managed technology roadmap strategies and ensuring sufficient budget is available to maintain/improve the system every year. Failure to do so leaves the door open for users taking process and tasks ‘offline’. I do not believe that a lack of functionality (at least in the leading TMS for 99% of business reasons) is a genuine reason for using Excel in this current age of the TMS.</p>

<h5 id=""kyriba"">Bob Stark, VP of Strategy, Kyriba:</h5>
<p>Spreadsheets have been popular in corporate finance and treasury because they are simple – and they are right in front of you without having to purchase additional software. Unfortunately, spreadsheets are also incredibly inefficient and create risk for the organisation.</p>
<h4>
Accuracy</h4>
<p>Ninety-five percent of spreadsheets contain errors because people make mistakes with formulas, rekeying numbers or copying/pasting data. There are far too many stories of critical financial decisions made on the back of incorrect data, costing organisations millions of dollars. When dealing with an organisation’s cash and payments, treasury cannot afford such mistakes.</p>
<h4>Productivity</h4>
<p>Treasury teams require automation for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To eliminate time spent on manual tasks so they can focus on analysis and strategic decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To minimise the errors that arise with rekeying and copy/pasting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While productivity itself does not deliver a compelling ROI, treasury, having time to pursue advanced financial projects, delivers measurable value to the bottom line.</p>
<h4>Audit and controls</h4>
<p>The biggest complaint about spreadsheets is the lack of security and accountability. Spreadsheets have no audit trails, no separation of duties and offer no capability to manage a workflow. With reported fraud attempts continuing to reach all-time highs, it is imperative that treasury aligns with the audit and control requirements that the rest of the organisation adheres to.</p>
<p>Treasury must embrace best practices such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Login requiring more than user ID and password.</h5>
<p>Ideally, login should require two-factor authentication and/or single sign-on to the organisation’s internal IT environment. Spreadsheets do not offer this protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Online access by multiple authenticated users with a complete separation of duties.</h5>
<p>No single person should be able to initiate and approve transactions and there should be structured rules defining how data can be modified. Spreadsheets do not offer such a workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Encryption of treasury data.</h5>
<p>Unauthorised users should not be able to open up a spreadsheet or data file and view sensitive treasury information. Spreadsheets do not offer data encryption at rest, relying upon insufficient access or password protections instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data management</h4>
<p>Spreadsheets are designed for minimal amounts of data, while at the same time treasury continues to require bigger and bigger data sets. A simple treasury requirement such as cash forecasting requires extrapolation of historical data as well as detailed forecast variance analysis.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are not designed to make thousands of calculations per second or store millions of records, meaning that file sizes balloon and processing time will range from minutes to hours. Spreadsheets are no longer scalable, meaning that multiple spreadsheets or additional databases are required, adding further complications and risk for treasury teams.</p>
<p>Given that the treasurer’s role is to reduce risk for the organisation’s cash and liquidity, creating new risks by exposing treasury operations to the weaknesses of spreadsheets is no longer acceptable to management or external stakeholders. Spreadsheets are simply an inferior way to manage treasury operations.</p>

<p><em>If you feel your bank fees are not what they should be, how can you get a better deal?</em></p>
<p> Everyone likes to think they are getting a good deal. But when it comes to bank fees, how easy is it for treasurers to know if what they are paying is the best possible price? And what exactly is the best price, because in corporate banking it all depends on the relationship?</p>
<p>How banks price cash management services is often not based on the strength of the treasurer’s negotiation, or even how well they know the bank, but on how hungry their bank is for the client’s business, says Bridget Meyer, Senior Director at Redbridge Analytics.</p>
<p>It is hardly a secret too that in this Basel III world, where certain deposits cost more to take than they yield, some clients are just not worth having. Furthermore, where some banks focus on certain sectors or industries, it will be to the exclusion of others.</p>
<p>There may even be a fee impact at a personal level. In some cases, if a bank relationship manager (RM) has not yet met their sales target for the year, they will be looking to extract maximum value from new business. But RMs may be targeted on the total wallet they bring in from each client, or on the amount of new product they sell and this too will affect their appetite for negotiation.</p>
<h3 id=""consider-all-angles"">Consider all angles</h3>
<p>For a treasurer seeking to negotiate bank fees, all this points to a number of ‘behind-the-scenes’ variables potentially impacting the outcome. For this reason, it is essential for the treasurer to try to understand the bank’s perspective.</p>
<p>It helps knowing what “levers” to push and when, says Meyer. Typically, this is a skill that comes either from extensive experience or from inside knowledge; having a former banker on the team, for example, should provide valuable insight into how certain banks operate in this respect.</p>
<p>If this sounds rather too much like a lottery then she believes that “those who get the best prices are often those who ask and who are persistent”. And when an RM offers a discount, the degree of latitude they often have on price is such that taking the first offer is perhaps rash; push a little harder and the true extent of that latitude may be revealed.</p>
<p>Always remember that there is a partnership at stake here warns Meyer. “It’s not just about taking from the bank. Treasurers need to be able to figure out what ‘carrots’ they can offer in return for a price reduction,” she says.</p>
<p>Before going into negotiation, consider what ancillary business you might be able to offer them. If, for example, there is another bank relationship treasury is not happy with, or a bank where there is very little in the way of committed business, perhaps this business could be offered as a means to raising the total wallet share.</p>
<p>If the bank with whom treasury is negotiating is proffering new services or products, whilst full treasury commitment may not yet be possible, listening with an open mind to these new solutions may help ease the negotiation. “At least hear them out,” advises Meyer.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">What are you paying for? A banker’s perspective</h2>
<p>“The fees that banks charge ought to be in direct proportion to the value they bring to the client,” says Paul Taylor, Global Head of Corporate Sales, GTS and Head of Sales for GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>It’s clear that the value a bank can bring to corporate clients has evolved over time. It used to be a very physical business, he says, with the transportation, clearing and settlement of funds being performed as part of a banking community which was not accessible to the client. Banking was a very distinct function and it was clear what was being paid for.</p>
<p>Today, far more of what a bank does is about data. This is data drawn from many sources including the client, obtained as per the usual transaction banking agreement. The ability of the bank to add value to the company through the use of that data is a vital part of today’s offering.</p>
<p>Because data has its own measurable value, its safekeeping and carriage has become a number one priority for banks today, with cyber-security a major necessity for all companies, says Taylor. “We invest very heavily in cyber-security and the integrity of our systems.”</p>
<p>In practical terms too, banks today manage data, producing more meaningful reporting for clients. This reporting allows clients to make more informed judgements about managing their cash. These are judgements which require banks to take actions which the companies typically cannot take themselves.</p>
<p>In terms of the innovation necessary to keep adding value, few companies want to be a first adopter in a world of proliferating solutions. This is simply because there is no certainty around which will become the de facto solutions, says Taylor. Banks have therefore become “an important litmus test” for new technologies, some of which pass into common usage, many of which do not.</p>
<p>The role of the bank has a value, from the expectation of the safe carriage of data, right through to the investment in and testing of new technologies to solve new problems. These are activities that no company could or should do on its own, says Taylor. “In that sense, banks today verge on being community providers.”</p>
<p>Are the fees in direct proportion to the value these services bring to the client? Try living without them for a while.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""commitment"">Commitment</h3>
<p>Striking a deal is one thing but sustaining the relationship is 
important too. “The number one requirement is to get the bank to 
demonstrate commitment,” notes Meyer.</p>
<p>Offering a short-term contract of say 12 months’ duration may seem 
ideal in that the bank has the perfect opportunity for early price 
rises. But commitment is a two-way process and the longer the 
arrangement, the stronger the bond between parties.</p>
<p>In taking the longer-term view, the bank knows its client is less 
likely to run an RFP in that period. This saves time and money and 
guarantees revenue for the bank for that period, she explains. “Banks 
would also rather take on a longer commitment so clients don’t bother 
them every year for a price reduction.”</p>
<p>Out of common decency, the commitment period offered by the bank 
should be respected by the corporate who should not go out to RFP until 
the agreement is coming to an end. However, it is not unheard of for 
banks to insert terms and conditions in their pricing proposals that 
allow fee increases on a sliding scale if volumes of business fail to 
hit a certain level, so the level of commitment is managed by the bank.</p>
<h3 id=""keep-watching"">Keep watching</h3>
<p>Perhaps it sounds too much like the balance of power is stacked in 
favour of the banks. This is not necessarily the case, says Meyer, but 
for the treasurer, to keep the banks sharp, “it is important to let them
 know that you are watching them,” she advises.</p>
<p>Bank fees can appear to rise inexplicably, even for large companies 
that are sharing a sizeable portion of their wallet, so it is clearly 
incumbent upon treasurers to keep their eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Treasurers should periodically benchmark their fees against the wider
 market using an RFP (bearing in mind the commitment to the partnership 
referred to earlier). The process has the advantage of testing the 
appetite for the treasurer’s specific business in a competitive 
environment.</p>
<p>By discussing results with the RMs, it sends the message that the 
client is very much aware of and tracking its bank fees. “The more 
treasurers pay attention and let their banks know that they are 
watching, the more the banks will know to keep their pricing in check,” 
says Meyer.</p>
<p>Failure to benchmark at all is a mistake. It can lead to corporates 
keeping certain banks on their panel purely out of habit. Inertia is 
never a good thing in business. Similarly, although the attitude that 
‘if it’s not broken don’t fix it’ is common, it suggests to Meyer that 
“some companies don’t want to know if its broken”.</p>
<p>This is a curious notion but she explains that there can also 
sometimes be “an apprehension of rocking the boat”. This fear is 
misplaced. “No bank ever pulled out of a partnership because the client 
asked for a discount on cash management.”</p>
<p>When it comes to broaching the subject of fees, let no more than five
 years elapse before going through an RFP, says Meyer. Requesting a 
discussion on fees with the current providers every two or three years 
is “not unreasonable”. Of course, some public bodies (such as 
municipalities) may even be obliged by law to run regular RFPs.</p>
<h3 id=""review-time"">Review time</h3>
<p>If an organisation is monitoring and paying attention to results, the
 treasurer will know when the right time comes to have that 
conversation. However, so many corporates don’t do anything, notes 
Meyer. If a treasurer waits for the banks to comes in to do their 
quarterly reviews, it invites a glossy and somewhat passively received 
explanation of what the bank is doing for the corporate, with maybe a 
few service issues raised on the side.</p>
<p>But these reviews are an ideal opportunity for the treasurer to 
really find out where the relationship is going and improve their 
treasury services. Do some homework before the review, advises Meyer. 
Perform an account and service rationalisation and come to these 
meetings with questions based on your analysis. Why do we have this 
service on this account and not the others? Timing discussions and 
negotiations with one of those meetings makes it a “relationship review 
on steroids”, she says and produces real results.</p>
<p>There is no point negotiating on superfluous services; if paper 
billing is going to be dropped soon don’t bother getting a reduction on 
it.</p>
<p>Send the findings to the bank, asking it to come prepared with a 
response at the next quarterly. The bank should be given enough notice 
to prepare and not feel like it is being pressured; this should be seen 
as a friendly reminder that treasury is taking fees seriously.</p>
<p>With RMs servicing many clients, “it’s the squeaky wheel that gets 
the grease”, says Meyer. If the corporate and bank have been on 
autopilot for a number of years, a sudden focus on fees may reveal areas
 where they have risen beyond acceptable levels. The relationship may be
 quite satisfactory in all other respects but if the treasurer knows 
they are paying above market rates, the bank now has the opportunity to 
address the issues and create a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id=""legal-bind"">Legal bind</h3>
<p>This is not just a tale of prices incrementally increasing over time 
because they were not kept in check. There are cultural differences that
 can influence pricing changes too. In the US, fraud protection services
 are lucrative because businesses are scared of doing the wrong thing; 
few will ever turn these off. However, banks in Europe know they cannot 
charge directly because corporates have always seen banks as duty-bound 
to protect their clients’ interests.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence further suggests that banks can and do amend their
 menu of chargeable items, and they are entitled to do so. Some banks 
may even use the complexity of their contracts to impose a range of 
price increases more or less at will.</p>
<p>These contracts are subject to negotiation, and treasurers have been 
known to challenge and win. But the process is far from easy because 
banks have vastly experienced legal teams; they have to because they are
 undertaking huge liabilities and risks.</p>
<p>A large corporate may have the legal resources to return red-lined 
copies of such documents and enter into negotiation. Even in such 
organisations the legal expertise will not be in banking per se. 
However, many more businesses do not have the capacity to do this and 
will have to accept the contract as is.</p>
<p>Although a smaller banking institution may be more compliant if it 
wants the business, the likelihood of getting a large bank to sign a 
service level agreement is minimal. For the treasurer, an appendix of 
agreed pricing may be about the extent of acceptable amendments in many 
cases.</p>
<h3 id=""true-partnership"">True partnership</h3>
<p>When seeking to negotiate, it requires more than just a database of 
industry best prices to make headway. These figures cannot possibly take
 into account the full and unique client relationship, which often 
encompasses a broad suite of products and services across multiple 
regions.</p>
<p>In any case, attempting to browbeat the bank with a list of the 
lowest rates on every product and service is likely to prove 
unsuccessful in negotiation. On the other hand, the ability to think 
from the bank’s perspective about the depth and desirability of the 
relationship, and from here set a reasonable pricing target on only the 
services needed, will be more fruitful.</p>
<p>The treasurer should only use those lowest prices as the starting 
point, considering each, line by line, only in the context of the entire
 package. Obviously, the target prices should not be revealed to the 
bank as sometimes the final offer can improve on these.</p>
<p>Allowing the bank time to think about the deal and come back with 
what it considers to be a better price is therefore a much healthier 
approach. It gives the bank the fairest opportunity to demonstrate what 
it believes is the true worth of the unique relationship it has with the
 client. If the offer has not met expectations, the client should review
 it as a good first try, using this as the starting point for the next 
round of negotiations.</p>
<p>Whether engaging in an RFP or bilateral negotiation, being forearmed 
with the information, taking a big picture view that encompasses a 
degree of flexibility and, importantly, being able to understand the 
bankers’ perspective, will give the treasurer the tools needed to seek 
and achieve rates that serve both parties well.</p>
<p>Treasurers who are prepared to ask their banks to revisit fees can 
save between 20% and 30% on pricing alone, says Meyer. Whilst no one 
benefits from driving too hard a deal, she believes many more in the 
profession should be thinking about “getting their best game face on”.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Get back to basics with the pros and cons of cash pooling in all its forms.</em></p>
<p> According to the ECB, pooling cash within a group represents a “significant opportunity to ensure that the use of internal funds is maximised and the cost of capital is minimised”. It is perhaps unsurprising then that cash pooling increased in popularity in certain locations following the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, the source of this quote – the ECB’s July 2016 Statistics Paper – noted that increased adoption was driven by limited access to capital markets, reduced bank lending, low returns and higher risks on banks’ deposits with corporates intent on maximising their use of internal sources of financing.</p>
<h3 id=""the-basics"">The basics</h3>
<p>Cash pooling is an essential liquidity management technique. It brings together a number of individual bank accounts to pool balances, optimise interest and improve an organisation’s liquidity management. This could be across multiple jurisdictions, currencies and entities, depending on the type of cash pool in place.</p>
<p>Cash pooling falls into two main types: physical and notional.</p>
<h4 id=""physical-pooling"">Physical pooling</h4>
<p>This is often referred to as physical cash concentration, target or zero balancing (ZBA) or sweeping. Balances are physically swept to a header or master account on a periodic basis and may have certain parameters, for example a minimum or maximum balance, a percentage sweep, target balance and a variety of other parameters depending on the provider capabilities. Physical pooling is available on a domestic, cross-border, cross-region and multi-bank basis and is also dependent on the provider capabilities.</p>
<p>The acceptance of pooling structures is not clear cut in every jurisdiction. Because direct inter-company lending in China, for example, is not permitted, physical cash pooling cannot be practiced using the traditional techniques, since this sort of arrangement generates inter-company loans. In order to achieve physical cash concentration, an entrusted loan structure must be used.</p>
<h4 id=""notional-pooling"">Notional pooling</h4>
<p>This is primarily a tool for interest enhancement. Notional pooling structures are typically overlay structures. Debit and credit balances on a series of accounts owned by the same or different entities and domiciled in the same country are notionally netted for interest calculation purposes, without a physical movement of cash. Multicurrency notional pooling offers the ability to achieve a net notional position in a single currency without the need to perform traditional FX or swaps, and extends the benefit of further interest savings as a result of compensating balances in different currencies.</p>
<p>Additionally, an overlay cash pool can be provided by an international bank offering physical or notional pooling on a multinational, multi-entity company level in country, in region or globally. Overlay cash pools allow changes to existing bank relationships when necessary without disrupting the operation of the cash pool and allow changes to the cash pool to take place without disrupting the underlying banking structure.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-impact"">Regulatory impact</h3>
<p>Under Basel III the cost structures of notional pooling solutions have come into question where some banks have increased their pricing for operating deposits to help meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements.</p>
<p>Corporate global or regional liquidity and funding structures such as notional pooling may be impacted by the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan in the countries where such structures operate.</p>
<p>Where International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS 32) apply, bank account balances are seen as financial instruments that must be disclosed and presented individually. However, US GAAP allows banks to net the balance sheet.</p>
<h3 id=""digging-deeper-physical-pooling-cash-concentration"">Digging deeper: physical pooling/cash concentration</h3>
<h4 id=""main-benefits-1"">Main benefits</h4>
<h5>Control funds centrally</h5>
<p>The concentration of all of a company’s surplus cash into one account, generally managed by the group treasury, will improve its control over cash. If the net balance of the cash pool is positive, this aggregated balance can be used to invest in overnight or short-term deposits, such as money funds. Indeed, companies with large treasuries often have dedicated staff managing these investments.</p>
<p>The establishment of a physical cash pool enables treasuries to exercise greater control over cash flows. Ideally, all subsidiaries should participate in the cash pool, as this provides the centre with more information about the daily cash flows that exist throughout the company.</p>
<h5>Reduce credit facility requirements</h5>
<p>Establishing a physical cash pool means that the treasurer need only negotiate one credit limit for the entire group. This avoids the need for separate credit arrangements to be set up for each subsidiary participating in the cash pool.</p>
<p>The treasury has a high level of visibility over the balances of subsidiaries’ accounts in this type of arrangement and can thus control the disbursement of cash. A subsidiary experiencing cash shortfalls can be funded from the master account at a cheaper rate than could be arranged locally. The treasury should be able to reduce borrowing costs significantly by using the balance aggregation to arrange inter-company funding.</p>
<h4 id=""disadvantages-1"">Disadvantages</h4>
<h5>Inter-company loans created</h5>
<p>The physical movement of cash between accounts creates a series of inter-company loans between the master and participant accounts.</p>
<p>This can have complex implications, particularly with regard to:</p>
<h5>Withholding tax</h5>
<p>In some countries, withholding tax may be levied on inter-company loan interest. This is because tax authorities regard the payment of interest on inter-company loans as an inter-company payment rather than as a bank payment.</p>
<h5>Thin capitalisation</h5>
<p>In some countries thin capitalisation rules apply – these restrict the level of financing a subsidiary can receive from its parent/major shareholder. Companies are often able to offset the cost of such loans by deducting the interest charged as an expense for income tax purposes. In order to prevent abuse of this advantage, many countries have introduced thin capitalisation rules.</p>
<p>The ratio of debt to equity a company is allowed before it is classed as being thinly capitalised varies considerably from country to country. Thin capitalisation levels need to be closely observed when running a physical cash pool to ensure that the redistribution of funds from the header account amongst the subsidiary accounts does not breach these rules. This is of particular concern when cross-border cash pooling is implemented.</p>
<h5>Legal issues</h5>
<p>The transfer of monies between a company’s subsidiaries creates legal issues due to the co-mingling of funds. Care must therefore be taken with the structuring of inter-company loans to ensure that they are legal. Often separate credit agreements will need to be put in place for each loan.</p>
<h5>Higher banking costs</h5>
<p>The physical transfer of cash between accounts will incur high banking costs, particularly if a large number of movements takes place and/or cross-border transfers are involved.</p>
<h5>Cash flow forecasting</h5>
<p>The master account will fund any cash shortfalls and invest in surpluses on a daily basis. Some degree of cash flow forecasting will therefore be required to manage these positions effectively.</p>
<h5>Concentrated banking arrangements</h5>
<p>Most cash pooling arrangements require that all participant accounts are held with the same bank. This may cause problems for companies with operations in many countries – a bank which is strong in one country may offer a more limited service, or indeed no service, in another.</p>
<h4 id=""variations-on-the-theme"">Variations on the theme</h4>
<h5>Zero balancing</h5>
<p>Cash movements into and out of the header account are structured so that all subsidiary accounts are left with a balance of zero. Typically, zero balancing cash pools operate on an intraday basis, with sweeps occurring daily (usually at the end of the working day). The net balance in the header account is therefore available for overnight investment.</p>
<h5>Target balancing</h5>
<p>In this arrangement, cash sweeps are arranged so that accounts in the pool are left with a pre-determined target balance after the sweep. Different target balances can be set for the constituent accounts in the pool. In fact, it is often possible for the treasurer to set negative target balances (ie an overdraft facility) on some of the participant accounts.</p>
<h5>Interest reallocation</h5>
<p>Some banks allow the interest payable to the cash pool to be redistributed between the participant accounts. The bank calculates the interest payable after balances have been swept from the participant accounts to the header account. Central treasury can, if the net balance of the cash pool is positive, benefit from a ‘turn’ (the difference between the credit and debit rates) which may be shared with the operating subsidiaries.</p>
<h5>Mirror accounts</h5>
<p>Some banks offer a service whereby mirror accounts can be set up for the participating accounts in a cash pool. Sweeps on the participant accounts would be booked through the mirror accounts, leaving the operating accounts to function as if they were not part of the cash pool. Each participant account and its mirror account will net to zero after the sweep has been performed. This arrangement can help operating subsidiaries to reconcile their account balances and track the inter-company loans created by the cash concentration.</p>
<h3 id=""digging-deeper-notional-pooling"">Digging deeper: notional pooling</h3>
<h4 id=""main-benefits-2"">Main benefits</h4>
<h5>Subsidiaries maintain autonomy</h5>
<p>As no physical concentration of cash occurs, subsidiaries participating in a notional pooling arrangement maintain autonomy over their bank accounts and retain their cash balances. The group however achieves similar economic benefits as it would with a physical cash pool.</p>
<h5>Less administration</h5>
<p>As balances remain with each legal entity (ie no inter-company loans are created), notional pooling requires far less administration than physical pooling.</p>
<h5>Lower banking costs</h5>
<p>Notional pooling incurs lower fees than physical pooling as the bank operating the pool is not required to transfer cash between accounts.</p>
<h4 id=""disadvantages-2"">Disadvantages</h4>
<h5>Balance sheet enlargement</h5>
<p>The balance sheet of both the bank and the company involved in a notional pool can become unnecessarily large. This is because there are no physical cash transfers occurring between the various accounts in the cash pool.</p>
<p>Specifically, a bank offering notional pooling services may find that it is unable to offset fully the debit and credit balances appearing on its balance sheet. This will affect the way in which the bank allocates capital, which will in turn affect the interest compensation paid to the pool. This can become a very important issue as banks have to allocate capital to all their lending. If the gross overdrafts on the participant accounts have to be carried on the banks’ balance sheet, there will be a charge to reflect this, which may or may not be made explicitly. This will partially offset the gains that are made.</p>
<h5>Legal issues</h5>
<p>In some countries notional pooling is prohibited. Additionally, the way in which net interest is calculated may vary from country to country.</p>
<h5>Credit facility requirements</h5>
<p>Separate overdraft facilities and credit agreements will need to be negotiated for each account participating in the cash pool. This can make managing liquidity across a company more complex.</p>
<h4 id=""main-variations"">Main variations</h4>
<h5>Interest optimisation</h5>
<p>This is a limited form of notional pooling whereby a bank offers a company preferential credit and debit rates (ie it returns to the company some of the ‘turn’ it would normally benefit from). This service is usually offered in jurisdictions where full notional pooling is not permitted.</p>
<h5>Margin pooling</h5>
<p>This arrangement is a variant of interest optimisation. In a margin pooling arrangement, a bank pays the company the benefit accrued by applying interest optimisation as a separate fee. The service allows for a bonus determined by the ratio between the debit balances and credit balances of the participating accounts. In effect, this operates as a sort of ‘loyalty scheme’ – the greater the offset between accounts, the larger the benefit paid to the company.</p>
<h3 id=""other-pooling-arrangements"">Other pooling arrangements</h3>
<h4 id=""single-legal-account-pooling"">Single legal account pooling</h4>
<p>A form of cash concentration, in this arrangement a company maintains only a master account with a bank. This master account – which is generally managed by the group treasury – contains all the company’s cash and is effectively an in-house bank.</p>
<p>The bank maintains sub accounts for all the entities participating in the cash pool. These accounts are used by the group’s operating subsidiaries as if they were not part of a cash pool (so they control their own balances). However, all transactions on the sub accounts are booked to the master account. The master account is thus a summary account for all activity occurring in the sub accounts. The bank calculates interest on the master account balance, although this can often be allocated to sub accounts.</p>
<p>Single legal account pooling is not especially widespread, being mainly offered by the Nordic (and some UK) banks.</p>
<h4 id=""reference-account-structures"">Reference account structures</h4>
<p>Reference account structures are a method of including the accounts of subsidiaries which are not officially a part of the cash pool in a pooling arrangement. Subsidiaries may be unable (eg for legal restrictions in place in their home country) or unwilling to participate in a cash pool. In this arrangement, each subsidiary has – in addition to its normal domestic operating account – a reference account in the central pooling location. Balances on the local operating accounts are manually or automatically transferred to the subsidiary’s reference account in the central pooling location. These balances will then be notionally pooled, allowing for the full offset of debit and credit balances.</p>
<h4 id=""overlay-cash-pool"">Overlay cash pool</h4>
<p>An overlay cash pool isn’t necessarily distinct from a notional, conventional target or ZBA cash pool, but could contain components of all three. It is a cash management service that facilitates the aggregation of liquidity from a series of multiple underlying banks or accounts into a single bank or banking structure. This could be within a single bank, but typically an overlay structure refers to a multi-bank structure.</p>
<p>Where balances are held at two different banks, the cash has to physically move from the local bank to the overlay bank. This can be done by the corporate instructing its local bank to push the funds to the overlay bank – where every day at a particular time the bank pushes excess cash into the overlay bank account structure. The alternative is for the overlay bank to pull the cash from the local bank at a predefined time and within certain parameters.</p>
<h3 id=""a-virtual-alternative"">A virtual alternative</h3>
<p>Given the potential for regulatory issues around the structure, an alternative to notional pooling is provided by virtual accounts. These have already been deployed for the streamlining of collections. By opening virtual accounts for each entity within a group and appending sub-level virtual accounts to these, clients of those entities can effectively remit to a central account (whether national, regional or global) using their own unique virtual account identifier. Like notional cash pooling, virtual accounts could enable corporates to allocate cash without segregating it physically.</p>
<p>By integrating virtual bank accounts with administrative sub-accounts called virtual ledger accounts (which populate a multi-bank cash management dashboard), a new type of liquidity management tool is created, allowing full cash concentration and visibility right across the group.</p>

<p>The treasury team at Nordson were acutely aware that much of the data it required to achieve its objectives of being a professional, innovative and core partner to the business sat within their ERP system. The frustration, however, came from the fact that much of this data could not be used because it was either inaccessible or of poor quality. As a result, Nordson was obliged to work with an incomplete data-set, and forced to manually carry out many tasks that it knew could be automated. This was time-consuming and created unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>A series of events sparked by the global financial crisis forced Nordson to reconsider how treasury uses technology. “The objective was to streamline our financial processes by creating a system-driven workflow to allow us to better support business and inform management decisions,” says Alexander Schulze, Cash Manager Europe at Nordson. “Given that we are present in nearly 40 countries around the world, it was vital that we had a single global solution that was embedded into our ERP system to drive consistency in the data. We were also keen to ensure that the new system worked as a platform that we can easily update when our business requirements changed.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-full-package"">The full package</h3>
<p>To achieve this, Nordson partnered with Hanse Orga Group, leveraging the vendor’s FinanceSuite (FS) for SAP. “We analysed multiple providers in the market and found that Hanse Orga Group’s solutions most closely matched our requirements,” says Schulze. “We quickly got to work, rolling out three solutions that today make up the core treasury technology infrastructure.”</p>
<h4 id=""fs-autobank"">FS AutoBank</h4>
<p>Following an extensive master-data clean-up and streamlining of many of its processes, Nordson rolled out the FS AutoBank solution for all of its entities in Europe in 2013. The solution gives treasury full visibility over its cash flows by reconciling all bank balances once statements are imported into SAP. With the high automation rate of FS AutoBank (increased from 45% to 85%) Nordson improved the accuracy of the overall process and reduced the manual effort and risk of human error which blighted Nordson in the past.</p>
<p>The improved posting quality and the shortened process cycle time (reduced by 50%) are the optimal bases to provide best data for all relevant cash management and treasury activities.</p>
<h4 id=""fs-payment-management"">FS Payment Management</h4>
<p>Immediately after the rollout of FS AutoBank, Nordson turned its attention to Hanse Orga Group’s FS Payment Management module. The solution enables the company to be SEPA compliant. Nordson was also able to centralise all its payment authorisations in one single platform, fully embedded into SAP. “Today we have six signatories and three people running all of our payments, down from over 100 previously,” says Schulze.</p>
<h4 id=""fs-cash-and-liquidity"">FS Cash &amp; Liquidity</h4>
<p>With precise data now coming from FS AutoBank and FS Payment Management, Nordson could roll out the third solution: FS Cash &amp; Liquidity. This centralises and consolidates cash, liquidity and treasury management functions in one tool. “We get instant cash information for all European operations via SAP, AutoBank and Payment Management,” says Schulze. “This has given treasury a unique view of the SAP environment allowing us to provide sufficient liquidity to the business when and wherever it is required.”</p>
<h3 id=""pushing-ahead"">Pushing ahead</h3>
<p>The use of these solutions has delivered a host of benefits to the Nordson treasury that have enabled it to become more automated, efficient and effective as a strategic partner to the business. Schulze highlights that they are not resting on their laurels, however, and are keen to continue pushing the boundaries of technology. “The next step is to move from FS to the next generation FS2,” he concludes. “We are also considering additional Hanse Orga Group tools that could add value, like FS2 Analytics, which provides comprehensive business intelligence and a central overview of key performance indicators. Moreover, we will look at their new tools for credit management, disputes and collections.”</p>

<p><em>Treasurers use a wide range of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure key areas of treasury, from capital structure to risk management. But a company’s needs can evolve over time – so it’s important to review those metrics on a regular basis and make sure they continue to support the overall business strategy.</em></p>
<p> You can’t manage what you don’t measure, as the old management adage goes. And in the world of corporate treasury there is much to measure. Indeed, research published in 2016 by KPMG found that almost two thirds (63%) of treasurers use a set of KPIs to measure the performance of their various treasury activities.</p>
<p>But while treasurers commonly use metrics and KPIs to assess the performance of treasury, there are different ways of approaching this task. Not all metrics will be applicable to every treasury – so it’s important to make sure that the measures looked at are the ones that are most relevant to the company and its strategic direction. Likewise, treasurers will sometimes need to review the metrics used to make sure they continue to reflect the company’s evolving strategy.</p>
<h3 id=""why-do-kpis-matter"">Why do KPIs matter?</h3>
<p>Within the context of treasury, metrics can be used to measure outcomes in a variety of structures and activities, from capital structure to risk management. David Blair, an independent treasury consultant based in Singapore, says that the chosen metrics should support the treasury’s overall goal, which he defines as cost effective risk reduction (CERR), within the parameters defined by the board of directors. He points out that while costs can be measured easily, the definition of what is cost effective will vary from company to company – as will the acceptable level of risk.</p>
<p>When using KPIs and metrics, it’s important to have a clear view of what the treasury is trying to achieve. “KPIs are there to assess how well the treasury function is performing and how it could improve on that operation,” explains Karlien Porre, Partner, Global Treasury Advisory Services at Deloitte. “There are three topics here. There are the processes involved in developing the strategy – ‘what should we be doing?’ Then there’s the execution of the strategy – ‘are we doing it right?’ And thirdly there are the tools and enablers required to do the execution.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Porre identifies several different benefits that KPIs can bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Controls.</h5>
<p>Testing the quality of controls within the treasury function and assessing how well these controls are applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Process efficiency.</h5>
<p>Measuring how efficient processes are and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Risk management.</h5>
<p>Evaluating the effectiveness of the treasury’s risk mitigation strategies and techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Value.</h5>
<p>Demonstrating the value of the treasury function to the organisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 id=""choosing-the-right-kpis"">Choosing the right KPIs</h3>
<p>Not all companies are alike, and the KPIs used by treasuries will vary depending on the nature of the business. Respondents to the KPMG survey identified the most important KPI as visibility over cash (88%), followed by counterparty limit usage (63%) and forecast errors (50%). Other KPIs included portfolio value at risk (38%), cost of funds above benchmark (38%) and cash swept into in-house bank (38%).</p>
<p>Porre points out that some KPIs are industry specific. “In the energy and resources sector, companies may have lots of derivatives and potentially big swings in margin calls on derivatives,” she says. “In these organisations there are short-term daily liquidity targets, and KPIs against these will be very critical – whereas in other organisations those KPIs will be less relevant.”</p>
<p>Also key is the company’s current strategy in areas such as financing. Porre says that a company which is highly leveraged will typically have a far greater focus on metrics related to leverage and gearing, and a heavier focus on cash flow forecasts than businesses which are less highly leveraged. Even within the same company, the KPIs used by treasury can evolve over time, reflecting changes in the business model, company strategy and treasury priorities.</p>
<p>At Hilton, for example, the company’s strategic priorities have shifted somewhat in recent history. For several years, the treasury’s primary focus was on deleveraging, with the company moving from a highly leveraged to a more moderately leveraged organisation. But following the company’s IPO in 2013 – which raised over US$2.3bn – and the more recent spin-offs of its real estate and timeshare businesses, Hilton has achieved a more capital-light business model. As a result, Fred Schacknies, SVP &amp; Treasurer, says there is a greater focus on returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.</p>
<p>This shift has had an impact on the treasury’s KPIs. “Looking back, leverage was the number one financial metric we were looking at,” Schacknies explains. “But going forward, while we’re still very mindful of our leverage – and have identified a target of 3-3.5X – our metrics have shifted to incorporate more free cash flow and the visibility needed to meet these targets.”</p>
<h3 id=""kpis-vs-management-metrics"">KPIs vs management metrics</h3>
<p>These are not the only metrics that Hilton focuses on. Schacknies notes that like many treasuries, Hilton also measures operational activities such as forecast accuracy, the number of bank accounts, yield on cash and FX risk. “These are all things we do on a daily basis, and they are all very important in making sure we can do our most important job, which is delivering cash flow,” he says. “But to me, it’s important to make the distinction that these are all operational metrics. I wouldn’t go so far as to call them key performance indicators, because at the end of the day the board is less concerned with the efficiency of your bank account structure than with the company’s ability to achieve key financial priorities, such as buying back shares.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Schacknies emphasises that KPIs should not simply be about 
measurement but should also include goals for the treasury. “KPIs have 
to be aligned with the company’s strategic priorities – but they also, 
in my mind, have to be not only measurable, but also tied to some sort 
of objective target,” he says. “So if you are looking at free cash flow,
 you’ve got models that you are trying to achieve. If you’re looking at 
leverage, you’ve got known ranges, either that you are looking at, or 
that the credit rating agencies are looking at.”</p>
<p>In contrast, Schacknies says that metrics such as the number of bank 
accounts held by a company “may be measurable, but there’s no right or 
wrong answer for them. You can benchmark it; you can say, ‘I’ve got more
 or less than other companies do’ – but that in itself is only a 
relative observation and it has no objective truth in and of itself.”</p>
<p>He adds that while managerial metrics are important for carrying out 
day-to-day tasks, they are simply data points that come without any 
particular target attached. “KPIs, on the other hand, have got to be 
strategic and aligned, and they’ve got to have some sort of objective 
reality to them.”</p>
<h3 id=""using-kpis-and-metrics-effectively"">Using KPIs and metrics effectively</h3>
<p>KPIs and metrics can and do vary over time – so how important is it 
to review these on a regular basis? “Your KPIs need to be reviewed on a 
periodic basis, because the business might change over time,” explains 
Porre.</p>
<p>How often metrics are reviewed will vary from company to company 
depending on a number of factors. What’s important is making sure that 
the metrics continue to be a good fit for the company’s goals.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a few different cadences of reviewing these metrics,” 
comments Schacknies. “In some cases, those might be sit down meetings; 
in some they might just be emails. In the eight years that I’ve been 
here, we’ve had a number of major milestones such as the IPO – and for 
each of those, we’ve sat down and considered what that changes for us 
and what we need to focus on going forward.”</p>
<p>Another consideration is how companies report on KPIs. “Something to 
reflect on is how you efficiently and effectively report on KPIs,” Porre
 explains. “This links with your technology and processes – you need to 
know where you get the relevant information and how you can automate the
 collection of the data needed.”</p>
<p>Porre points out that the information needed may come from a variety 
of sources, including the core ERP system, the treasury management 
system, banking platforms and trading platforms. “The question is how 
you can pull those various information sources together in order to 
achieve some automation.”</p>
<h3 id=""communicating-the-results"">Communicating the results</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s important to know when and how to communicate the information gathered to the rest of the business.</p>
<p>“It really does come down to making sure your message is 
level-appropriate for the intended audience,” says Schacknies. “My goal 
is to make sure that my boss – the CFO – and everyone else above him 
knows what they need to know, which is anything impacting those 
strategic KPIs. Everything else that happens operationally in support of
 that is part of the ordinary course of business and need not dilute the
 communication with senior leadership.”</p>
<p>Schacknies says the same applies when his peers across the 
organisation have demands for information from treasury. “It’s very much
 on a need to know basis – it’s about respecting people’s time and 
ability to process information, and giving them information that’s most 
useful for them,” he concludes.</p>

<h3 id=""examples-of-kpis-metrics"">Examples of KPIs/metrics</h3>
<p>Treasurers use many different metrics and KPIs, and the chosen 
metrics will vary considerably between companies. That said, Porre notes

Private placements explored,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>With the possibility of securing long-term, fixed-rate funding, private placements of debt securities provide treasurers with an alternative to the usual bank loans and public bond issues.</p>
<p>Often attracted by the private, and thus more personal nature of these placements, corporates have the ability to access the capital markets without the need for obtaining a credit rating. However, it’s not all a one-way street. A private placement’s success relies heavily on the treasurer’s and the investor agent’s ability to structure and negotiate the terms of transaction.</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-a-private-placement"">What is a private placement?</h3>
<p>A private placement enables a company to raise funding by offering shares, stocks, bonds or securities to a small group of sophisticated investors.</p>
<p>Investors of private placements could include larger banks, mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds. Since these placements are only offered to a few individual investors, buyers can request a custom-built financial plan from the issuing company. Using this approach, potential investors can assess the deal and see if it precisely meets their investment criteria.</p>
<h3 id=""the-market-in-general"">The market in general</h3>
<p>Historically, the long-established US private placement market is the model to follow, US investors having taken advantage of an exemption to the SEC registration and business prospectus requirements in the 1933 Securities and Exchange Act.</p>
<p>The market has ‘internationalised’ over the years, with nearly half of all placements now coming from non-US issuers. That said, leading investors in the private placement market remain solidly institutional and US-based.</p>
<p>In recent years, institutional investors have become interested in less traditional assets due to lacklustre normal market yields. More adventurous investors are buying stock through private placements, seeing it as a safer way to yield than heading into the junk markets.</p>
<p>On the issuer side, in a loans market partly constrained by Basel III capital requirements exerted on banks, mid-range businesses especially with their less attractive smaller wallets and limited ancillary business, could see a way forward with private placements.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a result of this, the smaller private placement markets in Germany (the ‘Schuldschein’), the UK and France and have expanded in recent years.</p>
<h3 id=""why-would-a-corporate-issue-a-private-placement"">Why would a corporate issue a private placement?</h3>
<h4>Direct investor relationship</h4>
<p>The beauty of a private placement can be found behind the scenes. Because more shares are bought by fewer investors, they have the power to request a private placement memorandum (PPM). This is similar to a bespoke business plan for buyers. Buyers can see exactly how shares would help the issuer, allowing for more complex business circumstances and investment stories to be communicated effectively. Business sensitive information is always subject to an NDA, so the level of publicity often seen with a public offering is avoided, which may suit both sides.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Variety is the spice of life and private placements offer help in this department, providing treasurers with an alternative source of funds to the usual bank loans or public bond issuance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Access to capital markets without a credit rating</h4>
<p>A key difference between private placements and public offerings is credit ratings: placements don’t need one. Whereas most public debt issues require at least one credit rating from a recognised credit agency, private placements allow companies without a long-term credit rating (or simply those that don’t want a long-term rating) to access capital markets. The lack of a credit rating doesn’t mean the placements have a low credit quality though; placements are usually investment grade, with issuers typically having an implied credit quality of AA to BB.</p>
<h4>Diversification of funding sources</h4>
<p>Variety is the spice of life and private placements offer help in this department, providing treasurers with an alternative source of funds to the usual bank loans or public bond issuance. This allows companies to easily diversify and thus make secure their funding sources, potentially freeing-up additional credit lines or enabling refinancing of existing bank loans.</p>
<h4>More breathing room for issuers and investors</h4>
<p>One of the good things about having such a personal relationship between issuer and investor is the increased freedom for both parties when making business decisions. Placements generally give the issuing company more breathing room in the disclosures it makes to potential investors. The theory is that buyers will make sure they know exactly what they’re buying when investigating shares. In terms of advantages for investors, the private market gives borrowers the opportunity to delay funding for 12 months or longer, as opposed to the public market where a transaction is funded just a short time after it has been priced. It can therefore secure funding for when it really needs it, not just when it can get it.</p>
<h4>Competitive pricing and flexibility</h4>
<p>The fact that the process of offering debt placements to a limited number of investors is private, means relatively competitive pricing is assured. There is also greater flexibility in structuring the debt issue, with issuers and investors laying out individual finances on the table before investors look at buying.</p>
<h4>Issuance costs</h4>
<p>Another bonus for companies issuing private placements is that they could potentially avoid significant underwriter fees; things like formal registration in the US, for example, and publishing a prospectus, all cost money, and it can be very helpful if such things can be avoided.</p>

<h3 id=""why-do-investors-invest"">Why do investors invest?</h3>
<p>Private placement investors are usually sophisticated, institutional investors, who will take the time to fully research and analyse the credit of the issuer. Most of the time, investors will be insurance companies, larger banks, mutual funds and pension funds.</p>
<p>In some cases, because the investor is buying more shares, they expect a higher rate of interest than they might earn on a publicly traded security, thus they are able to achieve slightly higher returns than can be achieved by investing in comparable publicly traded securities.</p>
<p>Also, because issuers may not have a credit rating, investors may not buy unless secured with specific collateral. This, accompanied with the fact that investors are often buying stock from less well-known names means they may expect a higher percentage of ownership in a business or a fixed dividend payment per share of stock.</p>
<h3 id=""regional-focus"">Regional focus</h3>
<h4>Asia</h4>
<p>About a decade ago, investments in Asia were moving into bubble territory. Eventually, there was little for investors to purchase on Asia’s underdeveloped capital markets. There was a period of prosperity for private placements as investors bought up all the debt they could in this market.</p>
<p>Whilst public placement accounts for the majority of corporate bond issuance in a number of Asian countries such as China, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea, its private counterpart thrives in other markets, like India. Here, private placements have remained the primary form of bond issuance, representing more than 80% of the corporate bonds issued domestically in 2012 and 2013. In 2015, private placement debt in India was at an all-time high, with 2,953 companies using this route.</p>
<h4>US</h4>
<p>Public bond issuances in the US still outweigh privately placed debt 80/20, despite the latter being on the rise generally speaking. In 2015, new issues of private placements amounted to US$49bn. This compares with more than US$1trn in the public corporate bond market during the same period. In 2015, US$578.9bn or 20.9% of insurance companies’ total bond portfolio was in private placements, up from US$531.5bn in 2014.</p>
<h4>Europe</h4>
<p>Before 2014, Europe was unable to recreate the thriving US market, where insurers, pension funds and other investors avoided public markets to buy billions in private placements.</p>
<p>A year later, in 2015, it looked as if the European private placement market was expanding but fragmented, with pockets of regional activity in areas such as Germany, France and an emerging market in the UK.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, momentum has been growing towards the establishment of a pan-European private placement market (Euro PP), which is envisaged will complement the established US private placement market.</p>
<p>Indeed, many European companies in search of private placement money still head to the US for it. About a third of the US market consists of placings for European companies.</p>
<p>Despite these developments, the US market looks to remain dominant, at least for the foreseeable future. The continued need by many global corporates for dollars remains a strong advantage. Perhaps the private placement market in Europe can continue to gain momentum and achieve the capital success of America it desires.</p>
<p>In 2017, Apple broke into the Canadian ‘maple bond’ market for the first time, raising US$2.5bn in private placements. In a filing with the US SEC, Apple said it planned to use the funds for general corporate purposes. Investors included institutional clients HSBC Bank Canada, RBC Dominion Securities, BMO Nesbitt Burns and Goldman Sachs Group.</p>
<h3 id=""pp-conclusion"">PP conclusion</h3>
<p>Private placements have continued to grow over the last ten years, and not just in underdeveloped capital market countries. Boasting many positive factors for both the issuer and investor, it is easy to see why placements are, in some parts of the world, outweighing bonds offered to the public by a factor of 4:1.</p>
<p>As leading US companies continue to invest in these more personal corporate deals, European markets remain for now the poor relation, at least in terms of deal size and volume. With capital markets rising and falling in different parts of the world, private placements can act synchronously to meet the ebb and flow of need.</p>
<p>As part of the treasurer’s funding arsenal, it is likely that private placements will be in demand for some time to come. Investors, it seems, are happy to oblige.</p>

<p>In a recent webinar hosted by Treasury Today Group, Mark O’Toole, Vice President of Treasury &amp; Commodities Solutions at Openlink advocated the arrival of Grey Swan events and discussed some key areas to focus on for improved risk management.</p>
<p>The presentation focused on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Treasury situation: expectations and volatility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grey Swan risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury-intensive organisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk and complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visualising risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management frameworks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark O’Toole opened the dialogue by describing the increased volatility in today’s world. This is heightening the focus on risk and on strategies to mitigate such risks. He cited forces including the Trump factor, Brexit, cyber-security and the threat to world peace as a result of the recent actions of Kim Jong-un in North Korea. Currency devaluations, changes in the US position on international trade and a weakening global economy were all deemed to present Grey Swan risks.</p>
<p>Mark then spoke about the risks inherent in the growing complexity of supply chains, ‘what-if’ scenario analysis and stress testing.</p>
<p>Attendees were polled during the webinar with a series of questions; here are the results of one of these polls:</p>
<h5>Which area do you believe your department requires the most education in the near term?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FX risk management: <strong>47%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commodities/procurement risk management: <strong>16%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest rates risk management: <strong>16%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derivatives modeling and risk management: <strong>21%</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given today’s volatile markets, it is perhaps unsurprising to see corporate treasurers needing the most education in FX risk management. The other polls conducted suggest sensitivity analysis and ‘what-if’ simulations also need to move up the agenda. Manually generated spreadsheets acting as risk dashboards remain prevalent too; a risk in themselves where a single error can often go undetected with potentially catastrophic consequences. Perhaps now would be a good time to review the way you manage your enterprise-wide risk and plan for the Grey Swan.</p>

<p><em>Few in treasury have not heard of SWIFT. It’s a complex beast that some say is run by banks for banks. We go back to basics, picking out the key elements and trying to unravel the mysteries of this global infrastructure.</em></p>
<p>SWIFT is a global bank-owned provider of secure financial messaging services. SWIFT has only ever been a messaging service: it does not hold funds nor manage accounts on behalf of customers. At its heart is an IP-based closed network infrastructure, known as SWIFTNet. This is a secure messaging environment that uses end-to-end encryption and a Public Key Infrastructure to ensure authenticity, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation of every message it handles.</p>
<p>Today, SWIFTNet connects more than 11,000 banking and securities organisations, market infrastructures and corporate customers in almost every country and territory on the planet.</p>
<p>With a claimed availability level of 99.99%, the platform carries standardised messages used, for example, in making payments or confirming trades. SWIFT’s standards group works with users to define all message standards. These not only specify the data elements included in messages but also document the meaning and format of each element. The standards also specify mandatory and optional elements, message order and in some cases the response required by recipients.</p>
<p>Although mostly associated with banks, SWIFT has long courted the corporate community as direct users of its services. Initially this was just the largest companies installing in-house connectivity but now it is pitching services at the midcaps too, having made adoption easier and cheaper.</p>
<h3 id=""messaging-services"">Messaging services</h3>
<p>SWIFTNet incorporates four messaging service variants: FIN, InterAct, FileAct and WebAccess.</p>
<h5>FIN:</h5>
<p>FIN enables the exchange, on a message-per-message basis, of a wide range of messages formatted with the traditional SWIFT MT (message type) standards. It also supports the exchange of proprietary formats between market infrastructures and their customers.</p>
<h5>InterAct:</h5>
<p>This is similar to FIN but it enables the exchange of MX message types that use the more flexible ISO 20022-based XML syntax.</p>
<h5>FileAct:</h5>
<p>FileAct is all about large batch transfers such as bulk payment files, very large reports or operational data.</p>
<h5>WebAccess:</h5>
<p>WebAccess allows users to browse securely on financial web sites available on SWIFTNet using standard internet technologies and protocols.</p>
<h3 id=""joining-swift"">Joining SWIFT</h3>
<p>Corporates have two main options when seeking to access SWIFT – SCORE and MA-CUG:</p>
<h4 id=""score"">SCORE</h4>
<p>The Standardised Corporate Environment (SCORE) has been the main model for corporate participation in SWIFT since 2007. It is a Closed User Group (CUG) administered by SWIFT.</p>
<h4 id=""ma-cug"">MA-CUG</h4>
<p>Set up in 2001, the Member Administered Closed User Group (MA-CUG) was the first model through which corporates were able to exchange a broad range of treasury and cash management messages via the SWIFT network. Under this model, corporates are required to join a new MA-CUG for each bank with which they wish to communicate.</p>
<h3 id=""methods-of-access"">Methods of access</h3>
<p>There are three main routes:</p>
<h5>Direct access:</h5>
<p>The technical infrastructure is located at the corporate’s offices, requiring substantial up-front investment and on-site technical support and expertise for ongoing management and maintenance of the connection.</p>
<h5>Service bureau (indirect access):</h5>
<p>Hosted and maintained by a third party, providing specialist knowledge, full disaster recovery and features such as the conversion of messages to SWIFT format.</p>
<h5>Member/concentrator (indirect access):</h5>
<p>Hosted and maintained by a third party offering the same benefits as the service bureau model. However, the member/concentrator has to be a SWIFT member and they offer a broader remit of services, including administration of the SWIFT contract such as registration and receiving SWIFT invoices.</p>
<h3 id=""connecting-to-the-network"">Connecting to the network</h3>
<p>SWIFT’s IP virtual private network (VPN) is the key to user connection to SWIFTNet. The required software for connecting internal systems to SWIFT and for accessing the network can be supplied either directly by SWIFT or via a third-party vendor.</p>
<p>SWIFT offers connectivity within its ‘Alliance’ suite. This multi-platform interface provides access to FIN, InterAct and FileAct messaging services. The suite includes the interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alliance Access.</strong> A multi-platform interface that enables customers to connect single or multiple destinations to SWIFT with maximum automation of system management tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alliance Entry.</strong> A messaging interface that SWIFT has developed for low-volume customers that use a single destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alliance Messaging Hub.</strong> A single integration platform for global financial institutions looking to rationalise their messaging infrastructure across networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alliance Gateway</strong> is the communication interface connecting to SWIFT via a single point. It aims concentrated message flows for SWIFT users with medium to high messaging volumes via the Alliance Access, Alliance Entry or Alliance Messaging Hub interfaces.</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-specific-connections"">Corporate-specific connections</h3>
<h5>Alliance Lite2.</h5>
<p>The easiest way to connect to SWIFT is using SWIFT’s cloud-based connectivity solution, Alliance Lite2. It is a smaller upfront investment than direct access but has access to all types of SWIFT messages and files.</p>
<h5>Alliance Lite2 for Business Applications (L2BA).</h5>
<p>This is a cloud solution, enabling corporates to combine their own SWIFT-ready software – such as cash management solutions, treasury management systems, trade and securities platforms – with SWIFT connectivity in a single package. SWIFT runs a partner programme for providers offering SWIFT services, as well as a ‘SWIFT-ready’ certification (or SWIFT compliance) programme for vendors and their offerings.</p>
<h5>Customer-hosted connectivity.</h5>
<p>Suitable for high traffic volumes, allowing connection to SWIFT via Alliance Access or Alliance Gateway.</p>
<h3 id=""swift-the-product-provider"">SWIFT the product provider</h3>
<p>SWIFT is expanding its portfolio of products all the time, mainly to help banks enhance their own transaction banking solutions for corporate clients. These developments focus mainly on the following core areas:</p>
<h4 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h4>
<p>MT940/942 messages are the standard customer statement messages. Where recipients need more information, in a format that suits them, the XML-based ISO 20022 camt (short for cash management) messages signal progress.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that, at the moment, there are few banks that are able to send camt.052 (account reporting), camt.053 (account statement) and camt.054 (credit or debit notification) messages.</p>
<h4 id=""mandate-management-and-user-identity"">Mandate management and user identity</h4>
<p>SWIFT’s 3SKey secure digital signatory tool provides an opportunity for the banks to securely authenticate end-users and validate the financial transactions based on individual mandates.</p>
<h4 id=""documentary-trade"">Documentary trade</h4>
<p>MT798 messaging standards enable banks to support the automation and centralised processing of letters of credit (LC), standby LCs, collections and demand guarantees.</p>
<h4 id=""approved-payables-financing"">Approved payables financing</h4>
<p>SWIFT’s Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) supports trade settlement using ISO 20022 data structures.</p>
<p>SWIFTRef is a global reference data utility providing reliable data sourced directly from its originators in a format compatible with ERP systems. The SWIFTRef platform is used to collect, manage and deliver worldwide payments reference data for use by over 5,500 financial institutions and 500 corporates globally. SWIFTRef data is used to validate and check international and domestic payment operations, as well as supporting regulatory reporting needs.</p>
<h4 id=""kyc"">KYC</h4>
<p>SWIFT’s KYC Registry provides KYC information for correspondent banks as well as fund distributors and custodians. Banks contribute an agreed ‘baseline’ set of data and documents for validation by SWIFT, which the contributors can then share with their counterparties.</p>
<h4 id=""data-quality"">Data quality</h4>
<p>The Payments Data Quality service checks messages using quality verification rules developed by SWIFT in line with industry practice and in cooperation with its community.</p>
<h4 id=""standards"">Standards</h4>
<p>MyStandards is a collaborative web application used to manage standards definitions and industry usage. It includes the MyStandards Usage Guideline Editor, an offline application that allows users to define and maintain their own usage guidelines.</p>
<p>The MyStandards Readiness Portal is an online, self-service function intended to ease the client on-boarding process for financial institutions and their customers. Even with global messaging standards, each bank’s format will differ slightly. When a corporate wants to connect with a specific bank, these small differences slow the process. When testing a message against a bank specification, any errors or mismatches will generate a response that describes what is wrong. The user will then be directed to the relevant field definition in MyStandards so that the message can be modified accordingly whilst still online and retested straight away.</p>
<h4 id=""most-recently"">Most recently…</h4>
<p>Launched in December 2015, the global payments innovation (gpi) initiative is being billed by SWIFT as creating “the next era for correspondent banking”. With more than 90 banks signed up, interest represents more than 75% of SWIFT’s cross-border payments traffic.</p>
<p>Essentially gpi is a new multi-lateral service agreement. It is designed to offer corporates the ability to make payments with same-day value, obtain transparency over fees, increase certainty by offering end-to-end payments tracking, and ensure that remittance information is transferred unaltered.</p>
<p>But there is a roadmap for services under gpi, including the ability for corporates to request payments through the SWIFT network and the capability for banks to stop payments where a sender has made an error. This requires some supplementary technology.</p>
<p>In July 2017, SWIFT announced that 22 additional global banks had joined its gpi blockchain proof of concept (POC). The PoC aims to validate whether the technology can help banks monitor, manage and reconcile their international nostro accounts in real time.</p>
<p>Currently, real time monitoring is not possible due to lack of intraday reporting coverage. Monitoring the funds in their overseas accounts is done via debit and credit updates and end-of-day statements. This work adds cost to cross-border payments. The PoC will test whether distributed ledgers can help banks reconcile those nostro accounts more efficiently and in real time, lowering costs and operational risk.</p>
<h3 id=""final-word"">Final word</h3>
<p>This has been a very quick look at SWIFT’s activities. It is complex and, for corporates uncertain as to how to approach it, independent research is essential. Banking partners, technology vendors and service bureaus will all have a view that is worth investigating. The truth is out there.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Treasury management systems have changed markedly over the past decade, with many adopting a broader range of functionalities as well as different deployment models. In theory, companies of all shapes and sizes are now able to leverage these solutions – but to what extent are corporates in Asia Pacific taking advantage of next generation treasury technology?</em></p>
<p>Treasury management systems (TMSs) are the mainstay of many corporate treasury departments in Europe and the United States. Indeed, PwC’s most recent Global Treasury Survey found that 80% of respondents in Europe and the US had a fully integrated TMS. Asia Pacific (APAC), however, has tended to lag behind where TMS adoption is concerned: the same study found that less than half of treasury functions in Asia use a TMS.</p>
<h3 id=""changing-landscapes"">Changing landscapes</h3>
<p>There are a number of reasons why this is the case, not least of all the way in which the treasury profession has developed in APAC. “In Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the region’s most developed markets, the usage of TMSs is generally on par with Europe and the US,” explains Albert Lo, Partner at PwC. “The main reason being that most companies in these cities have a more developed treasury department that is taking a strategic role in the business.”</p>
<p>Once you move beyond Hong Kong and Singapore, however, TMS usage drops significantly. “In some APAC markets, the role of treasury is still emerging and is embedded into the broader finance function,” adds Lo. “With no standalone treasury function in place, the driver to implement a treasury system is just not there.”</p>
<p>Even when a treasury function exists in companies operating in Asia’s emerging markets, corporate culture can prohibit TMS adoption, comments Tony Marrinan, Head of Financial Sales, APAC at OpenLink. “In the top-tier local corporates, the treasury function is still primarily regarded as a cost centre,” he says. “Typically, their structure is quite decentralised and they do not have overly complex requirements, meaning that senior management believes that the operations can be run on a spreadsheet.”</p>
<p>Historically, many Asian corporates were also priced out of the TMS market. “Until quite recently TMSs were perceived to be expensive,” says Tony Singleton, Managing Director, APAC at Reval. “They were required to be hosted on internal servers and the upkeep of these fell onto the corporate customer. As a result, TMSs have typically been a tool for top-tier corporates with abundant IT resources and sophisticated treasury functions.”</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-in-the-cloud"">Treasury in the cloud</h3>
<p>In more recent years, both the status of treasury in the region and the solutions offered by TMS vendors have changed, seeing TMS adoption gain momentum. “Today treasurers across the region have a much broader remit and are expected to achieve their goals with fewer resources,” says Singleton. In Reval’s most recent global survey, for instance, 72% of financial professionals in the region said they expect the scope of their treasury function to increase, while 73% expect their staff to stay the same or decrease. “This growing maturity, coupled with the proliferation of regional treasury centres (RTCs), highlights the need for treasury teams to have more sophisticated tools than spreadsheets to manage their operations,” adds Singleton.</p>
<p>As the treasury profession has developed, so has the TMS landscape, with vendors offering lower-cost deployment options. The game changer in this respect has been the rise of cloud-based solutions, whereby solutions and data are held off-premises on the TMS providers’ servers and accessed through the internet. According to Reval’s survey, 30% of respondents in the region said they are using cloud-based solutions.</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions offer numerous benefits for treasurers. For instance, vendors maintain and automatically upgrade their solutions, ensuring that systems are always up-to-date. Cloud solutions can also be accessed easily from anywhere in the world and they can offer better disaster recovery and business continuity.</p>
<p>The main attraction, however, is that the rise of cloud models has cut costs dramatically. PwC, for instance, suggests that a cloud-based TMS implementation can be 30% to 50% cheaper than a traditional server-based implementation. It is no surprise, then, that OpenLink’s Marrinan states that every RFP the company receives specifies cloud deployment.</p>



<h3 id=""six-steps-to-tms-success"">Six steps to TMS success</h3>
<h5>Executive management support</h5>
<img alt=""Group of three people icon"" class=""right icon"" height=""46"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2017-05-06-tta-01-t-executive-management-support-410285647-80x46.png?la=en&amp;hash=6A9216C9A269E4365676E9F0056629D2"" style=""float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"" width=""80"">
<p>At the outset of the project, it is essential that treasurers (should) garner the support of executive management and at least secure their willingness to consider investing in a new treasury system.</p>
<h5>IT department</h5>
<img alt=""Three people on top of a tog wheel"" class=""right icon"" height=""65"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2017-05-06-tta-01-t-it-department-60x65.png?la=en&amp;hash=53F7C8FDFBC5EBF1CF0C53FFAA7E6A36"" style=""float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"" width=""60""/>
<p>It is important to seek IT participation from the start and invite a designated representative to join any TMS project discussions. Their early involvement promotes their understanding of treasury requirements whilst giving them the opportunity to provide expert guidance on the technological details of the TMS project.</p>
<h5>External relationships</h5>
<img alt=""Handshake in the background with three people in the foreground"" class=""right icon"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2017-05-06-tta-01-t-external-relationships-232598128-60x67.png?la=en&amp;hash=675F9B0BB93D1C02666831F18039EBD4"" style=""float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"" width=""60""/>
<p>Treasurers should be aware of any issues that may surround the integration of bank reporting mechanisms, payment systems or other external feeds with a new TMS. It can be helpful to discuss the TMS project with bank relationship managers as they may be able to provide useful insight into TMS technology and how it can help specific clients’ needs.</p>
<h5>Treasury structure</h5>
<img alt=""Bunch of bricks laid out neatly"" class=""right icon"" height=""58"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2017-05-06-tta-01-t-treasury-structure-338622245-60x58.png?la=en&amp;hash=81C6C8CC8245C4F4491324ACE173890C"" style=""float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"" width=""60""/>
<p>It is important to consider which areas within treasury operations will be impacted by system changes. This will depend on a treasury’s structure – decentralised, centralised and/or in-house bank – and on whether payment/collection factories or shared service centres are used.</p>
<h5>Treasury operations</h5>
<img alt=""Tog wheels"" class=""right icon"" height=""60"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2017-05-06-tta-01-t-treasury-operations-302544857-46x60.png?la=en&amp;hash=1F54A2469F925567600D7E646FCC25B5"" style=""float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"" width=""46""/>
<p>The systems and procedures currently in use should be assessed in detail and relevant documents such as the treasury policy, treasury mission statement, job descriptions and user manuals should be consulted. Workflow analysis can be undertaken to identify current inefficiencies, weaknesses and control and security issues that may expose treasury to greater risk.</p>
<h5>Defining TMS requirements</h5>
<img alt=""Paper and pencil with target"" class=""right icon"" height=""58"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2017-05-06-tta-01-t-defining-tms-requirements-432915349-60x58.png?la=en&amp;hash=9C50FBA4722DF4342CB94C66DD4E27EB"" style=""float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"" width=""60""/>
<p>A definitive list of requirements should be drawn up using the information collated. These requirements can then be divided into areas of activity or sections within the treasury department, eg dealing, confirmation, settlement, cash flow forecasting, treasury control and risk management, differentiating between the essentials and the ‘nice-to-haves’.</p></img>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""joining-the-dots"">Joining the dots</h3>
<p>Treasurers are also requesting systems that are more flexible and better positioned to meet their changing needs. More specifically, treasurers are asking for systems which enable them to pick and choose functionality based on their own requirements and that can be easily integrated into other systems used by the treasury.</p>
<p>It is in these areas that relative newcomer to the TMS space, TreasuryXpress, has focused a lot of its efforts. As a former treasurer, Anis Rahal, the company’s founder and CEO, found it frustrating having to implement a full TMS when only a few specific features were needed. As such, TreasuryXpress has pioneered the ‘unbundled’ TMS solution with its C2Treasury platform.</p>
<p>Once the basic solution is deployed, Rahal explains that treasurers are able to use TreasuryXpress’ online ‘app store’ to buy extra modules, such as advanced forecasting. “The TreasuryXpress Store is all about how we can make the life of the treasurer easier,” he says. “Often the selection and buying process for treasurers is long and drawn out because they are forced to justify extraordinarily expensive implementation project fees and subscription costs. Our solutions eliminate those barriers because they are highly affordable and quick to implement.”</p>
<p>Rahal also notes that the TreasuryXpress solution has been built with next generation connectivity in mind, specifically application programming interfaces (APIs). Most recently, TreasuryXpress launched a payments API called Payments+. The new API delivers an easy, self-service means to automatically generate bank-ready, ISO 20022-compliant payment files from any ERP or TMS. “We rely on APIs to make our technology work and connect to other systems,” says Rahal. “It is all about providing flexibility and optionality to our clients.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-next-step"">The next step</h3>
<p>Some treasury departments in Asia are also now looking to squeeze added-value out of their systems through the use of analytical modules. PwC’s Lo states that when working with clients on implementation projects, many are interested in the ability to conduct scenario analysis and stress testing based on their own data set. “The results can then be provided to the CFO and used as a guide for the future,” he says. “This is a very good way to get more value from the TMS and something many corporates are looking at doing.”</p>
<p>The focus on analytical capabilities is something that OpenLink’s Marrinan says the company has been working hard on. “By including commodities risk alongside interest rate and FX rate risk in our system, we already offer our clients a holistic view of their overall risk profile,” he says. “Analytics has always been a big part of our offering, but now there is a concerted effort to make this easier and more effective for treasurers and CFOs. The aim is to help put them in a position to make highly informed and proactive business decisions.”</p>
<p>Analytics, while useful now, is not the zenith according to Reval’s Singleton: he expects to see the focus moving to mobility and real-time analytics evolving into artificial intelligence (AI) over the coming years. “Corporates won’t have to conduct stress testing, the system will do it for them based on the data it is receiving from the market,” he explains. “This information will then be pushed to the treasurer and displayed on a dashboard within the system. AI may also enable TMSs to suggest trades that need to be made and changes to the hedging policy, for instance. In Asia more urgent imperatives will be addressing cyber-security, blockchain, and new accounting standards like IFRS 9.”</p>
<h3 id=""building-a-business-case"">Building a business case</h3>
<p>Before treasurers in APAC can leverage the functionality that TMSs offer today – and the functionality they may offer in the future – they first need to build a business case to have one implemented. As mentioned earlier, this is not always easy.</p>
<p>Reval’s Singleton, who has been working with clients implementing TMSs for over ten years, has some salient advice for how to overcome the challenges. “Implementing a TMS is part of a transformation journey,” he says. “And first treasury needs to shift the thinking of senior management and make them view treasury as a value adding function that can deliver enhanced financial returns for the business.” Once this mindset has changed, Singleton says that treasurers can then begin thinking about how to sell the investment in a TMS platform. Here it is important to highlight the financial benefits that can be sought from improved working capital management, liquidity management and the adoption of an in-house bank.</p>
<p>Finally, when the treasurer gets approval to implement a TMS, Singleton advises that treasurers should be strategic when managing the implementation. “It is important to get quick wins to show the benefits of the solution immediately,” he says. “For instance, Reval helped one of its clients connect over 1,000 accounts in the first two months, gaining full visibility over their cash. This was a big benefit for the company and completely validated the rest of the project.”</p>

<p class=""management-summary"" style=""clear:both;""><em>As a fast-growing company, Malaysia’s Tan Chong Group needed to move away from manual processes and drive more efficiency across its treasury operation.</em></p>
<p>“We have been running an in-house bank on spreadsheets for a few years and as the company was expanding this was becoming an incredibly time-consuming process,” says Wan Chun Shong, Group Treasurer at Tan Chong Group. “The biggest issues were that mistakes were so easy to make and occurred frequently, and I was spending most of my time resolving these issues. We also needed to gain more visibility over the Group’s cash, something that the legacy manual set-up just didn’t permit.”</p>
<h3 id=""long-term-project"">Long-term project</h3>
<p>Tan Chong had actually come close to implementing a TMS a few years ago after the treasury explained the merits of such a system to the company’s senior management, however, this didn’t go ahead. Although disappointing for the treasury at the time, it did provide some key learnings for when Wan and his team began looking at the TMS market again last year.</p>
<p>“After setting up the in-house bank, we went into the market looking for a highly sophisticated solution that could be hosted on-premise,” he explains. “In hindsight, this really wasn’t what we needed. We were not a sophisticated treasury set-up and didn’t need a ‘Rolls Royce TMS’, so in some respects it was good that the project fell through, rather than be stuck with a solution that didn’t meet our needs.”</p>
<p>A more pragmatic approach was therefore taken last year when the Group submitted its RFP to the market. What is more, the senior management had also become more familiar with cloud technology and were therefore happy for the treasury to adopt a cloud-based solution. “We knew that the best system for us was one that has robust functionality and isn’t overly complex to use or filled with a lot of features that we wouldn’t use,” says Wan. “We wanted to plug in and play and enjoy the benefit right away.”</p>
<p>After a diligent process, Tan Chong selected Kyriba’s cloud-based solution. “We knew that all the TMS solutions could do what we wanted, it was just a case of finding the one that was easiest to use and most closely matched our requirements,” says Wan.</p>
<h3 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h3>
<p>With implementation commencing shortly, Wan states that the current focus for his team is on aligning processes with the system. “Treasury teams shouldn’t try and adapt the system to fit, they should adapt,” he says. “The TMS will provide all the efficiency and streamlining that you need as long as you provide the right inputs.”</p>
<p>The next area that Tan Chong Group will be focusing on is bank connectivity. This is especially important in ASEAN as not all banks have best in class technology infrastructures. “Ideally, we want the TMS to connect to all our banks and provide the straight through processing that we are looking to achieve,” concludes Wan.</p>


","Treasury management systems have changed markedly over the past decade, with many adopting a broader range of functionalities as well as different deployment models. In theory, companies of all shapes and sizes are now able to leverage these solutions – but to what extent are corporates in Asia Pacific taking advantage of next generation treasury technology?",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/treasury-systems/2017-05-06-tta-01-t__exposure-of-businessman-and-cityscape-mixed-media-588074678__1920x1080.jpg,2017-05-01,Treasury Systems,False

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>It has never been more important for treasurers to have a full view of risk across the business.  But how can treasurers achieve this, and how can technology help them manage their risks more effectively?</em></p>
<p>Managing risk has long been a core responsibility of the corporate treasurer – and recent events have only made risk a greater concern. From interest rate risk to cyber risk, treasurers are required to understand the implications of many different types of risk on the company’s financial position and, where necessary, take appropriate action to mitigate those risks.</p>
<p>In many cases, this is an area where improvements are needed. “In a recent study FIS performed of treasury professionals, approximately half of respondents described their risk management strategies as either mediocre or poor,” comments Steve Wiley, VP Treasury Solutions at FIS. “New regulations, recent fluctuations in foreign exchange prices and highly publicised hacks have put all areas of risk, including cyber risk, higher on the treasurer’s radar than ever before.”</p>
<p>In today’s challenging environment, risk management is arguably second only to cash management where the treasurer’s goals are concerned. PwC’s 2017 Global Treasury Benchmark Survey placed financial risk management third on the treasurer’s agenda after cash flow forecasting and cash management optimisation, while currency risk was found to be the second most important of the CFO’s priorities for treasury. Altogether, the survey found that risk management represented 15% of the activity split for central treasury staff.</p>
<p>In practice, treasurers often manage a broad range of risks. Vivian Peng, Vice President &amp; Asia Treasurer at Flextronics, points out that the traditional financial risks managed by treasurers include liquidity, forex and credit risk, but that other risks may be identified such as counterparty risk, industry risk and geographical risks, depending on the features of individual companies.</p>
<p>With so many risks to manage, how important is it for treasurers to gain a full view of risk across the business – and how can this be achieved in practice?</p>
<h3 id=""evolving-risk-management-environment"">Evolving risk management environment</h3>
<p>From political upheaval to high-profile cyber-attacks, the events of 2016 underlined the importance of expecting the unexpected. The UK’s Brexit vote has had a significant and lasting effect on exchange rates, while attacks such as the Bangladesh Bank heist demonstrated the potential scale of cyber-attacks as fraudsters become ever more sophisticated in their approach.</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-the-risk-circle"">Understanding the risk circle</h4>
<p>In this climate, it is more important than ever to understand the nature of the risks faced by organisations. Paul Taylor, Head of Global Corporate Sales and Head of EMEA Sales for GTS at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says that he regards risk management as a circle with four points flowing in a cycle.</p>
<p>“At the 12 o’clock position of the circle, you have geopolitical and macroeconomic events, which as we’ve seen in the last 12 months, can be surprising,” he explains, noting that such events can have a considerable impact on financial markets, politics, consumers and economies. “Moving round the circle, that has created a much greater feeling among clients – whether they are institutions or consumers – of exposure to risk. This awareness is the second point on the circle.”</p>
<p>The third point, Taylor continues, is the need for greater regulatory scrutiny and for market bodies to be appointed. “At one end, that means the regulators – but it also means activist investors, think tanks and quangos which provide scrutiny and oversight and highlight risk in a more detailed way than before.”</p>
<p>Finally, Taylor says that banks represent the fourth point of the circle. “Banks have seen a dramatic shift in terms of how they view risk, how they measure risk and how they react to those risk measures,” he says. “This feeds through into their appetite, their market selection and their client selection – and in turn, this ends up having an impact on economies and geopolitical situations, completing the circle.”</p>


<h3 id=""managing-volatility"">Managing volatility</h3>
<p>“As a treasurer, we have to worry about two kinds of volatility: the ones we know about and understand, and the ones we are not aware of,” says Damian Glendinning, the Singapore-based treasurer of Lenovo. “For the first category, once we are aware of the issue, it is usually possible to collect the data on the underlying exposure, and take the necessary risk mitigation actions. These will usually be some form of hedging.</p>
<p>“Of course, it is better if the awareness of the risk does not come from a bad experience: we always try to get out ahead of these problems. The sad fact is that many organisations are only willing to make the necessary investment in gathering the data and enforcing the disciplines after they have learned the lesson the hard – and expensive – way.</p>
<p>“By definition, it is hard to prepare for the risks and the volatilities we are not aware of. This will often take the form of unexpected consequences: the funding crisis and the dramatic spike in overnight interest rates during the global financial crisis is a prime example. It might have been possible to foresee the collapse of a single bank – but no-one expected the chain reaction which ensued.</p>
<p>“For these cases, it is always best to make sure we have something in reserve. It is also very good to challenge your own assumptions. In many cases, our actions are based on an implied assumption that something cannot happen – it very often can.”</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""growth-brings-risks"">Growth brings risks</h4>
<p>Another catalyst in the current risk environment comes, perhaps counterintuitively, in the form of growth. Steve Elms, EMEA Sales Head, Corporate and Public Sector and Regional Marketing, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, notes that growth is emerging as a key topic for 2017, with clients increasingly looking for opportunities to expand their businesses. “As they search for growth, this brings them to new markets, new counterparties and new relationships,” he comments. “As such, risk continues to play a role even in the context of a very positive growth story.”</p>
<p>Again, the geopolitical landscape is relevant to this theme. “While growth can be seen as positive, there is also a question mark about the impact of nationalism if this global trend continues,” Elms comments. “My belief is that growth will continue to be a theme, but it does create a few slowing down factors.”</p>
<p>Illustrating this point, Elms cites the long tail risks which have been evident following the shocks of 2016. “Following the UK’s vote to leave the EU and the election results in the US, the volatility created in the market was significant – especially in relation to FX rates,” he says. “Many had hedging programmes in place, but as hedges roll off the real impact of currency devaluation has hit home. Earnings volatility is therefore becoming more of a priority for corporates.”</p>
<h3 id=""know-your-risks"">Know your risks</h3>
<p>In this environment, what steps can treasurers take to manage their risks as effectively as possible? First and foremost, treasurers need to have a full view of risk across the business. “It is critically important for treasurers to have transparency into their financial exposures and the risks that could affect them,” says Bob Stark, VP Strategy at Kyriba. “Making decisions without a full view of risk is like only looking in one direction before crossing the street.”</p>
<p>Taylor says that the first step is to be as precise as possible when understanding the risks to the business. He points out that every business and industry segment has its own risk profile, so some businesses will prioritise certain risks above others: “If you are an oil major, for example, you will be considering different risks to a technology company.”</p>
<p>As well as having a clear understanding of the risks which impact the business, Taylor says it is essential to have the tools, mechanisms and technology needed to manage those risks on a real-time basis. At the same time, it is increasingly important for treasurers to take a broad, strategic view of the different risks they face. “Nowadays, treasurers play a much broader and more strategic role in the running of the company and how the company operates,” he says. “In that sense, treasurers are obliged to take into account risk considerations which go much further within the company than just within the finance or treasury function.”</p>
<h4 id=""responsibility-for-risk-management"">Responsibility for risk management</h4>
<p>However, gaining a full view of risk across the business can be challenging, and it is important to note that treasurers may not be directly responsible for managing every risk that affects the business. That said, even risks which do not fall under the treasurer’s remit will still need to be considered. “Treasury are normally involved in financial risks, not business risk,” comments Flextronics’ Peng. “But business risks should be factored into financial results. How treasury could help business to factor business risk into the development of strategy and negotiation with customers would be an interesting topic.”</p>
<p>Taylor notes that almost all forms of risk impact the treasurer, whether directly or indirectly. “A good example of that would be technology risk or cyber-security risk,” he explains. “I’m not sure that in most companies this would fall to the treasurer to manage, but clearly technology and cyber-security risk have a massive bearing on the role of the treasurer.”</p>
<p>Another area where treasurers may see indirect impacts is with geopolitical events such as Brexit in the UK, the change of administration in the US and political upheaval in the Middle East. “I don’t know if any treasurer feels that they directly own any of those elements as far as the overall company’s response is concerned,” says Taylor. “But clearly each one of those is going to have a ripple effect on the company’s finances and its ability to manage its working capital.” As such, Taylor says that even if these areas of risk are not ‘owned’ by the treasurer, the treasurer will still be directly responsible for managing certain elements of them.</p>
<p>In some cases, this responsibility will be shared with other parts of the business. “There are some risks that treasurers manage alone – such as liquidity, currency and interest rate risk,” observes Stark. “There are others that treasurers support in collaboration with other teams – such as the impacts of regulatory change on tax or the impacts of globalisation on the supply chain, and sovereign risk impact to top line financial KPIs of their organisations.” Stark points out that for treasurers who don’t play a role in tax strategy, reducing risk in the supply chain or external influences on business performance, “it is a lost opportunity that will limit their career progression.”</p>
<h3 id=""role-of-technology"">Role of technology</h3>
<p>When it comes to managing risk, technology has an important role to play – but this doesn’t negate the need for a clear view of the risks faced by the company. As Stark says, “a treasurer cannot manage risk without technology. Yet nothing can be achieved with technology before treasurers understand the business impacts of managing risk.”</p>
<p>With a clear understanding of the impact of risk on their cash flows, positions and opportunities to borrow and invest, Stark says that treasurers can leverage technology “to improve visibility into risk exposures, make better hedging and risk mitigation decisions, and manage regulatory compliance.” He notes that while a reactive treasurer will use technology to get everything done, “a proactive treasurer will leverage technology to analyse the effectiveness of what they are doing and how they can continue to improve.”</p>
<p>Treasury management solutions can play a key role in helping treasurers understand their risks and manage everything from interest rate hedging to liquidity risk. Functionalities such as business continuity and the ability to enforce segregation of duties can enable businesses to mitigate their operational risks.</p>
<p>“Treasury technology allows treasurers to centralise global foreign exchange exposures, track hedging instruments, automate risk analytics and reporting,” comments FIS’ Wiley. He notes that treasury technology can also protect company assets through access to the strongest levels of cyber-security by specialised treasury technology providers. “Additionally, risk management technology allows for the treasury function to be more effective in decision-making processes related to the hedging of risk, by automating the collation and analysis reporting of data, which deliver more timely, complete and accurate information.”</p>
<p>At the same time, treasurers should be monitoring how new and emerging technology can be used to enhance their risk management practices across different areas of risk. “It’s a new technological environment in addition to being a new risk environment,” comments Elms. Where receivables are concerned, Elms says that the use of machine learning to match invoices is a “significant trend” which can enable corporates to reconcile their receivables processes in a much more automated way. “This brings not only improvements to working capital, but also risk mitigation,” he adds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elms points out that the arrival of PSD2 is helping to drive some developments, such as the use of application programming interfaces (APIs), thereby enabling an event-driven rather than demand-driven flow of information. “So rather than requesting data, information is being pushed to the recipient who will be the consumer of that data,” says Elms. “For example, as a collection comes in, that automatically generates an impact to the balance of that account to be shared on a real-time basis.” Such developments can play an important role in arming treasurers with the information they need to gain a clearer view of risks.</p>
<p>Taylor says that robotics could increasingly play a role in helping treasurers manage their risks more effectively by enabling more processes to become automated. “Anyone can run a spreadsheet and it can produce results, but what do we do when we have to make emergency payments, or when a market event has a knock-on impact to the ability of a company or a market to function?” Taylor asks. “Are there newly automatable processes which would not only enable companies to manage this in an automated way, but which would actually increase the company’s speed of response to those events – and thereby dramatically reduce their risk?”</p>
<p>As banks invest in areas such as big data and robotics to bolster their own processes, they are also looking at ways in which this type of technology can be used to benefit their corporate clients. “We’ve certainly done that in terms of our CashPro or virtual account management platforms, and by rolling out robotics in our retail presence in the United States,” says Taylor. “I think banks can play a big role in that technology – but I think technology itself has a much bigger role to play in supporting the treasurer.”</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>If the events of 2016 taught treasurers anything, it is that unexpected events can and do happen. “Ironically, the market’s reaction for tail risk is becoming much less,” notes Elms. “People are getting used to the unexpected. Of course we’ll continue to see volatile events – but where day to day events are concerned, we’re moving into a new normal.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, understanding and managing risks is a higher priority than ever for corporate treasurers. As innovation continues, treasurers should welcome any developments that might enable them to manage risks more effectively – while also leveraging the full range of functionalities offered by existing solutions.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Every profession has a small set of activities that are fundamental to the successful execution of their role. For the treasurer, working capital management (WCM) sits at the beating heart of corporate endeavour and is amongst the core elements needed for survival. If ever such a claim was in doubt, take away the control mechanisms that keep the company liquid and start timing how long it takes before the vultures start circling.</p>
<p>Treasurers have always been the custodians of corporate cash, ensuring optimal liquidity, securely deploying any surplus or borrowing sensibly. But in today’s strained economic environment, simply putting cash on deposit, when that deposit is subject to unprecedented negative rates, can be costly. And if borrowing, it is flirting with disaster if a company expects its banks to agree to almost any facility. Times have changed and there is no longer a ‘one size fits all’ answer to the question “what shall I do with my cash?”</p>
<p>With approaching 30 years of industry experience, Kevin Grant, Member of the Executive Board at financial software and services firm, Hanse Orga, takes the view that today’s treasurers need to adopt a global vision of company cash. In WCM terms, treasury can be seen as an “overlay function” that looks at, and acts on, information received from operational regions and countries, entities within countries and the bank accounts and facilities they hold. Decisions around surplus cash and cash requirements will thus be influenced by a multitude of factors. Take seasonality of cash flow across the entire business, for example.</p>
<p>An ice cream seller makes money in the summer but will call upon reserves or borrow in winter to get by. This is perhaps an over-simplistic example but transposing it to a major international corporate will maintain the same seasonality effect, even if the demand on cash is extended dramatically. The matter is of course compounded for corporates when their activity takes place across different regions. ‘Ice cream selling’ – and its metaphorical corporate equivalent – suddenly takes on a whole new complexity.</p>
<h3 id=""changing-drivers"">Changing drivers</h3>
<p>Whilst companies have always had to manage working capital in order to survive, for obvious reasons the act of ‘working capital management’ has come to prominence since the financial crisis of 2008. For treasurers, executing this core activity in the face of adversity must assume a new profundity – and nowhere is this more relevant than where operational complexity exists. This will almost certainly be a matter of concern for the treasury profession.</p>
<p>Indeed, for Grant, almost by definition treasury exists in organisations that are in “such a mature stage of their development” that they are undertaking cross-border trade. For those businesses that have grown into multinationals (MNCs), with overseas entities and banking relationships and facilities to match, international trade will involve the flow of multiple currencies across the organisation. This, he notes, will inevitably create transactional exposures – these typically being associated with payables and receivables – which in turn require risk mitigation processes to be in place.</p>
<p>However, in order to expand, an international organisation demands foreign investment. A new overseas manufacturing plant, for example, may require a company to borrow locally to ensure it has the local currency, or the currency of the contract, to keep the project on track, and this has to be funded. The considered WCM view may suggest that rather than using free cash flow to support a long-term capital investment, it may be more prudent to borrow longer-term, by issuing a bond or going to the commercial paper (CP) market, for example. This loan, rather than absorbing free cash, then becomes a de facto cash generator and, unless there are regulatory constraints, this cash can be repatriated and used to pay down the principal on the agreed loan and interest.</p>
<h3 id=""no-kpis"">No KPIs</h3>
<p>In making working capital decisions, traditionally a company would look at its P&amp;L statement on a monthly basis and ask if it was generating the cash expected from sales activities, and also if it is controlling the cash going out of the business on the ‘accounts payable’ side (taking this as a generic term to include internal costs such as staffing and office management). “This is not good enough because it only offers a snapshot of a backward looking accounting statement,” states Grant.</p>
<p>A company might also look at its balance sheet on a monthly basis because this will reveal what cash is trapped in ‘work in progress’ (such as the sale of software or a service); the contractual terms around the delivery of this sales offer will influence the company’s ability to take that income into the P&amp;L statement. “Ultimately, whether a company uses the balance sheet or the P&amp;L for its working capital management, these are just accounting statements.”</p>
<p>Indeed, they give no information as to whether an invoice has been raised in time, if the customer has paid in time, or if the business is paying earlier than it needs to pay. For Grant, even if a business knows what its days sales outstanding (DSO) and days payable outstanding (DPO) activity is, it is not clear what is influencing and impacting this activity on a day-to-day basis if these elements are not being monitored as key performance indicators (KPI) of business processes.</p>
<p>Effective WCM is therefore more than just DSO and DPO from the invoice cycle; it is about cash in the bank account, and a host of other forecasted committed-costs that the company has. Of course, these should be picked up through the budgeting process. But consideration too should be given to monthly refreshes of the typical 12-18 months rolling forecast, the sales and expenditure expectations of each operating unit and treasury’s own borrowing and investment cycles and commitments.</p>
<h3 id=""deeper-working-relationships"">Deeper working relationships</h3>
<p>Biologists talk about the symbiotic relationship between certain different species, describing how one supports the other. Within business, it is easy to see how different functions interact as a living organism, with great potential for mutual benefit. But, says Grant, this ‘mutualism’ can and should extend beyond internal relationships. Corporate buyers working closely to support their suppliers can help to maintain supply chain stability. Indeed, as part of the Finanzsymposium survey mentioned earlier, almost half of respondents said customer behaviour and DSO was the area of greatest opportunity to maximise the effects of WCM.</p>
<p>In commerce, most businesses rely on their suppliers. If they start to lengthen business terms they run the risk of making those suppliers financially unstable, notes Grant. Putting a stranglehold on the companies you are dependent upon for your own production and subsequent sales is, he believes, “a very short-term view” that risks becoming “a self-fulfilling demise” for all parties. “But has it stopped large multi-nationals doing it?” Clearly not.</p>
<p>The common WCM approach to extending DPO and shortening DSO is to offer a supply chain finance (SCF) programme, he comments. SCF is a tri-party arrangement, with a financial institution sitting between the buyer and supplier. Where a supplier wishes to receive early payment, it is charged a fee in the form of an interest rate based on the creditworthiness of the buyer. Here, the burden of the financing cost is borne wholly by the supplier. “It may give the supplier its cash earlier, but it is cash that comes with a cost. I would question whether that really is supporting the supplier, or whether that is a buyer-preference model.”</p>
<p>More reasonable perhaps is the bi-party arrangement, where the buyer gives the supplier the option to take earlier payment for a discount set by the supplier with buyer approval. Dynamic discounting, as it is known, comes out of the free cash flow of the buyer and therefore does not require any financing third-party involvement. “That is a closer working relationship in my view and one that maintains a healthy collaborative symbiosis between both parties.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-difficult-view"">A difficult view</h3>
<p>As organisations begin to realise that managing cash is a vital skill, the treasury function has come into focus. With a macro-level view of the process, the role is in a position to assimilate information from across multiple functions in order to make key WCM decisions. Where such functions may exhibit inefficiencies – such as the slow raising of a purchase invoice, incorrect or missing references, late delivery or claimed non-receipt – these situations are not observable if the business simply looks at the P&amp;L or a balance statement at a group level. “Companies should be tracking these KPIs as part of the daily management regime,” says Grant.</p>
<p>What is required is a system of delivering visibility in an easily digestible way. The refrain at this point may be that this is hard to achieve – and this is fair comment. Many large corporates are still entrenched in siloed operational units, with fragmented data flows exposing them to error. An otherwise professional treasury may be extracting data from a TMS, ERP and forecasting system and trying to consolidate group data – along with data from external partners such as banks – in spreadsheets, sometimes even outsourcing this process to a third party. “Quite often the consolidation process is not automated, there is a mix of electronic and paper-based data and people are re-keying numbers,” notes Grant. Using the sum of this process as ‘fact’ is a dangerous occupation; if results even arrive in a timely manner, there is simply no way of efficiently verifying credibility.</p>
<h3 id=""all-in-solutions"">All-in solutions</h3>
<p>With organisations cognisant of the need to be more analytical and critical of their processes, the urge to fix the problem is rising up the agenda. Certainly there is acknowledgement by treasurers that today’s systems are capable of meeting the challenge but this comes with the conflicting view that technical complexity is perhaps too high a price to pay.</p>
<p>The key is to have data sources circulating within the same homogenised environment. Best-of-breed systems are impressive in themselves but if all data sources flow within an ERP, the fabled ‘single version of the truth’ might seem more probable, says Grant. For him, an ERP gives access to planning data, treasury activity, accounts payable and accounts receivable, supplier and customer contract management information in one location and available the moment it is updated – even if it is manually keyed at the initial point of entry.</p>
<p>Digitised data can be used for straight through processing and reporting. Business intelligence (BI) and KPI tools, which also reside within the same ecosystem, may also be auto-populated with this data. From here, it is possible to start building management dashboards to address the issues around WCM “in a dynamic and real-time way”. This can even be viewable in multiple channels, from smartphone to desktop, and be capable of providing group level information with resources to drill down into regional, country and even customer level, offering user-insight into various behaviours that impact cash and liquidity.</p>
<p>The counterpoint to this singular expression of company financial data is that, system-wise, this is asking for a monolithic structure; it will be complex, hideously expensive to build and resource-intensive to operate. “Things have changed,” states Grant. “None of the ERP vendors have been sitting back, failing to tackle ugly and unfriendly user interfaces; none have spurned real-time reporting”, he retorts. “They’ve been developing solutions to these issues: at SAP they introduced the HANA and they have built real-time reporting and BI tools around working capital. We also have the Fiori user-experience development environment which can give a completely new look and feel to navigating standard SAP screens.”</p>
<p>The aim is to allow greater transparency, analysis and control over liquidity positions and business processes. Modern solutions also allow global process owners, particularly the treasury function, to respond more quickly to ad hoc requests on liquidity and to meet the increasingly strategic nature of such enquiries. Furthermore, says Grant, not only are treasurers able to proactively provide information to senior management and the board but also, if dashboard capability is adopted, it can give senior managers direct access to that information, in an easily digestible form.</p>
<p>In practical terms, it may be that a customer pays on time every time, but what is the cost of serving that customer? Profitability analysis, notes Grant, is a function of new ERP analytics. “It can reveal a very different story when balancing that cost with individual customer behaviour, especially when annual budgeting costs are added into the mix.” There is a compliance issue here too, he adds. If a customer is not behaving in accordance with the commercial contract, easy access to information pertaining to this can prove “significantly advantageous” when applying such information to the overall analysis of WCM.</p>
<h3 id=""ask-an-expert"">Ask an expert</h3>
<p>Of course, the capabilities of an ERP system can prove somewhat overwhelming when seeking to optimise WCM. Within the realms of the system, treasurers may not even realise the full array of possible data sources that can be brought to bear on the matter, especially if they are not considered ‘traditional’ treasury sources. For Grant then it is the role of a company such as Hanse Orga to help unwind those complexities and to unlock the true potential of an organisation’s technology.</p>
<p>Large corporates often have a fragmented technology landscape and, as a result, fragmented processes. It’s a status that is all too easy to achieve. Deploying a best-of-breed approach will always create divisions between technologies and even if these divisions can be electronically bridged, it requires close planning to make those connections work. But fragmentation may also exist even if the organisation has an installed ERP, concedes Grant. Indeed, it is quite common to run different ERPs or multiple instances of the same system, across different locations (an effect commonly attributable to M&amp;A activity). Help may be required.</p>
<p>“Consulting in the ERP space first means understanding what system the client has acquired, how this has been implemented and how can this be fine-tuned – because the same goals can be achieved in different ways,” explains Grant. He accepts that the configurability of an ERP may be seen as both a strength and a weakness: if you know what you’re doing it will be the former.</p>
<p>When it comes to fine-tuning an ERP to achieve a specific goal, Grant has a clear vision of how he wishes to operate. “We liken ourselves to [Mercedes-Benz performance tuning firm] AMG” he says. AMG does not sell cars but it takes many aspects of a standard vehicle – such as engine, brakes and suspension – and can tune these to whatever specification the customer wants. In much the same way, Hanse Orga does not sell the ERP but it fine-tunes the system to its clients’ needs. In doing so it may bring in internally-developed add-ons or third-party tools (as indeed does AMG) to achieve the desired goal of de-fragmenting the overall treasury technology architecture. In many cases, just an expert’s fine tuning of the standard parts can bring significant process improvement.</p>
<p>When the goal is to bring about a sea-change in WCM, where disparate sources of data are brought together in the kind of symbiotic relationship that can only yield positive results, Grant argues the case for a technology partner that has financial workflow automation expertise, BI capability and a pragmatic approach to delivery. “There is no point in automating everything and giving the client great solutions if in the end it does not give the organisation information that helps manage its business,” he declares.</p>
<p>Tackling WCM efficiency demands the interpretation of a company’s goals as a business, its incumbent technologies and its strategies. In taking a view of the “policies, processes and people” that drive it all, Grant asserts that “the cash impact of all these behaviours” becomes readily apparent. This is effective WCM.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Smith Awards Winner – Harnessing the Power of Technology</strong></p>
<p>Ever wondered where your company’s cash is? Honeywell doesn’t, having been able to achieve 100% daily cash visibility on their 2,241 bank accounts and all cash investment transactions around the globe.</p>
<p>Honeywell had built up cash significantly since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, to over $8.4bn today. Counterparty risk has also been a growing concern as banks were hit by junk portfolios, new regulations and ensuing credit downgrades. Honeywell therefore needed to completely revamp its counterparty risk management process. Honeywell decided to harness the power of technology to address the situation. Séverine Le Blévennec, Director EMEA Treasury explains how the company leveraged a range of technology components to provide 100% daily cash visibility on their 2,241 bank accounts and all cash investment transactions around the globe.</p>
<p>This webinar was held on Wednesday 17th February 2016.</p>

<h4 id=""questions-asked"">Additional questions answered by Honeywell since the webinar</h4>
<h5 class=""question"">Why is your treasury set up in Belgium?</h5>
<p>This is an historical location. We used to be a ‘coordination center’, a Belgium special status set up to attract treasury centers, until Belgium was forced by the EU to end this status. We are now a ‘financial company’ and this status works well for us too. Belgium has double tax treaties with multiple jurisdictions to obtain WHT exemptions, has a rich pool of treasury talents, and enjoys a reasonably transparent and stable regulatory environment. For employees, you have many peer networking possibilities, it is close to other bank hubs such as London, Paris or Amsterdam, and the quality of living is high for a European, truly multicultural, capital city.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Is Honeywell an NFC+ institution and do you have a need to post any collateral for your derivatives portfolio?</h5>
<p>No, we only do hedging and so we are a NFC.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Given the current regulatory climate for both the banks and the Money market funds (ie MMF reform) are you looking at Triparty repo as an alternative secured form of investment for your cash deposits?</h5>
<p>We have been considering it since 2011, but have not managed to dedicate sufficient resources (especially legal support). Now, we have a pretty rich acquisition pipeline ($5.5bn solely in December, with more to come), so the need is less pressing.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">How do you handle local companies that claim to need a local bank because that bank supports local customers? I’m thinking specifically of times when the local bank preference differs from HQ’s wishes?</h5>
<p>Treasury selects the bank, taking into account all local needs. We work with our relationship banks to address our needs in a cost-effective manner. We may for instance negotiate fixed FX spreads to decrease the needs of a FX account. We also have a global netting in place (to settle intercompany invoices). Nevertheless, when integrating new companies it does happen that we need to keep legacy bank accounts for a certain period of time; it is often BG related. It is also more common in certain countries such as China or India (contract related). In this case all regular activity will go through the relationship bank account and the use of the legacy bank account will be limited to the strict minimum…until later closure. Our new affiliates enjoy steep bank fees reduction which does highlight the role of treasury in selecting and negotiating with our banking partners.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Do all your 2,400 accounts report balances via SWIFT? How was this managed with all your banks. And any accounts that do not report by SWIFT how are these balances captured. And how are your deposits covered?</h5>
<p>Ninety-eight percent of our bank accounts report balances via the SWIFT network, either directly to our BIC or via the BIC of Fides bank which acts as a consolidator (a process in place for the last 12 years). Only rare banks in the world do not have access to the SWIFT network. The other 2% of accounts balances, for instance upon an acquisition (awaiting for MT940 reporting to be set up) are reported weekly by the business in a in-house developed webtool, for further upload to our TMS.</p>
<p>All our deposits and any other investment transactions are entered in the TMS at the latest on their value date, by the person who closed the deal, with an automatic reconciliation via MT940 the day after. Our cash exposure reports displays both information (investments and cash on bank accounts), in many different sort orders and aggregation levels.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Do you have your own SWIFT BIC code?</h5>
<p>Yes, we do.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Do all accounts report by MT940? Some banks cannot for technical reasons or cost. Do you have any issues with this?</h5>
<p>Only rare banks in the world do not have access to the SWIFT network. The other 2% of accounts balances, for instance upon an acquisition (awaiting for MT940 reporting to be set up) are reported weekly by the business in a in-house developed webtool, for further upload to our TMS. If cost of daily MT940 reporting is prohibitive (not with our relationship banks), we may elect to report only on days where there are transactions.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">How many banks do you have your accounts in? And are all banks able to provide standard mt940s, especially the ones operating in emerging markets?</h5>
<p>As of today (following our $5.1bn large acquisition on 29<sup>th</sup> December), we hold bank accounts with 382 different banks (ie a banking group in a certain city), belonging to 118 different banking groups in the world.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Is SWIFT managed by IT or a service bureau?</h5>
<p>We do not use a service bureau.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Are bank mandates (authorised signers) also managed electronically?</h5>
<p>Unfortunately not yet. This is a 2016 project.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Does your solution also offer to some extent the possibility for all local entities to do liquidity forecasting, which is then automatically consolidated on a global level?</h5>
<p>No, because our treasury system is not linked to SAP (further than an interface to book the head office and in-house bank transactions). Not all our entities are yet on SAP, and the ones on SAP do not all have the same version. We are just too big and always growing.</p>
<p>Since we are cash rich outside the Americas, and that funding is automated largely, it is not an issue. We only forecast the month-end cash, a few days before month-end – and we have an over 99.8% accuracy.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">What are your minimum rating requirements for banks? How do you cope with the negative interest rates?</h5>
<p>At least A2/P2/F2 if there is no better rated option. We nevertheless do hold some legacy bank accounts with lower or non-rated banks, when we may not close those accounts for contractual reasons. We do not close active investment transactions (TD or others) with banks rated lower than A2/P2/F2.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">If credit rating of a bank drops what is the action plan to switch banks?</h5>
<p>It depends of the extent of the rating drop. If the bank is still at least A2/P2/F2 and we think we still bank with the best bank in country, we’ll work at limiting our exposure, eg by automating external investments. If we doubt of our bank abilities and want to benchmark them again, we analyse our business needs and do a RFP to select the best bank for our business in that country.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">Does Honeywell benchmark SAP enhanced capability to do more of the technology delivery for treasury?</h5>
<p>No. Not heard of it. Looking forward to receiving any related information.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">How long does it take from decision making to realising the results?</h5>
<p>Not sure which decision making you refer to, but we typically have a very short implementation time eg three months is the typical timeframe to reach over 80% of acquisition integration or switch bank, and such projects rarely last more than six months.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">How do you forecast the cash balances within existing platform?</h5>
<p>We do not forecast, our balances, to the exception of the in-house bank for the daily investments.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">What's the key driver in deciding on which treasury system to invest in? Do you have dedicated IT team?</h5>
<p>We have two persons dedicated to treasury, but they are more operational/technical than strategic. The selection is made by looking at demos, benchmarking with other alternative systems, asking peers, challenging the solution providers, comparing cost and service.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">You spoke about a 50% above target on interest income. What type of product do you invest in?</h5>
<p>The increase in interest income is not only linked to products, as we are extremely conservative. It is a matter of understanding both your constraints (first of which, your company investment policy!) and the market offer. To summarise, I’d say:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First you need to unlock idle cash and make sure you invest any USD that can be invested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, you estimate your cash needs (and cash generation) for different periods in the future to determine the optimal investment horizon for each investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, you do not necessarily do a single investment for any investor (frequent mistake if treasury is not involved in investing the cash). It often makes sense to break your cash into smaller tickets and build a maturity profile to extend the maturity of the investments while preserving regular access to liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth, we look at all product opportunities in each country: TD, structured deposits, active investment accounts (with or without a notice period to access funds), yield on operational bank accounts, AAA MMF etc. No repos yet, but could make sense. No non-rated funds yet, but can make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifth, you analyse the banking market in each country to select banks with attractive risk/return profiles, and establish a relationship when needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sixth, you may consider to invest cash generated in one region to be invested in another region (non-resident transactions). Be patient to fulfill all KYC.</p>
</li>
</ol>

ERP vs TMS: the best of enemies,"


<p><em>Over the years, some treasury departments have had the choice between implementing either a Treasury Management System (TMS) or the treasury module of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, while others have had to soldier on with spreadsheets. What are the arguments for and against each system?</em></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the late 1880s, inventors Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla battled over the correct way to transmit electric currents. Almost a century later, VHS and Betamax fought fiercely to dominate the video market. Today, Apple’s iOS platform continues to jostle with Android and Windows for number one position in the mobile market.</p>
<p>Like the retail space, treasury technology has its own battles. Treasury Management Systems (TMSs) and Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs) have been competing to be the treasurer’s workstation of choice for well over a decade. Both systems fundamentally seek to achieve the same goal, improving the work of the treasury function. Yet, both have different methods of achieving this, offering their own advantages and disadvantages. Making matters worse, there is the possibility to use both technologies, with spreadsheets also in the mix.</p>
<h3 id=""tms-built-to-fit"">TMS: built to fit</h3>
<p>A TMS is a dedicated treasury technology solution that vendors claim offers a wide variety of tools that can be applied to many treasury tasks. “The TMS sits at the heart of a treasurer’s operation – collecting data from a plethora of different sources, processing this data and then outputting it where necessary for both the treasury and company as a whole,” says John Byrne, Managing Director at TMS provider Salmon Software.</p>
<p>The sheer range of functions that a TMS is able to process is one of the main selling points. Salmon Software’s offering, for example, has around 120 modules that cover a range of treasury activities including: cash management, debt and derivatives, forecasting, hedging and risk management. “Typically a corporate would use around 40 or 50 of these modules, depending on their circumstances,” explains Byrne.</p>
<p>This flexibility to customise the TMS using modules has been one of the major developments in the TMS space of late. Whereas once there was a worry among the corporate community that a TMS was a relatively monolithic tool, the systems can now be installed to fit. For example, a multinational corporate would be able to select all the FX modules that they require to carry out cross-border activity. A UK domestic company on the other hand with little use for these can turn these modules off and focus on the area that better suit its business requirements. “A TMS is a customisable solution for companies of all shapes and sizes,” confirms Byrne. And because corporates don’t have to buy the system lock stock and barrel, there are potentially benefits in terms of cost, the time taken to implement the system, and also the ability to add on modules when business requirements change – instead of having to deploy a new system.</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Another area that TMS vendors have focused heavily on in recent years is interoperability of TMSs – whether it be integration with internal systems, or communicating with an external party’s software, such as a financial institution’s e-banking platform. “The increasing drive from corporates for straight through processing (STP) has ensured that the vendors have focused on integration,” says Salmon’s Byrne. “This focus has, in turn, assisted in delivering other benefits such as real-time cash positions and improved forecasting, as well as reducing the error rate from manual inputs.”</p>
<p>For many treasurers, an additional tick in the box for the TMS is that the system ‘belongs’ to the treasury (unlike a company-wide ERP). For the treasury, owning the solution offers a number of advantages. Firstly, the treasury will have control over the system and therefore – in theory – should have more say over when it is optimal to install updates. Of course, central sign-off will still be required for this, and budget will need to be allocated to the TMS, but this should be less cumbersome than an ERP treasury module update. After all, updates to the ERP treasury module would normally be driven by IT and be bundled into a company-wide package therefore leaving treasury little say in when this happens. The smaller scale of a TMS upgrade is likely to mean it will also be cheaper and quicker to achieve.</p>




<h3 id=""the-treasury-workstation-a-short-history"">The treasury workstation: a short history</h3>
<p>The first TMS providers emerged in the mid-1980s when, inspired by the advent of personal computers and new technology entering the corporate space, pioneering developers began to create solutions that could aid the treasury function. Approaching treasury technology from different backgrounds, these companies initially developed solutions that impacted only a portion of the treasurer’s operations rather than offering an extensive treasury solution.</p>
<p>From the mid-1990s, the core functionality of the TMS expanded rapidly as corporates began to migrate across from ‘in-house’ or spreadsheet based solutions to the ‘off the shelf’ TMS market. This really began to help drive the widening capability of these offerings.</p>
<p>During this period, TMS improvements allowed treasuries to begin to trade more and more complex instruments, and to integrate with a wider set of internal and external solutions and data providers. “At times, TMS providers struggled to keep up with the fast-changing demands of their clients, and at times new functionality could be delivered to market before it was ready,” says Andrew Marshall, Managing Director, SLG Treasury.</p>
<p>Since 2008 however, the treasury industry has gone ‘back to basics’ to reflect the changing attitudes to risk since the onset of the financial crisis. “This in turn has allowed breathing space for the TMS providers to focus on improving existing functionality, whilst at the same time allowing the ERP treasury solution providers a good opportunity to catch up with their TMS rivals,” adds Marshall.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""erp-the-holistic-view"">ERP: the holistic view</h3>
<p>Data from consultancy firm Zanders shows that currently 70% of corporates who employ a treasury workstation use a specialised TMS system. Yet, the data also suggests that there is a drive towards companies exploring and implementing an ERP treasury module. In 2006, 19% of companies were using SAP in combination with SAP treasury. In 2014 this number had increased to 40%, says Zanders. The driver for this change is not necessarily coming from the treasury department but from the boardroom.</p>
<p>By its very nature, an ERP system has a wider focus than a specialised TMS, with modules being available and used across the entire business. As such its treasury module can be seen as a branch of the system and not the heart of the system itself. While this might sound like a significant disadvantage, this can actually offer the business a number of benefits as treasury is fully integrated and on the same platform as the rest of the company – helping to facilitate the consistent passage of data. “The capabilities that are provided from a treasury perspective complement the story that the data from the wider finance function and beyond provides,” says Christian Mnich, Director of Solution Management for Treasury Application at SAP SE. “An ERP gives a view of core processes that concern treasury from end-to-end, and allows companies to better collaborate, identify risks earlier, obtain real-time data and bring all the pieces together in one place.”</p>
<p>In addition, “the ability of an ERP treasury module to retrieve information from other modules reduces integration headaches and ensures that the costs associated with non-ERP TMS platforms, are minimised,” says James Bateman, TMS Architect at SLG Treasury. “It also offers executives and internal audit a greater sense of satisfaction because all the data is being retrieved from a single platform.”</p>
<p>The sheer scale and technical complexity of an ERP system means that it has the ability, if supported by the right advisory and professional services support, to create a best-in-class architecture that can offer the treasury above and beyond what a standalone TMS can offer. “ERP vendors often work on economies of scales and have an ability to lower cost on the latest technologies a lot faster than non-ERP TMS vendors, as their TMS platforms are crucial to a wider sales strategy,” says Bateman. “Concepts that are considered the Holy Grail for most treasurers such as organisation-wide, real-time cash management views, are only available on ERP platforms,” he notes.</p>


<blockquote>ERP vendors often work on economies of scales and have an ability to lower cost on the latest technologies a lot faster than non-ERP TMS vendors.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">James Bateman, TMS Architect, SLG Treasury</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The common consensus, however, is that achieving such an integrated architecture comes at a large cost and one that the majority of organisations are not able to invest in. SLG Treasury’s Bateman contests this perception and argues that an ERP treasury module project may actually be a cheaper alternative overall. “If a company has already invested in an ERP then installing the treasury module is likely to be a cheaper option overall. This is because these types of systems are almost always architected to integrate seamlessly and haven’t in recent years been layered with the latest open interfacing technologies like Enterprise Web Services.” For Bateman, the cost of integration post-2008 is an excessively underestimated concept within most TMS rollouts and often accounts for large over-expenditure, future rework and is something that can potentially be avoided by leveraging an ERP treasury module crafted on standardised business and integration processes.</p>
<h3 id=""functionality-wars"">Functionality wars</h3>
<p>Cost aside, treasurers have often been cautious of using an ERP treasury module, because – historically at least – it has not offered such a rich variety of functionality in comparison to a TMS. An ERP, by its very nature, is vastly different to a specialised TMS system vendor package because an ERP is designed to fit complex organisational requirements – and the treasury module is only one minor element in the broader scheme of the architecture.</p>
<p>However, in recent years there has been a significant push by the ERP vendors to ‘beef up’ their treasury offerings. “The argument that the functionality in ERP treasury modules is outdated is ten years old now and there has been lots of investment in the treasury space,” says Mnich. “We now provide an end-to-end solution that covers the four key areas of – payments and banking, cash and liquidity management, debt and investment and FX management – and we are increasingly seeing more corporates adopt this.”</p>
<p>But then, a vendor will always back their own product. So what do end-users think?</p>
<p>“If a treasurer has the simple choice between a TMS vs ERP solution, I would say the majority would pick a TMS,” says Marshall. “A number of factors feed into this, but primarily it is the outdated stigma that exists surrounding the ERP’s functionality, cost, ownership and complexity of implementation. However, if for instance the business case for implementing the treasury module of the in-house ERP system is being driven by the wider IT strategy, or even driven downwards from CFO/CEO level, then the proposition becomes a hard one to argue against.”</p>
<h3 id=""best-of-enemies"">Best of enemies</h3>
<p>What then is the best solution for both the business and the corporate treasury? “In a perfect world the most optimal solution for the overall business is for all departments to be on the same platform. This would mean an ERP system that was seamlessly connected with the ERP treasury module allowing all cash flows to flow straight through giving complete visibility over cash and transactions,” says Marshall. But heavy investment is needed to achieve this. Also, large corporates often have different ERP instances within the same company, thus adding another layer of complexity when trying to reach a perfect solution.</p>
<p>For corporate treasury to be happy with the ERP solution, it will ultimately need to be satisfied with the level of functionality that is offered by the ERP treasury module, something that Salmon Software’s Byrne believes currently isn’t the case. “ERP systems in my opinion don’t have anything like the range of tools, functionality and coverage that a TMS has,” he says. “So depending on what the treasury activity is you would be unlikely to find it satisfied in an ERP system. Integration is therefore the key as this allows you to have best of breed systems that process a logical flow of data and satisfy all parties. Both a TMS and an ERP are strong in their own arenas and they should work together.”</p>

<p class=""management-summary""><em>UK based multinational mining company, Anglo American Plc, installed SunGard’s Avant Gard Quantum TMS in 2001 to manage its treasury operations, integrating this into SAP – the company’s ERP system. The TMS is upgraded regularly every 18 months to two years.</em></p>
<p>“We selected this system for a number of reasons,” says William Ward-Brew, Head of Treasury Operations at Anglo American. “Aside from it having the functionality we required, the reputation of the company was a big factor and we wanted to use a vendor with knowledge of the different markets we worked in and also with other blue chip companies on their books. The financial status of the vendor was also important due to the consolidation in the TMS industry over the years and we wanted to ensure our system was committed to and would be developed in the future.”</p>
<p>Anglo American did investigate the SAP treasury module after being pointed in that direction by IT, however, a specialised TMS seemed to be a better fit. “There was a lot of reluctance to use the ERP module because of the experience that some of the team members had had with it before and this carried a lot of weight towards not selecting it,” says Ward-Brew. “The project was treasury-led and we wanted a system that was suitable for treasury needs.”</p>
<p>Being suitable for treasury needs extends beyond functionality and also touches on its ability to be flexible. “If you work in a treasury environment where you need to adapt quickly then an ERP upgrade can take a number of months and will have to incorporate other functions that use it as well. With a TMS, you can dictate when things get changed,” he says. The support offered by the vendors was another selling point, “we wanted our teams across the globe that use the TMS to be able to obtain regional helpdesk support quickly should they need it and we didn’t believe that this was cost effective with the ERP solution.”</p>
<p>For Ward-Brew, there is a place for both systems in the current marketplace. “The integration between the two is getting better and better and now areas such as accounting are seamless,” he says. “I still believe that TMS vendors are closer to the treasury market in terms of development focus and they have built modules to meet the evolving needs of the treasury. Also, for real-time data, the TMS is a better solution because treasury can determine the flow of information, unlike an ERP which may be updated periodically based on competing workflow processes across the business. If the enhanced data flows from the ERP can be integrated into the TMS and vice versa, then that is a great solution.”</p>

<p><i>If ever a market was ripe for picking then it has to be the one for the treasury management system (TMS) in Asia right now. Growing economies, more corporates entering the market, few vendors with which to compete, and a largely untapped source of prospects. Can it really be this simple?</i></p>
<p>The TMS has been around since the 1980s and in that time has progressed from a relatively simple cash management tool into a sophisticated multiple-function platform. In Europe and North America, a proliferation of vendors came and went as the industry carved a niche for itself before engaging in an intense burst of consolidation in the late 1990s and early 2000s and again towards the end of the last decade. Today, just a few providers remain on the international stage. Although more localised and specialist sector vendors still ply their trade, it is often in the face of competition from the major players that boast established (but sometimes quite confusing) product sets and deeper pockets to support technological and market expansion.</p>
<p>For all vendors, the Asian TMS market is still in a state of development. The businesses most likely to consider such a solution – large international corporates and domestic players with international aspirations – seem to be dictating the direction of the growth of the TMS market in that where a system is implemented it will more than likely be from one of the big international vendors.</p>
<h3 id=""the-key-players"">The key players</h3>
<p>All of the ‘usual suspects’ seen in the global market place have an Asian presence, typically in the region’s key commercial centres. In terms of deployment, the Treasury Today 2014 Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study reveals that SAP’s treasury module, IT2 (now part of Wall Street Systems) and SunGard’s AvantGard (Integrity) are most frequently cited, followed by Wallstreet Suite, SunGard Quantum, Reval, Kyriba and 360T (the latter being a niche trading platform).</p>
<p>As with the European markets, some regional vendors are in the hunt and this short list includes Singapore’s CS Lucas and Australia’s Visual Risk (the latter now branching out and making inroads into the European market). As an aside, there are also a number of vendors in the extremely well-developed Asian (and largely India-based) banking back office supplier space. Players such as TCS, Oracle FSS and Infosys offer treasury tools but these are geared to the banking sector within which they are typically just a small part of a much broader suite of functionality.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the tier one global banks – such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank – offer regional treasury functionality to corporate clients, usually via their global transaction services divisions. In addition, some of the Asian regional banks are now offering treasury services too. China Merchants Bank, for example, delivers treasury management tools for its large corporate customers such as Shenzhen Energy Corp and China Shipping. The bank’s offering, it says, covers a range of core treasury functions in a centralised fund management environment across a virtual private network.</p>
<p>The increasing attention paid to the Asian markets by the specialist vendors has stirred the interest of more general financial technology providers. China’s largest ERP developer, Yonyou Software, has entered the treasury field – offering GL tools for reconciliation, P&amp;L statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. Yonyou claims it works with over 60% of China’s top 500 enterprises; it also has offices in Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand and an apparent will to develop the depth of its corporate relationships across a broad client base.</p>
<h3 id=""market-movement"">Market movement</h3>
<p>The US and European TMS market is hardly saturated but with flat economies in these regions and the level of economic growth over the last few years in the Asian markets, it is not hard to see where the next big push will be. Indeed, a measure of Asia’s growth potential is demonstrated by the ever-expanding community of international and global companies now operating in the region – a number of global corporates are now running in-house banking and shared service centre operations in the liberal APAC countries, for example. Today, around 30% of the total global economy flows out of Asia.</p>
<p>For corporates operating in the region, new markets will almost certainly mean increased financial and commercial complexity. As cross-border transactions ramp up, there will be increased exposure to different taxation structures, new regulations, currencies and cultural influences. All of these can conspire to put pressure on treasury concerns such as cash visibility, cash flow forecasting and cross-border liquidity, bank connectivity (particularly around standardisation of file formats and protocols), foreign exchange (trapped cash is a noted issue), counterparty risk and even payment cycles.</p>
<h3 id=""the-right-tools"">The right tools</h3>
<p>The bottom line is that technology can become a lifeline for many treasurers because the right products can limit or remove these issues. However, the Asia Corporate Treasury Survey 2014 by PwC revealed that more than 50% of respondents did not have a TMS in place, and those that did were only using the basic functions. This is odd because 29% said they operated within geographically dispersed businesses covering six or more countries in the region, with 31% overseeing operations between two to five countries. In essence, few have the right tools and yet many are in dire need of help.</p>
<p>Delving deeper into the technology issues, Treasury Today’s 2014 Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study uncovered this shortfall, highlighting the fact that implementing a cash flow forecasting solution was the number one urgent requirement, followed by a system to improve treasury’s visibility over company cash. Implementing a full TMS was a priority but some treasury operations have not even reached the start line: in response to a question about which systems will be installed in the next 12 to 18 months, one respondent said “none” as their treasury “requires greater centralisation before technology can be overlaid.”</p>
<p>Despite the increasingly urgent need for technological assistance, there seems to be a degree of dissatisfaction with and/or misunderstanding of TMS technology in Asia. The PwC 2014 survey revealed that 49% of companies using a TMS were not entirely happy with their current system. Just 9% of respondents associated risk management with a TMS and only 30% used their TMS for risk and position reporting. Again, the Treasury Today study went deeper, asking respondents to reveal the areas that they felt were most urgently in need of improvement in their system. The top five issues covered the basics: cash flow forecasting (as the top priority), then reporting, accounting, reconciliation and pooling.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the issues (which could equally be the vendor trying to shoe-horn a broad-based system into a local market or just a training-related matter), there is a general realisation amongst businesses in Asia that as they grow, the importance of IT rises up the agenda. Some are responding to this, with 20% of the Treasury Today study participants in charge of an annual technology budget claiming they had more than $250k at their disposal – one respondent said this figure had recently increased “due to the offerings in automation and standardisation” but added that every purchase was subject to return on investment (ROI) analysis.</p>
<h3 id=""growing-into-the-system"">Growing into the system</h3>
<p>The expansion of a business will have a knock-on effect in terms of how its treasury is structured, what is required of it and, eventually, the kind of technology it is likely to need to fulfil its role. In terms of the evolution of treasury, technology is a facilitator. It allows expanding Asian treasury units (expanding in terms of both reach and responsibility) to concentrate more time on value-added activities and less on the transactional. As the level of usefulness and professionalism increases so too do the responsibilities: it is (hopefully) a virtuous circle of growth.</p>
<p>TMS users in the key financial centres tend to be the offspring of vast North American and European companies that have chosen to locate in Singapore, Hong Kong or Malaysia largely because of their respective government’s tax-led incentives for treasury centres and because each has a well-established technical infrastructure and the ready availability of skilled staff. Indeed, PwC’s survey results showed that treasury technology adoption is dominated by large organisations (61%), with the vast majority of these being based in Singapore, Hong Kong or China (China has only recently begun to liberalise its currency but the main attraction for corporates is the sheer size of the market).</p>
<p>Only 25% of small and 44% of mid-sized companies had implemented treasury technology, the decision most likely being a result of budgetary constraints or the simple fact that they do not yet have the complexity or volumes to justify the cost. It could also be a matter of circumstance. Traditionally in Europe or the US, much of the ROI is predicated on automation and improving productivity; firms are effectively just saving on personnel costs. In a low-cost labour environment as may be found in the emerging markets of Asia, that cost saving is less relevant. Around 75% of companies in Asia without a TMS continue to rely on spreadsheets as their main treasury management tool. The business case to acquire a TMS is thus different in Asia; increasing treasury complexity is likely to be the trigger.</p>
<h3 id=""the-path-to-tms"">The path to TMS</h3>
<p>The uptake of the TMS has a clear linear relationship with the openness and complexity of the market in which the organisation is operating: complexity drives the need for technological help. A company that has no more need than to check its bank accounts once a week has no business case for a TMS; if it is looking to protect assets, align liquidity with where the needs of the business are and generally discharge the typical responsibilities of treasury, then a TMS may have a role to play.</p>
<p>The model that typifies the progress of a basic treasury function to one of strategic value follows a common path. Starting with a transactional treasury unit, the focus will be on the fundamentals such as short-term cash management, bank account management and execution of necessary transactions. As a business grows and its geographic reach extends, treasury may evolve to a more process-efficient unit that can optimise the local use of cash and liquidity and develop process efficiencies, typically aiming for a higher degree of straight through processing (STP). This might be the first point of consideration of a TMS.</p>
<p>The next stage of evolution is the value-enhancing treasury where it effectively discharges its core responsibilities but also exploits concepts such as the shared service centre (SSC), netting centre and regional cash pool to help the overall business achieve its strategic goals (bearing in mind that some of these are not permissible in certain jurisdictions). The final stage will see the rise of the strategic treasury in which it takes an active role in the development and delivery of the company’s strategy, providing financial leadership over matters such as funding, banking relationships and risk management.</p>
<p>The fact that having a professional treasury for many Asian companies is a relatively recent phenomenon gives them an interesting ability to quickly move ahead of the kind of development curve seen in Europe or North America. Asian firms are afforded the opportunity to analyse best practices developed by their overseas peers over the past couple of decades and apply them over a relatively short period. However, the quest to run treasury on best practice lines does tend to steer companies towards the long-established international vendors which will have already incorporated those practices into their system. This is particularly so if the client is seeking to expand its operations into the European or North American homelands of those vendors.</p>
<p>The ability to look at and learn from an existing market is something that the shrewd vendor should have exploited when seeking to tackle Asian TMS delivery. Treasurers in any part of the world tend not to be early adopters of technology so where other business functions in the region may trail-blaze with new concepts and models, particularly with delivery models such as the cloud, treasury technology vendors have had the opportunity to watch, learn and shape their own response accordingly.</p>
<h3 id=""new-players-unlikely"">New players? Unlikely</h3>
<p>The reason a treasury in Thailand, for example, is likely to be looking for a TMS in the first place is because it has experienced growth and complexity, so now lacks the visibility and control for its international or global operations. It will look at its peers and see which practices and systems they are using, and it is this that will possibly drive its own expectations of the kind of technology it needs (which in all likelihood in this case will not be a Thai-specific system). If most corporates in the market for a TMS need more than just local requirements, it follows that it is unlikely the market will see a sudden rush of local players climbing on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Even though there are major software firms (such as China’s Yonyou Software, mentioned earlier) that operate successfully across a number of verticals, the barriers to entry to the TMS space are extremely high, with few if any new vendors having emerged in recent years in any geography.</p>
<p>Does this mean the international players have the run of the Asian markets? To a degree, yes it does. But those vendors seeking to enter a new Asian market will not have an easy time of it: they will face unique challenges. The key to success will be its capacity to understand and respond to local issues. In Asia, language is going to play a key role in any progress. Singapore or Hong Kong may accept English-only, but no vendor will get away with that in China. This applies to the product, which has to be offered in the local language, and to service delivery too. There may also be culturally-based expectations around delivery too. Just as a US or European vendor may be expected to identify the business patterns and culture for each market and be able to align itself with those expectations, so it should expect to meet local Asian needs. Failure to understand will almost certainly see the vendor sailing into a headwind and possibly failing.</p>
<p>Investment in the market by the vendors is thus essential because of the prevalent business culture that demands localisation and people on the ground to make the deals and to support the clients thereafter; the personal touch counts for much in Asia. Being in the Asian markets also demands a detailed knowledge of the regulatory environment which may require a different set-up for each country – for example, the requirements around the way data is hosted and transferred cross-border under local data protection laws. Regulatory diversity in Asia is as much a challenge for corporates and banks as it is for the vendors.</p>
<h3 id=""an-attractive-proposition"">An attractive proposition</h3>
<p>That said, the potential in Asia for all stakeholders is huge. The reason it is a target for the major international TMS vendors is simple: economic growth attracts corporates and as those corporates gather momentum and acquire more treasury complexity, a TMS becomes an ever-more likely proposition. Asia is experiencing economic growth (even if the pace has slowed a little). As a largely green-field site in terms of current levels of TMS adoption, the region presents itself as the perfect opportunity for vendors – and if they are keen to make headway this perhaps is the perfect time for treasurers to test the water too.</p>

<h3 id=""spoilt-for-choice"">Spoilt for choice</h3>
<p>In many ways, we are spoilt for choice. Despite active consolidation by private equity funds, there are still several well-established old school TMSs on the market based on 20-year-old client server technology that has evolved over time. Post crisis, a gaggle of newer internet stack and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products have gained traction and are going global. Meanwhile, though most treasurers still feel they are a bit behind the cutting edge, the ERP vendors continue to develop their TMS offerings.</p>
<p>Even though they all claim to do everything, most TMSs come from specific histories, and this impacts their current functionality and style. For example, some started out as front office dealing systems, while others started in the back office. Some TMSs reflect the needs of the customer segment for whom they were first developed. Knowing this can help in understanding the system better.</p>
<h3 id=""bpr-or-customise"">BPR or customise?</h3>
<p>Implementing a TMS can at one extreme be an exercise in business process reengineering (BPR) or at the other extreme it can be an exercise in software customisation.</p>
<p>The BPR scenario is that the buyer adapts its processes to the functionality of the TMS. The epitome of this school of thought is the view that SAP reflects process best practice, so it is better to adapt your processes to SAP rather than adapt SAP to your processes (In any case, you need very deep pockets for the latter!).</p>
<p>The customise scenario is that the buyer pays to have the software customised to fit exactly to existing processes. This sounds attractive but initial customisation is always expensive and often disappointing; then you are left with a maintenance nightmare – I know companies who run ten year old versions of their TMS because upgrading the TMS – and the customisations – is just too frightening.</p>
<p>Treasurers moving from Excel spreadsheet and paper treasury to their first TMS will probably benefit from taking the BPR approach. You do not want to replicate inefficient and dangerous manual processes into your new TMS, and you likely have little experience of the automated and straight through processing (STP) world of TMS.</p>
<p>Most treasurers will have something in between. So how do you decide which processes can be reengineered and which are immutable? One rule of thumb is to map the requirements in terms of external processes in your business. The logic here is that, as treasurer, you can easily change internal processes within treasury; but you may struggle to change wider order-to cash (O2C) and procure to pay (P2P) processes across your company. (This does depend of course on the remit of treasury, and whether the TMS is pure treasury or a CFO level decision.)</p>
<p>For this analysis, I would include external financial and market interfaces as being open to reengineering. For example, if the TMS has SWIFT connectivity built in, treasury can choose to go multi-bank without disrupting the rest of the company, likewise for eFX and confirmation platforms and market data feeds. Regulatory constraints may create exceptions – for example, Chinese multinationals will require regulatory compliance and appropriate market practice from their TMS.</p>

<p>The simplest way to describe immutable processes is to start with the inputs and outputs and then add the actions that have to happen within treasury in minimal terms. Do not forget to include your internal control requirements – if your company likes to have eight eyes reviewing FX exposures before hedging, then a TMS that only handles four eyes will not work for you.

<p>Notice what is not covered in this description:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We do not describe processes within treasury because we are willing and able to change them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not provide samples of the Excel sheets we currently use (because we want to free ourselves from spreadsheet purgatory).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not describe our current insanity of calling banks by phone to ask prices (because we are open to eFX as an escape from operational risk and ‘rip-off’ phone pricing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not provide samples of the FX confirmations that we currently type up manually in Word and fax to banks (because we are open to the joys of electronic confirmation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This rigour is especially important when you are migrating from manual/Excel to TMS, because you simply do not know what TMS can do, so it makes much more sense to ask the vendors to show you. Even if you are moving from an existing TMS, you do not know what your new solution might offer so it is best to describe requirements as openly as possible – firstly you will learn more and secondly you will be better able to differentiate between the TMSs.</p>
<h3 id=""demonstrations"">Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Once you have described your immutable processes, select the ones that are the least ordinary and ask you vendors to demonstrate how they will cover your needs in their TMS. Since a live demonstration of an unusual process may be a lot of work for the vendor to set up, select only the processes that are most unusual and critical for you.</p>
<p>The demonstration can really set vendors apart. The worst ones will try to get away with demonstration by PowerPoint, which is not a demonstration at all – it is more like promises which may or may not be fulfilled, and at what cost.</p>
<p>The better ones will demonstrate the functionality you need on their live TMS. This should highlight any gaps and allow you to realistically assess the TMS’ suitability to your organisation.</p>
<p>There will also be differentiation between the live demonstrations. Some may stick to the minimal requested functionality. This has the merit of keeping the demonstration simple. Others may try to share what they observe as best practice. This can be a benefit, especially for treasury organisations moving from Excel to TMS.</p>
<h3 id=""putting-it-all-together"">Putting it all together</h3>
<p>The techniques I have described are not used in isolation. What works well is a two-phase approach. Start with an RFI (request for information) exercise based on requirements lists. Invite the vendors who seem to meet your requirements to give a generic demo which gives you a chance to see the system and ask follow up questions.</p>
<p>On the basis of the RFI results, you will be able to shortlist the vendors who appear to best meet your basic requirements. ‘Scanning’ an extensive part of the TMS market; but to not waste your own, nor the vendors’ time.</p>
<p>With the shortlisted vendors, you share the immutable process descriptions described above and ask them to demonstrate how they can cover your needs with their TMS. You can evaluate whether they cover your needs and also how much added-value their TMS brings to the process for you.</p>

eBAM: the journey continues,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Bank account management – the opening, closing and updating of accounts and their signatories – is not the most exciting task for a treasurer. It is a very manual, heavily paper-based, time-consuming task, and one often fraught with error.</p>
<p>Cash visibility has also historically been a challenge for corporates due to the paper-based processes involved. “Accessing timely information about accounts from different banking partners across the globe is a daunting task. There is a lot of work required from both the corporate and the bank to obtain this information,” explains Manoj Dugar, Product Head, Core Cash, Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan. As such, the information that corporates hold about their accounts is often not real-time.</p>
<p>Aside from the governance and audit challenges that having such little visibility presents, the lack of true information can also present a wave of control issues which can have more dire consequences. “Not having up-to-date information means that you don’t know who can access the accounts,” says Marcus Hughes, Business Development Director at Bottomline Technologies. “Despite internal controls, in a worst case scenario it is conceivable that an organisation will fail to inform a bank that a signatory on an account has left the organisation, meaning the ex-employee, should they wish, could fraudulently access the account and transfer the funds.”</p>
<p>Electronic bank account management (eBAM) looks to solve these challenges and mitigate the risks around bank account management by automating the process and improving visibility and control.</p>
<p>So what exactly is it? Well, there are mixed views on what truly constitutes eBAM, but fundamentally, eBAM is a simple concept. True eBAM looks to allow corporates and banks to fully automate the account management process, end-to-end, using a set of industry-standard messaging formats; a secure electronic platform that can provide access to online forms (that can be pre-populated) and provide the necessary information around the account management process. In addition, eBAM is intended to create an electronic work flow ensuring process efficiency which, as the information is collected, a real-time electronic database containing information about these accounts is created and maintained within the platform.</p>
<h3 id=""the-holy-grail"">The Holy Grail</h3>
<p>Seven years on from the first eBAM breakthrough, and the development of the eBAM standard message formats in 2010, the landscape looks very different to how many expected. “There has been and there continue to be two streams of eBAM – the bank-led portals and the SWIFT-led portals,” says J.P. Morgan’s Dugar. Corporates with a select number of banks are therefore able to access some single-bank eBAM functionality, but the Holy Grail of true end-to-end eBAM remains out of reach. The question is why?</p>
<p>According to Bob Stark, Vice President Strategy at technology vendor Kyriba, “although multi-bank functionality is often reported as a stumbling block, banks are actually well versed in multi-bank technology – multi-bank reporting and the ISO XML bank-agnostic payment files are just two examples,” – so this should not be seen as a major eBAM hurdle.” Technology vendors are also up to speed in this area and the job for them is fairly simple. “For TMS suppliers like ourselves we just have to ensure that we produce and communicate the prescribed messages on behalf of our clients,” he says. “The communication flowing both ways with the banks are simple.”</p>
<p>The real challenge, says Stark is that “the banks are currently trying to understand and decide how these messages are going to replace the complex legacy documentary process which they have in place. Many actions are triggered when an eBAM message is received. It is not just a case of receiving electronic messages rather than paper-based ones.”</p>
<h3 id=""on-the-same-page"">On the same page?</h3>
<p>Damian Macinante, Citi’s Asia Pacific Public Sector and Non-Bank Financial Institutions Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, goes one step further in his appraisal of the current state of play. “It is one thing to have a harmonised solution from a client-facing perspective, but a large degree of the benefits that derive from eBAM come from what the bank does with the information once it arrives,” he says. The promise of the solution is not only to automate for corporates but also banks. “Due to this, it will take time for all the participants involved in delivering multi-bank eBAM to develop a harmonised solution because of the disparate data flows in each system.”</p>
<p>Although the delays have been frustrating for the corporate community, Stark preaches patience. “The project and the banks shouldn’t be seen as moving slowly,” he says. “They are just working through the process.” The responsibility on the banks’ side to ensure that everything works is cited as a key reason for the time being taken. “It is like an iceberg; the simple stuff is what we see above the water, but the dangerous stuff – and what is taking the time to ensure that it is done right – is below the surface and out of the public eye.”</p>
<h3 id=""unique-challenges-to-asia"">Unique challenges to Asia</h3>
<p>Despite the delays, corporates are still asking for the product. In Asia Pacific, a region which Treasury Today’s Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Studies have previously shown to have less interest in the product than Western Europe and the US, demand is starting to appear. “In nearly all of my meetings with clients there is a conversation around eBAM,” says J.P. Morgan’s Dugar. “Asian corporates are keen to leverage an eBAM platform and want to see it taking hold in the region much more quickly.” However, the region amplifies many of the challenges which surround the eBAM initiative.</p>
<p>Digital signatures are a key pillar of eBAM and these have caused a legal headache in a number of countries worldwide. In Asia Pacific in particular these pose a major stumbling block. “Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia accept digital signatures in some format, but if we start to look at other countries in the region, it is still something that the regulators need to accept as an alternative to wet signatures,” says Citi’s Macinante. “Currently there is a lack of legal precedent so from this perspective the regulators are still trying to understand the implications.”</p>
<p>Stark believes that as eBAM develops there may need to be a pragmatic approach from corporates. “The regulatory challenge in Asia Pacific is a big one. I can certainly foresee corporates rolling out the solution in full across most of the region, and then countries, such as China, having to use a limited instance.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s Dugar is also optimistic. “For eBAM to fully work corporates need to centralise; the banks and industry players need to establish best practice; and standards and regulatory barriers such as the lack of acceptance of digital signatures need to be removed. All of these are moving in the right direction – it is just the timing and scale which is yet to be determined.”</p>
<p>However, Bottomline’s Hughes echoes Bishop’s point that many corporates worldwide and in Asia have other priorities besides eBAM. “It has great potential and corporates want the solution but it is not top of their priority list,” he says. “We still find the main focus is on cash visibility and cash concentration as well as efficient working capital management, so these are being actioned on, not eBAM.”</p>
<p>A lack of enthusiasm for local banks to adopt the product is a final challenge in the region. “When implementing the solution, it is desirable for a treasury to obtain 100% coverage over their accounts,” Jarno Timmerman, Head of Treasury South East Asia Pacific, AkzoNobel, told Treasury Today Asia earlier this year. “Many regional banks do not yet support SWIFT connectivity, so therefore if a corporate has accounts with these banks only part of the standardisation and improved straight-through processing that eBAM delivers will be able to be achieved.”</p>
<h3 id=""driving-forward"">Driving forward</h3>
<p>With eBAM moving at a glacial pace on the surface, many treasurers are asking not only when true eBAM will become a reality, but also whether it will at all. The good news is that a number of factors appear to be driving the initiative forward.</p>
<p>The banks have a large role to play in the development of eBAM, not only in ensuring that they can accept and act on eBAM messages but also in encouraging the regulators to accept the necessary technology – such as digital signatures. “The regulatory environment won’t evolve itself,” says Citi’s Macinante.</p>
<p>He also says that the education element is vital, especially in Asia Pacific, not just for the regulators but for the local banks and corporates. “Although we are seeing demand for this service in the region, this is primarily from multinationals who are pushing it through their internal structure,” he says. “Many local corporates are very comfortable using paper-based products so moving away from these is going to be a big change. Only with greater exposure and education will they become more comfortable with the technology, its security and benefits. There is certainly a mind-set change that needs to happen in the region overall.”</p>
<p>The push towards treasury centralisation may be another driver in the region. “To obtain full value from eBAM corporates need to centralise their treasury structure,” says Dugar. “Many multinationals and large local corporates have adopted this structure and we see a trend developing across the region. The drive towards centralisation in the region may therefore be an enabler for corporates to leverage the product and bolster demand.”</p>
<p>A final driver towards true eBAM is the adoption of the product by local banks in the region. As Timmerman mentioned, currently there is little interest from local banks in adopting the technology. But Stark expects this to evolve over time. “Corporates may be unwilling going forward to do business with those banks who don’t offer eBAM. Therefore we may see a follow-the-leader mentality in the region as the product develops and becomes more established.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-next-chapter"">The next chapter</h3>
<p>In some respects the future is already here as some banks do offer corporates a form of eBAM. However, the product which corporates and banks are looking for, true multi-bank eBAM, remains some way off. “We will get there,” prophesises Stark. “eBAM has a bright future, the questions remain around the timing. In my opinion it will be sooner rather than later, as the banking community is making lots of progress with their work in the background.”</p>
<p>Looking specifically at Asia, Hughes believes that the project might take more time. “The US and Europe will be quickest to adopt eBAM as they have more centralised treasury structures, greater corporate usage of SWIFT, and an easier regulatory environment for adoption. There are many more hurdles to jump, so the ability to deploy true multi-bank eBAM may remain some way off in the region.”</p>

<h3>Gazprom Marketing and Trading: eBAM in practice</h3>

<p>With eight different banking relationships and 140 accounts globally, the bank account management process at Gazprom Marketing and Trading (GM&amp;T) is complex. “Historically, we used SAP and spreadsheets to manage this process,” says Andrew Bishop, Head of Cash Management at Gazprom Marketing &amp; Trading. “In order to achieve greater control and visibility of our account status, we wished to move away from a spreadsheet solution as eBAM gave us greater systemic control.”</p>
<p>Ninety percent of GM&amp;T’s accounts are with its main cash management banks, who are also one of the pioneers of the eBAM initiative. “We engaged with our bank to see what the solutions current status was and what it could offer us,” says Bishop. “The bank was honest in saying the product wasn’t yet complete but GM&amp;T saw the value and decided to implement the solution.” At this stage it became clear that there was work to be done in order to have a truly single multi-bank solution.</p>
<p>“We could only use the eBAM solution with that one bank and although this helps, our preference was and remains to have a multi-bank solution,” says Bishop. Through discussions with various industry players Bishop realised that the lack of a bank agnostic solution isn’t necessarily the fault of the banks. “It is a wider community issue. Different players would say that they are ready, but in reality there are many different issues being ironed out across the board,” he says. “As a corporate with different bank relationships, a single multi-bank solution is what is needed.”</p>
<h4 id=""challenges-of-ebam"">Challenges of eBAM</h4>
<p>GM&amp;T is now live with a proprietary eBAM solution, although Bishop says that implementing this wasn’t an easy task. “The bank required us to authenticate any requests using a digital certificate sent from a designated authoriser. This is great in principle but the technicality of implementing this software was problematic due to the different settings required on the user’s computer.” For Bishop, a simple software package that corporates could download to use eBAM would be an improvement. “The current process required a lot of interfacing and effort from both our IT and the banks and this was not ideal.”</p>
<p>A further challenge GM&amp;T encountered surrounded the regulations in certain countries. “In Singapore, for example, we have a selection of accounts,” explains Bishop. “Although we have eBAM rolled out in Singapore, the regulations still require that the execution of any instruction to the bank is paper-based.” Despite this, an electronic database is still maintained by the bank for GM&amp;T which is update manually form the paper instructions. “Once you dig down, the full service eBAM which is offered in countries like the UK just isn’t available in Asia yet. This is against the principle of being able to electronically communicate with banks – all the risk that is present with using paper is still present, and work needs to be done to overcome this challenge.”</p>
<h4 id=""best-practice"">Best practice</h4>
<p>“The current product that we have in place is simple, but it is an improvement on our previous bank account management process with additional control and reporting capabilities,” says Bishop. “From our experience, it’s worthwhile considering all of the pros and cons of embarking on the current eBAM offering and ensuring that you are clear in terms of the global solution offering. By assisting our partner banks, I’m sure the regulatory challenges in Singapore can be overcome.”</p>
<p>“I think multi-bank eBAM will happen eventually; we have seen similar examples before such as electronic payments,” says Bishop. “But with everything else that the industry is contending with at the moment it is just a matter of priority. We are close – eBAM just needs somebody to take hold of it and push it over the line.”</p>

<h5 id=""martin-bellin"">Martin Bellin, Managing Director, BELLIN:</h5>
<p>If we turn the clock back ten years or so, traditional treasury functions typically operated with a standard approach: centralising everything at their headquarters and forcing subsidiaries to provide Excel-based reports. But it was gradually becoming obvious to more and more corporates that the centralised approach was no longer serving companies as well as they would have hoped. A new way of thinking – a new concept – was required.</p>
<p>At BELLIN, we call this concept ‘Load Balanced Treasury’. It is built on the idea that a central treasury application is provided to all group companies to support their local day-to-day work in the best possible way. The benefit is that both account statements and payments can be automatically uploaded into the system at the local level, allowing for all subsidiaries to have access to data in real-time. The results are tremendous. The platform contains complete, real-time data, important in running all global treasury operations. Furthermore, hedging and funding and an optimised distribution of cash have become much easier.</p>
<p>The implementation of the ‘Load Balanced Treasury’ concept does require certain technology, however. Only full web-based systems can serve this purpose well. It does not matter whether they are cloud-based or installed at any of the company’s data centres, but it matters a great deal that the chosen system can be provided on any device. It must be available on desktop computers, laptops and all kinds of handheld devices or smartphones without installation. Only then can the group companies and distributed users in different divisions all over the world start using the application simultaneously. The result is the availability of real-time information to the central treasury at any time.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s initiative to modify Alliance Lite2 for use in hosted- or cloud-based business applications has been a significant boost to this new model. Circa 30 different companies have already signed up for BELLIN’s SWIFT service – which embraces Lite2 – in order to reduce the amount of work in data collection and to optimise the concept of ‘Load Balanced Treasury’. This clearly illustrates how important changes in technology are to the treasury’s ability to collect up-to-date, accurate data.</p>
<p>And as technology continues to develop, the TMS landscape will be very different in five years’ time compared with today’s standard set-up. The secret is to embrace change, not fight it.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Markus Hofstaetter"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/11/2014-11and12-tt-02-qa-markus-hofstaetter-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""markus-hofstaetter"">Markus Hofstaetter, Senior Manager, Financial Management, Head of Treasury Services, KPMG:</h5>
<p>Today, treasury performance is not only judged on managing complex cash and liquidity processes, financing, and financial risks, successfully and in an efficient manner. Treasurers are also judged on the accuracy, speed, consequence and accessibility of their reporting.</p>
<p>Due to the trend towards enhanced centralisation and automation in treasury over the last few years, treasury-related know-how, significant financial processes (and thus data) have been pooled in centralised treasury functions with the help of professional treasury management systems (TMS). By doing so, financial control, transparency and efficiency have increased significantly, relieving operational business units from many treasury-related activities. At the same time, this has also enlarged the demand to act as an internal business partner and information provider – not just a data provider.</p>
<p>Access to such information places treasurers in the privileged position of having both control of the information with the unique bigger picture view, and the empowerment to act on it internally and externally. A group-wide view over cash positions, liquidity forecasts, debt service schedules, payments, financial risk exposures, hedging positions, risk simulations and treasury accounting are just a few of the key topics a treasurer should centrally manage and report on.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of the required information can be derived from a modern TMS – and this should therefore qualify as the ultimate reporting and analysis tool, even for smaller treasury units using SaaS-versions. However, reporting is still a critical element for all systems, from entry to high-end solutions, as system standard reports rarely meet the treasurer’s requirements beyond transactional information and thus, have to be tailored to a treasurer’s needs. This causes either high costs for system design and implementation, or ends up in a high manual workload for multi-tabbed Excel-spreadsheets and slide decks. Hence, more and more external solutions are being selected to transform big data volumes into valuable information and reports. The range of applied solutions varies from huge data warehouse solutions (SAP etc.) to lean, flexible and easy-to-use reporting tools (eg Qlikview) that are also available on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Nowadays, modern treasury IT strategies do not merely strive for straight through processing or homogeneous system landscapes, but also consider added-value through sophisticated and flexible reporting facilities (and therefore accept a certain amount of heterogeneity). Professional and automated interface management, high bandwidth for big data traffic volumes, cheap hardware, virtual server landscapes and sophisticated business continuity management approaches for critical processes allow heterogeneous system combinations. However, these new capabilities have not been integrated systematically in all treasuries and finance functions.</p>
<p>Leading treasurers are increasingly expected to be as much information dealers as idea lobbyists and strategic finance consultants to their CFOs and CEOs. They therefore need to advise the C-suite based on reliable information, which requires sophisticated reporting, presented in a comprehensive manner and available immediately upon request. This is very much the road we see modern treasury systems going down.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Elaine N. Filus"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/11/2014-11and12-tt-02-qa-elaine-filus-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""elaine-n-filus"">Elaine N. Filus, CTP, Principal, Treasury Strategies:</h5>
<p>The statement that information is key for the treasury function is certainly correct. Currently, our clients are placing a high priority on having 100% global cash visibility on a daily basis. This information is becoming increasingly important as corporations place a high priority on counterparty risk management and controls over cash assets. With this information a treasurer has full knowledge of worldwide exposures. From there, they are in a strong position to build risk and liquidity management strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>Tools such as ERP’s and TMS’s are being used more and more to automatically consolidate bank data in one place and massage it into something tangible that can be used by the business. Traditionally, a corporate would have to gather information from each bank individually and manually consolidate that information across banks, so this is a great improvement. Also, SWIFT for Corporates has had a big impact in recent times. The service that SWIFT provides has made it much easier for corporates to gather bank information from multiple banks globally, significantly improving the availability of information.</p>
<p>Despite the advent of this technology there are still many corporates that rely on traditional bank online platforms and Excel to collate and manage information. When it comes to managing the information, I have seen some fantastic spreadsheets that can do everything the corporate requires. However, there remains a large degree of inefficiency and risk in managing information this way; especially as the data becomes greater and the spreadsheets more complex. This approach can be very time consuming and there is significant risk of data entry errors, corrupted formulas, and broken links in the worksheet.</p>
<p>The rise of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is breaking down the barriers to entry for smaller corporates, by minimising the cost of an automated solution, and more companies are beginning to reap the rewards of using a TMS.</p>
<p>A challenge that comes with increasingly better technology, although a welcome one, is knowing how to fully leverage the new information that is available to best add value to the corporation. In the last few years, both ERP providers and off-the-shelf TMS providers have been working on developing more robust functionality that automatically pulls in simple bank data, and then transforms it into business intelligence. This can benefit the treasurer in areas such as risk management, bank relationship management, FX exposure management and others.</p>
<p>The presentation of this business intelligence to senior management is also important. The technology providers have, therefore, been working on developing dashboards that summarise key performance indicators, such as cash balances, total liquidity and FX exposures, down to the fundamental level and present this on one page, providing tangible business information that is clear and concise.</p>
<p>Even with these technological advancements, and the ability to manage vast amounts of data and present it concisely, the treasurer still has a key role in providing colour commentary and wisdom. We are seeing from conversations with our clients that this is something treasury is spending increasingly more time doing – not only reporting on the present for senior management, but also forecasting the future, and devising strategies to add value. There is currently no technology that can achieve this better than a skilled corporate treasurer.</p>

Not just any portal in a storm,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Money market funds (MMFs) are gaining ground in the short-term space as bank deposits typically remain low or zero yield. The method of accessing funds is changing to meet investor needs and the online multi-bank portal is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition for busy treasurers. The third annual cash management study issued at the end of 2013 by technology vendor, SunGard, collated the responses of 160 corporates globally and found a reduction in the use of telephone transactions for short-term investments from 51% in 2012 to 30% in 2013, in favour of web-based portals.</p>
<p>The attractions of largely automated trading platforms are many, not least being that some also enable other products to be traded too (such as short-duration bonds, separately managed accounts and certificates of deposit). In the MMF space, in addition to the facilitation of trade and settlement across multiple funds and providers, portals typically offer a range of pre- and post-trade services including market intelligence, consolidated reporting, trading access and authorisation, limit setting, position and risk analysis (from counterparty to country risk). By providing market and counterparty intelligence, trading and monitoring all under one roof, treasurers seemingly have access to a one-stop MMF shop. But are all portals created equal?</p>
<h3 id=""portal-differences"">Portal differences</h3>
<p>Multi-fund MMF portals may be offered either by international banks such as Citi and BNY Mellon or by independent providers such as MyTreasury, ICD and SunGard. This is the first great divide – and users seem to be swinging slowly towards the independents, having favoured bank platforms since they first arrived a decade or so ago. Of those that now use portals, the number of treasurers working with independent providers over proprietary bank offerings is rising, according to the SunGard survey. It shows that 35% of all portal users now prefer the independent option, an increase of 15% over the previous year.</p>
<p>Independent providers will always argue that they are cheaper for investors to use but banks will often bundle together their offering with other services such as custody, cash sweeping or asset management, which can create certain operational efficiencies. Whilst this tends to make the true cost of the portal easier to absorb, the flipside is that actual cost is less easy to discern.</p>
<p>The range of fund participation in a bank portal may be limited compared to an independent. This may influence a treasurer’s decision where there is a need for portfolio diversification, although a portfolio of around five to ten is typically used. Banks often have distribution agreements with their fund participants which may be seen as encouraging partiality where advice is offered. Of the independents, ICD and SunGard are permitted to offer investment advice, and are thus regulated, whereas MyTreasury is concerned mainly with (and therefore earns its keep through) transaction processing and execution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Independent providers will always argue that they are cheaper for investors to use but banks will often bundle together their offering with other services such as custody, cash sweeping or asset management, which can create certain operational efficiencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Banks typically offer ‘omnibus’ trading portals, which means the provider will set up and manage accounts on behalf of its users allowing trading and settlement (through a central clearing agent) to take place en masse and anonymously. As independent portal providers, both SunGard and MyTreasury offer ‘fully-disclosed’ direct trading platforms, which allow treasurers to trade directly with each fund on the platform – their independent competitor, ICD, provides a mix of direct, clearing bank facilitated and omnibus trading which clients can use in combination.</p>
<p>With direct trading systems the fund provider knows who its client is. For treasurers, maintaining visibility of ‘share of the wallet’ may be important. For other traders, particularly hedge funds, anonymity may be preferred. If using a bank portal, it may be perceived by other institutions on the treasury’s bank panel as giving that bank preferential treatment; conversely it may be the intention to overtly give that bank the business.</p>
<p>Broadly, the omnibus model offers simplicity and ease of use but trading authority is given away with an omnibus account. Direct trading is more transparent and controllable. The investor opens one account with the portal provider and the portal provider opens an undisclosed account with all of the funds, doing all the admin such as account opening and settlement on the investor’s behalf. Fund providers do not have access to their investors. A disclosed nominee account may be opened in the investor’s name, but this account is still owned by the portal provider. If something happens to the portal provider or an intermediary, such as a clearer, if the client is an undisclosed nominee its anonymity means it will not be able to approach the fund providers; as a disclosed nominee the issue remains that the trading account actually belongs to the portal provider and unless the client is a signatory on that account, return of funds is unlikely until the problem has been resolved. Most omnibus portal users do not have delegated trading authority on their own accounts.</p>
<h3 id=""background-movements"">Background movements</h3>
<p>At the front end, the look and feel of portals will be quite similar; the difference is all in the set-up where, depending on which portal is being used, trades may be routed through a clearing partner or direct to the fund provider.</p>
<p>Background processes such as clearing and settlement vary according to portal type. Omnibus platforms may offer auto-settlement or direct settlement. Auto-settlement platforms do away with manual processing and payment and settlement requests. Automation will make all the trades across all accounts for the client and will net off all investments and redemptions before calculating what is owed. This does present an element of risk; whilst the money is in transit, if the clearing bank being used by the portal to facilitate the movement gets into financial trouble then the investor’s payment will be locked into the system until such time as the clearer emerges from administration. Bear Stearns was such a clearer, rescued by J.P. Morgan. Auto-settlement is now optional rather than mandatory for most providers.</p>
<p>An alternative omnibus model will execute trades for the client, the client settling directly with each fund, going through the normal payment process for the business as if it was trading outside of the platform. Reference to direct trading on an omnibus account does not mean trading directly with the fund; it refers only to the settlement process. Settlement through a fully direct trading portal typically uses the same direct settlement process as for omnibus although MyTreasury offers an auto-settlement feature developed with Honeywell (<a href=""#case-study"">see case study below</a>).</p>

<h2 id=""case-study"">Case study</h2>
<img alt=""Honeywell"" class=""logo"" height=""17"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/honeywell-red-logo-2013-90x17.png"" width=""90""/>
<p class=""company-info"">Honeywell is a US-based Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing business which in 2013 reported global sales of $39.1 billion. Globally, Honeywell manages over $7 billion of cash and investments and a component of that is invested in MMFs. All MMF trades in EMEA and APAC today are executed and managed using the MyTreasury MMF portal.</p>
<p>The in-house bank which centralises the cash and provides funding to the affiliates is located in Belgium and overseen by the firm’s Director of Treasury, EMEA, Séverine Le Blévennec. In 2009, when a European regulatory shift ended the in-house bank’s Coordination Centre status, investment in MMFs became possible. With the cash balance notably increasing and the “investible universe of banks” decreasing, it led directly to the implementation of ICAP’s MyTreasury MMF portal. Although Honeywell’s treasury team had been part of a panel of investors that two years prior helped the vendor develop its platform, it still made market comparisons before selecting.</p>
<p>The set-up and integration of the portal was a fairly straightforward process, says Le Blévennec. The project started with the in-house bank and then rolled out to the UK before taking in the Asian markets. Honeywell sent documents to its existing fund providers explaining that beyond a specified date it would only be dealing through the portal. Where existing funds were not already on the platform the invitation was extended to join it, Honeywell having insisted that if the fund was not on the platform it would not deal with it at all. Only one agent (not the fund itself) declined the offer. For those that did, the terms and conditions of trading remain the same or better, she reports.</p>
<p>Le Blévennec notes too that the visibility and transparency that the platform provides over management fees has enabled her to negotiate rebates with various fund managers; in total it has amounted to a return of around $1m, although the low rate environment has seen some euro funds subsequently cancel their rebates.</p>
<p>One of the key features of MyTreasury for Le Blévennec is its workflow system and ability to set up investment limits in the system. This means there is no need to monitor sub-limits of certain funds. “The platform gives us a view of the aggregate position of all money invested in the same fund. We can set limits and if a new deal would breach one of them, the system sends a warning message. A further control sends an e-mail message in case post trading, the fund AUM decreases causing us to be in breach.”</p>
<p>Honeywell helped MyTreasury develop a feature for reporting underlying exposures, aggregated across all of its funds on the system. This is downloaded as an Excel workbook enabling, for example, a view of the exposure to a specific institution or country across all 68 accounts. Given the volatility of some markets this is a welcome insight. “We could not have done it manually. With this function, if I have any doubts I can download the data and quickly take a decision to rebalance my funds.”</p>
<p>Today, the Group invests in six of the main currencies and has in the region of 40 active funds globally across the 68 accounts (different investors in the group can invest in the same fund). The only countries where Honeywell invests in MMF and where the MyTreasury system is not available yet are China, India and Japan, although the latter is in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Following geographical extension of the system’s use Honeywell worked on portal integration with its SunGard Quantum TMS. This has enabled a high degree of straight through processing, with all transactions being entered automatically for exposure management and settlement for the in-house bank. The interface to the TMS was also further developed to automate the booking of dividend (or rebate) distribution as well as day-to-day accruals on outstanding funds. MyTreasury has also developed an auto-settlement process for Honeywell where each trade automatically generates a SWIFT MT101 payment instruction.</p>
<p>For any treasurer considering using an MMF portal, Le Blévennec advises close inspection of the potential for platform customisation, particularly for reporting. Platform scalability is also important, as is user-friendliness and the ease of integration with existing technology. “I would also ask for references from a number of customers with a similar or more complex business profile who have been using the system extensively.” As a final point she expresses the need for a pro-active and open approach from the provider. “It is easy to deliver a platform where you just execute deals, but the devil is in the detail; when it starts to get more complex you will start to see the difference.”</p>

<h3 id=""added-value"">Added-value</h3>
<p>By building in compliance features such as trader limits, counterparty limits and maximum holdings, for example, a portal can automatically monitor every transaction. Electronic portals consolidate huge amounts of investment data and so reporting functions have notably improved in the past few years. ICD’s offering, for example, allows users to import external investments (such as bank and time deposits) into its exposure analytics component to give a broad picture.</p>
<p>In addition to consolidated views of exposures, counterparty, currency and liquidity positions, a host of management information may be made available to users, depending upon the provider. These tools may show levels of activity and risk by country, asset type, maturity and so on and may be used to inform asset allocation. Market research, intelligence (including counterparty metrics such as stock price trends, CDS spreads and capital adequacy ratios), market price and news feeds are also typically delivered.</p>
<h3 id=""cost"">Cost</h3>
<p>The explicit cost of using a portal as an investor is zero because the cost of providing a portal is borne by the fund providers. However, for an investor it is important to ask each fund it is already using – or intends to use – whether trading on a portal will alter its terms of trade compared to direct trade. Some funds operate a ‘portal’ share class, using this to effectively charge investors as an offset against the fees it pays to the portal provider.</p>
<h3 id=""the-valuation-debate"">The valuation debate</h3>
<p>The ongoing discussion about MMF valuations, systemic risk and the various proposals for reform put forward by the EC and, in the US, the SEC, will have some impact on the way in which portals operate. The key requirement, if the shift is made to floating Net Asset Value (VNAV) funds will be how the portal provider will get information from the fund transfer agents in a timely manner. The agent, usually a bank, looks after records of investors, account balances and transactions and will provide the actual share price required for daily valuation. With constant NAV (CNAV), investors know the value is ‘one’ (dollar/pound/euro) and for accounting purposes this makes life relatively easy. VNAV brings uncertainty to valuation. On a daily basis portal providers will have to get the price in good time. It may be that cut-off times for investment may have to be brought forward, which for investors is going in the wrong direction. The decision is yet to be made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The explicit cost of using a portal as an investor is zero because the cost of providing a portal is borne by the fund providers. However, for an investor it is important to ask each fund it is already using – or intends to use – whether trading on a portal will alter its terms of trade compared to direct trade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if floating NAV is the way forward, the focus by almost all portals on prime institutional AAA-rated CNAV funds is unlikely to shift by any great magnitude (assuming the regulators’ proposal to abandon fund ratings is dropped). However, whilst treasurers will not necessarily want to have to seek permission to invest in new funds, if the reforms are accepted some portals may open up to a broader range of fund-types, even exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p>Firstly, this will require significant technological development on the part of the portal providers to accommodate the different fund processing models. And secondly, it would change the risk profile of MMFs. CNAV funds are sold on the back of their perceived robustness but when the US-based Reserve Primary Fund ‘broke the buck’ back in 2008, it cast a long shadow over CNAV money markets everywhere. The SEC stepped in with Rule 2a-7 requiring MMFs to restrict their underlying holdings’ average dollar-weighted portfolio maturity to 60 days or less, and for credit ratings no more than 3% of assets must be in securities falling below the top two ratings. If the sanctity of MMF fund robustness is to be maintained, for all the discussion it may just be business as usual for most providers.</p>
<h3 id=""integration"">Integration</h3>
<p>Treasurers are now able to source market, trade and position data, with most platforms at least offering market views, size of funds, current and historical yield, portfolio information and analytics, and account balances. The discussion about which data is required, when and in which format, should be ongoing and reflective of the changing needs of treasurers and the need to integrate data with existing treasury systems. The closer the integration the more likely straight through processing can be achieved, eliminating the need to re-key daily rate and trade confirmations, for example.</p>

eBAM: another year on,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The treasurer’s responsibilities have broadened considerably in the wake of the financial crisis. But while many traditional treasury duties have increased in relative importance, recent advancements in technology have automated much of the work, freeing up more time for the treasurer to provide strategic insight to other executives within business, in particular the CFO.</p>
<p>There is one area which remains an exception. Despite strong demand for an electronic solution, the administration of corporate bank accounts has remained rooted in manual, paper-based procedures.</p>
<h3 id=""cutting-out-the-paperwork"">Cutting out the paperwork</h3>
<p>At present, many of the routine processes treasurers undertake – the opening, closing and managing of global bank accounts – involve much manual input. It can be time-consuming, labour intensive and, above all, inefficient. Documents are printed, signed, scanned, mailed and filed, before being double-checked for accuracy on a separate data-tracking sheet. Then the process begins all over again for a different account in another jurisdiction, governed by different laws and regulations. “We seem to be doing the same things over and over,” says Jackie White, EMEA Banking Manager at Xerox. Indeed, it must feel a little like the labour of Sisyphus.</p>
<h3 id=""is-there-another-way"">Is there another way?</h3>
<p>At present its availability is limited, but electronic bank account management (eBAM) promises to revolutionise these processes by allowing them to be carried out electronically in the future. It has not, however, caught on as quickly as some corporates would like. Treasury Today’s annual benchmarking studies revealed that in 2012 in both Europe and North America corporates using the technology remain a small minority, 11% and 15% respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at the recent EuroFinance conference in Barcelona, the ‘Treasury Verdict’ polling session found that 18% of respondents were already using eBAM. Almost a quarter (24%) reported that they wanted eBAM, but weren’t being offered it by their banks, while 28% said that they wanted it but the current options don’t satisfy their needs. 30% on the other hand, stated that they didn’t need it.</p>
<p>Patricia Greenfield, Director Treasury Operations, AstraZeneca, said: “I want it and need it – it’s on the project list for 2014. We have people moving around the organisation a lot and sometimes the signatory card is not there when you need it. Therefore, it’s high up on the agenda for next year.”</p>
<p>Xerox is one of the many multinational companies (MNCs) interested in eBAM who are on the cusp of implementing a solution. In Europe, Xerox investigated SWIFT’s eBAM offering but ultimately decided that Citibank’s proprietary eBAM solution suited them better. They are Xerox’s primary cash management bank in EMEA and, given that many of the company’s accounts are with a single banking partner, using a single bank portal for eBAM was not considered to be an issue. In addition, most of the software and integration is already in place and they could be confident their signatory information is correct on the basis that they are using the bank’s database.</p>
<p>Things would have been very different using SWIFT, she explains. “If we are sending messages down a pipe which does not update at ours and the bank’s end at the same time, in the same way and with the same data, then we would all end up in a muddle. It would be like replacing one headache with another.”</p>
<p>Although White feels very positive about Citi’s eBAM solution, the company doesn’t plan to begin implementation until later in 2014. Proceeding immediately would have placed an enormous strain upon resources, she explains. It is not necessarily the software and testing that is difficult, it is the ‘housekeeping’ that needs to be done before a solution can be implemented. Signatories on a mandate have to be agreed with the bank, and with hundreds of accounts across the globe, this is an unavoidably time-consuming undertaking and one which we would be foolish to contemplate when the company, like most of its peers, is busy preparing for the 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 deadline for migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Once the dust has settled from SEPA migration, the company will truly begin its eBAM project.</p>
<h3 id=""building-an-ebam-for-everyone"">Building an eBAM for everyone</h3>
<p>If, like Xerox, your company has one main bank for cash management in a particular region and that bank offers eBAM, then electronically managing your accounts in the near future is a real possibility. However, if your company has relationships with a significant number of different banks, then the prospects are less certain. Most industry experts agree that multi-bank eBAM is something that will be the standard at some point in the future. The problem is that these experts have been predicting the same for some time now and it seems as though with each year that passes the concept is hit by another setback.</p>
<p>Last year, it seemed the final technical hurdle had been overcome when SWIFT announced it had successfully piloted a mechanism called the eBAM Central Utility (ECU). The ECU was expected to resolve the problem of the different legal and documentation requirements in place across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand why legal and documentary requirements could undermine the value that a corporate would hope to derive from a multi-bank eBAM solution. In order to open up an account with a bank in the Ukraine, for example, a corporate would need to speak to somebody in that branch, or perhaps ask a colleague in a subsidiary to speak to the branch, in order to determine the documentation requirements. This unnecessarily protracted process is then likely to be repeated the next time, when a different corporate decides to open an account at that particular branch.</p>
<p>Corporates wanted something better, and with the ECU it looked like they might get just that. To address the problem, the ECU was intended to operate as a database for storing all the necessary bank- and country-specific account information, allowing corporates to know in advance the different documents required by banks across the globe. This, it was hoped, would ensure that all messages between treasuries and banks comply with the correct rules and guidelines, thereby accelerating the flow of information.</p>
<p>Disappointingly, for some corporates, this was not to be. In October 2012, speaking exclusively to Treasury Today, SWIFT confirmed that development of the ECU had been put on ice. The problem was that for a project of this nature, SWIFT required the co-operation of a majority of the large cash management banks; outside of North America this was, for reasons that have yet to be revealed, not forthcoming.</p>
<p>Since then, SWIFT has been at pains to downplay the importance of the ECU to advancing eBAM adoption amongst corporate treasurers. Andre Casterman, Head of Corporate and Supply Chain Markets at SWIFT, does not believe that the decision to limit SWIFT’s role in the delivery of standards and the messaging for eBAM will be fatal to the development of multi-bank eBAM. Others will surely take over from where SWIFT left off. “I think that those corporates who want a multi-bank solution will be able to get that functionality from established vendors, such as SunGard, in the future,” he says.</p>
<p>Recent developments do appear to substantiate Casterman’s assertion. Weiland, now a part of Fiserv, already has one client – a large insurance company – in production with one of its banks and in test with two others. “Last year, the only companies doing eBAM were those using the single bank portals – but that’s not really what I call eBAM,” says Dan Gill, Senior Vice President of Weiland Corporate Solutions.</p>
<p>Through BAweb, the bank account management application provided by Fiserv, corporates can send and receive messages over the SWIFT network to any of the banks which are capable of sending and receiving eBAM messages. Although, Fiserv’s offering is still in the pre-production pilot stage, it does provide the clearest indication yet that multi-bank eBAM is beginning to become a reality. The only snag is that, at present, only three big US-based banks have this capability; many outside of North America have made very little progress on developing such functionality.</p>
<p>Once the remaining banks are able to offer fully developed eBAM solutions to customers, treasury management systems (TMS) vendors, such as cloud-based platform provider Kyriba, are poised for a surge in enquiries about eBAM from their corporate customers. Bob Stark, Vice President of Strategy at Kyriba, adds to Casterman’s assertions that SWIFT’s withdrawal of the ECU will not act as a damper on corporate demand once they begin to understand that multi-bank eBAM is achievable without it.</p>
<p>“As long as you have the ability to connect to all of your different banks – that is all you need,” says Stark. “The difficulty we are having at the moment is that many banks have merely been developing their own solutions and have not felt it necessary to connect to the outside world. But that is the main thing that a vendor like us is waiting on – for it to be more widely available and move beyond a pilot phase.”</p>
<h3 id=""coming-together"">Coming together</h3>
<p>Gill is also convinced that the various technicalities of eBAM have mostly been resolved. All that is left to do now, he says, is to convince more banks across the globe to come on board with the project. And to this end, he says, a lot of progress is being made.</p>
<p>Recently, the three US banks involved in the eBAM project from the start, came together with SWIFT and a selection of software vendors to form the CGI eBAM Working Group, with the objective of promoting eBAM globally and encouraging adoption across. Through this group Gill hopes that more banks will be encouraged to come on board and, once that stage has been reached, eBAM will really begin to take off.</p>
<p>“We are going to see more banks working together to drum up industry collaboration. We’ve been a big part of that and we are very supportive of it. So even though the ECU is no longer there, there is still a lot of work being done to drive eBAM forward from a collaboration perspective.</p>
<p>“It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” says Tom Durkin, Global Head of Integrated Channel Solutions, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). The cancellation of the ECU does represent a set-back for multi-bank eBAM, he says, but not one of a technological nature. The real issue was that it concerned corporates who believed that the utility was essential to the development of a multi-bank eBAM solution.</p>
<p>“We are having a lot more dialogue with corporates than we had a year ago. I think corporates are now taking a broader view of all their systems and that is slowing uptake a little. Essentially they are realising that there are many things they need to improve on before they begin to implement eBAM – their data repository, account database, signer database, etc – and so it creates a bigger project to focus on.</p>
<p>“However, I think that is appropriate,” he adds. “It is important for clients to get the foundations in line first, and that is what we have been advising our clients.”</p>
<h3 id=""2014-the-year-of-ebam"">2014: the year of eBAM?</h3>
<p>After so many false dawns, corporates might understandably feel sceptical about pronouncements heralding the imminent arrival of eBAM as a widely used, off-the-shelf solution. Nevertheless, there is a growing sense now that 2014 could be the floodgate moment. In Europe, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that the resource constraints Durkin speaks of have been exacerbated, as Xerox explained, by the looming deadline for migration to SEPA. Once the February deadline is out of the way and corporates have finally managed to put their taxing migration projects to bed, one would therefore expect interest in eBAM to begin to intensify.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the three big banks with existing eBAM solutions –</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Citi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>J.P. Morgan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>have all been ramping up their offerings.</p>
<p>As recently as October, Citi announced it has expanded its eBAM service footprint to 55 countries across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Evidently this is good news for companies such as Xerox, to whom a proprietary portal solution appeals, as these companies will now be able to bring the benefits of eBAM to a majority of their global banking customers.</p>
<p>However, as we have seen, the future prospects for multi-bank eBAM hinge on the willingness of the rest of the global banking sector join these three frontrunners in establishing the capability. Until now, many organisations have been reluctant to do so, perhaps on the basis that the technology still requires further developing.</p>
<p>Given all the previous disappointments it is still too early to declare with any confidence that 2014 will be the year eBAM arrives. But now, with all of the standards and infrastructure in place and with corporate interest stronger than ever, one could argue that the time is right for the remaining large cash management banks to begin jointly planning the transition.</p>

Deal or no deal: anatomy of an FX portal,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that the natural evolution of foreign exchange (FX) dealing has seen it move well beyond its early status as a by-product of international business and into a space where more opportunistic FX traders (such as hedge funds) work with it to make considerable profit. According to bank-owned settlement infrastructure provider, CLS, FX is now the largest financial market by value.</p>
<p>The evolution of FX as a vital part of global commerce has brought a number of complex derivatives – and matching technologies – that, whilst enabling traders to be more in control of the risk, have also attracted the attention of regulatory measures, such as the latest Dodd-Frank and Markets in Financial Instruments Direct (MiFID) requirements regarding transparency, record keeping and reporting.</p>
<p>Indeed, as regulation around financial services increases, electronic solutions appear even more attractive because they offer the kind of audit trails and reporting functionality that old-fashioned voice trading does not. Few corporates look at their treasury as a profit centre, and the precise determination of when and how they trade is often something they do collaboratively with their banks: price and convenience may be hugely important in some deals but the relationship side of FX for corporates is equally so, especially in tough economic times.</p>
<p>There are three ‘buy-side’ models. Voice trading (over the telephone) is often favoured for large or complex orders. The other two rely on web-based portals and are offered as single-bank (eg bi-lateral) or multi-bank trading variants. It is not a case of either/or, but rather of using the most appropriate tool for the circumstances.</p>
<h3 id=""e-portals-make-their-mark"">e-Portals make their mark</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, the multi-bank portal allows users to obtain a range of prices, products and services from a range of banks whereas the single-bank option delivers the same from just one bank.</p>
<p>The single-bank option was first to appear. In the early days, a request for quote (RFQ) model was used. The treasurer would log in to the bank’s website, state how much was needed of a required currency, and receive within 30 seconds or so an automated quote. Once that offer was accepted all the downstream processes, such as clearing and settlement, had to be executed offline. Continual investment by banks in their technology has today created greater levels of automation and facilitated ever-lower latency of price streaming, more akin to professional traders’ requirements, to the point where users can instantly see the depth of liquidity in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Few corporates look at their treasury as a profit centre, and the precise determination of when and how they trade is often something they do collaboratively with their banks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sophistication and capability of a system’s functionality today tends to be driven from the top downwards by the needs of the financial institution (FI) and pro-trader market, but the way in which users wish to work and interface with these systems tends to be driven from the bottom upwards by the needs of the retail market. In other words, users want a simple, intuitive interface but with all the clever behind-the-scenes trickery garnered from the top end of the market.</p>
<p>With the high levels of FX trade flow a system is required to handle, many pre and post-trade services have also been integrated with platforms to try to create as much of a straight through processing (STP) environment as possible. For corporates, trades are usually integrated up front into an order management or trade planning system and then uploaded into the FX platform before execution, with automated booking of these trades back into the treasury management system (TMS) or spreadsheet.</p>
<p>For a treasurer, the choice between single or multi-bank platform seems obvious at face value. Why wouldn’t they sign up for a multi-bank FX portal and get the lowest price at the click of button? Certainly the multi-bank portal’s arrival was seen by some observers as the death knell for single-bank platforms. But it has not been the case. Why?</p>
<p>It may be that the treasurer does not execute a sufficient number of trades to warrant subscribing to a multi-bank portal. But there may be another factor at play too. Just as retail supermarkets don’t always come out on top for customers when factors such as service, product knowledge, advice and even customer loyalty are factored in with price, so multi-bank portals may not always deliver best execution for a corporate treasurer. Another factor often considered when trading is the need to spread the share of the corporate wallet. Quid pro quo, a treasury may wish to ensure that its banks are getting a fair share of its business – even if that means a particular FX trade is executed on a non-competitive basis. The reason is simple: they may not want a certain bank – especially one with which they have a valuable line of credit – to pull the plug on the relationship because it was deemed unprofitable.</p>
<p>If one thing is certain, it is that the treasurer is yet to be presented with a one-size-fits-all FX solution and that until such a tool is made available, it is essential to understand the pros and cons of each in order to make the most appropriate choice in each situation.</p>
<h3 id=""all-change-as-multi-bank-portals-arrive"">All change as multi-bank portals arrive</h3>
<p>In the late 1990s, encouraged by the rapid uptake of the internet for business purposes (driven in part by rising consumer confidence in web-based transactional tools), players in the banking and technology communities saw a niche in the FX market. Corporate treasurers were typically engaging in multiple bilateral relationships with liquidity providers. The new connectivity technologies would enable treasurers to request and receive FX prices from multiple banks, and place orders, all in ultra-fast time, through one central platform. A number of multi-bank platforms hit the market around mid-2001.</p>
<p>For the corporate, these portals promised more than just a convenient price discovery tool. They could also deliver workflow, enabling treasurers to see all their accounts, trades and the scope of their portfolios in one place. With further integration into SWIFT (via the automated MT101 request for transfer message) and the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system, such a combination would eventually deliver post-trade services, right through to clearing and settlement. Connectivity between the front end of a TMS and corporate back office functions became a reality in October 2012 for 360T’s multi-bank FX trading platform, when it announced that Kyriba was to integrate it into its own software-as-a-service (SaaS) delivered TMS.</p>
<p>But the early rush to join the multi-bank platform race ended almost as soon as it began for some, with SunGard’s system, part of its STN Treasury unit, and Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan Chase’s Atriax failing to make the grade within a year or two of hitting the market. The (short) list of those that survived includes FXAlliance (aka FXall, a business originally owned by a consortium of 16 banks, but since July 2012 a part of Thomson Reuters), the aforementioned independent German-based global provider, 360T and the State Street-owned Currenex.</p>
<p>However, the breadth of products, currencies and liquidity providers available on each of these – and later arrivals such as Bloomberg’s FXGO – has flourished. Platforms now typically cover electronic trading across the range of instruments including spot, forward outrights, swaps, non-direct forwards (NDFs), options and deposits. All seek to add value in as much as users can access functions such as market surveillance, statistical and comparative analysis and portfolio and risk management. The number of banks available to trade with will vary by platform, but most major institutions will make themselves available in this way to their corporate clients.</p>
<p>At the technological heart of all multi-bank FX portals is the electronic communication network (ECN). For web-based FX trading, this has been around since 1999, being first offered by New York-based Matchbook FX. Multi-bank platform providers today, such as Currenex, Bloomberg, 360T, FXall and Knight Capital’s Hotspot FX, use it to stream quotes from the world’s major banks. Because ECN is a live exchange-type order book driven by spreads on all quotes, buy-side users (often FIs, but sometimes the pro-traders of MNCs) can actually move prices. Using an ECN-enabled platform means traders generally enjoy improved price transparency and faster processing than single-bank portals, whilst the highly automated process enables banks to lower their costs and widen margins.</p>
<h3 id=""multi-bank-versus-single-bank"">Multi-bank versus single-bank</h3>
<p>Why multi-bank? The multi-bank vendor argument against voice-trading is that treasurers seeking price differential this way will call their usual panel of banks for quotes, but by the time they have done the rounds the market may have moved away from them. The multi-bank portal automates the RFQ process, making it faster and more efficient. But large and complex deals may still require human interaction, this being borne out by the observation that very large trades remain resolutely voice-based.</p>
<p>The riposte to the single-bank model from a multi-bank perspective is that a major corporate is likely over time to accumulate a multitude of portals to manage. Arguably too, pricing is less favourable when there is no competition. But FX tends only to be part of a relationship and a wise bank will deliver greater benefits to the corporate that gives it a greater share of its wallet.</p>
<p>In terms of FX this may include extras such as client-specific pre and post-trade functionality. When a corporate transacts through its bank’s own platform, it may also have access to the bank’s proprietary trading algorithms and be able to automate its own trading preferences for best execution. This is a valuable selling point that has not gone unnoticed by multi-bank provider, FXall. Since mid-2012 it has been able to deliver some of these algorithms through its own platform, starting with Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. This suggests that more of a partnership exists between the three parties than had previously existed, perhaps because banks have realised that they can reach a wider corporate base if they make themselves more readily available to their clients, and platform providers know they do not have the benefits of extended corporate relationships.</p>
<p>In practice, a multi-bank portal will offer a range of execution methods. The traditional RFQ model, as discussed above, remains the dominant model. Other trading models, such as portfolio-trading (which facilitates trades across multiple allocations, currencies and forward dates) and active or direct access trading (which provides price streaming) require a higher degree of trader-sophistication, often reserved for in-house corporate traders, FIs or professional traders.</p>
<p>Most banks that have developed a one-to-one FX portal will retain it because there will always be clients that at one time or another have reason not to use a multi-bank option. There may be clients for whom the cost savings are irrelevant or are outweighed by other considerations. Indeed, if a corporate has a regular line of trade with a bank it may be that the bank’s FX portal effectively becomes a gateway to other benefits. Anecdotal evidence even suggests that some banks have been actively upping liquidity for favoured clients using their proprietary channel. Banks that have been investing in the well-being of their proprietary FX portal are effectively doing so as a means of investing in their client relationships, providing access to the whole pre-trade, trade, and post-trade value-chain (which may include underlying services such as trade finance or letters of credit (LCs) as opposed to just thinking about the narrow trading processes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The multi-bank portal automates the RFQ process, making it faster and more efficient. But large and complex deals may still require human interaction, this being borne out by the observation that very large trades remain resolutely voice-based.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For all these reasons, the advent of the multi-bank portal has not overseen the demise of the single-bank option (nor voice trading). The advantages of multi-bank portals are obvious and many corporates have adopted them with relish (one enthusiastic group treasurer told Treasury Today that on savings alone his system paid for itself in just six weeks). But banks are in a unique position of being able to steer clients towards the most appropriate solution at that time, whether that means voice trading, their proprietary FX portal or a multi-bank platform.</p>
<p>There are clearly roles for all and the likelihood is that most corporates will continue to pick and choose the platform and the trades that suit them best, which means providers need to keep all channels open and work with the flow, not against it.</p>

<h3 id=""dont-forget-to-ask"">Don’t forget to ask…</h3>
<p>When choosing a platform provider, treasurers will need to match the kind of instruments they wish to trade to those that the platform is able to deliver. But if the need is to trade in any significant volume, there is also a need to understand exactly the level of automation being offered, particularly around trade uploading (some systems may require manual shifting of files).</p>
<p>Most systems now offer a high degree of STP and treasurers will gain efficiencies trading electronically, but the degree to which execution and reporting of both competitive and non-competitive trading is enabled is important for treasurers even if ‘non-competitive’ trading is an alien concept for FI users.</p>

The right tool for the job,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There is literally nothing like a spreadsheet for its agility and low-cost handling of sometimes complex numerical data. Spreadsheets possess a familiarity and flexibility that have made them de rigueur for many financial professionals. And yet, like fire, spreadsheets are a good servant but a bad master; they harbour the potential for costly mistakes – in both a financial and reputational sense – unless controls are put in place.</p>
<h3 id=""errors-of-judgement"">Errors of judgement</h3>
<p>Looking for evidence of the fallibility of spreadsheets reveals an extensive research base. The European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group (EuSpRIG) offers a wealth of evidence, advice, comment, and academic papers on the subject and should be a first port of call for anyone interested in the life and times of spreadsheets.</p>
<p>“If the uncontrolled use of spreadsheets continues to occur in highly leveraged markets and companies, it is only a matter of time before another ‘Black Swan’ event occurs (a major unexpected event), causing catastrophic loss,” says Grenville Croll, a specialist in spreadsheets, spreadsheet applications and spreadsheet risk research, and a former Chairman of EuSpRIG.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of academic study placing human error as the major downside of spreadsheet use. EuSpRIG’s research suggests that the majority (more than 90%) of spreadsheets contain errors. Research conducted in 2006 by Professor Raymond Panko at the University of Hawaii indicated that spreadsheets are rarely tested and as such these errors remain in circulation.</p>
<p>There are a number of elements that undermine the efficacy of spreadsheets. David Banks and Ann Monday in a 2002 paper highlighted the potential of spreadsheets to facilitate fraud if there are no auditable trails. They also found users exhibited overconfidence in the accuracy of their spreadsheets leading to them not looking for errors and subsequently not finding them. And error of interpretation was also cited, where business decisions could be based entirely on spreadsheet data even where there was ‘evidence to the contrary’.</p>
<h3 id=""acknowledged-problems"">Acknowledged problems</h3>
<p>Most treasury professionals are acutely aware of the advantages and pitfalls of spreadsheet usage. In the two most recent Corporate View articles in Treasury Today, the interviewees (representing very large international corporates) were almost apologetic about using them, but stated, quite rightly, that there was nothing to take their place. Malcolm Cooper, Global Tax and Treasury Director at UK and US energy distributor, National Grid, said: “I do whatever I can to reduce the use of spreadsheets, but I’m afraid it is impossible because they are so useful. So often you need that ad hoc piece of analysis that a TMS or anything else will not do.” Similarly, Manish Kapoor, Head of Airtel Centre of Excellence Cash and Bank at Indian mobile telecoms giant, Bharti Airtel, admitted that “the treasury function cannot completely get rid of spreadsheets”. He too explained that they enable his team to perform some data analysis functions which he felt could not be performed on any other immediately available technology.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet’s capacity as a core treasury tool was investigated in June 2011 in a Treasury Today ‘Question Answered’ article. Phil John, EMEA Treasury Director of Mars Incorporated referred to spreadsheets as “our flexible friends” and noted that if used properly they were a “tremendous tool”. However, he warned that if used inappropriately “they quickly become an Achilles heel”.</p>
<p>“The weaknesses,” said John, “are many: individual designs are not always transferable; formulae errors are not transparent and can easily be introduced when amendments are made; large designs become clumsy and error-prone; manual data entry frequently leads to error; work is often duplicated; storage is frequently not on shared servers; and there is no audit trail.”</p>
<p>It is perhaps unfair to criticise the technology itself: it does what it does perfectly well. But because it responds only to data entered, it would be more appropriate to state that it is only ever as reliable as the people who use it – and when they prove to be confused, inefficient and prone to making errors, so too are the spreadsheets.</p>
<p>One respondent to an article looking at how to minimise spreadsheet error using monitoring technology fired back that it was “patronising to say we all make these big typos everywhere”. Professional accountants, he argued, know what results to expect from their spreadsheets. Excel, he continued, “is the only bit of kit we have that provides the flexibility we want”.</p>
<h3 id=""official-complaint"">Official complaint</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the professionalism of most treasurers, the lack of care and attention over spreadsheet control in some organisations has been officially commented on (if not actually legislated against) by regulatory bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the UK’s FSA.</p>
<p>The Basel Committee issued a consultative document in June 2012 – ‘Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting’ – in which it warns banks to be ‘fully aware of any limitations’ that prevent full risk data aggregation. It talks of the need to aggregate data ‘on a largely automated basis so as to minimise the probability of errors’.</p>
<p>Automation is recognised as a force for good by the FSA in its September 2012 report on the country’s insurance industry, ‘Solvency II: internal model approval process data review findings’. It noted that many firms had automated spreadsheets, using macros to reduce manual intervention. Others had taken further steps and had deployed spreadsheet management tools to determine the dependency of interlinked spreadsheets and were able to apply controls such as audit trail and version management.</p>
<p>The FSA accepted that automation of spreadsheets reduces the risk of manual error, but warned that it can also ‘introduce different problems such as reduced oversight, inadequate transparency about the extent of linking and proliferation of nested linked spreadsheets’. Linked spreadsheets, it added, ‘typically pass only single numerical values, without an indication of the date of their last update, creating the risk of passing stale data around the system’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In May 2012, Oracle and Accenture issued a report which claimed that 67% of companies still use spreadsheets – and 8% use spreadsheets and nothing else – to assist with tasks in financial close, reporting and filing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are fair points that concur largely with the academic views presented above: although targeted at the insurance industry, the FSA’s report could easily stand for most verticals in that it describes the use of “often uncontrolled” spreadsheets as “pervasive” and that “nearly all the data reviews identified issues with them”. The FSA in particular reserved criticism for firms that did not have an inventory of critical spreadsheets, “classified by use, by the impact on the internal model, and by complexity”.</p>
<h3 id=""mind-the-gap"">Mind the gap</h3>
<p>Whatever systems treasurers use – whether they are built in-house or bought in – the capabilities of those systems will have been defined by specifications that were written “at best” two or three years ago, claims Ralph Baxter, CEO of spreadsheet and data management software vendor, ClusterSeven. “And most technology-refreshes in big organisations are considerably slower than that.”</p>
<p>The gap between what corporate systems (a TMS or ERP, for example) can do and what the business needs is entirely understandable because few IT budgets can keep pace with all the requirements for change, especially those forced upon organisations at great speed by the regulators. Baxter believes that every regulatory report required by Dodd-Frank, for example, will be prepared in a spreadsheet “because there is no other way of compiling the information from all the different sources in the time that’s required”.</p>
<p>In May 2012, Oracle and Accenture issued a report which claimed that 67% of companies still use spreadsheets – and 8% use spreadsheets and nothing else – to assist with tasks in financial close, reporting and filing. The report’s author found it interesting that while more companies with three separate solutions for close, reporting and filing used spreadsheets (73%), a “significant 59%” of companies with a single solution also use them.</p>
<p>Paul Bramwell, Senior Vice President, Treasury Solutions at SunGard, looks upon the reliance on spreadsheets and manual processes alone as “making it difficult for corporates to respond quickly to fluctuations in the market with any degree of confidence”. Without automation, he says the time it takes to pull fragmented data together, as well as the potential inaccuracy of data, “can have a negative impact on investment and borrowing decisions”. Whether or not Bramwell’s contention is correct that spreadsheets are thus “quickly losing their appeal” remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Baxter offers some evidence to the contrary. Firstly, the fact that spreadsheets are still very much in use (with plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this) suggests that the business world has not found a suitable alternative and neither is one waiting in the wings to take over. Secondly, that their usage is not constrained by size, value or project complexity suggests an almost limitless appeal. In respect of the latter, he claims that one of the biggest treasury-related projects of the past few years – the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP) in the US – had to be managed in spreadsheets. “Despite the supposed foresight of all the vendors in the market place, I doubt any of them had built a TARP programme that could be bought off the shelf.”</p>
<p>Regardless of who’s right, because of the continual dysfunctional conversation (and the publication of many spreadsheet horror stories) that has sown the idea that spreadsheets are bad and must be removed, many finance professionals don’t want to admit the extent to which they use them. But like any problem that’s swept under the carpet, the result tends to be the creation of a bigger problem because if no one’s admitting what they are doing, the task of managing spreadsheet usage becomes that much more difficult.</p>
<h3 id=""the-fix"">The fix</h3>
<p>According to a 2000 study by the University of Hawaii’s Raymond Panko, only one approach to error reduction has been demonstrated to be effective. This, he said, is code inspection, in which a group of spreadsheet developers checks a spreadsheet cell-by-cell to discover errors (so ensuring that what is supposed to happen has and that nothing unexpected has occurred). Quoted by EuSpRIG, Panko said that even this process, exhausting and expensive as it would be, could only catch about 80% of all errors.</p>
<p>But Baxter believes that as long as the business process integrity for each key spreadsheet can be defined, the checking process can be automated thus making it quicker, cheaper and more consistent. Such a checking tool cannot reach spreadsheets that have been taken outside of the corporate system (on a user’s laptop, for example), but this marks a move away from business process integrity towards compliance and security issues, both of which should be handled by their respective policy units.</p>
<p>And it is perhaps policy development where the real answer to all this lies. There certainly needs to be a change of direction in the approach to spreadsheets, steering thoughts away from shame and secrecy towards an acknowledgement that, according to need, there is a balance to be reached between spreadsheet usage and the deployment of corporate systems. And if, as the academics and the regulators state, the problem is one of control, the obvious need is to implement a policy-led framework to create that control, and then to implement it enthusiastically.</p>

<p>PwC’s Internal Auditor publication has noted five common effective spreadsheet controls:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting documentation standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing data entry procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using good security measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backing up data frequently.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to this high-level set of pointers, the T2P Information Governance Research Community has published a few more pertinent guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expect errors and test regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage spreadsheet change, preferably using versioning software, at least where spreadsheets are part of a critical business process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If possible, use software to audit spreadsheets, right down to cell level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate critical business processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor centralised application adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage a balanced mix of enterprise application and spreadsheet usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforce policies and procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies need a clear understanding of where their existing and new business-critical spreadsheets are being used and what people are doing in them. In an ideal world, the gathering of this knowledge would take the form of a centralised business/IT team capable of assessing existing spreadsheets, monitoring and controlling the creation of new ones across the organisation. This implies a level of group-wide connectivity which few companies possess and, in the real world (where siloed technology and fractured data sets are par for the course), knowledge of what is happening locally is usually only a local capability.</p>
<p>An alternative is to adopt a more distributed approach to understanding spreadsheet usage, where centrally the need is only to know that everyone is following policy, but then giving all the tools, capabilities and support to enable teams to manage spreadsheets locally. In this way, spreadsheet control becomes a policy issue, with the assumption that, as long as the policy is well-crafted, most users will comply.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the flexibility of the spreadsheet is not in question and neither is its capacity to fill a technology gap between what is needed for immediate and ad hoc developments and what is offered by more substantial but less wieldy corporate systems. But just as the Japanese samurai used to carry two swords – the powerful long-blade katana for most combat use, and the agile short-blade wakizashi for close-quarter (or indoor) fighting – modern businesses need the combination of power and agility to cover all eventualities and it gets this through intelligent combination of the tools available, including spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Global treasury requires a business presence in several countries, maintaining accounts with several banks both local and international in each and using a variety of channels for routing cash and information. In this situation, the ideal is a single forwarding bank through which to manage all the accounts and channels, regardless of where they are.</p>
<p>“Sogecash Web particularly fits companies having several banks at both domestic and international levels,” says Corinne Babok, Corporate Cash Management Senior Product Manager, at Societe Generale. “Any company having cross-border interests, even if its accounts are located in different banks, can benefit from this product. It has applications for small entities as well as large corporate groups. The key requirement is not the size, but the cross-border banking activity.”</p>
<h3 id=""key-benefits-of-sogecash-web"">Key benefits of Sogecash Web</h3>
<p>Sogecash Web is designed to provide genuine decision-making support for corporate treasurers, allowing them to manage accounts efficiently and optimise their cash on a day-to-day basis. It offers a single access point to a wide range of services available for accounts held with Societe Generale or with other banks, anywhere in the world. “As any internet tool, Sogecash Web is easy to access, available at any time and from anywhere” says Babok.</p>
<p>The benefit also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single and multilingual point of access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wide range of reporting and transactional functionalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modular system customisable to individual needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High degree of security, coupled with a high degree of flexibility to match any company organisation regarding signature management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class=""center"">

</figure>
<h3 id=""a-la-carte-services"">‘A la carte’ services</h3>
<p>The system provides a wide range of services in two modes: upload/download and transactional. The key innovation is that each client can select only what he needs and create his own version of Sogecash Web by selecting from a palette including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>View bank account statements and intraday reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiate orders globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or if preferred, access Societe Generale’s local cash management capabilities in different countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive selected alerts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Though account monitoring can very easily be made on a global basis with the tool, it is also important to be able to have direct access to specific local specificities, and this is precisely what Sogecash Web provides. Indeed, accessing the Internet environment of our branches through the Sogecash Web portal opens up direct access to domestic payments and collections in the relevant domestic formats when needed. This allows the user to have both global and local view and transaction issuing in a way that suits either a decentralised or a highly centralised organisation equally,” says Babok.</p>
<h3 id=""advanced-customisation"">Advanced customisation</h3>
<p>Each treasurer is unique and has his/her own way of working. What must appear first is not necessarily the same for all users. So Sogecash Web is designed to allow treasurers to create their own uniquely personalised workspace.</p>
<p>The Dashboard is the key vehicle for customisation. Here content is fully customisable as is the presentation. The user can choose to display different modules and functions in any way he or she wants and all the customisation is via drag and drop, very easy to handle.</p>
<p>“We simply let our users decide which services within the tool they wish to use and display on the screen only their selection,” Babok explains.</p>
<figure class=""center"">
<a class=""enlargeable"" href=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2011/06/2011-06-tt-06-pp-print-screen-02.png""><img alt=""Image of Sogecash Web advanced customisation"" height=""331"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2011/06/2011-06-tt-06-pp-print-screen-02-t.png"" width=""300""/></a>
</figure>
<p>In addition to the core treasury and banking modules, Sogecash Web, through the dashboard, enables the user to view information on stock markets and, through RSS feeds, to access a selection of financial papers if they so wish.</p>
<h4 id=""flexible-user-rights"">Flexible user rights</h4>
<p>A key feature of the system is that each user can have a fully independent profile. The management of user rights is completely flexible in order to make Sogecash Web consistent with each client’s internal rules and organisation.</p>
<p>Says Babok, “the way users’ rights can be managed must be both very rich and highly flexible. Sogecash Web allows users to tailor access, input and signature rights, in different ways, at individual or group level, so that it can be adapted to suit a very large range of organisational structures.”</p>
<h4 id=""state-of-the-art-security"">State-of-the-art security</h4>
<p>Confidentiality and security are crucial elements of any electronic banking tool. First of all, the site benefits from the high security of the https protocol. In addition, access can be granted through X509 certificate authentication, which is at present the strongest security standard when stored on a physical device (USB dongle or smartcard) and this is the case in Sogecash Web. Sogecash Web will also integrate the new SWIFT 3SKey solution, removing corporates’ need for different security devices from one bank to another.</p>
<h4 id=""all-in-one-solution"">All-in-one solution</h4>
<p>Sogecash Web is an all-in-one solution. As Babok points out: “Our clients need more from such products than just cash management functions, they also need easy access to the other services they use often, such as FX and trade services.” Sogecash Web provides for such links.</p>
<h4 id=""simple-migration"">Simple migration</h4>
<p>For customers currently using the former product Sogecash Net International, access to the new one will be very easy. They will simply have to log on to the new address and will be able to use all of the new capabilities. All existing user rights will be automatically transferred into the new system so that users will have no action to take to go on using their services the way they previously did.</p>
<h4 id=""swift-3skey-compatible"">SWIFT 3SKey compatible</h4>
<p>Sogecash Web is designed to be fully compatible with 3SKey. This is a service offered by SWIFT to banks and their corporate customers. The solution can be used to authenticate corporate customers on banks’ websites. It also enables corporates to genuinely digitally sign the files sent to their banks with the banks then able to check the level of authorisation granted to the signatories.</p>
<p>With the 3SKey solution, the same certificate can be used with multiple banks, so that the user needs only one device.</p>
<p>Says Babok: “Corporate clients often use cash management products and services from different banks and different countries and the security devices are all different. Even within the same bank several devices may be needed depending on the service type. 3SKey is an opportunity to simplify this process to a single security device. Treasurers want just one device – a multi-bank multiproduct solution.”</p>
<p>To make the most out of the 3SKey solution, Societe Generale also allows the use of 3SKey in a wide range of products and services such as SWIFTNet FileAct and EBICS in France.</p>

<h4 id=""sogecash-web-completing-our-range-of-cash-management-solutions"">Sogecash Web: completing our range of cash management solutions</h4>
<p>Eric Flour, Head of Marketing and Products, Corporate Cash Management Department, Societe Generale outlines the bank’s product line and aims.</p>
<p>Our ambition is clearly to provide best of breed international cash management solutions to our customers, adapted to their needs and to their organisation. In this context, we have developed offerings and products recognised by the market such as SWIFTNet capabilities and treasury centralisation tools.</p>
<p>With 200 corporate customers expected by the end of 2011, we are, with our SWIFTNet offer, one of the top five international banks. We aim to keep this rank by integrating new functions and value-added services. Just one example: the launch at the end of 2010 of the 3Skey certificates for the signature of files under SWIFTNet FileAct.</p>
<p>In the field of the treasury centralisation, we have created a range of products allowing us to meet the needs of ZBA/TGA for accounts held with the Societe Generale network and with other banks.</p>
<p>It is in the same spirit that we have renewed and enriched our international cash management product on the internet. The launch of Sogecash Web allows us to offer a global portal gathering the Societe Generale group products from cash to FX and even trade, while bringing a customisation adapted to the needs of each of our customers. In a sense ‘a global personal portal’…</p>

<p>“SG NetBanking is a domestic electronic banking tool adapted to the specific requirements of the Polish corporates and is fully compliant with Polish regulations”, says Frédéric Sem, Head of Corporate Cash Management at Societe Generale Warsaw. “It has been developed by the Societe Generale Warsaw IT team on the basis of our clients’ requests. It’s a constantly evolving product which is permanently enriched with new functionalities aiming at answering Societe Generale Warsaw clients’ expectations. It is a generic tool intended to satisfy any type of clients.”</p>
<p>SG NetBanking is a fully secured internet based tool. It provides on-line access to intra-day and end of day information and allows the clients to issue direct debits and all kind of payment orders, including specific local ones such as payments to the Tax Office or Social Security. Payment orders can be prepared and imported in local formats (ELIXIR-0) and any format chosen by the client.</p>
<p>In addition to the ‘classical’ cash management services, SG NetBanking aims at giving the Societe Generale Warsaw clients an easy access to all the commercial banking products offered by the branch.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, Frédéric Sem adds, “Our clients have been at the same time the requestor and the architect of our product and SG NetBanking should be rightfully considered as ‘a son of the Polish soil’”.</p>


<h4 id=""robert-le-bourgeois-global-head-of-sales-cash-management-societe-generale"">Robert Le Bourgeois, Global Head of Sales, Cash Management, Societe Generale: “The launch of Sogecash Web will pave the way for a new relationship with our customers”.</h4>
<p>Much more user-friendly and closer to the treasurers’ needs, our web based electronic banking tool will allow them to monitor their accounts, streamline their liquidity and optimise their treasury in the most innovative way a global bank can offer today.</p>
<p>This objective has been achieved thanks to the close cooperation between our sales team and our product managers in order to meet most of the requirements of our international clients – some of who were even deeply involved in the proof-of-concept process.</p>
<p>That’s the reason why we were able to design Sogecash Web as the global and modular answer we dreamt about: you can make it your complete cash management tool or use it as a complementary tool in conjunction with other EB services. Sogecash Web will provide you with a wide range of reliable banking services ‘à la carte’, you subscribe… and you only pay for the services needed!</p>
<p>And as required by many international treasurers, you will benefit from the domestic features of cash management practices in a particular country. Just ask our cash management consultants how comfortable they now feel with the new brand Sogecash Web!</p>

Commerzbank’s TREASURY module,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Optimising liquidity has never been more crucial and in order to achieve this, treasurers need an accurate overview of the company’s cash. Commerzbank’s TREASURY module is a web-based solution designed to give treasurers clear visibility into the company’s bank accounts, together with cash management, reporting, administrative and planning functions facilitating effective liquidity management.</p>
<h3 id=""introduction"">Introduction</h3>
<p>In the current market, liquidity is high on the agenda of any treasurer. More than ever, treasurers are looking to ensure that available funds are being used as efficiently as possible. In contrast to the trend of recent years, when companies were more focused on rationalising their banking relationships, treasurers are now choosing to work with a larger number of banking partners in order to ensure they have access to sufficient credit.</p>
<p>This can make it more challenging to obtain a complete, consolidated overview of the company’s liquidity status. Commerzbank’s TREASURY module is a solution that can address this need by giving the treasurer access to all of the company’s accounts, regardless of which bank they are held with.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury"">TREASURY</h3>
<p>TREASURY is a module of Commerzbank’s corporate banking portal. Launched in 2006, the module is a multi-banking solution which allows corporate customers to view the status of all the company’s bank accounts. TREASURY is entirely web-based and can therefore be accessed from anywhere in the world with internet access.</p>
<p>TREASURY provides functionality in the following key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Information management.</h5>
<p>The system provides account information relating to all participating accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cash management.</h5>
<p>The system includes a cash flow forecasting function. It also allows corporates to run a shadow account of an existing automatic cash pool or to carry out cash pooling manually. Interest income and liabilities arising from cash pooling can be calculated at the end of each period with a few clicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity planning.</h5>
<p>Medium and long-term liquidity plans can be automatically created using data from the account statements, allowing the user to compare the plans with details of the company’s actual transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Administration.</h5>
<p>TREASURY allows corporates to administrate deals that have already been conducted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FX (spots, forwards, swaps, options, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money market (loans, deposits, overnight money, commercial paper, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest management (swaps, forwards, caps, floors, collars, swaptions, FRAs, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract and guarantee management (instalments, annuity and maturing loans, etc).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maturity lists and reports can be generated and associated cash flows can be viewed in the cash management and liquidity planning functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Netting.</h5>
<p>This function is aimed at corporates with significant accounts payable and accounts receivable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reports.</h5>
<p>All information in the system can be processed and visualised via the reporting tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution also provides up-to-date information regarding current interest rates and exchange rates.</p>
<h4 id=""target-customers"">Target customers</h4>
<p>TREASURY is aimed at medium-sized corporate customers with an annual turnover of around €50m and over, as well as larger corporates.</p>
<p>The application is likely to be attractive to corporates that do not have a treasury management system in place, or to those looking to replace an older solution which is no longer able to fulfil the company’s requirements. TREASURY currently serves a broad range of customers in terms of industry and geographical location.</p>
<h3 id=""key-features"">Key features</h3>
<p>Some of the most important features of the solution are as follows:</p>
<figure class=""center"">
<a class=""enlargeable"" href=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/04/2009-04-tt-11-pp-print-screen-01-commerzbank-overview-account-disposition.png""><img alt=""Print screen 1: TREASURY application showing an Overview Account Disposition page"" height=""293"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/04/2009-04-tt-11-pp-print-screen-01-commerzbank-overview-account-disposition-t.png"" width=""300""/></a>
</figure>
<h4 id=""web-based-application"">Web-based application</h4>
<p>TREASURY is a web-based application. There is no need for software to be installed in-house; the system is accessed using any standard web browser and system updates do not involve any installation of software on users’ PCs. Commerzbank installs updates to the system outside of working hours and users automatically access the newest version of the module on next login.</p>
<h4 id=""multi-banking-solution"">Multi-banking solution</h4>
<p>Accounts from any bank in the world can be integrated into the system, as long as the bank is able to send account statements using SWIFT MT940 messages.</p>
<p>The banks send account information at the start of the working day to Commerzbank in Frankfurt and Commerzbank routes the information through to the customer’s database. If the banks are able to send information intraday, this will be uploaded into TREASURY on a same day basis.</p>
<h4 id=""user-profiles"">User profiles</h4>
<p>The system can support unlimited user profiles and user rights can be customised to allow each user to access the functionalities relevant to their role.</p>
<p>Profiles can be customised by Commerzbank during the implementation process and can subsequently be amended by the user’s database administrator. There are no limitations on the number of users or the size of the customer’s database.</p>
<figure class=""center"">

</figure>
<h4 id=""flexibility"">Flexibility</h4>
<p>TREASURY is a flexible tool which can be tailored according to the customer’s requirements. For example, a standard reporting portfolio is included but it is also possible for customers with specific requirements to receive customised reports.</p>
<p>The customer’s view of data in the various functions is another area that can be tailored to suit the customer’s needs. For example, each user can configure their view on an individual basis.</p>

<h5 id=""how-is-the-treasury-module-positioned-to-help-treasurers-in-the-current-financial-crisis"">How is the TREASURY module positioned to help treasurers in the current financial crisis?</h5>
<p>In general, what we hear from our customers is that ensuring they have sufficient liquidity at any time has become extremely important for them. Obtaining an accurate view of group-wide liquidity at any time, and managing that liquidity, is therefore a major priority for treasurers. The TREASURY application places the corporate treasurer in a position to fulfil this aim and as a result we are seeing significantly more interest in the application.</p>
<h5 id=""what-challenges-was-the-application-designed-to-overcome"">What challenges was the application designed to overcome?</h5>
<p>Going back a few years, we launched our previous treasury system in 2000. We subsequently re-launched in 2006 with the system we are running now. At the time, treasurers generally had two options: they could use Excel, which is easy to use, very flexible, but not an integrated comprehensive solution; or they could adopt a server-based treasury management system, which was highly expensive, with additional running costs per year.</p>
<p>The objective for us was to create a solution that was in between those two options, which was easy to implement, train and use. We also wanted to create a solution whereby the customer had no need for additional IT server and services.</p>
<p>Today, the application is valued by treasurers looking to obtain visibility over their group liquidity on a daily basis. It is also able to address reporting requirements arising from Basel II. Functions like the ability to monitor cash pool and internal account activities are particularly useful.</p>
<h5 id=""what-benefits-would-a-corporate-achieve-through-choosing-treasury-over-another-application"">What benefits would a corporate achieve through choosing TREASURY over another application?</h5>
<p>There are a lot of benefits. The independence of location is a major benefit, due to the fact that the solution is web-based. Also the automatic preparation of the group-wide liquidity status is a very great benefit, so the treasurer has the transparency and visibility over group cash that they need at a time when liquidity is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>Also TREASURY is a flexible tool with a lot of individual customised functions. The customer pays only for those functions which he is using. So this is a tailor-made solution meeting the customer’s requirements.</p>
<h5 id=""how-does-treasury-compare-to-a-typical-treasury-management-system"">How does TREASURY compare to a typical treasury management system?</h5>
<p>The main point of differentiation again is the internet-based architecture. Take a corporate with a lot of locations around the world – if they want to use a classical treasury management system, they have to install the system in their own environment. In our solution, they only need internet access. This is the main difference.</p>
<h5 id=""what-have-customer-responses-to-treasury-been"">What have customer responses to TREASURY been?</h5>
<p>We have a proven track record and have received a lot of very good feedback from customers. They are satisfied that they feel very comfortable with the application. They have told us that TREASURY is user-friendly and easy to handle, and within a few days of using this tool they are completely comfortable with the solution. Since the solution was re-launched in 2006, a broad range of customers has begun using TREASURY.</p>
<h5 id=""how-do-you-plan-to-develop-the-application-in-the-future"">How do you plan to develop the application in the future?</h5>
<p>TREASURY is enhanced on an ongoing process and the development of function and features is driven by the needs of our customers. We run regular functional updates on the system (one or two major releases per annum) and several improvements and optimisations during a year.</p>

<h4 id=""secure-internet-platform"">Secure internet platform</h4>
<p>Users access the system using their user ID and password. The system uses minimum 128-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. If a web browser does not support this level of encryption, the user will not be able to access the system.</p>
<h4 id=""low-investment-cost"">Low investment cost</h4>
<p>There are two components to the fee. There is a one-off charge at the outset, which relates to setting up the company’s database and providing on-site training. This tends to be lower than the set-up fees associated with a traditional treasury management system, which requires installation of the system at the company’s premises. There is also a monthly user fee, which varies depending on the scope of functions accessed and which includes maintenance and hotline support. There are no annual running costs or update fees.</p>
<h3 id=""implementation"">Implementation</h3>
<p>The web-based nature of the solution means that implementation is straightforward. From the customer’s point of view, all that is required is a PC running a standard internet browser, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari.</p>
<p>Commerzbank provides on-site training at the customer’s premises. From the decision to use the system to going live, implementation is completed very quickly because no installation is needed and there is no need for any further technical requirements.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Liquidity is a key concern for all treasurers in the current market but the tendency to work with multiple banks can make it more challenging to obtain an accurate overview of the company’s cash. Commerzbank’s TREASURY module is well positioned to serve treasurers’ needs in the current market, with its convenient web-based architecture, its wide range of liquidity management tools and its ability to incorporate account information from a number of different banks.</p>

<h3 id=""the new commerzbank"">The new Commerzbank</h3>
<p>With the takeover of Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank opens up a new chapter of its corporate history. Commerzbank AG and Allianz SE agreed on the sale of Dresdner Bank AG to Commerzbank on 31<sup>st</sup> August 2008. As of 12<sup>th</sup> January 2009 the takeover has been completed and Commerzbank has become the sole shareholder of Dresdner Bank.</p>
<h4 id=""the-leading-bank-for-private-and-corporate-customers-in-germany"">The leading bank for private and corporate customers in Germany</h4>
<p>The transaction will make Commerzbank the leading bank for private and corporate banking in Germany. With some 1,200 branches, the new bank will have the strongest branch network of all German banks, and its customers stand to benefit from an even broader and more attractive range of products and advisory services.</p>
<p>At the same time, the takeover will enhance Germany’s standing as an economic and financial centre. The new Commerzbank will be an even stronger long-term partner for the export-strong SME sector and corporate customers, combining the expertise and clear commitment of both banks to the German market under a single roof.</p>

Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>While the trend globally has been for treasurers to rationalise their banking relationships, the geographical scale and market conditions in China mean that it is often necessary to maintain relationships with a number of local and foreign banks in order to ensure adequate coverage.  Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution aims to work within this framework by enabling treasurers to manage different banking relationships via a single platform, making it possible to take a more centralised approach to liquidity management.</p>
<h3 id=""background"">Background</h3>
<h4 id=""the-china-banking-landscape"">The China banking landscape</h4>
<p>The development of treasury operations in China in recent years has taken place against the background of a vast and fractured banking landscape. There are currently over 130 commercial banks, operating 280,000 bank branches and offices across China. The level of service quality and product availability differs significantly, even between branches of the same bank.</p>
<p>Globally, a major trend in cash management has been for corporates to reduce the number of their bank accounts and banking relationships in order to facilitate a more centralised approach to liquidity management. However, the nature of the banking industry in China means that there is a limit to the extent to which this can be achieved.</p>
<h5 id=""foreign-banks-and-domestic-banks"">Foreign banks and domestic banks</h5>
<p>The foreign banks which have moved into China have a lot to offer corporates in terms of products and services, with electronic banking solutions and global networks. However, the major domestic banks have vast domestic branch networks with which the foreign banks cannot compete.</p>
<p>The market was opened to foreign banks at the end of 2006 as part of China’s WTO entry conditions, but the number of branches held by foreign banks in China remains small. In total, the foreign banks currently operate around 200 branches across China. The largest Chinese bank, in comparison, has over 18,000 branches. For companies that need access to local banking services, relationships with domestic banks are therefore still essential.</p>
<h5 id=""co-operation-is-key"">Co-operation is key</h5>
<p>Many of the foreign banks operating in China have worked hard to develop good relationships with the domestic banks. Much can be gained by working together. The foreign banks can benefit from the domestic banks’ impressive branch networks, while the domestic banks can benefit from the foreign banks’ technical expertise, product range and global perspective.</p>
<h3 id=""companies-moving-into-china"">Companies moving into China</h3>
<p>Recent regulatory changes have encouraged multinational companies to set up regional headquarters, shared service centres and holding companies in China. In order to obtain the benefits of this form of centralised approach, it is crucial to have good visibility over cash – a task that is difficult to achieve if there are a large number of different banking relationships, requiring different bank software to be used.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution"">The Solution</h4>
<p>One product which has been developed to help customers in a multi-banking environment is Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution. This product, developed specifically for the China market, allows customers to access bank accounts held with domestic banks as well as with Citi via Citi’s secure electronic banking platform, CitiDirect® Online Banking. By using the platform, corporates can gain better visibility over their cash and adopt a more centralised approach to managing their liquidity without sacrificing key local banking relationships. Consequently, cash flow forecasting can be carried out more accurately and efficiencies can be gained by the rationalisation of electronic banking platforms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the participating banks benefit from a larger share of their clients’ business, as the corporates using the solution tend to reduce the number of their banking relationships. In addition, all of the banks involved in the programme benefit from the enhanced product capability and competitive edge which results from their ability to offer integrated solutions and services.</p>
<h5 id=""development"">Development</h5>
<p>Citi began working on the solution in early 2005, when it developed a host-to-host connection with the first participating domestic bank. Since then, a further four Chinese banks have partnered with Citi to participate in the solution. Citi has continued to develop alliances with domestic banks in order to expand the number of participants. Meanwhile, the functionalities of the solution continue to be developed.</p>
<h5 id=""host-to-host-connection"">Host-to-host connection</h5>
<p>The defining feature of Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution is the host-to-host connection held between Citi and the participating domestic banks. Payments can be initiated via this connection, which also supports transaction and statement reporting. CitiDirect in turn connects with the company’s ERP system to enable straight through processing.</p>

</figure>
<p>As a result of the improved level of visibility and control over the company’s cash provided by the Multi-Banking Treasury Solution, liquidity can be managed on a centralised basis, leading to cost and operational efficiencies.</p>
<p>The solution facilitates cash concentration as the debit and credit balances of different group entities can be offset in order to reduce interest costs or enable the use of high-yield investment tools. Better internal control can also be achieved across the participating accounts as a result of CitiDirect’s pre-defined multi-layer authorisation functionality.</p>

<img alt=""Anheuser-Busch"" class=""logo org"" height=""42"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/anheuser-busch-logo-2007-50x42.png"" width=""50""/>

<p><em>Anheuser-Busch is a leading global brewing company, most notably producing Budweiser and Bud Light. The company established its presence in China in 1995 with the acquisition of a first brewery and acquired Harbin Brewery Group in 2004, which added a further 13 breweries. Anheuser-Busch has 18 companies in China including a regional head office, and owns a 27% stake of Tsingtao Brewery Company. Two treasury staff are based in Shanghai, working closely with the international treasury based in St. Louis, Missouri.</em></p>
<p>The vast geographical scale of China means that it is often necessary for corporates to bank with a large number of banking partners. Anheuser-Busch uses more than 20 banks in China but is keen to pare this down to its key banks: one foreign and one domestic bank. While the market has recently been opened to foreign banks, the huge branch networks of the local banks make it necessary to use domestic banks in order to ensure adequate coverage, particularly for companies like Anheuser-Busch which rely on local banks to collect sales revenue in cash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now, as we are expanding our business in China, we have created a dedicated Asia treasury department which is focused on working with the banks and finding treasury solutions to lower our cost of capital and provide better funding.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company has only recently moved towards a centralised approach to treasury, as treasury operations were previously conducted on a local basis. “Three years ago, before we bought the Harbin Brewery Group, we had no Asia treasury department,” explains Stanley Wang, Senior Financial Analyst.  “All the treasury work was managed by the accounting staff locally, with some assistance from the US international treasury department. Now, as we are expanding our business in China, we have created a dedicated Asia treasury department which is focused on working with the banks and finding treasury solutions to lower our cost of capital and provide better funding.”</p>
<p>Before the acquisition in 2004, the Harbin Brewery Group’s treasury operations were very basic, with no access to e-banking solutions. Balance information was limited to the monthly statement issued by the bank, or had to be obtained by visiting the branch. The expansion has made visibility over Harbin breweries’ cash increasingly important, particularly as the company is now looking to expand Harbin brand across China. It became clear that a more centralised approach was required, and that a sophisticated banking solution should be adopted in order to provide better visibility over its cash.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch was also keen to consolidate its numerous banking relationships, with the goal of eventually using one local and one foreign bank. The relationship between the two chosen banks was of key importance. “We needed good co-operation between our local bank and our foreign bank, so that we could better use the expertise from both banks to achieve good cash control,” says Janet Ming, Asia Treasury Director.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch had been working with Citi for four years, having been a pilot customer for Citi’s liquidity management system. The services provided by Citi included an RMB cash pool incorporating one brewery and four branches, as well as payables and receivables services. “We found CitiDirect®, Citi’s e-banking system, to be reliable, cost-effective and efficient,” says Ming. The decision was therefore taken to implement Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution in order to streamline the company’s banking relationships by taking advantage of the strong relationship Citi has with ICBC, Anheuser-Busch’s key domestic bank.</p>
<p>The major benefit of this solution was the reduction of the number of banking relationships that Anheuser-Busch needed to maintain. “We don’t have to use so many local banks to provide the local cash pick up or local banking services,” explains Ming. Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution incorporates a host-to-host connection with ICBC, which enables Anheuser-Busch to access balance information relating to the accounts held with the domestic bank via Citi’s e-banking system. The solution has also made it possible to automate the cash concentration structure which was set up to move the cash generated from the Budweiser business to the Harbin business.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch is planning to continue centralising its treasury operations in China as the two businesses are integrated and intends to set up a China shared service centre which will initially focus on accounts payable. The consolidation of banking activities will continue to be a priority as the company moves forwards. “The big obstacle in China is that you can’t find one bank that can fulfil all your needs, in terms of branch network, banking services and e-banking capabilities,” says Ming. “However, Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution has enabled us to minimise our banking relationships and improve our cash visibility and control.”</p>

<h5 id=""technology"">Technology</h5>
<p>The host-to-host connection between Citi and its partner banks uses leased lines that provide a high level of transmission encryption in order to ensure maximum data security.</p>
<p>The host-to-host link is used instead of SWIFT as SWIFT does not support Chinese character transmission, which is essential for the processing of renminbi payments. In addition, few banks in China are able to provide intraday statement reporting using SWIFT. The Multi-Banking Treasury Solution supports Chinese characters and intraday reporting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While China’s banking landscape is experiencing significant changes in the wake of the opening of the market at the end of 2006, the vast number of banks in China mean that it will be a long time before most corporates can adopt a single-bank approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""points of differentiation"">Points of differentiation</h3>
<p>Citi has drawn on the features of other banking platforms elsewhere in the world in developing the Multi-Banking Treasury Solution, and consequently this solution offers a number of points of differentiation compared to the other solutions on the market in China.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intraday account information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Straight through processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real-time payment initiation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chinese language support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are available on all the participating accounts.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>While China’s banking landscape is experiencing significant changes in the wake of the opening of the market at the end of 2006, the vast number of banks in China mean that it will be a long time before most corporates can adopt a single-bank approach. As a result, solutions such as Citi’s Multi-Banking Treasury Solution are likely to be very attractive to treasurers, offering a practical means of managing liquidity on a country-wide basis without sacrificing key banking relationships.</p>

The Rabo Financial Logistics Portal ,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The Rabo Financial Logistics Portal (RFLP) was launched by Rabobank at the end of 2006 as a means of enabling treasury and administrative staff to access a collection of cash, liquidity and risk management products via a single web portal. Since then, a number of updates have increased the portal’s range of functions, and the product continues to develop in response to demand from the market. In this Product Profile, we look at the portal’s current functionalities and talk to Rabobank about the expected future developments.</p>
<h3 id=""financial-logistics-the-concept"">Financial Logistics – the concept</h3>
<p>The concept of Financial Logistics has been developed by Rabobank as a way of looking holistically at the areas of cash, liquidity and risk management, as well as trade. The Financial Logistics offering consists of two main elements: an advisory service, through which Rabobank’s FL consultants work closely with clients to come up with tailored risk mitigation solutions, and the RFLP, which allows corporates to manage cash, trade and risk via a single point of access. The two elements of the Financial Logistics offering are designed to be used in conjunction with each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the portal is entirely web-based, users do not need to install any software from the bank and the updates are carried out automatically without any effort from the end user.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""the-rflp"">The RFLP</h3>
<p>The RFLP is aimed at mid-sized to very large enterprises. A separate platform has been developed for smaller businesses. Since the RFLP’s launch at the end of 2006, more than 100 corporate clients have started using this service. In the longer term, Rabobank is expecting up to 8,000 corporates to join worldwide, resulting in around 35,000 individual end users.</p>
<p>While the most important features of the portal are already fully operational, the RFLP continues to evolve, with updates issued every quarter. As the portal is entirely web-based, users do not need to install any software from the bank and the updates are carried out automatically without any effort from the end user.</p>
<h4 id=""rabo-cash-management"">Rabo Cash Management</h4>
<p>The Cash Management area is currently focused on payments and receipts. However, additional functionalities, such as cash flow forecasting tools, will be available in due course. The following functionalities are now available to customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Payments.</h5>
<p>Customers can initiate and receive detailed information on domestic and cross-border payments, credit transfers and collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reporting tools.</h5>
<p>Customers are able to use reporting tools; MT940s and MT942s (bank balance and statement information) can be integrated into customers’ ERP systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>File upload.</h5>
<p>One function that has been added recently is the portal’s file upload capability. Customers that have a payment hub are able to upload huge payment files – 600,000 or more items if necessary – via a host-to-host connection or an upload applet that are both supplied via the portal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Multi-bank functionality.</h5>
<p>Also recently added to the portal, the multi-bank function allows customers to use the portal to access information about accounts held with other banks elsewhere in the world. This is based on information feeds from these banks and payments can also be made from these accounts, via the portal, using MT101s.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""rabo-trade-access"">Rabo Trade Access</h4>
<p>Brand new and added to the portal’s functionalities just this year is the Rabo Trade Access application which allows clients to manage import and export letters of credit (LCs) and documentary collections. The application allows for authorisation and amendments to LCs as well as tracking and tracing. The application supports multiple signatures and authorisations. Two more releases are scheduled for late 2007 in order to expand the range of functionality.</p>
<h3 id=""future-developments"">Future developments</h3>
<h5 id=""xml"">XML</h5>
<p>One of the key future developments lined up for the RFLP is a response to the growing demand for XML. SWIFT has already developed XML standards relating to MT940s. Rabobank has used these standards to develop a format enabling clients to upload and download payment files from the portal in XML format. The portal includes a generic payment factory which is able to process both Dutch domestic and SEPA credit transfers. Clients will also be offered conversion tools in order to process different formats.</p>
<h5 id=""mobile-access"">Mobile access</h5>
<p>Rabobank reports a growing interest from corporates in mobile access to the RFLP. Accordingly, they are working on enabling customers to access the portal from mobile phones and PDAs. The first step towards this has already been taken.</p>
<p>In July 2007, Rabobank announced that customers would be able to view account information from the RFLP via their PDAs. Patrick Straten discusses this in more detail opposite.</p>
<h5 id=""liquidity-and-cash-forecasting"">Liquidity and cash forecasting</h5>
<p>Within the RFLP Rabobank is planning to offer an online liquidity and cash flow forecasting tool. This functionality can not only be used for cash management information that is stored in Rabobank’s databases but also enables users to upload business events that can influence their liquidity and cash flow forecasting.</p>
<figure class=""center"">
<a class=""enlargeable"" href=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2007/09/2007-09-tt-07-pp-screenshot-01-rabo-trade-access-create-collection.png""><img alt=""Screenshot 1: RaboTradeAccess Create Collection website page"" height=""247"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2007/09/2007-09-tt-07-pp-screenshot-01-rabo-trade-access-create-collection-t.png"" width=""300""/></a>
</figure>
<h3 id=""profiles"">Profiles</h3>
<p>With so much information available on the portal, it is important to ensure that customers are not overwhelmed with data. In order to keep the portal as relevant as possible for all the end users, Rabobank has therefore developed three different user profiles. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Treasurer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrator</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The data which are available to these different profiles varies. For example, treasurers have access to rates and detailed market information which is not available to administrative users. These profiles can be customised when required to ensure that users only receive information that fits their needs. They can also be used to enforce segregation of duties, for example by preventing deal initiators from also authorising deals.</p>
<h5 id=""security"">Security</h5>
<p>The RFLP uses PKI technology to ensure security and is accessed using a combination of smart card and PIN. One of the advantages of the system is that a single login is used to access the whole range of tools.</p>

<h5 id=""pki-public-key-infrastructure"">PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)</h5>
<p>PKI technology is used to authenticate users across a public network, such as the internet, ensuring the security of relevant applications. This is achieved through the use of pairs of public and private cryptographic keys. Users’ identities are saved in the form of digital certificates, which are created by Certificate Authorities (CAs). The PKI itself is the framework used to manage the certificates and keys.</p>

<h5 id=""what-differentiates-the-rflp-from-other-banks-products"">What differentiates the RFLP from other banks’ products?</h5>

<p><span>MB:</span> First of all, the portal is an integrated solution – it is accessed in one window, using one security token. Clients can obtain real-time access to current financial positions, carry out FX deals and manage import and export letters of credit using one portal. Only a few competitors in the world offer a completely integrated portal. More often, you see separate cash management, treasury and trade applications, which need to be accessed individually.</p>
<p>In addition, some of our big corporate customers are able to link the portal directly to their ERP systems without using any bank software, making it simple to switch between Rabobank and other banks. This is another unique selling point for our portal.</p>
<p>Rabobank is introducing a functionality called MT940 extended. Customised MT940s are commonly used, meaning that clients would ordinarily need to make significant adjustments to their ERP systems when going from one bank to another. However, the MT940 extended functionality is a unique tool which reformats other banks’ MT940s, allowing customers to open an account at Rabobank without the need to make changes to their ERP systems.</p>

<p><span>PS:</span> The portal also includes an integrated fulfilment process. Customers can make changes to client data or apply for corporate credit cards online, which is common in the retail market, but unique in the corporate market. In the context of payments, online investigations can also be sent via the same window.</p>

<h5 id=""how-have-customers-responded-to-the-rflp"">How have customers responded to the RFLP?</h5>

<p><span>MB:</span> Customers have been really enthusiastic about the portal. They like the concept – Anytime, Anywhere – and the fact that there are no restrictions on volumes and no need for physical software. There is just one portal and one PIN code for all treasury needs. They have also responded well to features such as authorisation profiles which can be set up with between one and four signatures.</p>

<h5 id=""how-are-you-planning-to-develop-the-portal-in-the-next-year"">How are you planning to develop the portal in the next year?</h5>

<p><span>PS:</span> At the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, we will be focusing on providing access to the cash management application using PDAs and mobile phones. Initially, this will enable clients to access transaction and balance information. However, at the beginning of next year, the functionality will also enable clients to authorise and release payments.</p>
<p>Demand for this is growing. A few years ago, mobile phones were too slow for this type of access to be feasible, but now we have PDAs and faster internet connections, providing new opportunities to look at balance information anywhere, even in aeroplanes. Obviously we are talking about huge sums of money, so it’s important to ensure that the PDA is just as secure as a desktop. To secure this we have integrated our PKI solution for mobile access.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we are planning to introduce a few more features in the trade area. We will be developing further integration with our clients’ ERP systems, for document preparation, status download for LCs, etc. We will also continue to upgrade our existing host-to-host solutions. In Europe, there is a lot of integration through payment hubs.</p>
<p>Large corporates are creating payment hubs which enable them to send payment files without the need for bank software. They send huge files and the bank has to process them. We’re one of the few banks that can offer this functionality and we are intending to build on it further by finding a banking partner to offer this functionality in the global market. Of course, we recognise that a host-to-host connection is just one of the solutions enabling corporates to connect to a bank without the bank’s software. For this reason, we also support SWIFT Corporate Access.</p>

<p>As part of Rabobank’s Financial Logistics offering, the RFLP is designed to complement the other branch of Financial Logistics, which is the advisory area. While the portal focuses on cash management, treasury and trade services it also links to the risk management services provided by the FL consultants.</p>
<p>For example, the portal includes a Quickscan application, which enables customers to fill out a questionnaire relating to their risk exposures in order to create a customised risk profile. However, for more detailed risk management advice, customers are directed to Rabobank’s team of Financial Logistics consultants.</p>
<p>The consultants take an enterprise risk management approach to their clients’ risk exposures and spend a couple of days talking to customers in order to come up with appropriate risk mitigation solutions.</p>

<h5 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h5>
<p>As the role of the treasurer continues to evolve beyond the traditional transactional activities, there is a clear need for technology to enable treasurers to perform a wider range of activities. On the whole, treasurers are still using several different applications in order to carry out these different activities. Rabobank’s portal, by offering treasurers the ability to carry out all of these activities from one web-based location, is in line with this evolution.</p>
<p>The trend in recent years has been for treasury activities to be centralised, with more and more corporates now looking at treasury operations as a whole and in relation to each other rather than individually. By allowing treasurers to access these activities in one place, Rabobank’s portal is very much in support of this approach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the question of mobile access to treasury applications is an area where we expect to see much innovation in the future. By harnessing this technology into the portal, Rabobank is showing the RFPL will be keeping up with the market and continuing to offer clients an innovative solution.</p>
