<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Five years ago treasurers would have “run a mile” from the topic of digital technology, says Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer, Ferguson plc. “Back then, treasurers weren’t that comfortable talking about Cloud technology,” he says. “But the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a change and digital technologies are now seen as necessary. No one wants to go back to what things were like before.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 legacy of increased remote and hybrid working environments means digital transformation is key to thriving in the next decade, says Chris Schutte, Manager at corporate financial consultants Actualize Consulting. “Emerging technologies are changing how we do business. For treasury departments, the use of a treasury management system [TMS] will increase overall visibility for better-informed decisions, while mitigating the risk and loss of efficiency that comes with manual tasks.”</p>
<p>Michael Levens, Global Head of Payments at consultancy Delta Capita, says as industry in general has shifted to a new way of working, so too have corporate treasuries. “There has been a shift in the way that many corporate treasuries operate, moving away from the manual processes of the past and embracing new technologies and solutions to make themselves ready for the future,” he says. “Given the fast changing pace of the global economies treasuries have had to balance the aspirations of more digitisation and automation with the need to better manage broken risk processes and core regulatory asks.”</p>
<p>Treasuries are now more than ever looking at ways to optimise processes and hence reduce operational cost, he adds. “With a new wave of digital enablers covering everything to be digitalised from any type of assets to central bank money, there are numerous use cases that treasuries are examining to improve cost margins, especially with those scenarios that have high repeatable transaction volumes and existing manual processes.”</p>
<p>Writing in the Association of Corporate Treasurer’s (ACT’s) International Treasury Peer Review, Schutte says incorporating a digital treasury function enables a treasury team to focus on critical tasks “with less distraction, providing strategic insights for your organisation and enhancing controls”. As you look to start incorporating automation to eliminate errors and streamline operations, the first place to start is identifying whether a TMS would be beneficial.</p>
<p>While Ferguson has deployed a “fair bit” of digital technology, there is still much more it can implement, says Da Costa.</p>
<p>“There’s a balance to be struck between what digital technology is necessary to do your job as a treasurer and also what is necessary from the commercial side of the business.”</p>
<p>For many treasurers, digital still means “moving from paper and a physical signature to email communications”, says Naresh Aggarwal, Associate Director – Policy and Technical, ACT.</p>
<p>Digital is often defined as straight through processing (STP), but some treasuries are still only part-way through a digital journey, he notes. STP typically means processes are automated and there is little or no manual intervention. “A treasury might have a certain level of STP, but because of internal controls, documents may have to be printed out to be signed off. There is often a disconnect between the corporate culture and what it is trying to achieve and the delegation of authority.”</p>
<p>The most challenging processes for treasuries can be reporting, which is often manual and therefore time-consuming. “A big question today is how can companies move towards STP to have more real-time visibility while providing more informative reporting to key stakeholders,” says Aggarwal.</p>
<p>A corporate treasurer’s digital aspirations often will be tempered by the capabilities of its partner banks. Ferguson’s banks offer “fairly digitised” solutions, says Da Costa, but much of it is “low-hanging fruit”. However, with a TMS and cloud technology, a treasury can think about its digital aspirations, and what it can implement on a plug and play basis, particularly with the advent of application programming interface (API) technology.</p>
<p>“You cannot implement everything at once; for Ferguson, progress is one step at a time. We are cautious because we want to be confident that what we are doing is safe and correct,” he says.</p>
<p>Writing in the ACT peer review, Roshun Tulken, Group Treasurer, at distributor Mantrac Group, says the company spent six months conducting a global bank review and taking the time to select the right bank for each country from a digital capability perspective.</p>
<p>A capital-intensive business with high working capital requirements, Mantrac was seeking to make its cash management processes as efficient as possible. When Tulken joined the company it was operating with close to 100 bank branches with businesses manually tracking balances and some of the local banks had poor cash management capabilities, often paper based. Real-time visibility was also challenging, due to the lack of reporting and sheer number of banks, so the treasury operations were not efficient, he says.</p>
<p>In addition to choosing the right banks, Mantrac implemented a TMS, which gave it intraday visibility of cash balances. A direct connection to the Brussels-based financial messaging system SWIFT enabled the company to reduce its reliance on manual transfers and cheques and move to electronic payments across the group.</p>
<p>“Ultimately we were also able to vastly reduce the number of banks we were using, which streamlines operations and improves controls,” he says. For cash collections, the company has rolled out mobile money and e-wallet collections solutions, to move away from cash and cheque. This has reduced the clearing time, while also reducing the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>For Ivan de Crescenzo, Financial Analyst at Italian energy utility Tirreno Power, an overriding theme in treasury is digitisation. Much of this has been driven by changes to Italy’s electronic invoicing laws that became effective on 1st January 2022.</p>
<p>de Crescenzo, says an overriding theme in treasury is digitisation, driven largely by changes to Italy’s electronic invoicing laws which came into effect on 1st January 2022. Under the rules, in certain business-to-business cross-border transactions Italian entities will have to report details of transactions to the Italian tax authority under the same rules and processes that apply to mandatory e-invoicing between parties established in Italy.</p>
<p>Digitisation is “increasingly crucial” to meet the requirements of the new laws, he says. Corporates must receive digital documents from banks, not least because this makes life in treasury much easier, particularly with regard to reporting. “To be blunt, I would actually ditch a bank if it was unable to digitise documents for the accounts we have with them.”</p>
<p>de Crescenzo’s digital aspirations are focused on cash forecasting – understandable in an industry currently hit by turbulent global energy markets. The ability to more accurately forecast cash flows is becoming crucial. Tirreno Power’s treasury is focused on attaining tools to improve forecasting and give a better outlook on “how the numbers will move”, he says.</p>
<p>“Gas prices are skyrocketing and while we have tools for cash prediction, it is time for us to invest even more in machine learning and other technologies that will give us more sophisticated features,” he says. “The market is so complex now and that is why we must prioritise forecasting.”</p>
<p>Patricia Hines, Head of Corporate Banking Research at analysts Celent, says while year after year, corporates rank cash forecasting as a top priority, “they still struggle with basic cash visibility”.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers continually indicate interest in real-time capabilities for statement data and payments, but little progress has been made as corporates are largely satisfied with their existing corporate-to-bank connectivity options, she notes.</p>
<p>“Corporate treasurers are pursuing technology solutions that offer either software as a service or Cloud platform deployment, which much better suit departments with limited IT resources,” she says. “Treasuries are pursuing robotic process automation and artificial intelligence [AI] primarily for cash flow forecasting and cash application (receivables automation).”</p>
<p>Much as banks accelerated efforts to increase digitisation during the pandemic, treasuries also recognise the value from eliminating manual processes and increasing automation, she says.</p>
<p>The way digital technologies are developed has raised some concerns for Tirreno Power’s de Crescenzo. “Machine learning will be very useful, but I sometimes fear that fintech companies and banks might produce a black box product,” he says. “In corporate treasury, we need to know the algos that are included and how the system works. I feel that this control might slide out of our hands when it comes to machine learning-based forecasting solutions.”</p>
<p>Raising a treasury department’s ‘digital acumen’ is cited as a key priority for treasuries by the PwC 2021 Global Treasury Survey. Compared with 2019, the survey found that CFOs and treasurers were more focused on technology improvements and digital innovation. The primary investment targets of gaining efficiency and generating more impactful insights “point toward organisations laying a foundation to support an ultimate vision of enabling treasury on demand services”, says the report.</p>
<p>Half of the respondents said they were working towards the vision of a connected ecosystem that leverages advanced capabilities and analytics to empower CFOs and treasurers to make financial decisions in real time. “The pandemic underscored the need for real-time treasury data and insights as teams responded to intense cash and liquidity challenges while working remotely,” the report says.</p>
<p>APIs, software tools that connect systems and share data, and support real-time connectivity between corporates and banks, are becoming a priority for corporate treasuries, says the survey. It found that 90% of respondents expect APIs to be relevant in their function over the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Delta Capita’s Levens says the utilisation of API technologies to provide better integration and connectivity between systems and with clients and counterparts is one of the digital technology strategies for corporate treasuries. Other areas of focus include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Digitalisation of central bank money, coupled with new digital settlement technologies. This will hopefully provide the foundations for real-time access and on demand management of liquidity, payments and risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The long-term future of digital assets – which range from digital coins to asset tokenisation. Treasury departments and many other market actors are looking at new digital currencies and distributed ledger technology (DLT) as potential future replacements for traditional clearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data analytics using AI and machine learning to gain forward-looking insight rather than looking back just at past data. For instance, cash flow forecasting is one of the most essential functions of treasury and machine learning solutions will help build models, based on historical data and predict future cash flow, enabling treasuries to make better decisions about resource allocation and to manage risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Messaging standards such as the adoption of ISO 20022 across the financial community has a potential to improve payment reconciliations, which can help remove some of the manual processes from treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robotic process automation to address some of the well-established and mundane operational tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Andy Schmidt, Vice-President and Global Industry Lead, Banking at consultancy CGI, says APIs, which can be used to share information and execute transactions will get treasurers to “where they need to be”, delivering a “single pane of glass” of information and the ability to do something about it. “For example, if there is a cash shortfall in one part of the company, a treasury can use open banking and virtual account management to drag and drop funds over to where they are needed,” he says. “This is ideal for intercompany borrowing, which is cheaper than going to a bank.”</p>
<p>At present, corporate treasuries are a mix of “screens, spreadsheets and timing difficulties”, he adds. “It can take hours, if not days for a large corporate treasury to pull together an answer to the question ‘how much money do we have today?’ There is a mix of currencies, some systems are real-time, others are end of day. It is a real mishmash.”</p>
<p>A core digital aspiration is to tackle this by leveraging APIs and the solutions of fintechs to access the information and make it available in as few screens as possible, says Schmidt.</p>
<p>“The good news is that everyone is moving towards a common end state or next state, which is a more considered understanding of the use of APIs and more universal access to real-time systems,” he says. “It is the differences in timings of systems that is the hard part to address. Open banking and virtual account management will be central to solving this.”</p>
<p>ACT’s Aggarwal agrees timing presents difficulties for treasurers. “APIs can provide a chunk of real-time visibility but processing may only provide batch updates. If part of the information is in real time but some in batch a treasurer will not get a proper picture of what is going on. To do so requires business transformation, not just in the treasury, but across the business as a whole.”</p>
<p>Other digital aspirations of note, according to Schmidt, include the integration of accounts payable and receivable – a “great idea” that hasn’t caught on yet, he notes. Integration will enable greater visibility of incomings and outgoings.</p>
<p>Real-time access to information is also a priority aspiration for bank treasuries, says Nadeem Shamim, Global Head of Cash and Liquidity Management at fintech SmartStream Technologies. “A key aspiration right now for bank treasuries is real-time reporting and meeting regulators’ demands for them to be focused on more actively managing their real-time liquidity,” he says. As with corporate treasuries, the COVID-19 pandemic focused minds on the urgency of real-time liquidity management.</p>
<p>Previously, it was considered a costly exercise to implement real-time liquidity management but changing dynamics such as higher interest rates and the advent of faster payments is increasing interest among bank treasurers in real-time connectivity with internal and external systems. “Bank treasuries are looking to see if APIs can help them to address these issues,” says Shamim. “The reality is that banks have antiquated systems and they need to get to the data. Bank treasuries are looking to real-time clearing systems to release APIs for connectivity.”</p>
<p>One of the key challenges for treasuries to accelerate digital transformation is “fixing up the fundamentals, which remain a core focus”, says Delta Capita’s Levens. “From a recent event we held with a number of senior banking executives, they all agreed there needs to be a lot of progress on regulation, standards, and interoperability of digital assets; DLT; and central bank digitisation and tokenisation are to change the game. All agreed on the need for better regulation in areas such as processing times, amount of information carried, and interoperability. This would lead to better standards, or at least some minimum agreed standards.”</p>
<p>For Ferguson’s Da Costa, addressing treasury pain points is how a treasurer can build a business case for digital aspirations. “From a treasury view we are careful to look at technologies to implement that can add value, we are not trying to find solutions for problems that don’t exist,” he says.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing range of digital technologies on offer, Da Costa says the fundamentals of treasury – cash, liquidity and risk management – will not change. “These will still need to happen, but the processes we use to do them will have evolved along with the technology.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Much of the potential for digitisation to boost access to trade finance remains untapped. In June, the World Economic Forum observed that lack of digitisation and automation means access to trade finance as an asset class by institutional investors remains prohibitively expensive. However, the infrastructure is already in place to enable end-to-end straight through processing of hundreds of thousands of instruments in a low cost way, giving asset managers direct access to trade finance assets and enabling alternative investors to channel more capital into the market.</p>
<p>Last September, XDC Network and Tradeteq launched what they described as the world’s first trade finance-based non-fungible token (NFT) transaction with invoice finance company Accelerated Payments as the asset originator.</p>
<p>The transaction used XDC Network’s blockchain technology to transform trade finance assets into non-fungible tokens. Institutional investors can buy and sell these tokens – which represent the value of an off-chain asset – giving them legal entitlement to an asset or package of assets.</p>
<p>Ian Duffy, CEO of Accelerated Payments describes token-based fungible and non-fungible blockchain funding options as the future of trade finance. “A token-based, non-fungible financial instrument focuses on ownership and contract specifics,” he explains. “It evolves paper based (or electronic) contracts typically held by relevant investors incorporating expensive legal frameworks or compartments with no version control and/or dubious signature pages into cloud-based digital blockchain format that is verifiable, tamper proof, shareable and cost effective.”</p>
<p>According to Duffy there is strong demand from both institutional and retail investors for an asset class that is relatively low risk and pays a decent yield which includes receivable books. “The effect of non-fungible and fungible tokens will be to widen the access to such investment instruments as well as lowering the cost considerably with improved audit trail and transparency, similar to what has happened with quoted stocks and shares,” he adds.</p>
<p>When asked how many transactions have been performed to date and who has bought these NFTs, Nils Behling, Co-Founder and CFO at Tradeteq says the initial issuances have been placed with a limited number of sophisticated investors on a proof-of-concept basis.</p>
<p>“However, we are very active in the space and the case for real asset-backed crypto remains strong,” he adds.</p>
<p>The challenges of gaining traction in trade finance were underlined in June when digital trade platform we.trade closed its operations. But this hasn’t deterred other fintechs from exploring the potential of new trade and supply chain finance marketplaces.</p>
<p>In June 2021, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and Finastra commenced a pilot for a trade funding marketplace to provide small businesses in Ecuador with short-term liquidity for their trade operations by allowing bank and non-bank financers to finance their invoices. Iain MacLennan, Head of Trade and Supply Chain Finance at Finastra explains that the ICC TRADECOMM pilot is still running and that the company has been working with a number of partners to expand the proposed marketplace offering from the original proof of concept.</p>
<p>“We plan to announce these partnerships in the near future once we have concluded contractual discussions,” he says. “These partners will also offer these additional services outside of the pilot market. We are in commercial negotiation with a number of financiers to provide liquidity to the marketplace.”</p>
<p>According to MacLennan, Finastra has already identified the next two markets where it plans to deploy the platform, both of which are in Latin America with the second marketplace expected to launch in the middle of next year.</p>
<p>“In addition to these markets, we have been approached directly in regards to other markets in South East Asia, Africa and the Middle East, which we will investigate,” he adds.</p>
<p>The ICC is also behind the UK Centre for Digital Trade and Innovation launched in April, described as the first neutral forum for co-ordinating the efforts of governments and trade sectors to adopt legal and standards frameworks. With the Electronic Trade Documents Bill (expected to enter law later this year or early 2023) putting electronic trade documents on the same legal footing as their paper equivalents in the UK – and the extensive use of English law in bills of lading – the ICC reckons there is an opportunity to tackle bureaucracy on a global level.</p>
<p>Chris Southworth, Secretary-General of the ICC United Kingdom expects Germany to have similar legislation in place by next year and the rest of the G7 to have followed suit within five years. “We can now begin the process of connecting platforms and systems,” he says.</p>
<p>The centre is running live technology agnostic pilot testing of end-to-end supply chain transactions, starting with electronic bills of lading, and similar facilities are expected to emerge in Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands as well as Singapore and Thailand. Two other UK-based fintechs have been developing solutions that they say can help businesses release capital tied up in stock and payroll.</p>
<p>Hi promotes pay asset finance as a way to release working capital by externally financing a company’s payroll without adding debt to its balance sheet. The employer is charged a flat fee per employee per month to defer its payroll commitments and repays the amount financed after the two month deferral period plus the fee.</p>
<p>The fee depends on the size of the business, but according to Hi is ‘normally very competitive based on their current cost of capital’.</p>
<p>Supply@Me hopes to tap into the trend for companies to hold higher levels of stock that has emerged since the supply chain issues caused by the pandemic started to affect the freight and logistics sectors.</p>
<p>Its service is designed to enable companies with warehoused inventory to free up the value of this stock through an off-balance sheet solution, which allows firms to recognise inventory monetisation funds as a legal true sale.</p>
<p>Monetisation transactions can be facilitated for a wide range of inventory types providing the goods are stored in a warehouse and are not categorised as ‘slow moving’ or ‘non-moving’.</p>
<p>The banks are also keen to get in on the act. In March, Citi announced that it had started working with Stenn, a global platform providing SME funding, as part of the expansion of its global trade payables finance product offering to include deep-tier supplier financing – helping to provide access to funding across global supply chains.</p>
<p>Historically, deep-tier suppliers have had less access to credit as they are typically SMEs. Financing options available in the market have been limited or may come at a high cost.</p>
<p>“We hear first-hand from clients about the challenges their businesses are facing to extend support to manufacturers and second tier suppliers, whilst also having to shift their supply chains due to the current environment to retain continuity in procurement flows,” says Parvaiz Dalal, Global Head of Supply Chain Finance at Citi.</p>
<p>“Disruptions at any stage of the supply chain can have a knock-on effect to the upstream parties. Our aim is to reduce these disruptions by improving access to attractive financing at all levels of the supply chain, regardless of whether the supplier sells directly or indirectly to our client.”</p>
<p>The benefits include faster access to financing for downstream suppliers, often at a reduced cost compared to other options according to Dalal.</p>
<p>“Stenn’s digital onboarding experience helps support and address the working capital needs of both buyers and suppliers,” he adds. “As Citi maintains a trade relationship with the anchor buyer, all downstream participants can potentially benefit from this relationship and receive improved pricing.”</p>
<p>Other interesting recent developments include the acquisition of digital trade finance platform developer Bolero by logistics software firm WiseTech Global, and embedded business finance platform Liberis entering into a partnership with Barclaycard to offer their small business customers access to personalised revenue-based finance. Also in June, Dutch fintech Factris secured €10m of funding through asset manager NN Investment Partners. The company now offers factoring services in five EU countries after launching in Poland and Belgium in the first quarter of this year and will use the new funding to enter other European markets.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting – and potentially contentious – recent examples of innovation in trade finance is the evolution of buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) into a refined version of invoice factoring. B2B BNPL companies embed themselves in the supplier’s sale process and offer quasi-instant net terms to end customers. Suppliers get paid 100% of the invoice up front – minus the fee – with the BNPL company managing credit decisioning, bearing default risk, and managing collections. The platform providers use algorithms and credit checks to onboard customers.</p>
<p>The target audience for the service includes companies that lack assets such as real estate or inventory to put forward as security against loans. German B2B online workshop equipment marketplace Contorion started using Billie’s B2B BNPL service in 2018 when it encountered challenges around credit limits, risk identification and prevention.</p>
<p>The company’s credit limits were very low and while it paid for all the individual checks and everything was done to the best of its knowledge, technology or even data science was never part of the process explains Andreas Lehmann, SVP Operations.</p>
<p>“Also, customers had to wait for our manual order approval which was an issue for logistics cut-off times,” he says. “We realised we needed real time decisions and higher credit limits and were looking to outsource these processes – including managing the risk of customers not paying – as we also managed the dunning and encashment process in-house.”</p>
<p>With B2B BNPL, most of the orders Contorion receives are checked in real time. Customers therefore get an immediate decision and the order is ready to be processed immediately (although in rare cases Billie will put the order on hold to perform another check or see if the existing credit limit can be exceeded). Credit limits start at €7,500 but can be extended and customers have 30 days to pay their invoice from the date of shipment.</p>
<p>“Over the last four years our conversion rate has increased by more than half,” says Lehmann. “Almost two-thirds of all our customers use the invoice product provided by Billie at the checkout and the acceptance rate is 91%. The average order value for customers using BNPL is 28% higher than the average order value of those who use other payment methods.”</p>
<p>Brian Blank, Senior Manager at BNPL business services provider Splitit reckons there is considerable scope for the use of BNPL in B2B, especially among small companies.</p>
<p>“While getting it into mid-market and enterprise business may take a bit longer, there is a faster path in smaller businesses and sectors such as professional services,” he says. “Our services can be easily integrated into platforms through an API that can be turned on or off depending on the needs of their customers.”</p>

		<title><![CDATA[e-CNY trials push treasurers to prepare]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[


<p><em>China’s central bank digital currency – the e-CNY – is gathering pace with more users trialling it by the day. Although it has been designed for retail payments, treasurers who ignore its adoption and don’t prepare themselves for the future of CBDCs may live to regret it.</em></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The recent Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics showcased China’s ability to host an international event, and it was also an opportunity to show off its digital currency. Athletes and visitors used the e-CNY at the Olympic venues and the transaction figures point to a promising future for the central bank digital currency (CBDC). Approximately RMB3m (US$316,000) was spent each day at the event, according to reports that quoted Mu Changchun, Director-General of the PBOC’s Digital Currency Research Institute.</p>
<p>It could be easy for treasurers to think that because the e-CNY is still being piloted, there is no need to do anything just yet. However, the numbers are already staggering: by some estimates 140 million people have created e-CNY wallets and over 1.5 million merchants are already accepting e-CNY payments. With China’s population being so large, even its trialling of the CBDC is significant, and the project is much further ahead than the other major economies trying to get their digital currencies off the ground.</p>
<p>Urszula McCormack, a partner at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons (KWM) and specialist in the digital economy and emerging technologies, describes CBDCs as lying on a spectrum. At one end are the broad projects – such as China – where the digital currency seeks to renew the existing currency and potentially even replace cash. At the other end of the spectrum are projects that are very specific in their use case. One example is Australia’s Project Atom, which has trialled a wholesale application of a CBDC specifically for syndicated lending. “And then there is everything in between,” adds McCormack.</p>
<p>CBDCs are part of a wider story of renovating money, says McCormack. This includes real-time payments, more efficient cross-border payments and generally reducing friction, cost and time from transactions.</p>
<p>“As custodians of their institution’s wallet, treasurers need to know that the whole payments infrastructure is changing all around the world,” says McCormack. She uses an analogy to describe how various jurisdictions are approaching CBDCs: “Some are knocking down the house and rebuilding it. Others are adding a new room, while some are just giving the house a lick of paint,” says McCormack.</p>
<p>In China, for the companies that haven’t already been affected by the e-CNY trial, they need to start making plans. Linghao Bao, Analyst at Trivium China, explains that when it is legal tender, businesses will be obliged to accept it, if their customers want to use it.</p>
<p>“There’s time for businesses to get ready. And the central bank will ask big retail companies to test this first,” Bao adds. This is already happening and a number of large corporations have been involved in the pilots in various cities, including McDonald’s, ride-hailing app DiDi Chuxing, and the e-commerce company JD.com reportedly used e-CNY to pay its employees.</p>
<p>Aziz Parvez, head of Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Sales, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America, comments that some corporates have been trialling e-CNY for utility and tax payments. And when the project is rolled out further, corporates stand to benefit from the efficiencies the digital currency can bring. “A broader adoption of e-CNY would provide comprehensive benefits to treasurers, given e-CNY is legal tender and a digital version of the fiat currency issued by PBoC [People’s Bank of China],” he comments.</p>
<p>Retailers and e-commerce companies are a natural place for the e-CNY to be tested. For consumers, the e-CNY will seem like another payment option – alongside Alipay or WeChat Pay, for example – that is being offered by the retailer at the checkout. It may seem simple for the company to offer this additional option, but there are a number of considerations for treasurers as they understand how this new infrastructure operates behind the scenes. These include how their bank connects to the e-CNY systems, and how the e-CNY is converted into other currencies and held in accounts.</p>
<p>To use the currency, consumers will need to have an e-CNY digital wallet – typically an app on their smartphone – with funds loaded from their regular bank account that have been converted into e-CNY. Banks could offer this as part of their usual mobile banking service, but the e-CNY funds are different from the regular deposit accounts. Technically, e-CNY has the same quality as cash or, in economics parlance, M0 – the money that is in circulation and a liability of the central bank. This is distinct from M1 money that is deposited in bank accounts and is a liability of a commercial bank, and for this reason e-CNY has to be kept separate from regular bank deposits.</p>
<p>It is expected that the e-CNY issuance will occur in layers, with the PBoC – the central bank – at the top, issuing the currency to commercial banks, who will in turn make it available to their customers. Banks will make it available to both individual consumers and also companies. Also, non-bank financial institutions and other providers will be able to offer e-CNY wallets.</p>
<p>Parvez comments on the features of the digital currency and what it means for corporates and their treasurers: “With e-CNY, the only necessary intermediary would be the central bank. e-CNY would provide the benefits of shortened collection periods, because payments could be completed – finality – at the moment e-CNY is delivered as legal tender. It would additionally ease the process of account reconciliation through the end-to-end electronic solution. As such, the implementation would help treasuries achieve cost efficiencies and better cash flows management,” says Parvez.</p>
<p>For now, the e-CNY is a retail payment system and will have an impact on all types of corporates, although some more than others. Parvez says “the flows could be higher for corporates dealing in business to consumer, and consumer to business” transactions and the impact of the e-CNY would be greater for those companies.</p>
<p>Parvez comments that there are a number of things that treasurers can do to prepare ahead of the formal rollout of China’s CBDC. This includes setting up corporate guidelines to adopt digital wallets to accept e-CNY payments. They can also establish the necessary hardware and software to start accepting e-CNY, for example scanners for reading QR [quick response] codes, and software programs like online e-wallet transfer capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, Parvez continues, the newly-added software needs to be integrated with the company’s existing enterprise resource planning and treasury management system to streamline accounts reconciliation. This is especially important when processing anonymous transactions with missing payer information, he adds. Also, e-CNY adoption entails fewer hardware requirements – such as QR code scanners – so treasurers should focus more on software integration to enable online e-wallet transfer capabilities, offline e-CNY payment function and streamlined account reconciliation, says Parvez.</p>
<p>What would happen to the treasurers who don’t take any of the steps to prepare, or even ignore CBDCs altogether? KWM’s McCormack points out if CBDC use becomes mandatory in a particular market or for a particular type of transaction context – whether by law or contract – treasurers will inevitably need to evolve their own systems and processes, although access will likely still be through their banking and payment providers. When it comes to implementing the systems necessary to handle CBDCs, if they have been slow to react, they may find that they are at the back of the vendor queue, says McCormack.</p>
<p>Another issue, comments McCormack, is the contracts that treasurers have with their banks, for example, are likely to be updated to make sure they are relevant for CBDCs. This can present an opportunity to consider whether new payment or operational mechanisms would better suit their needs.</p>
<p>Could treasurers leave it to their banks to think about this on their behalf? Possibly, but it would be better for them to be ahead of the curve. McCormack says it is important for treasurers to start talking about CBDCs with their banking partners now, and by asking questions they are signalling that they expect their counterparts to have adequate plans and protections in place for handling CBDCs.</p>
<p>There are still quite a few unknowns with the new digital currencies. McCormack says that treasurers will need to grapple with the uncertainty surrounding the CBDCs for some time. In the case of e-CNY, for example, the specific technical integrations that will be necessary have not been made fully public, nor have the full gamut of onshore and offshore applications, and so what it actually means in practice for businesses and users still remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Treasurers are already used to digital payments, but the difference with this infrastructure – notes a recent Oliver Wyman report – is that this system is sponsored by the Chinese government rather than the private sector.</p>
<p>One of the concerns with the e-CNY and other CBDC projects is that the state will have eyes into corporations and will be able to have visibility of all their transactions. “In the case of e-CNY there is a very careful approach about what data is collected, who can see the data and for what purpose,” says McCormack. She explains that data provision is tiered and for low-value transactions there is not much data needed to onboard, whereas for high-value transactions, a lot more information would be needed. “Globally, data privacy and security is always in the top two or three issues that are debated when designing the architecture for CBDCs,” McCormack says, adding that the debate focuses on protecting both personal and professional privacy, as well as protecting the data from cyber criminals.</p>
<p>Another feature of CBDCs – with them being issued by central banks – is how they can be liberalised and extended into a cross-border, and offshore system. If the Chinese government liberalises the e-CNY – in a similar way as it has done with the internationalisation of the renminbi – it could accelerate the renminbi’s adoption as a global trade currency, according to Oliver Wyman. For now the e-CNY is a retail system, but if its use is extended to cover wholesale payments, and is used by large institutions for cross-border transactions, it could supersede the dominance of the US dollar. If cross-border transactions are in e-CNY, and use the new payment rails, it could bypass the need for SWIFT’s messaging and its correspondent banking network. “A new dawn of currency is upon us, and the time to act is now,” the Oliver Wyman report states.</p>
<p>The e-CNY project is effectively “super-charging a currency and making it super competitive because of how easy it is to use,” explains McCormack. With buyers and suppliers on a Belt and Road project, for example, they could transact via their CBDC wallets. “They can make that payment in a trusted and auditable way – to a degree not available for cash or traditional banking rails. It is an extremely compelling proposition,” says McCormack.</p>
<p>The currency could be used by overseas companies for transactions that don’t reach China onshore, much in the same way as the offshore renminbi – or CNH – has been used. At the moment it is unknown how far the e-CNY will be internationalised and if it will be available for offshore companies to pay counterparts in China or vice versa.</p>
<p>If, however, the e-CNY is extended to cross-border usage it could provide substantial savings. Oliver Wyman’s ‘Digital Currency Battleground’ report estimates that if the CBDC could be used between China and Singapore there would be costs savings of SG$16bn to SG$24bn, or up to 5% of Singapore’s GDP.</p>
<p>With China leading the way in the central bank digital currencies, other markets – and treasurers more generally – need to take note. And a global, interoperable infrastructure for CBDCs is already being considered as other countries explore what the implications of the e-CNY will be. A prototype has already been built for multiple Central Bank Digital Currencies (mCBDCs), which is being developed by the Bank for International Settlements, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of Thailand, the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The mCBDC platform has so far demonstrated how CBDCs can offer more efficient cross-border payments and settlements for treasurers – and their bankers. They are real-time, cheaper and safer and 24/7. In a trial of the mCBDC platform, international transfers and foreign exchange transactions occurred in seconds – a vast improvement on the several days that treasurers are used to waiting for their cross-border transactions to be completed.</p>
<p>For the e-CNY to be broadly adopted and used, there will be a number of factors at play. Parvez notes that the wide adoption of China’s CBDC will depend on the PBoC’s coordination with central and commercial banks around the world. Also, another factor that will be crucial to the e-CNY’s success will be the new system for cross-border settlement, which will be something similar to the current Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS) but with the ability to issue digital wallets to global users. And finally, Parvez notes, adoption will depend on the new regulatory framework globally.</p>
<p>Once the e-CNY does start to gain traction, however, it will open up new opportunities for corporates. It will be possible to rethink the way transactions are done, and in a sense the e-CNY is underpinning – or facilitating – China’s digital economy. With its clean slate, the e-CNY infrastructure can be built specifically to interact with other cutting-edge technologies, such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence. And, once the e-CNY is in place, it could spur other organisations to innovate with solutions that haven’t been possible before.</p>
<p>“For some treasurers it is unnecessary to think about CBDCs right now. For others it may be quite exciting for them or their group entities to be able to programme payments in a certain way and to explore the opportunities relating to the digitisation of money.”</p>
<p>This echoes the possibilities that Brett Turner, Founder and CEO of Trovata – a provider of an open banking platform that automates cash management – told Treasury Today <a href="/technology/emerging-technology/niche-or-normal-treasurers-decide-on-digital-currencies-ttb2b">in a previous interview</a>. He notes the biggest pain for treasurers is still cross-border payments, and CBDCs have the opportunity to do something about it. He notes that with CBDCs, “You can architect modern technology from the ground up and everything else – all this existing technology – becomes obsolete and you get a chance to have a complete reboot of all that,” says Turner.</p>
<p>And he urged treasurers to think about getting their systems ready now: “The time is now to start thinking about your technology and systems environment,” says Turner. “People need to start being ready,” he added.</p>
<p>As the e-CNY trials gather pace, it will become more urgent for treasurers to consider how China’s CBDC – and other digital currencies more generally – will impact them and their treasury operations. For those who don’t act now, they could lose out.</p>

<p><em>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are quickly moving from a concept to a reality as dozens of countries around the world are exploring and trialling them. Treasurers need to consider how to get ready – otherwise, they risk falling behind and missing out on the benefits that CBDCs can bring.</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are now being explored – in some form or other – in more than 100 countries, and treasurers will need to be prepared for their eventual rollout.</p>
<p>“We have moved beyond conceptual discussions of CBDCs and we are now in the phase of experimentation. Central banks are rolling up their sleeves and familiarising themselves with the bits and bytes of digital money,” Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director, said in a recent speech in Washington.</p>
<p>“These are still early days for CBDCs and we don’t quite know how far and how fast they will go. What we know is that central banks are building capacity to harness new technologies – to be ready for what may lie ahead.”</p>
<p>In the same vein, treasurers also need to get ready for the journey ahead. Urszula McCormack, a partner at law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons (KWM) and specialist in the digital economy and emerging technologies, describes CBDCs as lying on a spectrum. At one end are the broad projects – such as China – where the digital currency seeks to renew the existing currency and potentially even replace cash. At the other end of the spectrum are projects that are very specific in their use case. One example is Australia’s Project Atom, which has trialled a wholesale application of a CBDC specifically for syndicated lending. “And then there is everything in between,” adds McCormack.</p>
<p>CBDCs are part of a wider story of renovating money, says McCormack. This includes real-time payments, more efficient cross-border payments and generally reducing friction, cost and time from transactions.</p>
<p>“As custodians of their institution’s wallet, treasurers need to know that the whole payments infrastructure is changing all around the world,” says McCormack. She uses an analogy to describe how various jurisdictions are approaching CBDCs: “Some are knocking down the house and rebuilding it. Others are adding a new room, while some are just giving the house a lick of paint,” says McCormack.</p>
<p>In China, for the companies that haven’t already been affected by the e-CNY trial, they need to start making plans. Linghao Bao, Analyst at Trivium China, explains that when it is legal tender, businesses will be obliged to accept it, if their customers want to use it.</p>
<p>“There’s time for businesses to get ready. And the central bank will ask big retail companies to test this first,” Bao adds. This is already happening and a number of large corporations have been involved in the pilots in various cities, including McDonald’s, ride-hailing app DiDi Chuxing, and the e-commerce company JD.com reportedly used e-CNY to pay its employees.</p>
<p>Aziz Parvez, head of Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Sales, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America, comments that some corporates have been trialling e-CNY for utility and tax payments. And when the project is rolled out further, corporates stand to benefit from the efficiencies the digital currency can bring. “A broader adoption of e-CNY would provide comprehensive benefits to treasurers, given e-CNY is legal tender and a digital version of the fiat currency issued by People’s Bank of China (PBoC),” he comments.</p>
<p>Retailers and e-commerce companies are a natural place for the e-CNY to be tested. For consumers, the e-CNY will seem like another payment option – alongside Alipay or WeChat Pay, for example – that is being offered by the retailer at the checkout. It may seem simple for the company to offer this additional option, but there are a number of considerations for treasurers as they understand how this new infrastructure operates behind the scenes. These include how their bank connects to the e-CNY systems, and how the e-CNY is converted into other currencies and held in accounts.</p>
<p>To use the currency, consumers will need to have an e-CNY digital wallet – typically an app on their smartphone – with funds loaded from their regular bank account that have been converted into e-CNY. Banks could offer this as part of their usual mobile banking service, but the e-CNY funds are different from the regular deposit accounts. Technically, e-CNY has the same quality as cash or, in economics parlance, M0 – the money that is in circulation and a liability of the central bank. This is distinct from M1 money that is deposited in bank accounts and is a liability of a commercial bank, and for this reason e-CNY has to be kept separate from regular bank deposits.</p>
<p>It is expected that the e-CNY issuance will occur in layers, with the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) – the central bank – at the top, issuing the currency to commercial banks, who will in turn make it available to their customers. Banks will make it available to both individual consumers and also companies. Also, non-bank financial institutions and other providers will be able to offer e-CNY wallets.</p>
<p>Parvez comments on the features of the digital currency and what it means for corporates and their treasurers: “With e-CNY, the only necessary intermediary would be the central bank. e-CNY would provide the benefits of shortened collection periods, because payments could be completed – finality – at the moment e-CNY is delivered as legal tender. It would additionally ease the process of account reconciliation through the end-to-end electronic solution. As such, the implementation would help treasuries achieve cost efficiencies and better cash flows management,” says Parvez.</p>
<p>For now, the e-CNY is a retail payment system and will have an impact on all types of corporates, although some more than others. Parvez says “the flows could be higher for corporates dealing in business to consumer, and consumer to business” transactions and the impact of the e-CNY would be greater for those companies.</p>
<p>Parvez comments that there are a number of things that treasurers can do to prepare ahead of the formal rollout of China’s CBDC. This includes setting up corporate guidelines to adopt digital wallets to accept e-CNY payments. They can also establish the necessary hardware and software to start accepting e-CNY, for example scanners for reading QR [quick response] codes, and software programs like online e-wallet transfer capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, Parvez continues, the newly-added software needs to be integrated with the company’s existing enterprise resource planning and treasury management system to streamline accounts reconciliation. This is especially important when processing anonymous transactions with missing payer information, he adds. Also, e-CNY adoption entails fewer hardware requirements – such as QR code scanners – so treasurers should focus more on software integration to enable online e-wallet transfer capabilities, offline e-CNY payment function and streamlined account reconciliation, says Parvez.</p>
<p>What would happen to the treasurers who don’t take any of the steps to prepare, or even ignore CBDCs altogether? KWM’s McCormack points out if CBDC use becomes mandatory in a particular market or for a particular type of transaction context – whether by law or contract – treasurers will inevitably need to evolve their own systems and processes, although access will likely still be through their banking and payment providers. When it comes to implementing the systems necessary to handle CBDCs, if they have been slow to react, they may find that they are at the back of the vendor queue, says McCormack.</p>
<p>Another issue, comments McCormack, is the contracts that treasurers have with their banks, for example, are likely to be updated to make sure they are relevant for CBDCs. This can present an opportunity to consider whether new payment or operational mechanisms would better suit their needs.</p>
<p>Could treasurers leave it to their banks to think about this on their behalf? Possibly, but it would be better for them to be ahead of the curve. McCormack says it is important for treasurers to start talking about CBDCs with their banking partners now, and by asking questions they are signalling that they expect their counterparts to have adequate plans and protections in place for handling CBDCs.</p>
<p>There are still quite a few unknowns with the new digital currencies. McCormack says that treasurers will need to grapple with the uncertainty surrounding the CBDCs for some time. In the case of e-CNY, for example, the specific technical integrations that will be necessary have not been made fully public, nor have the full gamut of onshore and offshore applications, and so what it actually means in practice for businesses and users still remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Treasurers are already used to digital payments, but the difference with this infrastructure – notes a recent Oliver Wyman report – is that this system is sponsored by the Chinese government rather than the private sector.</p>
<p>One of the concerns with the e-CNY and other CBDC projects is that the state will have eyes into corporations and will be able to have visibility of all their transactions. “In the case of e-CNY there is a very careful approach about what data is collected, who can see the data and for what purpose,” says McCormack. She explains that data provision is tiered and for low-value transactions there is not much data needed to onboard, whereas for high-value transactions, a lot more information would be needed. “Globally, data privacy and security are always in the top two or three issues that are debated when designing the architecture for CBDCs,” McCormack says, adding that the debate focuses on protecting both personal and professional privacy, as well as protecting the data from cyber-criminals.</p>
<p>Another feature of CBDCs – with them being issued by central banks – is how they can be liberalised and extended into a cross-border, and offshore system. If the Chinese government liberalises the e-CNY – in a similar way as it has done with the internationalisation of the renminbi – it could accelerate the renminbi’s adoption as a global trade currency, according to Oliver Wyman. For now the e-CNY is a retail system, but if its use is extended to cover wholesale payments, and is used by large institutions for cross-border transactions, it could supersede the dominance of the US dollar. If cross-border transactions are in e-CNY, and use the new payment rails, it could bypass the need for SWIFT’s messaging and its correspondent banking network. “A new dawn of currency is upon us, and the time to act is now,” the Oliver Wyman report states.</p>
<p>The e-CNY project is effectively “super-charging a currency and making it super competitive because of how easy it is to use,” explains McCormack. With buyers and suppliers on a Belt and Road project, for example, they could transact via their CBDC wallets. “They can make that payment in a trusted and auditable way – to a degree not available for cash or traditional banking rails. It is an extremely compelling proposition,” says McCormack.</p>
<p>The currency could be used by overseas companies for transactions that don’t reach China onshore, much in the same way as the offshore renminbi – or CNH – has been used. At the moment it is unknown how far the e-CNY will be internationalised and if it will be available for offshore companies to pay counterparts in China or vice versa.</p>
<p>If, however, the e-CNY is extended to cross-border usage it could provide substantial savings. Oliver Wyman’s ‘Digital Currency Battleground’ report estimates that if the CBDC could be used between China and Singapore there would be costs savings of SG$16bn to SG$24bn, or up to 5% of Singapore’s GDP.</p>
<p>With China leading the way in the central bank digital currencies, other markets – and treasurers more generally – need to take note. And a global, interoperable infrastructure for CBDCs is already being considered as other countries explore what the implications of the e-CNY will be. A prototype has already been built for multiple Central Bank Digital Currencies (mCBDCs), which is being developed by the Bank for International Settlements, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of Thailand, the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The mCBDC platform has so far demonstrated how CBDCs can offer more efficient cross-border payments and settlements for treasurers – and their bankers. They are real-time, cheaper and safer and 24/7. In a trial of the mCBDC platform, international transfers and foreign exchange transactions occurred in seconds – a vast improvement on the several days that treasurers are used to waiting for their cross-border transactions to be completed.</p>
<p>For the e-CNY to be broadly adopted and used, there will be a number of factors at play. Parvez notes that the wide adoption of China’s CBDC will depend on the PBoC’s coordination with central and commercial banks around the world. Also, another factor that will be crucial to the e-CNY’s success will be the new system for cross-border settlement, which will be something similar to the current Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS) but with the ability to issue digital wallets to global users. And finally, Parvez notes, adoption will depend on the new regulatory framework globally.</p>
<p>Once the e-CNY does start to gain traction, however, it will open up new opportunities for corporates. It will be possible to rethink the way transactions are done, and in a sense the e-CNY is underpinning – or facilitating – China’s digital economy. With its clean slate, the e-CNY infrastructure can be built specifically to interact with other cutting-edge technologies, such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence. And, once the e-CNY is in place, it could spur other organisations to innovate with solutions that haven’t been possible before.</p>
<p>“For some treasurers it is unnecessary to think about CBDCs right now. For others it may be quite exciting for them or their group entities to be able to programme payments in a certain way and to explore the opportunities relating to the digitisation of money.”</p>
<p>This echoes the possibilities that Brett Turner, Founder and CEO of Trovata – a provider of an open banking platform that automates cash management – told Treasury Today in a <a href="/technology/emerging-technology/niche-or-normal-treasurers-decide-on-digital-currencies-ttb2b">previous interview</a>. He notes the biggest pain for treasurers is still cross-border payments, and CBDCs have the opportunity to do something about it. He notes that with CBDCs, “You can architect modern technology from the ground up and everything else – all this existing technology – becomes obsolete and you get a chance to have a complete reboot of all that,” says Turner.</p>
<p>And he urged treasurers to think about getting their systems ready now: “The time is now to start thinking about your technology and systems environment,” says Turner. “People need to start being ready,” he added.</p>
<p>As the e-CNY trials gather pace, it will become more urgent for treasurers to consider how China’s CBDC – and other digital currencies more generally – will impact them and their treasury operations. For those who don’t act now, they could lose out.</p>

<p><em>Cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies are hot topics in the financial industry, and they are quickly becoming mainstream. Treasurers need to think about the implications of digital currencies now and decide what they need to do to get ready for a wave of change that is coming their way.</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>If you were facing the biggest disruption that financial services had ever seen, what kind of treasurer would you be? One who embraces innovation… or one who ignores it? That is a question treasurers could be asking themselves in the face of digital currencies and whether they have the potential to completely disrupt treasury services as they are currently known.</p>
<p>Treasurers differ in their mindset when it comes to digital currencies, comments Brad Yasar, Founder and CEO of EQIFI. There are those who have a positive outlook, who are exploring opportunities even if they are not getting involved in them right now. And then there are the more old-school types, who do not want to touch any of it. Of cryptocurrencies, these treasurers have typically heard J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon “bashing crypto” and see Tesla’s maverick CEO Elon Musk investing in it, and they look at crypto as something that will disappear, says Yasar. “But they have been looking at it as a ‘scam’ for the past 12 years. It has not disappeared, and it keeps growing. I do not think that camp gives it the time and attention it needs. Some people are completely anti alternative investments,” he says. And that is a missed opportunity, adds Yasar, who is a serial entrepreneur, and also founder of EQIFI, which is positioning itself as the leader in decentralised finance, and offers a single platform for banking, trading and lending for fiat and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>“This ain’t going away; it’s not a flash in the pan,” says Luke Sully, Co-Founder and CEO, Ledgermatic, on the topic of digital currencies and digital assets.</p>
<p>And treasurers are well placed to take advantage of digital currencies. In fact, if corporations are going to innovate with Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, stablecoins and the like, the natural place for that innovation to start is with the treasurer.</p>
<p>The first step is to perhaps consider Bitcoin as an investment. Earlier this year Tesla invested US$1.5bn in Bitcoin, and when that news broke, Sully –whose company Ledgermatic enables treasurers to manage their traditional and digital assets in one place – said he received a lot of calls. Although other companies, such as business intelligence Microstrategy and payments company Square, have also invested in Bitcoin, the uptake hasn’t been what some thought it would be. “We have not seen many companies put it on the balance sheet – that did not really take off, for a variety of reasons,” says Sully.</p>
<p>And for treasurers, there is a lot to consider. Michael Aandahl, Head of Digital Treasury at Ingka Group, the largest IKEA franchisee with 392 stores in 32 countries, has looked into the multi-faceted topic of digital currencies. The first question he asked was whether the group’s customers would be interested in this as a payment form. “We did not identify any immediate customer demand that is specific to our industry,” he tells Treasury Today. The experience of retailers, however, is likely to be different from corporates that are already in the financial chain– such as consumer payments companies – where digital currencies are already a hot topic and have more relevance in the near-term to their customer base, he comments.</p>
<p>Aandahl explains that Ingka Group also considered Bitcoin as an asset class. “We have had that discussion and we decided it is not for us for various reasons,” he says. He adds that Bitcoin as an investment does not fit into the classic treasury mandate. It was ruled out, especially given the environmental concerns about the mining process. From an ESG [environmental, social and governance] point of view, it was “not going to fly”, considering what the company values are, he says.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin as an asset, it’s not just the ESG concerns that treasurers are grappling with. Reporting Bitcoin on the balance sheet is a sophisticated accounting problem, says Sully. Also, there are the practicalities of managing a portfolio of crypto investments. If corporates do hold Bitcoin, it is likely to be held in siloed wallets on various exchanges, with little visibility – or controls, for that matter – about who can move it there. A “half-sophisticated” investor has probably got five to six different accounts on various exchanges, explains Sully, all of which aren’t related to anything else they are doing. This leaves a treasurer logging into one account at a time. “We thought this is a disaster for crypto hedge funds. Someone will want to know their position and it will take an hour to figure that out.”</p>
<p>Also, there is the issue of the changing value of crypto. As Yasar points out, “Crypto is continuous – the value continuously changes. It may change 20% in a day.”</p>
<p>Brett Turner, Founder and CEO of Trovata – an open banking platform that companies use for real-time cash forecasting, cash reporting and cash flow analysis – explains how it has helped one of its largest customers, Square, with its cryptocurrency holdings. Trovata’s platform enables it to know its cash position in real-time. Unlike traditional treasury management systems, which were typically designed over 20 years ago, Trovata leverages cloud technology, big data architecture and APIs to deliver real-time cash reporting to treasurers. When it comes to managing Bitcoin as a digital asset, treasurers would not normally be able to see this as part of their overall cash position. With Trovata’s solution, however, they can see the real-time value of the Bitcoin and know what the US dollar equivalent is at any point in time.</p>
<p>Square is unusual when compared to the typical company and most treasurers are still wary of investing in Bitcoin. “Because of the volatility concerns, very few treasurers are wading into it,” says Turner. Some treasurers, however, are updating their treasury policies so they can buy it. They are considering Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, especially in a low-interest rate environment where they are searching for yield and rethinking their options.</p>
<p>There are still ways for treasurers to explore these options at arm’s length. They may want to have exposure to a fund of a fund that is invested in crypto, such as Pantera Capital or Galaxy Digital, for example, explains Yasar.</p>
<p>In terms of persuading people who are reticent, Yasar says, “Think of crypto as an insurance policy. Do not look at it as ‘I’m going to make money this is a solid investment’… If it is a complete scam, you paid your premium and nothing happened. But what happens if it disrupts your business? If you have invested – you have disrupted your own industry,” he says. And to EQIFI’s institutional partners he says, “Do not try to make a meaningful investment. Do a small investment and do it for the long-term – as an insurance policy.”</p>
<p>There are some corporations out there that are more forward-thinking than this. Another way to explore the potential of crypto, is to invest in an internal lab or exploratory group. Some companies may even put aside US$10m or US$20m for such a project, comments Yasar. This could include exploring how to mine Bitcoin themselves, which gives them certainty over the cryptocurrency’s provenance and knowledge that it has not been associated with illicit activity in the past.</p>
<p>So far, much of the focus on digital currencies has been on Bitcoin as a store of value, comments Turner. In terms of its function as a payment mechanism, Turner says there are inherent problems with transferring funds this way, “It can still take a few hours to settle,” he says of Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>Given this slow time to settle, it’s unlikely that Bitcoin would be used as an alternative payments network for a corporate’s regular transactions. For consumer-facing companies, however, they may need to consider Bitcoin as a payment form so that they can accept it from their customers. Yasar points out that it is possible for companies to accept Bitcoin payments from customers without holding it on the books and carrying the risks of volatility. There may be risk while the customer has items in their online cart, but once they check out – paying in crypto – companies can quickly divest out of it, explains Yasar.</p>
<p>When it comes to digital currencies as a payment method, there has also been a lot of interest in stablecoins, which are digital coins that are backed by a regular fiat currency to make them ‘stable’ and smooth out any volatility.</p>
<p>Turner expects to see stable coins being used more widely, especially as a means of payment. Private companies could effectively issue their own currencies. Sully expects to see the same. “People are doing a lot of building this year,” he says, adding it won’t take long before the most well-known brands are issuing their own coins. Such stablecoins could be used for loyalty schemes, for example, or perhaps an alternative to retailer-branded gift cards.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Meanwhile central banks around the world are making plans to introduce their own digital currencies, which would, in effect, be digital versions of money they issue. The biggest pain point for treasurers, comments Turner, is cross-border payments, which can still take several days to settle across an outdated and complex system. With central bank digital currencies, however, there is the opportunity to change that. “With the digital coins you can architect modern technology from the ground up and everything else – all this existing technology – becomes obsolete and you get a chance to have a complete reboot of all that,” says Turner.</p>
<p>For now, it seems that the central banks are still working out how these currencies would actually work in practice. And what about treasurers who say they don’t need to think about digital currencies yet? “They should invest time in understanding the dynamics and the evolution of this market. If any of this takes off in a serious way it will have a significant impact,” says Aandahl. “This has the potential to impact the whole financial world, and customers need to be prepared upfront if that happens,” he says.</p>
<p>Also, Aandahl adds that he’s not just considering the outlook for digital currencies in his role as a treasurer, but also in terms of what it means for the business he is supporting. In many respects, he takes on the role of a translator who explains what these latest technologies are and what their implications could be.</p>
<p>So, when should treasurers get their systems ready for digital currencies? “The time is now to start thinking about your technology and systems environment. People are still using Excel – they need to start thinking about next-generation technology. They need to think about open banking and how their bank can help them with these changes,” says Turner. “People need to start being ready,” he adds.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>China is about to roll out a digital yuan that could ultimately replace physical cash with a digital wallet app for users to store their e-CNY. Successful trials have been run in four cities and a nationwide roll-out is planned early next year at the Beijing Winter Olympics. e-CNY, just like the paper yuan, will serve as a legal tender issued by the central bank, circulated to the public via commercial banks. Companies need to ready operational and technological processes to allow for the new payment option that will make payments real time, cut costs, reduce bank dominance and encourage innovation. It could also propel the renminbi (RMB) into a significant trade currency. More controversially, it gives the Chinese government sight of all transactions with implications for how companies operate.</p>
<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>
<p>China is not introducing the digital yuan to challenge the dollar or push a new international payment rail. Charting the momentum that has steadily built behind the e-currency over the last two years, Hong Kong-based Michael Ho, a Principal in Oliver Wyman’s Corporate and Institutional Banking practice, argues the key driver to its introduction is the Chinese government’s bid to break away from private sector reliance on critical payments infrastructure. The bulk of national payments now go through Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay, he explains. “Over 90% of the mobile payment market is dominated by two internet firms. If Alipay was to fail, what is the failsafe alternative that the country can rely on to move billions of cash every day?”</p>
<p>Its launch also sits within the context of a changing regulatory environment for tech businesses as the government reins them in. Witness the crackdown on Didi following the ride hailing app’s listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the sudden cancellation of Ant Group’s IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong last year.</p>



<blockquote><p>In the long-term, if the adoption of e-CNY increases, it would provide more substantial support to the internationalisation of the RMB.</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">
<a href="">Parvez Aziz, Managing Director and Regional Corporate Sales Head, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America</a> </p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>The tables have turned, and now the country’s tech giants have little choice but to co-operate with the government’s plan to disrupt them. Alipay is testing the e-CNY, Alibaba accepts it for online grocery purchases and at its food delivery service Ele.me. Didi, food delivery giant Meituan and ecommerce group JD.com are also introducing payments via e-CNY. As of June, consumers and corporates have opened 24m e-CNY wallets and spent Rmb35bn ($5.4bn) in 71m transactions for paying utility bills, buying food or taking the metro, among other things, according to a recent PBOC white paper.</p>
<h4 id="benefits">Benefits</h4>
<p>The regulatory regime is still unclear, but e-CNY enthusiasts point to important benefits ahead. Its real-time characteristics could unlock trapped funding in corporates’ payments processes, reduce financing costs and free up corporate liquidity. Expect faster reconciliation of payments, better efficiency and security and more freedom to transact in RMB without opening an account for settlement, says Parvez Aziz, Managing Director and Regional Corporate Sales Head, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America. “The e-CNY will enable payments to be made directly between payees and beneficiaries instantaneously, removing intermediaries like correspondent banks and the associated fees and charges. The only necessary middleman would be the central bank.”</p>
<p>Other elements are more worrying, however. It is programmable, making it possible for the government to track and monitor all e-CNY transactions and ending the anonymity of decentralised physical cash or bitcoin. “Of course, if the Chinese government wants to look into a transaction it already can, but this gives it full visibility on every individual transaction going on,” says Ho. Zennon Kapron is Founder and Director of Kapronasia, one of Asia’s leading financial technology research and consulting firms. He warns it could lead to business or individual wallets being frozen, and raises important issues regarding domestic and multinational companies’ operations in China. “You can’t stuff e-CNY under the mattress – the government will always be in control.”</p>
<h4 id="policy">Policy</h4>
<p>This control will become a policy lever to regulate how money flows. Positively, it could lead to more flows to China’s cash-starved SMEs, suggests Kapron. Traditional commercial banks find it costly and risky to lend to SMEs. Now a digital currency could boost the government’s efforts to get banks to lend more. “Historically the government has not had control of how much banks lend to SMEs,” he explains. “But a programmable currency could remain inactive until it gets into the wallet of an SME. Unusable until it hit its intended recipient, it gives the Chinese government the ability to fine tune fiscal policy.”</p>
<p>In another example, unlike physical cash, e-CNY can have an expiry date that once passed takes the currency out of circulation. “If the economy slows down, the government could boost consumer spending by setting expiry dates [to hasten spending] on the e-CNY,” says Aziz.</p>
<h4 id="cross-border">Cross border</h4>
<p>It also heralds changes in the use of the RMB in a cross-border context, potentially allowing China to transfer money across borders and enable users to avoid going through the dollar-based international payment SWIFT system. Although the e-CNY is currently only designed for the domestic market, the Chinese government has announced plans to work with G20 and other organisations to develop cross-border settlement of e-CNY. It has joined central banks in Hong Kong, Thailand and the UAE to explore cross-border e-CNY payments through DLT, and in June began piloting e-CNY settlement in Hong Kong. In short, by facilitating the use of e-CNY in the region and enabling cross-border money transfer, China is advancing efforts to internationalise the yuan which currently accounts for only 2% of the world’s FX reserves. “Companies should pay close attention to developments outside of China,” advises Aziz.</p>
<p>Of course, the RMB is currently restricted under capital controls, with access based on a quota system. New rules will have to be drawn up, says Kapron. “If there was wide adoption of the e-CNY you could have a situation where the currency is swapped and circumnavigates capital controls. It is still up in the air how the government will navigate this from a rules perspective.”</p>
<p>It holds implications for international banks serving US dollar transactions in some regions. For example, in Hong Kong foreign banks may begin to adopt the e-CNY over the dollar to serve changing client needs. “It will become more efficient to settle in RMB in Hong Kong where you already have a lot of Chinese corporates operating,” predicts Ho. “Hong Kong is just the kind of environment for the e-CNY to get really good adoption.” Moreover, as the use of e-CNY spreads so it becomes more expensive for companies to transact in currencies based on traditional, old school payment infrastructure. There will be a cost for banks, and therefore companies, associated with legacy infrastructure, predicts Ho. “International banks have always had good US dollar liquidity and served their clients best in dollars. The transition won’t happen overnight, but the dollar’s position in cross border payments could be challenged.”</p>
<p>Beyond Hong Kong, Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), trade flows could be conducted in e-CNY given much of this lending is already in RMB. Looking further ahead, e-CNY could filter into corporate supply chains in line with companies’ digitisation of their logistics operations, suggests Aziz. “The adoption of e-CNY for cross-border trade may see more companies leveraging China’s digital logistics networks to access quicker and more accurate information on their shipment flows. In the long term, if the adoption of e-CNY increases, it would provide more substantial support to the internationalisation of the RMB.”</p>
<p>It also offers Beijing the chance to sidestep SWIFT and US sanctions. Countries which are not common currency partners and want access to RMB can settle in RMB directly, no longer having to go via the US dollar. “The US has visibility on nearly all US dollar transactions,” explains Kapron. However, he doesn’t believe the dollar will be replaced any time soon. Commodities are priced in dollars, and it remains the most fungible currency out there. “Just because you have an electronic version of the RMB, it doesn’t mean that commodities will be priced in RMB or that its fungibility will suddenly increase.”</p>
<h4 id="bank-impact">Bank impact</h4>
<p>The digital currency poses important changes for commercial banks. It means money will move in real time, impacting their liquidity positions. “A lot of capital trapped in payment process is now freed up and will move much more quickly. This will bring liquidity management challenges for the banks,” says Ho. Moreover, he warns banks (and corporates) to expect real pressure from policy makers and regulators to start using the currency.</p>
<p>It also promises to open the competition, introducing a payment infrastructure that other market participants will be able to access. For sure, banks will be able to leverage the infrastructure to broaden their own offering. But so will non-banking organisations, suddenly able to offer their customers payment applications over the same infrastructure, undeterred by costs and benefiting from the democratisation of the payments market. “The concept of banking as a service will become increasingly prevalent,” predicts Ho. For example, telecoms companies or travel agencies with an e-commerce platform will be able to provide their own version of a banking service. Although transactional banking and FX will remain banks’ domain, another wave of competition is bound to follow their recent loss of retail business to fintechs. “Staying relevant could be an issue,” predicts Kapron.</p>
<p>That said, the ability of the government to usurp the popularity of current e-commerce payment tools will be determined by e-CNY functionality and user experience. “This is where existing payment tools probably have an edge given their prevalence within and outside of China,” says Aziz, who suggests the e-CNY could see more ready acceptance in areas like utility and tax payments.</p>
<h4 id="corporates-get-ready">Corporates get ready</h4>
<p>Corporates should prepare by assessing how the digital currency will impact their payments model and client experience, exploring how it will cut across their e-commerce channels and instore payments for customers in China. Treasury needs to establish the necessary hardware and software to start accepting e-CNY, says Aziz. “Newly added software needs to be integrated with the company’s existing ERP/TMS to streamline accounts reconciliation. This is especially important when processing anonymous transactions with missing payer information.”</p>
<p>Treasury also needs to access how to leverage the liquidity position and the opportunities unlocked by faster access to cash. Perhaps most importantly firms need to join the conversation, staying abreast of all regulatory changes. Chambers of commerce and industry platforms should come together and talk about what this means for their sectors, and how they can help shape policy. Anecdotal evidence suggests the eCNY is not on treasury’s radar: retail and business payments are already all digital and e-commerce is firmly embedded for consumers and businesses. Yet Ho concludes with a word of warning. “Most central bankers are not corporate treasurers.”</p>

<p>We are guided by the conviction that investors need clarity at every point in the investment process in order to make more informed decisions and achieve better outcomes. Cash management technology plays a critical role in helping treasurers manage their cash investments effectively and at scale. It is also an area that is developing rapidly for several reasons, including the growing focus on remote working and the rise of emerging technologies such as blockchain.</p>
<p>“Today is a very complex and dynamic time in the technology space,” says James Capps, Managing Director, Head of Cash Technology at BlackRock. “We’re seeing some real growth in APIs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and integration, as firms are starting to realise the value of bringing multiple technologies together. And using the best-in-breed systems for various functions is really adding value across the [cash management technology] ecosystem.”</p>
<p>For firms like BlackRock, this means embracing the cloud and exploring the capabilities of highly scalable and sustainable systems that can meet clients’ expectations. “And even more critically, we’re seeing a desire for clients to be able to manage their entire portfolio in one location,” Capps adds, highlighting the need for integrated technologies to provide a more seamless user experience.</p>
<h4 id="solving-todays-treasury-challenges">Solving today’s treasury challenges</h4>
<p>For corporate treasurers, the current environment presents significant challenges, says Tricia Turner, Head of Relationship Management for Cachematrix by BlackRock. “I think the two biggest challenges are finding enough time, and managing operational and investment risk effectively,” she notes. “Treasurers have such wide-ranging responsibilities, from financing corporate debt to managing investments.”</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, she sees technology becoming an essential tool for treasury teams to help manage these challenges, with portals like BlackRock’s Cachematrix providing a one-stop shop for the management of the investment, and reporting process.</p>
<p>Streamlining processes to save valuable time is an increasingly important feature of cash management portals. “Portals like ours [seek to] provide clear, efficient, and reliable data that enable treasury teams to make informed investment decisions quickly, rather than working through a multitude of spreadsheets on a daily basis,” says Turner.</p>
<p>In addition, an effective cash management solution can enable the faster sharing of information by loading historical information such as trade confirmations and monthly statements. “Other solutions provided to our clients include straight-through processing via auto-settlement and full integration to treasury management systems of choice, so that more time can be spent on critical tasks – and less time on rekeying data,” Turner explains.</p>
<h4 id="anticipating-the-future-of-cash-management-technology">Anticipating the future of cash management technology</h4>
<p>How will cash management technology evolve going forward? Alongside the continuation of current trends, such as challenges around managing time and risk, Capps says that higher levels of automation will mean there is less need for manual intervention. “I also think we’ll start to see more focus on things like blockchain to increase trust in some of these transactions – the space cannot be ignored,” he says. “And we should take note of developments in the mobile space as people increasingly look to manage their work from remote locations, and not necessarily in front of a computer.”</p>
<p>Where Cachematrix is concerned, future developments include the forthcoming launch of a new mobile app. “There’s been so much demand from our client base for that – not because people want to do money market fund trades on the beach, but because people want to be able to keep track of their trades and approve them on their mobile, both while working from home and when moving between meeting rooms [in the office],” says Turner. Likewise, she says clients are increasingly looking for features such as notifications to alert them when a trade needs to be approved.</p>
<p>Turner also adds that she believes ESG reporting and monitoring will continue to attract more focus in the coming years. “It’s another key trend that we expect to continue working on with our clients going into the future,” she concludes.</p>



<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Cash management technology in practice</h2>
<p>Melinda Olah, Cash Management Supervisor at Guardian Media Group, says that cash management is a key component of business growth for the UK-headquartered news organisation.</p>
<p>As such, having the right technology in place is an important element of the company’s cash management strategy. This includes using Cachematrix by BlackRock to manage orders for the company’s money market funds.</p>
<p>“When I log into Cachematrix, I see all the details of my money market funds, which is extremely useful because I don’t have to log into each of them to see the balances, movements or interest,” Olah explains. “It’s then straightforward to top up or redeem from the funds as needed.”</p>
<p>Olah also finds the portfolio balance information available on Cachematrix by BlackRock useful for weekly and monthly cash flow forecasting. Also valuable is the ability to generate transaction history reports for each fund, which can then be used to support the balance sheet reconciliation process at the end of the month.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading">What is Digital Dialogues?</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p><em>In 2021 Treasury Today Group and Citi bring you a new series dedicated to the topics of the moment. This audio centred content series brings together leading voices from across Asia Pacific. From academics to corporate treasurers to financial leaders, we will focus on the issues affecting corporate decision makers against a backdrop of the pandemic and global risk.</em></p>
<p style="margin:2em 0 2em 0;"><a class="button--red-stroke" href="/podcasts/citi-digital-dialogues-2021">Listen to podcast</a></p>
<p>In our second audio episode we sat down with Sarika Joshi of Zalora and Sanjeev Jain at Citi to explore emerging business models in theory and in practice. Some of the most dynamic treasury, payments and general corporate finance innovation is occurring in the e-commerce and digital native space. The pandemic has accelerated and enhanced the commerciality of digital first, e-commerce, young and adaptive companies. The ability to move rapidly and both guide and follow their consumer base has propelled retail companies with a strong e-commerce base into a new world. These savvy and tech-based businesses process data and consumer insight rapidly, adjusting and evolving their approach and outlook to maximise efficiency and profit. This is reflected in their treasury and finance functions, where they can adapt to a fast paced environment and allow data and consumer insight to power a new kind of progressive and future focused decision making business model.</p>
<p>Moving into a role at Zalora following an established career with high level roles in corporate finance was an adjustment for Joshi. She has thrived within this new and ever-changing business model. Blending corporate financial expertise and experience with this sector’s innovative and collaborative mindset, she has redefined her role and function. A business predicated on emerging business models, risk taking, growth and fast paced change calls for a new kind of corporate finance model and leadership.</p>
<p>As Joshi explained, ‘It’s two and a half years since I joined Zalora. The e-commerce space is still evolving, it's fun and it's changing and very dynamic, especially given what has happened in the last year and a half. Adapting to that kind of speed and also to how the business models are changing has been very exciting for me. Given also that my role is much broader than the treasury, it also lets me have a much broader view into the business per se.’</p>
<p>Speaking about the dynamic pace within the e-commerce industry that she now works in, Joshi offered the following, ‘there's a lot of testing that happens and a lot of changes that get incorporated due to continuous customer feedback. The speed at which it happens in an e-commerce business is amazing. Getting to know what the pulse of the customer is and how to support and provide value has been I think one of the biggest revelations for me from a business perspective. A lot of that translates then into the different functions that you manage within treasury or risk for example.’</p>
<p>Sanjeev Jain spoke about the consumer and their behaviour patterns that sit at the centre of this rapid change that we have seen in these industries. These are really the fulcrum of a lot of the emerging business models that we are documenting. As he explained, ‘At Citi we try to look at these things as a consumer, because there's always a service to our business, on the other side. As a consumer, as an individual, if you look at how your life has changed over the years. Think about if you're commuting to work in the morning, we're still lucky in in Hong Kong right now to be commuting to work, that whole experience around ordering a cab from an app. And an app is powering your ordering of meals and groceries. This whole change in terms of how our personal lives are facilitated, from the goods you're buying to services like entertainment, streaming platforms for music and television and film. This extends to the whole experience of how you invest and how you borrow, even consumer finance options across digital banks. Even on a shopping e-commerce platform, previously you would pay by credit card and now there are instalment payment options alongside.’</p>
<p>The rapid pace of change in consumer behaviour has fuelled a certain expectation of an equivalence with a corporate focused platform. Why should this experience be different than our experiences as individual consumers? Then there are digital native companies such as online retailers and technology enabled companies which also expect a new kind of business model from their treasury and corporate finance. The pandemic has only further accelerated these changes to corporations and to consumers, as Jain and Joshi have demonstrated. We further explore the knock-on effect of these trends on the industry as a whole as we look at what we can learn and observe from emerging business models.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Despite the advance of digital technology into everyday lives, many treasurers continue to rely on manual processes and spreadsheets. But the uncertainty and liquidity issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic underlined the need for speed and accuracy in cash management. For many treasurers, the time has come to leverage new and emerging technologies and commit to a digital treasury environment that will enable real-time cash and liquidity management.</p>
<p>Financial technology provider Bottomline Technologies’ 2021 Payments Barometer found that despite the cashflow challenges faced by many businesses, accurate forecasting is lacking, with 48% of the 800 organisations surveyed admitting their cash forecasts are rarely accurate. Among enterprise organisations, this lack of visibility increases to 56%.</p>
<p>However, the survey found that few businesses – 8% – aim to prioritise improving cash forecasting in the next 12 months. Financial decision-makers also tend to use more than one method to manage cashflow, with 37% of small businesses still using manual calculations on Excel, the survey found.</p>
<p>“The pandemic highlighted the need for accuracy and speed,” says Tracy Kantrowitz, Vice-President of Marketing for Treasury at Bottomline Technologies. “Treasurers were the stewards of the information that CEOs needed in order to make business decisions about furloughing staff or keeping them on. A treasurer’s role was no longer about just cash positioning and this shed a light on how inaccurate and inefficient existing processes were.”</p>
<p>Tom Wood, Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC UK, says the pandemic has accelerated companies’ existing digital treasury strategies. “Many treasurers were striving towards this pre-pandemic and treasury teams of all sizes and types of business are at different stages of their own digital development, as are their banks,” he says.</p>
<p>Companies in the early stages of digital transformation have focused on automating processes such as administration, contracts and payments tracking, while more sophisticated and advanced treasurers are moving to decision-making tools for cash-flow forecasting. “Overall, there is more hunger from our client base to talk to us about real-time digital solutions than in the past, which is as expected given the impact of the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Bert van Drie, Global Head Cash and Liquidity Management at ING Wholesale Banking, says there has arguably never been a situation as uncertain as the pandemic. “This has increased the importance of cash management for companies,” he says. “Companies were suddenly confronted with drastically decreasing or increasing demand for their products and immediate and real-time insights in cash, lending facilities and (supply chain) risk management became even more important.”</p>
<p>Stephen Randall, Global Head of Liquidity Management, Citi, says the pandemic refocussed the attention of companies on the importance of cash, in a similar way to the last financial crisis. “Companies realised they had to have a laser focus on concentrating cash and redeploying it to where it was needed most,” he says. “This gave them visibility and the ability to best support the liquidity needs of the operating business.”</p>
<p>Cash management has always been seen as important, says Peter Dehaan, New Business Director, Cash and Liquidity Management at technology company SmartStream, but much has changed. “The pandemic was almost like a natural disaster, overnight immediate and significant changes in working patterns and customer behaviours occurred,” he says. “When you have such change you realise the importance of real-time, robust, auditable information which is readily available.”</p>
<p>Normality changed much faster than anticipated, he adds. The human element and interaction that enabled organisations to successfully manage their business pre-pandemic was now at arm’s length as treasury team members worked remotely. “Forecasting and visibility of the balance sheets were stretched, with companies drawing down on revolving credit facilities. In a number of financial institutions this was exacerbated given the volumes, essentially creating the need to establish a banking ‘track and trace’ system for cash movements.”</p>
<p>The shift to remote working is a point also highlighted by Bottomline’s Kantrowitz. Many treasurers felt comfortable with the status quo of manual processes and spreadsheets, she says, however during the pandemic team members were no longer able to walk up to a colleague’s desk to ask a question, for example. Moreover, the collaborative technologies such as Teams that were used to enable staff to work together remotely made life easier and opened the eyes of many treasurers to the benefits of such technologies.</p>
<p>With the initial shock of the pandemic over and governments and businesses discussing recovery and ‘building back better’, existing cash management processes and systems are coming under scrutiny.</p>
<p>HSBC UK’s Wood says there has been reluctance among some treasurers to move to digital treasury technology, caused by concerns over loss of control of processes and cyber risk. “There has always been an element of this, although digital processes are often more secure than manual ones,” he says. “There is a shift away from this attitude, but there are always people who find it difficult to change historic systems and processes. The pandemic has forced a change away from dated processes that many people were very comfortable with.”</p>
<p>Moreover, digital first was already the direction of travel for treasury functions. “Companies are moving away from physical products such as cash and cheques, which are operationally cumbersome and generally higher cost,” he says. Virtual account solutions and other digital technologies, such as HSBC Global Wallet, a new digital, multi-currency payment solution, will enable treasurers to transact faster and have better visibility.</p>
<p>All treasurers had similar challenges during the initial phases of the pandemic, says Kantrowitz, but those relying on manual cash management processes struggled more than those with more innovative cash management systems. The newer generation of cloud-based systems such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services enabled users to better connect the disparate pieces of information that typically reside in AP, AR and other accounting systems, she says. “From a decision-making point of view, the treasury infrastructures based on the new digital generation of treasury management systems fared much better.”</p>
<p>The companies that had a handle on the fundamentals, with efficient and automated cash pooling structures already in place and the systems and data to monitor cash balances and forecast future liquidity needs, were able to more easily make decisions about cash deployment during the early months of the pandemic, says Citi’s Randall. “Without the fundamentals, such decisions become more complex and deployment of cash is slower and less efficient.”</p>
<p>Martin Gray, Managing Director in the Restructuring Advisory practice at risk solutions provider Kroll, says as a result of the pandemic, finance teams are “drastically changing in terms of their structure, organisation and processes. Thereby, businesses are scrambling to manage this adjustment by investing in their technological solutions. The accounting and finance branches have become a key area of focus for companies.”</p>
<p>While the pandemic has provided a catalyst for reviewing cash management processes and systems, it is not the only driver. Instant domestic payments systems and the moves towards open banking and application programming interfaces (APIs) are highlighting the inadequacies of current cash management technologies. The proliferation of real-time clearing and settlement mechanisms will eliminate the established batch, end of day processing environment and will transform liquidity and collateral management.</p>
<p>Wood says one of the major benefits of digital treasury is its green credentials. “Technology such as digital cash flow forecasting tools can remove a lot of paper from operational processes while also removing inefficiencies.”</p>
<p>Technology moves fast and pinning down any one technology that will emerge as the winner is difficult. Dehaan says cloud-based solutions are now more readily discussed by treasurers than they were a few years ago. “Portals and dashboards that align data are key to ensuring people do the right things at the right time. You have to ask yourself, what is worse, latent data or latent liquidity,” he says.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology enables very fast real-time of actual cash positions. “Because of the transparency around it, you can see very quickly when something is wrong,” says Digital Strategist Kate Baucherel. “Speed and transparency are crucial for cash management and blockchain transactions are much faster to settle because they don’t have to go through any third parties.”</p>
<p>The volatility of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (which are based on blockchain technology) has held back widespread adoption of blockchain in treasuries, however. “Stable coins, which are tethered to a currency or commodity are emerging and central bank plans for digital currencies indicate the area is constantly evolving. There isn’t much confusion about what blockchain is, but there is a lack of knowledge because it is such a fast-moving area, which is common with any emerging technology.”</p>
<p>The oft-quoted adage, “rubbish in, rubbish out” still applies. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and robotic process automation (RPA) systems are only as good as the data that are fed into them. “Much of what treasurers are trying to accomplish in cash management will depend on high quality and accessible data,” says Randall. “New and emerging technologies such as AI and ML are very useful and are bringing treasuries closer to real time liquidity management, which is becoming an important requirement. But treasuries must have good data to deliver on their promise.”</p>
<p>ING’s van Drie also points to data as an important element. “Data Analytics, robotics, blockchain and APIs are ‘buzzword’ technologies aimed at improving the treasury function. Fintechs in the open banking space, enterprise resource planning (ERP), treasury management system (TMS) providers and banks all step up to provide the platform for the future, particularly for real-time cash management, for cashflow forecasting and for risk management.”</p>
<p>These solutions can bring tangible benefits in terms of better informed financial decisions, but van Drie warns that a careful strategy is required. “Which role do you want to play as treasury? Should it be fully integrated in the supply chain, or more focused on the financial and risk side? What is the culture of your company – more decentralised or centralised?”</p>
<p>Kroll’s Gray says RPA is increasingly used by businesses to automate “monotonous” treasury management processes. “If businesses scale the technology properly and adopt a holistic approach, the future could be bright in terms of ROI for CFOs.”</p>
<p>A technology is only as good as the organisational environment in which it works, he adds. Treasurers should consider how technology should function in the entire organisation and how easily data from subsidiaries of the right quality can be obtained and how the most value can be added.</p>
<p>Manoj Mishra, Vice-President, Consulting Services at CGI, says treasurers often feel “left behind” compared to their retail experience. “We are seeing treasurers demanding the same user experience that they have as a retail customer,” he says. “Many treasurers and CFOs have made it clear to their banks that they should modernise or risk losing their business.” Treasurers are seeking customer centric user experience, unified platforms and real-time, predictive insights, he adds. “We strongly believe that these changes in the next two to three years will help transform CFO organisations making them nimbler and efficient.”</p>
<p>Highly connected, open treasury systems that enable easy onboarding of clients are the future of cash management, says Kantrowitz. “The biggest benefit of such systems is that they give access to data across all the financial ecosystems, including treasury, banks, ERP, TMS and accounting systems. Treasurers can unlock all of the data, using the right systems and tools to be more proactive and intelligent in analysis of cash flow and in vendor management.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading">What is Digital Dialogues?</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>In 2021 Treasury Today Group and Citi bring you a new series dedicated to the topics of the moment. This audio centred content series brings together leading voices from across Asia Pacific. From academics to corporate treasurers to financial leaders, we will focus on the issues affecting corporate decision makers against a backdrop of the pandemic and global risk.</em></p>
<p style="margin:2em 0 2em 0;"><a class="button--red-stroke" href="/podcasts/citi-digital-dialogues-2021">Listen to podcast</a></p>
<p>In our first audio episode with Jason Han of Nanyang Technological University and Citi’s own Sandip Patil, we explored the most exciting digital innovations of the past decade, outlining the scope of our upcoming episodes throughout the course of this year’s series and focusing on both their experiences and insights.</p>
<p>Jason Han has held roles in corporate treasury at SABIC, Michelin and most recently at GE, leading treasury digitalisation. When asked about his highlights from the last decade of advancements and innovation in treasury, Han spoke about process excellence and how APIs are helping bank connectivity. He speaks about SWIFT GPI, the importance of virtual accounts and how that has been used to maximum effect, all of which are driving process excellence.</p>
<h4>Looking ahead</h4>
<p>Han spoke specifically about cash flow forecasting, ‘Cash forecasting for all corporates is an exciting space. Many things can be done from there. Helping to finance and at the same time you can see sales patterns that are coming up and where certain suppliers may be having certain issues. Automating and using AI for cash flow forecasting is very impactful and innovative.’</p>
<p>Patil agrees but believes ‘It’s not all about cash flow forecasting’. Looking beyond just automation, they focus on putting decision making into the power of machines. Moving from APIs to ‘deep APIs,’ the bulk of the APIs are consumed with balances and we have taken it deeper into treasury’s needs into cards, supply chain etcetera, to offer a range of services and digitise the entire domain. Creating a service and leaving the client just to consume that service isn’t enough so we want to co-create solutions with our clients which can perfectly suit their needs and so that they can benefit fully in execution.’</p>
<h4>Transformation</h4>
<p>When asked about advancements and digital transformation in general, Patil states ‘Digital treasury will play a huge role in digital transformation of the whole world as we continually grapple with the pandemic. All the wallets such as Alipay along with digital currencies are players in this space and so digital treasury is a vital area. It will have been only enhanced by the pandemic and more widespread adoption of new technologies.’</p>
<h4>Total transformation</h4>
<p>Patil speaks about ‘transformation rather than evolution,’ that he has seen with disruption and metamorphosis occurring across the world and across multiple industries. ‘Treasury is no longer seen as a space which just acts as financial efficiency but it also drives cash flow, profits and business support which brings a large amount of investment and evolves the way the function operates. The newer technologies like APIs, robotics and instant payments drive change in a positive direction to create new business pockets and demands.’ Although Patil recognises that such transformation brings challenges, the overall energy is positive.</p>
<h4>Harnessing new technology</h4>
<p>As new technologies emerge there is a co-existence with existing technologies. This is set against a backdrop of a complex regulatory backdrop and cyber security landscape. When it comes to the impact of the pandemic, Patil explains, ‘Shock after shock and wave after wave, there has been a lot that everybody has gone through. Ecommerce has taken a boost and future of work has been affected. Consumption habits have certainly shifted as tolerance and patience have diminished. Reactivity on the part of providers has improved. This is a totally different landscape that is transforming business.’  As Patil explains, this change and ecosystem shift has changed forever and he believes that out of these challenges positive changes have developed.</p>
<h4>Collaboration and community</h4>
<p>Han’s new role brings his corporate experience into an academic space as he collaborates with the fintech industry and industry associations to create learning opportunities and collaboration. Bringing professors and research teams together with the industry allows both sides to leverage one another’s expertise and to create a better future for the industry and Singapore at large. Han wants to encourage an environment where corporates can reach out and collaborate, and welcomes all the community to get in touch with universities and himself.</p>
<p>Patil continues, ‘The approach with which services and solutions are developed differentiates Citi. Perceiving fintech as a collaborative partner instead of as the competition was an approach that we took from the beginning.’ The future of innovation comes from these collaborations, interactions and exchanges and is one of the main reasons why we have created Digital Dialogues, to inspire that synergy. Citi has long promoted a collaborative approach within the industry and has many academic partnerships. It has long facilitated education and exchange with its corporate clients through its annual conference and partnerships with academic institutions including INSEAD (Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires).</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Europe, Middle East and Africa’s (EMEA) emerging markets include a diverse range of countries, from Russia to Turkey and from Pakistan to Nigeria. From a treasury perspective, these countries present numerous challenges, both for companies that are expanding into those countries, and for countries that are headquartered there. But at the same time, the adoption of digitisation and innovation is particularly high in these markets, with many companies ‘leapfrogging’ their peers in more developed markets by adoption new technologies at pace.</p>
<p>So how is digital adoption likely to progress in the coming years – and how is Citi’s EMEA emerging markets strategy enabling the bank to support clients in these markets more effectively?</p>
<h4 id="challenges-in-emerging-markets">Challenges in emerging markets</h4>
<p>EMEA’s emerging markets are characterised by a number of challenges, some of which are common, and some of which are country specific. “Clients that come to these markets often face some significant challenges around the macroeconomic and geopolitical situation, including trade wars and sanctions environments,” says Marek Potoma, Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) Head for Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (TRUK) at Citi. “Currencies tend to fluctuate more in emerging markets than in developed markets. And interest rates are often high, which may make it more difficult for companies to access financing.”</p>
<p>In addition, Potoma notes that regulations in some emerging markets can limit the activities that companies can do in those markets. “In Russia, for example, there are foreign currency restrictions, and measures to limit the repatriation of profits and capital,” he says. “These issues might be common to other emerging markets – but each country has a different way of doing things.”</p>
<p>As well as economic and regulatory challenges, companies may also face industry-specific challenges in some markets, including issues around access to raw materials, capital markets and labour markets.</p>
<h4 id="treasury-challenges">Treasury challenges</h4>
<p>For treasurers operating in these markets, there are many matters that need to be addressed. For one thing, diverse regulatory environments can make it difficult for treasury teams to achieve a uniform policy across different countries, comments David Aldred, TTS Head for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) at Citi.</p>
<p>“If you look at the MENA region, you have the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which is fairly liberal in terms of allowing sweeping and pooling structures – and you also have markets like North Africa and Pakistan, that are much more restrictive,” he notes. “So you can’t treat it like a fungible region where it’s easy to get liquidity centralised, or adapt a common trade solution across the market.”</p>


<blockquote><p>At Citi, our biggest differentiator is our global network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Marek Potoma, TTS Head for TRUK</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Over the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented further obstacles. “One thing that is impacting our clients is debt levels and fiscal gaps,” says Esther Chibesa, Citi’s TTS Head for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). “As countries try to deal with COVID-19, governments are under pressure. And for some of the poorest countries, this is going to lead to the prospect of things like higher corporation tax rates, as well as new forms of taxation.” In particular, she cites the growing interest in the taxation of digital goods and services, which is likely to affect companies that have recently recalibrated their own ways of doing business.</p>
<h4 id="citis-approach">Citi’s approach</h4>
<p>Citi covers 26 emerging markets in EMEA, divided into three sub-regions: Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (TRUK). The bank also has 33 non-presence countries, in which activities are conducted from neighbouring markets. This structure was introduced in September 2019 in order to address common challenges and opportunities across the relevant countries, and identify synergies between them.</p>
<p>“At Citi, our biggest differentiator is our global network. This enables us to help emerging markets businesses go global, and to provide our global clients with connectivity to, and local knowledge of, emerging markets. In this way, our clients can deal with one bank across multiple geographies,” says Potoma.</p>
<p>He adds that Citi’s five-year investment strategy across EMEA’s emerging markets includes a centralised approach to investing in the region. “Even though we already have robust local capabilities in these markets, we are investing in further expanding not only our presence, but also our product capabilities, service and client experience in this market,” Potoma notes.</p>
<p>Chibesa comments that one of the best things about the bank’s strategy is that it creates an opportunity to share best practices and invest in new skillsets across the region. “It also helps us to attract great talent, because people are drawn to the complexity of having some really diverse markets to solve for,” she says.</p>
<h4 id="digitisation-and-innovation">Digitisation and innovation</h4>
<p>Digitisation is an important topic across EMEA’s emerging markets, many of which demonstrate strong adoption of solutions such as virtual accounts and instant cross-currency payments. “This particular area is very exciting, because there are a lot of markets that have leapfrogged ahead of developed economies in things like instant payments and digital wallets,” says Chibesa. Adoption of these solutions is being enabled by the rise of new faster payment schemes in markets including Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia and the UAE.</p>
<p>While this trend was already under way before the pandemic began, there’s no doubt that COVID-19 has helped to sharpen the focus on digitisation over the last year. “The pandemic is accelerating this shift, which will enable companies to benefit from more efficiency in terms of getting paid quicker, more securely and more efficiently,” says Aldred. He notes that as companies adjust their business models in response to the crisis – for example, by moving from distributor to direct-to-consumer models – key enablers include not only faster payment schemes, but also by the ability to digitise trade finance flows.</p>
<h4 id="co-creation-and-collaboration">Co-creation and collaboration</h4>
<p>Chibesa agrees that many companies are rethinking what is valuable about their propositions, including a greater focus on the ESG agenda. In addition, she says she is seeing some interesting conversations around the topic of skills. “When we work on a project with a client, such as an API solution, our project manager is working with a project manager on the client’s side – so there is a lot of cross-fertilisation. It’s no longer just about getting the project done, but also about transferring skills and ideas.” The more that companies embrace digitisation, the more willing they are to engage in co-creation, she reflects.</p>
<p>Citi is continuing to enhance the process of collaborating with fintechs – not least through the bank’s global venture capital fund Citi Ventures, which engages with fintechs on a global scale. In addition, the bank’s fintech challenge programme has led to the development of solutions specific to particular emerging markets, including an instant payments solution in Kenya and a digital receivables solution in Turkey.</p>
<p>“Yes, fintechs are competitors – but they’re also our partners and our clients,” observes Aldred. “I think that our willingness to work with a select group of fintechs helps us to deploy local relevant solutions very quickly for our clients, improving our overall agility.” He adds that clients are not only looking to overcome current market challenges, but are actively focusing on expansion and growth, and the ability to tap into new client segments. “So how can we bring quicker, relevant solutions to them? Fintechs are a way of doing that.”</p>
<h4 id="future-developments">Future developments</h4>
<p>Looking forward, Citi’s EMEA emerging market experts predict that digital transformation will continue to be accelerated by the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We have seen a lot of progress in TRUK, for example, in the adoption of digital signatures and digital onboarding,” says Potoma, adding that this has been facilitated by the use of mobile connectivity tools that allow the bank to be more flexible and allow clients to access the system through API technology. “I don’t think this will disappear – it’s now about commercialising the things that have been created either as a COVID-19 accelerator, or as business-as-usual work with clients on digital transformation.”</p>
<p>Also significant is the continuing shift to real-time payments across emerging markets – a shift that is likely to continue in the coming years, and which offers further opportunities for product development. In addition, says Aldred, companies that have struggled during the pandemic will continue to focus on diversification as they work to return to growth. “They’re going to look at the markets they have,” he predicts. “Across emerging markets, they have a very savvy client base that is digital and mobile driven, so they will look to leverage that.” At the same time, he predicts that the adoption of ecommerce models will continue to accelerate in the coming months.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Real-time data is a significant focus for treasurers. In 2019, a survey of 400 treasurers carried out by IDC for Finastra found that 59% predicted that getting real-time data and payments would be a priority by 2022. And more recently, the pandemic has further sharpened treasurers’ focus on the importance of data.</p>
<p>“Having the most up-to-date accurate, integrated information is very important to businesses of all sizes to be able to effectively forecast and manage their funds at times when they need to closely monitor them, because revenue may be lower than it typically is, or because receivables are coming in slower,” says Christine Barry, Research Director at Aite Group.</p>
<p>Marcus Hughes, Head of Strategic Business Development at Bottomline, likewise points out the importance of real-time data in the current landscape. “The pandemic lockdowns, combined with the uncertainties of today’s business environment, have highlighted that it is mission critical for a treasurer to have real-time visibility of their cash position over multiple bank accounts, in order to have full control over their treasury, payments and receivables,” he says.</p>
<p>It’s clear that real-time data is an important topic for today’s treasury teams. But what does real-time data mean in the context of corporate treasury? How can treasurers benefit from real-time data? And how important is it for treasurers to have a real-time data strategy?</p>
<h4 id="which-types-of-data">Which types of data?</h4>
<p>In simple terms, real-time data is data that is delivered to the end user as soon as it has been collected. For treasury teams, which come into contact with many different types of data, the term ‘real-time data’ is one that incorporates a number of different topics and activities, from cash balances to foreign exchange exposures:</p>
<h5>Cash position and liquidity</h5>
<p>Having a real-time view over the company’s cash across different bank accounts is an important tool where decision-making is concerned. “Any latency in the availability of current cash balances can and will have a negative impact on the treasurer and CFO’s ability to make decisions,” explains Paul Bramwell, Principal &amp; Founder of Treasury Tech Advisory. “The complete understanding of where your cash is, why it’s there and when it will be needed is critical to the business.”</p>
<h5>Cash forecasting</h5>
<p>Likewise, access to real-time data on the company’s cash position is an important component of the cash flow forecasting process. Out-of-date information will make it more difficult to generate accurate forecasts that can support effective liquidity planning and cash management.</p>
<h5>Market rates</h5>
<p>Hughes notes that in today’s volatile markets, treasury teams need real-time data feeds of market rates to manage their foreign exchange exposure and hedging strategy, “as well as other financial risks and derivative instruments related to interest rates and commodity prices.”</p>
<h5>Fraud prevention and compliance</h5>
<p>Sanctions lists are becoming increasingly complex – and while sanctions screening remains an important focus for banks, treasurers are increasingly putting systems in place to prevent their businesses from sending payments to sanctioned countries, entities or individuals. Likewise, with the risk of payments fraud continuing to rise, real-time fraud prevention systems have an important role to play in screening payments for suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Across these different areas, the benefit of real-time data is not the data itself so much as the decisions that can be made as a result. For example, if treasurers are basing investment decisions on out-of-date information, there will be a greater need to keep excess cash readily available in case of unforeseen developments.</p>
<p>As Bramwell points out, “If a treasurer has access to data on cash balances, historical flows/trends and the ability to forecast with increasing predictability, the company is much better placed to manage capital markets activity, investments, debt and any risks inherent in the business such as foreign exchange, interest rate and operational risks.”</p>
<p>Consequently, says Bramwell, there are a number of ways that treasurers can benefit from real-time data. For one thing, treasurers can benefit from real-time cash data to place surplus cash in different instruments with better yields as early as possible. They can also use accurate and timely data on orders, expected inflows and outflows to place investments longer and thereby generate better yield, “given the predictability of cash flows.”</p>
<p>In addition, the real-time data resulting from business transactions may generate foreign exchange risks which need to be managed or mitigated, explains Bramwell. In addition, “the application of cash balances to business flows will tie into the sales pipeline where goods and services are sold on credit,” he says, adding that if this doesn’t happen in real-time “there is a risk of turning business away.”</p>
<h4 id="impact-of-iso-20022">Impact of ISO 20022</h4>
<p>The opportunities brought by real-time data are also becoming more interesting as a result of the transition to ISO 20022 messaging, which will not only standardise payment formats, but also enable payments to carry more structured data than in the past.</p>
<p>“ISO 20022 will make it easier to ensure compliance with Anti-Money Laundering requirements because the format has many structured fields which can be made mandatory for including important details, such as the name and address of the ultimate beneficiary, the originator and the intermediary bank,” explains Hughes. “This means payments using ISO 20022 can include all the information necessary to comply with FATF 16 requirements and EU Wire Transfer Regulations.”</p>
<p>In addition, Hughes points out that ISO 20022 messaging will increase efficiency, thereby resulting in lower costs and higher straight through processing rates. “The increase in information provided can also be used to make it easier to track payments in real-time across multiple banks and payment systems,” he says.</p>
<p>“It will also reduce the risk of errors, as users will be able to include additional payment details and references. Using rich data in a structured way will also make it easier for parties receiving payments to achieve higher levels of automated and real-time reconciliation.”</p>
<h4 id="tools-and-resources">Tools and resources</h4>
<p>When it comes to accessing and using real-time data, treasurers need to have the right tools and systems in place. “A starting point will be a treasury management system that is connected to the banking world where balances can be obtained with as little latency as possible,” says Bramwell. “With the advent of APIs and the PSD2 directive, this is becoming far more prevalent.”</p>
<p>While sourcing data is important, treasurers also need to have the ability to analyse that data effectively in order to support better decision making. Hughes notes that data analytics, and techniques such as machine learning and predictive analytics, “are becoming a key tool for treasurers and other financial decision-makers.” He adds, “Treasurers greatly benefit from analytical tools which enable them not only to measure their KPIs (DSO, DPO, customer payment performance) but also to improve these metrics and therefore have a positive effect on overall financial performance.”</p>
<h4 id="barriers-to-real-time-data">Barriers to real-time data</h4>
<p>While the benefits of real-time data are clear, getting access to the necessary data isn’t always straightforward. As Aite Group’s Barry explains, “Sometimes banks have legacy technologies in place that make it a challenge to get real-time data, especially when you are looking for that data to be integrated and accurate.”</p>
<p>In order to optimise access to real-time data, Barry says that treasurers may need to put pressure on their financial institutions and technology providers. “I think a lot of banks, especially for real-time information, have historically had more of a tendency to focus on the retail or consumer side,” she comments.</p>
<p>One reason for this, says Barry, is that corporates have accepted near-real-time or next-day information until recently – “but that’s no longer the case.” As such, she suggests that corporates should put pressure on financial institutions to understand their needs and understand the challenges they face with older data, such as not being able to make the right financial decisions. Further challenges may need to be overcome when it comes to aggregating data. Hughes points out that it can be challenging to aggregate real-time data from a range of disparate business and bank systems – although he also says that the use of APIs is helping to make data aggregation and analysis easier and faster.</p>
<h4 id="real-time-data-and-cash-forecasting">Real-time data and cash forecasting</h4>
<p>Where cash forecasting is concerned, data from systems such as the treasury management system, ERP system and bank accounts needs to be combined in order to generate accurate cash flow forecasts. As Hughes explains, this data typically includes: future inbound payments relating to outstanding sales invoices, maturing deposits and investments, and tax refunds; future outbound payments relating to outstanding supplier invoices, payroll, maturing loans, interest and tax payments due and existing and up-to-date cash balances and uncleared items on multiple bank accounts in multiple currencies.</p>
<p>“These cash flow forecasts must be constantly reviewed against actual cash flow by performing variance analytics in order to improve the accuracy of these forecasts,” Hughes says. He notes that some inbound and outbound flows, such as loan repayments, are highly predictable – but others, such as when a customer will pay an invoice, are less easy to predict. “It is also essential to constantly reconcile bank statements against the ERP ledger to allocate cash correctly and take revenue to profits,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id="planning-ahead">Planning ahead</h4>
<p>For Bramwell, a key enabler when it comes to making the most of real-time data is having a plan and vision in place setting out “what data to collect, what to use it for, who to provide it to and how to harness the value to broader decision making.”</p>
<p>As such, he says it is “incredibly important” for treasurers to have a data strategy in place. “Data is everything and the tools required to handle the sheer amount of data available are easily able to package and present the data into usable dashboards and KPIs to enable decision making and action,” Bramwell says. “It’s also important to bear in mind the usability of data across the organisation which transcends the treasury department.”</p>
<p>Bramwell adds that a data strategy should include “every aspect of the treasurer’s world – cash, forecasts, debt, investments, hedges etc. All are of broader use to the CFO’s organisation and indicate the health of the treasury function in servicing the business.”</p>
<p>Hughes agrees that having a data strategy is increasingly important. “This should cover the aggregation and analysis of data from multiple sources, such as treasury, AP/AR, CRM, debtor management and collections,” he says. In addition, advanced techniques such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics “can be applied to historic performance and improve the accuracy of forecasts.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, real-time data brings real opportunities for treasurers to improve visibility over cash, manage risks more effectively and support better decision-making. But to harness these benefits, treasurers first need to be able to access and aggregate the data they need – and having a strategy in place is an important enabler for companies looking to get real value from their data.</p>

<p><em>How is technology supporting the evolving role of the treasurer? And how can treasurers tap into everything from AI and data analytics to AML solutions as they take on a more strategic position within their organisations? In a recent virtual roundtable held by Treasury Today and the BottomlineTreasuryXpress team, industry experts discussed the latest developments.</em></p>

<p>Treasurers are no strangers to technology. But in the last couple of years, the rise of new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have brought additional opportunities for treasurers. At the same time, the increasingly strategic role of the treasurer has made it more important to harness efficiency and automation wherever possible. And of course, the COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened treasurers’ focus on digitising processes.</p>
<p>With this in mind, a recent virtual roundtable hosted by Treasury Today and Bottomline explored some of the latest developments in this area, and the skills treasurers need to succeed in this evolving landscape.</p>
<h4 id="embracing-digital-transformation">Embracing digital transformation</h4>
<p>In the last few years, treasurers have increasingly had to become fluent in the topic of digital transformation – namely the ability to use and understand good quality data and make the most of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p>This shift has only accelerated during the pandemic. “The transition from the physical to the virtual office has been the catalyst for a lot of change, especially around payment approval,” says Tom Leitch, Director of Sales and Business Development, Treasury, Bottomline. For example, he notes that treasurers are interacting more frequently with the system on activities such as liquidity planning and cash flow forecasting.</p>
<p>For many, this has placed additional demands on the treasurer’s skillset, as well as a growing emphasis on the role of the treasurer as a strategic partner within the organisation. In some cases, this means bringing additional experts into treasury conversations. “What we’re now seeing in conversations with treasurers is that they often have software engineers and data engineers with them in the discussions,” says Leitch. “So, we’re having much more in-depth conversations about how treasurers can access the data within software, and I think that’s a big shift. Treasurers are now looking to derive intelligence from their operational data.”</p>
<h4 id="building-skills">Building skills</h4>
<p>Treasurers are also looking closely at how they can build out their own skills. Kemi Bolarin, Director, DKB Treasury, observes that the pandemic has shown that resilience needs to be part of the treasurer’s core skillset. Where technical skills are concerned, treasurers also need data intuition skills – “How do we identify data that will result in actionable intelligence? How can we manipulate the data into insights that then provide entry level understanding to the people that are going to use the data?”</p>
<p>As such, Bolarin makes a point of spending 30 minutes a day on LinkedIn Learning in order to top up her existing skills in areas including AI, ML and robotics. “As treasurers, we can’t be shy of technology,” she says. “Social media is where you can pick up a lot of information around the rapidly changing landscape around digital technology.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Séverine Le Blévennec, Senior Director EMEA Treasury at Honeywell, explains that she spent time teaching herself about robotics and completed a developer certificate so that she could help the company automate repetitive processes – an exercise that has saved almost three hours a day.</p>
<h4 id="harnessing-analytics">Harnessing analytics</h4>
<p>Treasurers are also paying closer attention to the importance of data analytics when it comes to getting more value out of data. “The data revolution is here – there’s no escaping it,” says Bolarin. “We’re talking about significant digital data flows landing on our desks.” Following the pandemic, she expects CEOs and CFOs will increasingly invest in the tools needed to help treasurers leverage information more effectively to make smarter decisions.</p>
<p>James Marshall, Head of Treasury at Virgin Media, says that while a lot of the company’s cash forecasting is based on drilling into ERP systems, “We get the other half of the story through receipts and collections, which is a little bit more difficult.” As such, business analytics data represents a valuable source of information that the team can use to inform the forecasting process and make more strategic decisions.</p>
<h4 id="combatting-financial-crime">Combatting financial crime</h4>
<p>A further area of focus for treasurers is the role technology can play in helping with anti-money laundering (AML) initiatives. Charles de Rougé, Head of SaaS Solutions at Bottomline, notes that five years ago companies regarded AML as the responsibility of banks – but more recently, concerns about reputational risk and deepening regulatory requirements are prompting companies to looking more closely at AML and sanctions screening.</p>
<p>“At Bottomline, we have two tools that are embedded in everything we do,” he explains. “These are anti money laundering/watch list screening, and the anti-fraud tool, which is based on machine learning and artificial intelligence.” By using specialist solutions, treasurers can “tick those boxes and prove that they’re doing everything they can to mitigate the risk, to avoid bad publicity and loss of money.”</p>
<h4 id="working-together">Working together</h4>
<p>Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer at Ferguson plc, argues that while fintechs and treasury teams have stepped up to the mark during the COVID-19 pandemic, “the banks have been slightly slower to act.” He adds: “My ask to the banks is that they seize this opportunity to develop their technology and provide value added solutions to their customers, in order to stay ahead for example accepting digital documents (KYC) and improving security around payments (Two Factor Authentication). I’d like to see more corporate treasurers pushing the agenda with their banking partners, and to some degree their vendors – but I do think most fintechs are doing what they should be doing.”</p>
<p>Indeed, many treasurers are taking a proactive approach when it comes to driving development. Le Blévennec notes that there are plenty of opportunities for treasurers to embark on co-creation initiatives, both with banks and with technology providers. “If we want to invest the time, they are more than happy to get our feedback,” she says. “It’s a way to be more demanding and have things that work better for us.”</p>
<p>Summing up the conversation, De Rougé noted that digitisation is inevitable. “It’s so great to see all of your individual initiatives,” he said. “The tools that used to do basic things are now doing much more to bring actionable insights and decision-making assistance. It’s exciting, it’s fast-paced, it’s the future.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>So let’s start with the basics of how we can categorise bitcoin vis a vis other digital currencies. When it comes to digital currencies there are broadly speaking two camps which currencies can sit within – centralised and decentralised. Centralised digital currencies are those where there is a central point of control over the money supply, ie a central bank. Decentralised digital currencies or peer to peer money enables investors to create their own ecosystem where they deal directly with one another without a centralised exchange. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin operate on this principal. Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a distributed ledger called a blockchain and are open to market fluctuations without centralisation, as we have seen recently.</p>
<p>Something of the bad boy of the digital currency landscape, bitcoin’s origins and utilisation are infamous and much discussed https://www.wired.com/story/guide-bitcoin/ and, after languishing at the outskirts of the mainstream conscious, it is having something of a moment, to put it mildly. So, what does its advent mean for treasurers, what are the opportunities and the risks of bitcoin for corporates and why should treasurers be staying on top of the latest developments surrounding bitcoin?</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s evolution in public opinion as a cryptocurrency is explained as follows by Seng Ti Goh, Director at Focal Partners Private Ltd and President of the ACTS, “Bitcoin’s genesis should be attributed to the white paper titled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, and only garnered much attention in recent years, much to the chagrin of the central bankers, traditional Wall Street and main street folks. Ironically, the volatility and attention can be arguably linked to the loose monetary policies and the general sense of distrust in the banking system. The idea of a cryptographic, DLT, and de-fi based system appealed to many. It is only of late that some of the biggest names on Wall Street and at hedge funds have been so vocal and now even Elon Musk is tweeting about #BTC!”</p>
<p>Although the volatility and risk associated with bitcoin should serve as severe warning for all those whose role it is to protect and preserve their company’s liquidity, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are becoming an ever increasing power on the global financial stage and it is wise for treasurers to intellectually explore this space. As Seng Ti expanded, “What is bitcoin to traditional corporate treasurers and CFOs? What about the others like Ethers and even Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) which are centralised digital currencies issued by a central bank)? CFOs and Corporate Treasurers’ primary and rightful roles are to support the fundamental businesses on all things finance and treasury; while safeguarding and protecting the organisation’s financial health. Bitcoin should not be used as a profit generator, nor a meaningful hedge (under current volatilities). However, CFOs and treasurers should understand its mechanics and understand the implications to their organisation; and look for proxy hedges if their underlying businesses ever need to accept payments in cryptos or CBDCs.”</p>
<p>We spoke with Kieran Smith of Qredo https://www.qredo.com/product, a cross-chain liquidity protocol that provides secure decentralised custody and a layer-2 peer-to-peer trading network. Smith explained, “Tesla, MicroStrategy and Square are setting a new trend by adding bitcoin to their balance sheets. This marks an inflection point in the gradual institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency.” Smith sees this as being spurred by several trends which he outlined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Macroeconomic tailwinds are blowing bitcoin higher</strong>. Inflation fears have become widespread amid ballooning public debt and massive amounts of money printing, putting the limited supply of bitcoin in stark relief. As a result, the idea of bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ has hit prime time. At the same time, corporations are holding record amounts of cash with ultra-low interest rates. This makes opportunities to earn yield in decentralised finance too lucrative to ignore. While 3-5% is reason to get excited in traditional finance, lending stablecoins and crypto assets in DeFi can offer yields of more than 10%, with relatively higher risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Market infrastructure is rapidly maturing</strong>. It is no longer just crypto-native tech start-ups offering digital asset services, but big banks like BNY Mellon building out offerings. On the payments side, the global payment processors including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal are now building out crypto support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory approval now seems inevitable</strong>. The top US bank regulator (OCC) published letters late last year saying that banks can store crypto and participate in blockchain networks, and Biden has appointed what is expected to be a largely balanced and proactive set of regulators at the head of the SEC and CFTC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many are dubious about the opportunities that bitcoin can realistically offer to corporate teams, but ultimately treasury must support the direction of their board and organisation. For those considering what the journey may look like, here is some further insight from Smith and Qredo, “As a cryptographic asset controlled by a string of code, bitcoin doesn’t neatly slot into traditional treasury management systems: It cannot easily be managed in the same way as you might cash, stock, or bonds in corporate treasury systems.</p>
<p>“Much of the existing infrastructure for digital asset custody was designed for individuals securing personal funds. These solutions are not necessarily suited to institutional needs of safeguarding, compliance, reporting, and access control.”</p>
<p>So what are the practical implications for treasurers who may need to manage bitcoin as a result of a corporate decision at board level, as in the case of Tesla? As Smith explains, “A typical institutional setup would involve keeping the majority of funds in cold storage, which keep private keys offline where they are secure but difficult to access. Day-to-day working capital is then kept in more accessible hot wallets which carry significant operational risks.”</p>
<p>Smith further expands on the challenges and risk implications of such a strategy, “Moving funds on-chain between wallets, or between multiple custodians or corporate departments, can be subject to high network fees and delays from limitations of the underlying blockchains. This makes simple tasks like managing treasuries and rebalancing portfolios expensive and inefficient. At the same time, there is a lack of dedicated infrastructure for providing transaction records, meaning a lot of crypto treasury is run through spreadsheets which also carry a lot of operational risks.</p>
<p>“There is also no way to track transactions for compliance and governance needs, easily retrieve an audit log, or get live reliable data on transactions to perform EOD reconciliations. This creates heavy burdens of manual reporting. Similarly, there are no automated workflows for tasks like reconciliation, and no way to get full visibility across different holdings, making it tricky to manage capital and risk.”</p>
<p>At the moment this ‘one to watch’ space is just that it seems. For the moment there are not elaborate enough frameworks or hardy enough tools and products for treasurers to securely navigate the landscape. David Blair of Acarate Consulting confirms that position, explaining, “Like gold, another popular inflation hedge, bitcoin has no intrinsic use and does not generate any yield. The latter may seem moot in a time of zero interest rates, and even attractive compared to negative interest rates. But corporates need to report results in fiat currency, and bitcoin’s volatility will cause mark to market variances that will need explaining to shareholders. Buying bitcoin and then hedging it into fiat currency obviates the point of the investment. Basically buying bitcoin is buying balance sheet volatility. Most treasurers goal is to reduce risk, not to increase it.”</p>
<p>As Blair states, there really is not much of a use case for corporates to adopt bitcoin as a medium of exchange. He expands, “As an inflation hedge, bitcoin has higher volatility and transaction costs and operational risks than gold. One also needs to question the need for corporates to hedge inflation – for most corporates, inflation will affect both inputs and outputs and have roughly neutral effect over time. Of course, this last is not true for corporates with large net cash positions.”</p>
<p>Blair sums up his assessment with this flourishing finale, “We owe a great debt to Satoshi Nakamoto for his pioneering work in bringing together different technologies into a robust working blockchain – bitcoin. There will doubtless be many interesting use cases for digital ledger technology (DLT aka blockchain), especially across supply chains with smart contracts and the like. Alternative mediums of exchange and store of value are unlikely to be the most interesting DLT use case for corporates.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>During the COVID-19 crisis, many treasury teams have been able to step up and support their organisations proactively – but many others continue to face challenges as a result of technology constraints. “A lot of people still have trouble just getting the data they need and organising it,” says Bruce King-Shey, Executive Director, Design Strategy for the bank’s machine learning product team. “If a treasurer asks their team a question, they can find that four different people give three different answers.”</p>
<p>Emerging technologies can offer new opportunities for treasurers to access, interpret and enhance data and use it in a more strategic way. “We service clients around the world that have really complicated needs,” says Sarah Olsen, Head of Business Development for Coin Systems at Onyx by J.P. Morgan, a new division focusing on blockchain and digital currency initiatives within the bank’s Wholesale Payments business. “Our clients are exploring technologies such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum computing, as well  seeking to connect to platforms more seamlessly via APIs – so the demands from our clients for technical acumen are higher than ever.”</p>
<p>These technologies offer new opportunities to predict the future or optimise cash – but the need to understand these developments also places further demands on treasurers. As King-Shey points out, while the core job of the treasurer is to manage cash, “suddenly they’re forced to become technologists.”</p>
<h3 id="collaborating-and-connecting">Collaborating and connecting</h3>
<p>Collaboration can be a powerful tool when it comes to developing new solutions – and alongside in-house technology development, J.P. Morgan is pursuing  a growing network of alliances with over 100 fintechs. Olsen says that this enables the bank to harness emerging financial technology “in a way we otherwise couldn’t”, as banks and fintechs each have something different to bring to the table.</p>
<p>For one thing, while large banks have the benefit of a strong client base, fintechs typically have more flexibility when it comes to developing new solutions at speed. Another difference is that fintechs tend to focus on improving the end user experience, while money continues to move on traditional rails. “Because we’re a global bank, the way we approach these problems is more fundamental when it comes to building better solutions at the money movement level,” Olsen explains.</p>
<h3 id="human-centric-approach">Human-centric approach</h3>
<p>As technology becomes more sophisticated, the need for strong relationships remains key. “Human relationships are still so important,” says King-Shey. “Treasurers would rather come to their banking partner when they are considering new tools, because they’ve spent time building that relationship – whereas a fintech is a company that is selling a technology solution.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say those relationships should be taken for granted. King-Shey says that when it comes to working on data initiatives, “we have to work very closely to understand their process, their data needs, where there are challenges in their system.”</p>
<p>Olsen agrees: “When we’re building new technology, whether in-house or by working closely with fintechs, we want to make sure we are taking a client-first approach – that we’re building things our clients want, and addressing their needs in a real and holistic manner.”</p>
<h3 id="investing-in-innovation">Investing in innovation</h3>
<p>With annual firmwide technology investment of over $10 billion, J.P. Morgan takes a proactive approach to developing digital treasury and payments solutions. As well as supporting decision-making and liquidity management with solutions like Virtual Account Management, the bank was the first to issue a digital coin (JPM Coin). Also notable is the development of Liink, a scalable peer-to-peer blockchain-based network designed to ease cross-border transactions and now part of the Onyx business.</p>
<p>Looking forward, King-Shey says the data team is currently working on a machine learning application that will enable companies to enhance their cash flow forecasting processes. “Forecasting is the number one challenge for most treasury organisations, and we heard that loud and clear,” he says. “We’re excited to be using our capabilities to create an app that will help our clients forecast better.”</p>
<p>Olsen, meanwhile, explains that Onyx is looking closely at how money and data moves at the commercial level between financial institutions, fintechs and corporations in order to improve the flow of data and value across networks. “Liink and Coin Systems are both great examples of how J.P. Morgan is using distributed ledger technology to facilitate better data and value transference,” she says, adding that the team is also exploring use cases outside of payments, such as IoT and identity.</p>
<p>What’s clear is that innovation is a continuous exercise. As Olsen concludes: “In order to compete, we need to push the boundaries of what’s possible, while meeting our clients’ expectations – and their expectations will only continue to grow as technology evolves.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>It’s no secret that the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated digitisation for organisations around the world. “The common theme is that digital adoption has accelerated by many years, and is becoming a conversation at the C-suite level,” explains Sara Castelhano, EMEA Head of Payments and Digital Solutions at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>However, the destination for digital journeys can vary considerably from company to company. Some organisations are focusing on automating traditional processes, such as liquidity management, payments and working capital. Others are implementing changes to their business models, such as a shift to ecommerce channels. And of course, different companies are at different stages of transformation along this path.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-and-tools">Solutions and tools</h3>
<p>When supporting clients on their journeys, Castelhano says it is important to pin down what each company needs to build by itself, and what it can access from the bank. “Our goal is really to start with a client problem, and bring insights and an agile mindset to solve that,” she says. “That’s something that has accelerated in the last couple of months as we’ve seen digital become a top priority.”</p>
<p>For J.P. Morgan, the focus in this environment has been on building solutions that require minimal effort from clients, such as the Data Once™ portal, which simplifies the onboarding process and avoids the need to enter the same information repeatedly. Other developments include a major focus on supporting clients with e-signatures and connectivity APIs, as well as Virtual Assistant, an artificial intelligence self-service tool.</p>
<p>Another notable solution is the bank’s Virtual Branch model, explains Alan Lin, Head of Asia Pacific Core Cash Management. “In many countries in Asia, customers need to submit physical documents when they make cross-border payments – but we’ve made it possible for them to upload image files using our Virtual Branch capabilities, which removes the physical challenge,” he states. The Virtual Branch was first offered in Asia Pacific and has since been rolled out across markets in other regions,  such as Russia and Mexico.</p>
<p>Where liquidity is concerned, Lin says the bank offers a variety of techniques which allow the configuration of rules on how liquidity and currencies are automatically consolidated and centralised in real-time, either physically or notionally.  The bank’s leading solutions now extend to Virtual Account Management, which offers a unique proposition enabling in-house-banking and on-behalf-of arrangements to be implemented easily.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shift to remote working has created additional vulnerabilities where cybersecurity is concerned. As such, a key focus has been on helping clients establish the right procedures to authenticate calls, report suspicious activity and make sure that remote workforces still maintain the necessary controls.  J.P. Morgan has also responded to the growing cybersecurity threat by developing tools, adding payments data to a data lake to identify patterns, and leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="moving-digitisation-forward">Moving digitisation forward</h3>
<p>Companies may wish to access digital tools in a variety of ways, depending on where they are on their digital journeys. J.P. Morgan therefore offers a range of options to support different requirements, including an app inside the company’s enterprise resource planning system that treasurers can use to see balance information and track payments via an analytics dashboard. Others prefer a different approach: “There are customers using Microsoft Excel® that require a simple way to access real-time information,” say Lin. “So we have developed an API plug-in that feeds real-time data into Excel.”</p>
<p>With companies increasingly expecting sophisticated technology solutions from their banks, collaborating with fintech companies is another key focus. “J.P. Morgan has developed a thriving network with over 100 different fintechs, including our alliance with Taulia for supply chain finance solutions,” says Lin. “Other examples are our collaborations with Trovata, offering multi-banking treasury management system, and Global PayEx, providing EIPP and AI/ML receivables reconciliation solutions, to our clients across countries.”</p>
<p>In addition, Lin says the bank is working with specialist providers to build local solutions – such as multi-bank collection and reconciliation solutions supporting local language for Korean clients, and multi-channels collection and reconciliation solution for Indonesia clients. Other notable initiatives include the commercialisation of Project Ubin, a multi-year, multi-phase programme led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The programme aims to solve challenges around cross-currency payments clearing and settlement using blockchain technology, in partnership with DBS and Temasek. This effort is being led by Onyx by J.P. Morgan, which is a newly set-up business unit within the bank’s Wholesale Payments division.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-is-key">Relationship is key</h3>
<p>Finally, embracing digitisation may be a common goal for many organisations in today’s climate – but with companies at different stages of their digital journeys, strong banking relationships have never been more critical.</p>
<p>“You need to make sure your banking partner really understands the local landscape and gives you proactive insights, particularly when markets are complex,” says Castelhano. She notes that for example, it is more challenging for new entrants when they start operating in countries where there are specific documentary requirements or regulations around offshoring cash, like exchange control requirements in South Africa. Consequently, “understanding the local landscape is pivotal.”</p>
<p>For banks, this means paying more attention than ever to what clients are really looking for. As Lin concludes, “When it comes to designing and delivering the digital journey, the most important thing is to have a deep understanding of how the customer operates, how they leverage digital tools, and how we can provide a total solution for their new business models. That’s where we are heading.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>The pandemic has increased the need for companies to understand their cash flow and reduce costs. It makes APIs, and the automated, real-time reporting they facilitate whereby companies can better access their banking services, more important than ever. For example, APIs allow a company applying for a loan to have funds in the account seconds after approval. “This is a real case in the current environment when there is so much lending,” explains Nadya Hijazi, Global Head of Business Banking Digital at HSBC. In other examples, she cites how APIs allow investors to fund and top up their brokerage trading accounts instantly or provide online customers with instant refunds. “Everyone is selling online. APIs allow an immediate refund to customer,” she says.</p>
<p>In coming years digitisation and the role of APIs has become even more important. “I see a sea change in the coming years in how API connection helps banking services develop,” Hijazi says, detailing how APIs provide treasury with access to banking services and data on demand, swapping the business-as-usual model with accelerated digitisation as well as hastening internal processes. Here treasury can integrate APIs into their own systems to unlock data and information to create valuable business insights, she explains. “APIs allow a business to move away from end of day processing to real-time decision making and reduce manual touch points.”</p>
<p>Of course, APIs are nothing new. At HSBC they have been used for several years to connect multiple internal systems in its digital transformation programme. However, in recent years they have evolved from being used internally at the bank to allow clients to connect their infrastructure to the banks and vice versa as corporate and bank share ecosystems to “deliver enhanced digital systems for partners and customers,” she says.</p>
<p>Since 2018 she notes a significant increase in customers’ awareness of APIs and their benefits. Last year the number of RFIs and RPs HSBC received with questions related to APIs and their usage, led by tech-based companies, jumped. “We started seeing a long line of customers saying they wanted to move from normal host to host, to an API connectivity,” she recalls. This year that trend has accelerated, driven by the challenge of COVID-19. “We saw the acceleration in digital demand hit Asia first and then it accelerated across the world with COVID-19,” she says.</p>
<p>However, there are challenges to rolling out APIs. For some corporates, like those offering a real-time service to customers off their own digital platforms, APIs are already integral to their business model. For others, integration is complicated. “Some businesses have no prior experience and depend on third parties to adapt their offering via ERP systems that aren’t ready to receive APIs,” she says. “A key challenge is the ability to integrate into their own system.” Here she explains that host to host connectivity tends to be file-based whereas APIs work in real time. It requires a fast turnaround and a new way of working to manage volumes coming in from APIs with an impact on backend systems particularly. “ERP and TMS systems must adapt and as part of this, customers must get used to fraud and security issues and move from a slower paced to a faster paced environment.”</p>
<p>Other challenges include the lack of standardisation. “The industry needs to do more work here,” she says. Although the hope was that open banking would create standards “it never came back with a standardisation process,” and customers still face different standards for different banks, she says although some progress has been made in Asia around common APIs for direct debit transactions, where HSBC worked with SWIFT to define the standards. “A real time direct debit is the nirvana for many companies,” she says. At HSBC, strategy remains “listening and learning” as the bank continues to deliver the best possible API strategy and experience for its customers, she concludes.</p><br/>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>For Pedro Madeira, Group Treasurer at UK telecoms group Arqiva, open banking – the UK version of Europe’s PSD2 – and its drive to encourage banks to open-up their precious data isn’t really on the radar. “Open banking doesn’t affect us. We would be interested in exploring the opportunity to access other banks from our main bank platform, but it’s early stage and I can’t see how it would change how we do business,” he says, reflecting a muted interest in open banking’s promise of competition and innovative financial products and services that is shared by many other treasury teams.</p>
<p>For enthusiasts, however, the technology that allows banks to securely share information with their customers’ consent via application programming interfaces (APIs) with regulated third parties (TPPs) may be complex, and driving deeper, widespread adoption still a way off, but the benefits are undeniable. And signs of progress, like industry body Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE), recently reporting a record number of API calls, or requests for information, between systems, shows banks are finally responding to increased demand from treasury teams to develop corporate APIs.</p>
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p>Still, everyone agrees progress is slow. One key reason remains a lack of corporate demand. Treasury teams with little downside risk from ignoring open banking have little enthusiasm to explore its opportunities. For example, Arqiva uses an HSBC banking platform that already embeds strong customer authorisations and security protocols, says Madeira. For large corporates using SWIFT or similar third-party applications that already offer multiple banking information, the push for open banking is similarly lacklustre.</p>
<p>With no pressure from clients, corporate banks have been slow to innovate. On one hand, some of the physical infrastructure isn’t fully in place yet, explains Hakan Eroglu, Global Open Banking lead at Mastercard Advisors. Banks need to introduce APIs for TPPs to access customers’ accounts, and the speed at which banks systems respond to API calls is crucial. “At the moment, not all banks have compliant APIs available or working the way they should. Speed and availability are important in the API business,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="retail-focus">Retail focus</h4>
<p>Banks have been equally slow to roll out products for corporates to take advantage of the ability to share information. Their focus has been on retail customers, primarily around encouraging switching to stop money languishing in current accounts not earning interest. “I haven’t seen much effort being put into corporate solutions,” says Arqiva’s Madeira. “Some banks are evolving solutions but it’s sporadic. Open banking is something targeted at retail customers, and corporates have been an afterthought.” He’d like to see innovations that could help Arqiva’s B2B business like greater concentration of the company’s bank accounts, tighter security and centralised cash management. “The ability to have all this without using SWIFT would be significant for a mid-sized corporate like Arqiva.” The problem is compounded by the lack of regulation pushing corporate innovation, says Eroglu. “Most of the focus is around online banking. Corporates have much more complex needs that are not covered by PSD2 – or other regulation,” he says.</p>
<p>Like banks, fintechs have also prioritised retail over corporates, says Professor Markos Zachariadis at the Cambridge Centre for Digital Innovation. However, he does observe that fintechs have developed an increasing ability to offer corporate solutions in the last three years. “There is a lot of accumulated knowledge and experience in the fintech industry that can be re-purposed or transposed to develop business banking solutions,” he says.</p>
<p>A next step would involve fintechs partnering with banks. But this depends on corporate banks integrating with innovative fintechs leading in the space, and role models are few and far between, says Zachariadis. “Fintechs are not great at customer acquisition and banks won’t necessarily do much to provide them with access to their clients. The emergence of platforms that can connect the dots and integrate fintechs and banks into corporate systems may be the way forward for corporates to benefit from fintech innovation.”</p>
<h4 id="regulatory-barriers">Regulatory barriers</h4>
<p>Regulatory disparities between different markets don’t help. In Europe, despite overarching regulation, there is no uniform adoption of open banking between European countries. Some banks are embarking on automated onboarding processes; others are pushing manual registration or asking TPPs to register on a development portal. “There are different interpretations in different countries, and it is also a question of whether the regulation has been implemented properly,” says Eroglu.</p>
<p>Brexit is adding to unknowns for the UK’s financial services industry around PSD2, one of many pieces of legislation within the European directive. “Who is going to take charge of the implementation of this post Brexit?” questions Madeira. “It feels that regulation might be taking a back seat.”</p>



<blockquote><p>The problem is compounded by the lack of regulation pushing corporate innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Hakan Eroglu, Global Open Banking lead at Mastercard Advisors</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Outside Europe, the pace of implementation is equally disparate – and slower. For example, Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority (HKMA) began its open banking journey in 2018 launching four phases of regulation, but banks have yet to really open up account data and enable the initiation of transactions by third parties. In Singapore, “by far the most advanced country in Asia in terms of open banking and APIs” according to Eroglu, there is no regulation in place and utilisation remains comparatively low. “The reasons are a lack of market-wide standardisation of APIs and a lack of common infrastructure and processes. A fintech will be reluctant to invest time and money in developing apps that will only work with a certain bank in a relatively small market like Singapore,” he says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he believes that despite the lack of regulatory stick, open banking’s benefits will ultimately drive take up. “When we talk to banks outside Europe about their strategy around open banking in the corporate space, many are not under regulation. But they still want to understand its merits and learn how to build their own ecosystem and business model around it.”</p>
<h4 id="new-approach">New approach</h4>
<p>The lack of innovation and interest in all open banking offers, requires a new narrative to capture the industry’s imagination. And now is the time as transaction banking grows more competitive, and treasury teams take a tooth comb to costs. Moreover, the pandemic has highlighted the wider importance of APIs, forcing banks to prioritise and drive their digital offerings and explore new technologies to meet increasing client demand for digital solutions.</p>
<p>Because it is real time, open banking can transform working capital and liquidity management, says Eroglu, in an enthusiastic reminder of all open banking’s benefits. Companies can carry out instant payments from one account to another or pause payments at the touch of a button. It allows treasury to access all their transactions and balances instantaneously, giving a window into the entire dollar, sterling and yen positions in one go. By connecting to multiple banking relationships, companies can streamline and optimise invoicing, putting all their transactions into one place or paying them at the best time to optimise cash management. “There are things you can do much better when you have a 360 view of financial situation in real-time,” he says.</p>
<p>Open banking promises easier digital onboarding. Imagine a ‘passport API’ that sends all your information from a bank where you are already set up to a new one you want to join, easing a complex process frequently cited as a pain point for corporates. Similarly, it would allow bank credit committees to make quicker, more informed decisions to boost credit lines by sharing data.</p>
<p>Nor is any business too small or large to benefit. For large corporates, the technology can feed data directly into their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, providing treasurers with insights on cash flow trends that can help them improve financial efficiency, suggests Andrea Melville, Managing Director and Head of Commercialisation and Propositions, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.</p>
<p>As for smaller companies (which find SWIFT too expensive and in excess of their needs, yet still need multiple bank accounts) it enables information sharing across one centralised platform as opposed to managing three or four separate banking relationships, a benefit that has crossed Madeira’s radar. “In this respect, open banking could ward off cyber security concerns and manage multiple authorisations and mandates. It would simplify processes and also keep things tight, centralised and secure,” he says.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Lloyds is currently testing an intelligent book-keeping solution for small businesses that combines data gathered from open banking with companies’ own invoices and expenses data. “It will help reduce the administration load for small and medium businesses and enable them to make better financial decisions through real-time cash forecasting and profit and loss information,” says Melville.</p>
<p>Lloyds is also using open banking technology to become a Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP), a type of TPP authorised to make payments in and out of accounts. It creates a new receivables proposition that will allow its largest clients to improve the payment experience for its end customers. “On top of this, we’re developing new applications for APIs that corporates are starting to integrate directly into their own systems. A good example is an API that speeds-up the ‘time to decision’ for asset finance credit requests,” she says.</p>
<h4 id="investment">Investment</h4>
<p>It’s the kind of product innovation and new customer propositions that are finally starting to trickle. But banks’ journey to becoming API-driven organisations, shifting to innovation and monetising open banking doesn’t just require a new mindset. It also needs investment, says Eroglu, who urges treasury teams and their banking partners to view open banking as an opportunity rather than a regulatory must. “Banks need to invest, especially in the regulated market. It means investing in technology and finding their way with the help of strategic and consulting advice. Banks need to make themselves open and agile and change their business models.”</p>
<p>Only then will they begin to think about distributing new products in different ways, rethink their target operational model and put themselves between multiple business models as a service, a platform and as third-party service provider – a position already grabbed by the tech groups and other API driven companies. In short, banks need to focus on corporate clients, and grab the opportunity to innovate in a win-win for banks and treasury. “We would consider changing bank accounts if we found that a bank starts racing ahead in terms of developing open banking tools we could take advantage of,” concludes Madeira.</p>

<p><em>“There is an ongoing digital revolution in the supply chain finance space. What should treasurers be aware of?”</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>The first half of 2020 brought tremendous change to Singapore’s trade finance eco-system. Several high-profile fraud cases (ie Hin Leong, Agritrade) and government-imposed lockdowns due to the global pandemic led to significant changes in banks’ handling of deal compliance and documentation work-flows. The ensuing “forced” acceleration of the digital revolution created challenges and opportunities for all stakeholders along the value-chain. Early adopters of new technologies had a head start when it came to adjust and take advantage of this new reality.</p>
<p>We at Agrocorp greatly benefitted from our experiences in pioneering blockchain-based trade finance solutions. We developed in partnership with DLT Ledgers and major banking institutions such as DBS and Rabobank, a platform that replaces traditional paper-based trade documentations with digital API interfaced applications which guarantee trust, traceability and transparency by utilising a blockchain architecture.</p>
<p>The project created a good foundation for the year 2020. We had completed a full review of technological bottlenecks between our treasury and operations departments and external stakeholders. The close coordination with our banks and suppliers had given us a great understanding of each other’s needs and constraints.</p>
<p>Two important lessons emerged: first, the digital revolution was primarily held back by bureaucratic inertia, and not by a lack of technological solutions. Second, creating the right company culture that encourages and rewards innovation is the key driver for corporate change. Both points proved essential when the pandemic counter-measures hit our day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Disruption in the flow of physical documents meant intense pressure on everyone to migrate to digital solutions like e-signatures and submission of electronic trade documents via bank portals. Sending most staff to work-from-home, while these process changes occur, required our colleagues to quickly adapt and shape solutions to reduce delays and disruptions. Our long-standing practice to embrace and drive change paid off and earned us praise across our business partners.</p>
<p>The pandemic also caused a highly volatile macro environment accompanied with reduced risk appetite by our banking partners. The Singapore market felt special pressure this year due to significant losses in commodity trade finance fraud cases in the first quarter. Banks introduced additional compliance checks, causing longer trade document turnover times. For those who embrace technology, the impact can be lessened and a client can differentiate itself to the bank.</p>
<p>Another benefit to digital integration of the supply chain is that both buyers and sellers can optimise working capital and improve liquidity. Buyers can also create more robust supply chains by leveraging their access to cheap finance to support key suppliers and have increased levels of transparency in first, second, and even third-tiers whilst enabling more accurate forecasting and greater predictability.</p>
<p>Widespread industry adoption of new technologies like blockchain enable integration and seamless data transfer between parties, as well as reducing delays and effort, and increasing the ability to demonstrate provenance and sustainability. During the peak of COVID-19, we managed to move 14.3% more product compared to the same period last year. We saw the biggest improvement in rice, oilseeds, feed, cashew and cotton, as these products rose more than 40%.</p>
<p>For Agrocorp, we weathered the storm exceptionally well, managed to reduce our documents collection times with the help of our business partners and win new business in times when our competition pulled back.</p>

<p>Digitalisation in supply chains is not new. What is new, however, is the pace of that change – the speed at which new technologies are emerging and being adopted has intensified. The pandemic has also catalysed that change as companies accelerate digitalisation initiatives as they adapt to working from home and realise that a lack of digitisation can lead to supply chain processes grinding to a halt.</p>
<p>Even today, many organisations retain a surprising number of inefficient or paper-based processes, which simple, well-developed and accessible digitisation capabilities can help to automate.</p>
<p>There are many immediate and practical opportunities for treasurers to digitalise the processes they have with their banks. They can leverage new tools to manage onboarding documentation digitally and use eSignature to accelerate the legal documentation cycle. While electronic payments are not new, many trade and supply chain finance capabilities have traditionally remained highly paper-based. Now companies can use character recognition technology to move from paper to image to data-based communication, shortening cycle times, eliminating cost and reducing risk.</p>
<p>Treasurers should also focus on the “back to basics” approach of driving manual and paper-based processes out of their supply chains. Simple digitalisation initiatives can remove many dependencies from supply chain processes, improving agility, reducing risk, and ensuring the continuity of treasury processes regardless of physical locations. Most importantly, such digitalisation initiatives lay important groundwork to prepare for future innovations – like DLT – by having already automated and streamlined a company’s supply chain and the financial processes that sit around it.</p>
<p>Global supply chains are very complex and one of the key challenges lies in digitalising the end-to-end value chain. There are diverse constituents, often in countries with disparate rules, practices and standards. End-to-end automation is at the mercy of the least sophisticated actor in the supply chain, often determined by local market rules. Where standards and platforms exist, it’s often a battle between you adopting mine, or me adopting yours.</p>
<p>This has impacted uptake and eroded the benefit of digitalising global supply chains. But as more regulators and other players recognise the importance of digitisation as a way to keep economies moving, we should expect to see more of a drive to align legal and regulatory standards to facilitate greater – and more consistent – digitalisation of all the participants in a supply chain.</p>
<h4 id="">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Digitalisation is also only one of the many drivers influencing supply chains today, which treasurers need to consider: reshoring, geopolitical uncertainty, shifting supply chains, and driving sustainability to name just a few.</p>
<p>The pandemic has emphasised the importance of digitisation, moving it from being merely a driver of incremental efficiency to an imperative that could determine whether a company has the ability to continue operating in the face of significant global disruption for them, their counterparties and their banks.</p>
<p>Finally, it is not all about new, revolutionary technology. Those will continue to emerge and evolve; but many of the opportunities for treasurers are much closer to home – as simple as continuing to drive paper-based and other physical processes out of the financial supply chain.</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create economic chaos worldwide, treasurers must look for ways to ensure the financial standing of their companies remains strong. Having full visibility into the company’s finances is critical for treasurers to ensure there is enough liquidity to support day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Fintechs across the world are stepping up to provide solutions to challenges like real-time visibility of cash flows, visibility into the strength and resilience of suppliers, and the levers with which to control working capital can support treasury operations. These solutions can de-risk treasurers’ work by making sure they have a complete view of both expenditure and upcoming income to enable them to make adjustments.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when treasurers have to rely on spreadsheets and reports to manage cash forecasts, daily transactions and working capital targets. A new generation of tools driven by today’s technology, which fully integrate into ERP systems, are available for treasurers to improve efficiently and effectively as they navigate through the new working world. A best-of-breed technology solution includes features such as cash flow management and supply chain management to help paint a holistic picture of the company’s finances.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cash flow management</strong> – treasurers need full visibility into the cash flow of the business. Having visibility will help them to make quick decisions, which is essential in the current economic environment. Access to a solution will ensure that a treasurer spends their time on more valuable and strategic tasks, as opposed to manual data entry and management of spreadsheets and documents.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Supply chain management</strong> – treasurers need to ensure that a healthy supply chain remains operational and all regional compliance is being followed. A technology solution helps to streamline and automate current processes, such as checking the status of invoice payments, which is costly and time-consuming.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The digital revolution in the world of supply chains will continue to gain traction as the world adjusts to life during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic. Processes and operations that can be automated will help treasurers to focus on their bottom line: to ensure there is enough liquidity to survive and thrive during all business cycles. Going digital is no longer just a phase, it is here to stay and treasurers need to implement solutions that will change their work for the better.</p>



<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading">Next question:</h3>
<p><em>“Evidence suggests that companies with a declared purpose perform better on important metrics over time than their less-purposeful peers. (Purposeful companies have a clear role in the world that offers them a reason for being, and promise to work for all their stakeholders rather than just shareholders.) How is this new idea of corporate purpose manifesting in corporate Treasury?”</em></p>

<p>In a recent webinar, Marcus Hughes, Head of Strategic Business Development at Bottomline Technologies and Patrick Verspecht, Group Treasurer, Trillium Flow Technologies, Board Member &amp; Secretary of the Board at the ATEB, shared their views on how the latest technology can help towards an easier and faster path to digital transformation.</p>
<p>“For sure, the payments industry is going through a period of unprecedented change. A range of factors are driving this: new regulations, payment instruments, payment schemes and formats, as well as new technology. Increasingly, the treasurer is expected to do more with less, while the size of treasury teams is getting smaller and smaller. So, it’s not possible now, in our day-to-day work as treasurers, to cope without technology tools,” says Verspecht.</p>
<p>The treasurer is responsible for managing the project, implementation, testing, resources, timelines and then “going live”. It’s perhaps surprising that today this focus on projects has expanded to become almost 50% of a treasurer’s role. Thanks to technology, many operational matters can be automated, meaning the treasury team can focus on more strategic matters.</p>

<p>Instead of joining SWIFT, Trillium Flow Technologies used Bottomline’s BIC as a service solution. The Payments and Cash Management (PCM) solution is network agnostic and works with full SWIFT SCORE membership, EBICS, H2H or direct local ACH clearing. The solution’s standard environment comes with embedded routing rules and standard formats, like MT940/942; PAIN 002 PSR; MT101; PAIN 001, Standard 18. PCM formats are based on CGI ISO 20022. This means that Bottomline was able to take the company through the various project phases very quickly; from development, QA, UAT and then live.</p>
<p>Now that the company has put in place the cash reporting functionalities, it is planning to implement multi-bank payments, and more features in the future.</p>

<p>The following key factors emerge from the way Bottomline approaches its proposition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mitigation of risks by real time visibility and strict control to avoid fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost efficiency by automation and technology.</p>

<li>
<p>Centralised platform payment and statement hub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits of an aggregated infrastructure and connectivity to multiple payment schemes.</p>

<p>More insight at your fingertips presented in simple but intuitive formats to drive faster and more accurate decision making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="successful-transformation">Successful transformation</h4>
<p>Hughes closed the session with three top tips for a successful and rapid digital transformation:</p>
<p>Start simple and small. For example, utilise bank statement monitoring tools for enhanced real-time visibility of transactions in your main bank accounts and combine with BIC as a Service to leverage the SWIFT network without the overhead membership.</p>
<p>Then expand and roll out in a controlled way. For example, with a centralised payment and collection hub to view the status of all payments and take the necessary action to ensure seamless execution and reduce the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>Finally, aggregate the status of all payment flows for a complete and real-time view of visibility for more effective cash management and working capital optimisation.</p>

<p>Before we analyse the question we need to first understand the difference between digitalisation and digitisation, since the two are often confused. Digitisation in its simplest form is converting information from a physical format into a digital one. For example, scanning a medical prescription and saving it as a PDF would be digitisation.</p>
<p>Digitalisation is slightly more complex. This means harnessing the digitised information to improve processes. In the example of my digitising the prescription, only when I store the prescription in a platform (say, the cloud) – which can be accessed at any point of time – will it be digitalisation. This saves me from carrying the prescription with me when I next visit my doctor.</p>
<p>Once we understand the underlying principles of digitisation and digitalisation, we can examine if it is worth engaging ourselves in this enhanced effort. I argue in favour of digitalisation on the following grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Your customer is your focus</strong> – you can be closer to the customer through digitalisation. It is the easiest and cheapest method for any business to reach the customer. Social networks, opinion polls and websites all help the business to understand the customer’s needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The decision turnaround</strong> – while digitisation goes hand-in-hand with data management, digitalisation leads to harnessing information – the faster the information is processed, the better the decision-making is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Productivity matters</strong> – this is probably the most critical. Digitalisation leads to more knowledge and when such knowledge is used intelligently, it can lead to a significant increase in productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee friendly</strong> – options such as flexible working hours and working from home need the support of digitalisation. This benefits not only the employees but the employer too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brand recall</strong> – the extent to which customers are able to recall or recognise a brand. This increases the public awareness of the organisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So how do we prevent digitalisation from creating more problems? One possible approach could be through the clear understanding of the threats and opportunities that the digital world presents to the business. This can be addressed through an assessment of the challenges posed alongside the possible digitalisation endeavours to resolve them. With this basic understanding it should be possible to create a plan that will ensure success in the digitalisation endeavour.</p>
<p>The idea that digitisation and digitalisation are transforming the business and operating models has already been time-tested and the new business models will continue to stand the test of time in the current digital era. It will become imperative for businesses to develop digital strategies and comprehensive digital operating models.</p>
<p>Digitalisation today is no longer a choice but a necessity. Technology is changing the world and the progress is not linear. In the future, the digital strategy will become the business as usual strategy. This is the time to get a head start.</p>

<p>The fintech industry has boomed in the last decade precisely because people recognise that fintechs are providing simple solutions to really complex problems. International payments is a perfect example of how a process, which has traditionally been unnecessarily convoluted, is now being simplified for millions of businesses across the world. For the first time, payments systems can be harnessed to help businesses grow, rather than act as a burden or inhibitor.</p>
<p>The SWIFT global payments initiative (gpi) is likely to really kick off in 2020 and the coming years. The new system for global payments will increase speed, from days to minutes, if not seconds. Transparency will also drastically improve, meaning you are able to see where your payment is at any moment, and the cost of international transfers will also come down.</p>
<p>Yet, there is still more work to be done. Reconciliation is still probably the greatest challenge facing treasury departments today when it comes to payments. With traditional methods, a typical payment will pass through numerous intermediaries, which adds to the cost and shrouds the process in mystery, making a payment extremely difficult to track.</p>
<p>This means that when treasury departments receive a payment they often struggle to match it against the original invoice because what arrives in an account doesn’t match what’s been invoiced, or in many cases, what has been sent, even though all parties have acted in good faith. Global accounts that hold multiple currencies and allow businesses to invoice in local currencies can make the process a lot smoother for all parties.</p>

<h4 id="digitisation-vs-digitalisation">Digitisation vs digitalisation</h4>
<p>First of all, it is important to make the distinction between “digitisation” and “digitalisation”. A number of people use these two terms interchangeably but they are in fact quite distinct. “Digitisation” means the conversion of data from analogue or physical form to a digital form (bits and bytes) that can be read and understood by computers. “Digitalisation” on the other hand is the actual process of moving from manual or paper-based processes to an electronic or digital mode, to improve efficiency and enhance the customer experience. And further along the digital spectrum is the process of “digital transformation”, which looks at the company’s strategy on using digital technology to completely change the value proposition for the customer and generate additional revenue streams.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example from everyday life to illustrate the difference between each of these terms. Scanning a newspaper to make a digital version of the same paper is digitisation. Sending an electronic copy of that newspaper or making it available online to the readers is the digitalisation of that process. Creating an entirely new online website or app to change the way readers access and read their news is true digital transformation.</p>
<h4 id="todays-digital-world">Today’s digital world</h4>
<p>Today, we live in a digital society and the vast majority of our social and business interactions are digital in nature. Ranging from social media and news to education and ecommerce, every aspect of our lives is touched and shaped by digital technology. Technology is no longer just an enabler but is in fact the very driver of everyday experiences at the social and the business level.</p>
<p>No business today can afford to do without a vision and strategy for digital transformation. And the undisputable fact is that digital transformation is simply not possible without digitisation. The actual process of digitisation can be challenging and does not come without its problems, especially if done in an ad hoc manner without a proper digital strategy in place.</p>
<p>Digitisation needs to be managed within the wider framework of digital transformation with clear articulation of how the digital experience is going to improve the overall employee and customer experience. Just digitising the information, without changing the underlying process and delivery of the information will not yield the desired results and will more often than not derail the entire digitisation process. For digital transformation (and digitisation) to be successful, there needs to be broad cultural change across the organisation and acceptance of the way business needs to be conducted in the digital world. Adaptation of business processes to emerging technologies like AI, APIs and mobile are key to longer-term success of any digital transformation programmes.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The process of digitisation is a means to the end, without which digital transformation and continued growth and very existence of the organisation is not possible. The potential for increased customer satisfaction and corresponding growth in revenues by harnessing the power of digital transformation far surpasses any challenges in the actual process of digitisation.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Given the importance of accurate and timely cash forecasting to the whole organisation, an outsider would be forgiven for thinking that every possible resource would be made available to ensure the right numbers are accessible as and when required.</p>
<p>But, as many treasurers will know to their frustration, even with the best will in the world there is often neither the time nor the means to gather that data, particularly for the short-term 12 or 13-week rolling forecasts typically derived from receipts or payments-based data.</p>
<p>Short-term treasury forecasts of this nature give a better operational view of cash than medium-term P&amp;L-type forecasting that offers a more strategic view over 12 months or more. Indeed, short-term rolling forecasts should afford treasury a view that helps them manage their daily cash positions around key areas such as whether they are borrowing or depositing short term, and what currencies they are exposed to.</p>
<h4 id="ideal-vs-reality">Ideal vs reality</h4>
<p>The data required is ideally submitted in a timely manner by every company in the group and formed into a consolidated view. If executed well, treasury has a relatively early alert for any impending major incomings or outgoings, and attendant currency requirements. In its ideal form then, the treasury forecast is simply a better decision-management tool for the kind of daily cash positioning that most large companies undertake.</p>
<p>However, whilst the benefits of treasury forecasts based on short-term cash flow are manifold, the accuracy and timeliness of the data from which they are derived is frequently found wanting, says Carol Power, a corporate treasury consultant and interim treasurer of many years’ experience. That lack, she notes, can typically be traced back to a failing in organisational systems.</p>
<p>“Most treasuries are lean operations,” notes Power. “Without a decent solution to help manage the data processing aspect, treasury often finds itself being overwhelmed. Indeed, with many treasuries running on spreadsheets, harvesting and consolidating data on a weekly basis from 30, 40 or more group companies can be more than a little challenging.”</p>
<p>Expecting teams from other functions to continually update a rolling forecast is one thing; expecting someone in a lean treasury operation to drop all their regular pressing affairs to create a consolidated spreadsheet view of the entire enterprise, and then analyse the results, is quite another. As such, Power notes that the value of forecasting as a decision-making tool can often be overlooked in the clamour to get other vital day-to-day treasury tasks discharged. It’s all about prioritisation, she says, and cutting and pasting figures from multiple spreadsheets gathered from around the group does not often feature highly on the overworked treasurer’s agenda.</p>
<h4 id="business-case">Business case</h4>
<p>And yet being in a position to better manage cash and currency positions as a net borrower could serve to reduce interest costs. If treasury knows its cash positions precisely, it no longer needs to maintain a large cash buffer and can streamline its borrowing requirements.</p>
<p>Most corporates will have facilities with a degree of headroom; astute forecasting can thus lower that headroom, which in turn can reduce commitment fees payable to the bank for holding, what are in effect, unused facilities. “Treasury could unlock a real cost benefit,” says Power, “but ultimately, on a day-to-day basis, better forecasting means better financial decision-making.”</p>
<p>This suggests a clear business case for developing a systemic framework for managing treasury forecasting; it delivers process advantages and there is an additional benefit, says Power. In fact, the exchange of data, in a simple streamlined way, promotes a value-adding two-way engagement between treasury and the business units. A treasury that is unable, through time-constraints, to consolidate its forecasting data, will certainly not have time to analyse that data. This prevents it from subsequently communicating its findings to the business units.</p>
<p>It follows that being able to consolidate and analyse that data gives treasury a greater opportunity to help the other units better manage their own forecasting activities. This matters because failure to secure visibility over cash positions can, at best, lead to sub-optimal short-term cash and currency positions, resulting in higher interest costs and foreign exchange risk and, in extreme cases, insolvency.</p>
<h4 id="project-thinking">Project thinking</h4>
<p>Upgrading technology can bring about more accurate and timely forecasting, and for the treasury that has deployed a treasury management system (TMS) or ERP, logic dictates that the incumbent platform be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>However, Power sees a major issue potentially arising from the roll-out of TMS or ERP forecasting functionality to a large group. “It can quickly become a major systems project,” she comments, adding that such projects can quickly rack up the costs and the pressure on resources – not just on treasury but also on IT and the business units concerned.</p>
<h4 id="new-view">New view</h4>
<p>What may have seemed a logical step, suddenly morphs into a series of imponderables. But treasury has options, even for bread-and-butter activities like forecasting, says Power. “Rather than base it on a modified core platform, it is entirely possible to rapidly deploy a niche system.” The fintech market has perfected the building of specialist software, delivering and maintaining web-based solutions for a wider spread of users.</p>
<p>The software as a service (SaaS) delivery and licencing model is a proven and agile method of quickly and cost-effectively rolling out an application to multiple users. It allows centrally-hosted subscription-based services to be accessed using just a secure link and a password. Analyste CashForecast, a module within the company’s Trezone suite for treasuries, for example, sits on a remote server and, once configured, simply requires users across the business to login and upload their own cash data to share with the central treasury function.</p>
<p>With very little effort, a treasurer can view every position across the business as a consolidated report, with capacity to drill down to business-unit level. “It makes the decision-making process around short-term cash much improved,” remarks Power.</p>
<p>Having implemented Analyste CashForecast for a number of corporates – as both a standalone and ‘bolt-on’ core system module – she reveals that although principally a central treasury-led system, once configured, “it also becomes a tool for the business units to leverage for their own cash visibility needs”. The units have the option to upload data manually or automatically from their own systems.</p>
<p>Treasury can grant access to data and analysis so that each unit has full visibility over its own cash positions by business unit and by region or division as necessary. It is a distinct advantage for all if, when it comes to approaching central treasury for funding, each unit can do so in good time and with a complete set of supporting cash metrics.</p>
<h4 id="power-of-niche">Power of niche</h4>
<p>Where once treasurers longed for a single platform in which they could do everything, there is perhaps a realisation that, as the pace of innovation continues unabated, adopting a select group of ‘best-of-breed’ systems may offer improved levels of performance. “It’s no longer such a big deal for a treasurer to log into a few different systems, especially when many SaaS solutions support single-sign-on,” notes Power.</p>
<p>With the treasury forecasting challenge now centring on getting the right data in a timely manner from the business units, a product that is easily launched, accessed and used with little or no training, is a genuine solution to that challenge. Analyste CashForecast is such a product, says Power. “It is not trying to do anything overly complicated because cash forecasting is not complicated,” she notes. Perhaps this is the secret of the success of niche products like Analyste CashForecast.</p>
<p>Of course, treasurers will understandably be sceptical about products marketed as ‘quick, easy, low-cost solutions’, says Power. “We’ve heard it all before.” But, with hard evidence to support such claims drawn from several interim assignments with major corporates, experience has shown her that Analyste CashForecast delivers.</p>
<p>Whilst other processes may justifiably clamour for the treasurer’s attention, Power understands that good forecasting is critical to the successful running of treasury. “Whether they have a core system or use spreadsheets, it is a fundamental, underlying, basic challenge that every corporate treasury has.”</p>
<p>It follows that if the process can be managed without fuss, bringing the business units closer to treasury, and vice versa, and enabling more effective decision-making across the organisation, then the power of niche solutions should not be overlooked.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>With every swipe, click, like, search, stream and purchase, data is being created to the tune of 2.5 quintillion bytes every day, according to Domo, the cloud-based operating system provider. And by 2020 it reckons an astonishing 1.7 MB of data will be created every second for every person on earth.</p>
<p>No surprise then that leveraging data has become a major objective for both companies and governments and given rise to the ‘data economy’. Consultant McKinsey estimates that better access to, in particular, open data – public information and shared data from private sources that everyone can access and use – can help unlock US$3-5trn in global economic value  across seven sectors alone: education, transportation; consumer products; electricity; oil and gas; health care and consumer finance.</p>
<p>Flows of data now play a much bigger role in tying the global economy together, says McKinsey, pointing out that global online traffic across borders grew 18-fold between 2005 and 2012, and could increase eightfold more by 2025. It believes digital technologies and data flows are increasingly “becoming the connective tissue of the global economy”.</p>
<p>More specifically, the European Commission reckons that in the EU alone this data-driven economy had a value of almost €300bn in 2016 and that it will more than double by 2020, reaching €749bn.</p>
<p>Among technologies that will support the rise of the data economy, artificial intelligence is expected to play an especially important central role. McKinsey foresees at least one type of artificial intelligence technology being utilised by 70% of businesses by 2030. That increased adoption of AI technology would be worth around US$13 trn to the global economy. AI could, furthermore, expand employment by around 5% by 2030 as well as improve productivity by about 10%.</p>
<p>While governments are increasingly leveraging open data for improving the quality of life of their citizens, it is corporates that have to date benefitted most from the data revolution, most spectacularly a small band of ‘digital first’ companies with a combined value of US$4trn: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.</p>
<p>As the data revolution gathers momentum, ‘physical first’ companies – the overwhelming majority of corporates and financials globally – will need to learn from the success of the digital firsts as they too look to leverage data and monetise it. The challenges ahead for them are varied and many: exploiting new technologies like AI, Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G; dealing with regulations such as PSD2/Open Banking and GDPR, developing new business models; addressing the needs of millennials and native digital generations that follow as customers; and ensuring data security, to name but a few.</p>
<p>However, as Nigel Dobson, Banking Services Lead and Leigh Mahoney, Head of Wholesale Digital, Institutional, ANZ point out, while the challenges for organisations are many, there will also be many opportunities for them that will emerge as the data economy evolves.</p>


<blockquote><p>It’s a new frontier, and those who are accountable for delivering the insights have a huge responsibility to get it right, reassuring all stakeholders that the boundaries within which they are operating are appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Nigel Dobson, Banking Services Lead, ANZ</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Creating and retaining competitive advantage will increasingly mean leveraging data to make strategic decisions, improve operational efficiencies, and drive sustainable growth and innovation.</p>
<p>In commercial terms, few could dismiss the importance of data; and fewer still could deny that competitive advantage awaits organisations able to quickly access, integrate, refine, analyse and share data.</p>
<p>“It’s becoming increasingly evident that the value of data, and data analytics, as a support to business is a tremendous opportunity,” says Dobson. However, he notes that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>In this instance, unbounded data analytics is met by regulatory forces acting to protect citizens – particularly measures such as the EU’s GDPR, Australia’s Consumer Data Right (CDR) and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).</p>
<h4 id="value-versus-risk">Value versus risk</h4>
<p>These Acts are empowered to heavily penalise organisations that do not compliantly manage data storage. In GDPR’s case this could be up to €10m, or 2% annual global turnover – whichever is higher. For CDR, a fine of up to AU$2.1m for businesses is possible. And for PDPA, it could mean a fine not exceeding S$100,000. They could add up to a significant disincentive for firms seeking to engage with the new data economy.</p>
<p>“The narrative is reaching new highs in terms of the commercial value of data and analytics, but the consequences of getting it wrong have similarly increased,” notes Dobson. This, he believes, has led some organisations to adopt a more conservative approach to the handling of their data assets.</p>
<p>It is also unhelpful for many firms that siloed data has created for them enterprise-wide divisions. Finding a single customer-reference across a number of products can prove difficult in these circumstances, says Dobson. The customer annoyance this typically presents – explaining a case repeatedly or receiving the same information multiple times – is not uncommon.</p>
<p>These data siloes have a negative internal impact too, he notes. In the banking sector, for example, where data management is characterised by some of the highest required levels of privacy and security, the “self-erected barriers” of product silos and customer segmentations can lead to sub-optimal performance, certainly from the perspective of additional timely customer insights.</p>
<p>For many banks though, the notion of providing value by using data analytics to help customers gain a deeper understanding of their own and their competitors’ business activities, is a key differentiating factor. Indeed, for all regulated institutions, getting accurate data into the hands of the right customers in a manner that is timely, secure and compliant is vital.</p>
<p>The imperative for banks and corporate clients to find quick answers to some of their most pressing business concerns is leading to the deployment, or at least the consideration of real-time technologies, comments Mahoney. He believes this state of affairs is heralding an urgent overhaul of risk management processes.</p>
<p>The ability to share the vast computing power offered by providers such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft is a major benefit, but at the same time, warns Mahoney, organisations taking this huge step forward need to find a way of balancing speed of data processing with appropriate controls around security and compliance.</p>
<p>“Controls must be established around who has access to data, when and for how long, because across many organisations increasing processing speeds and the interconnectedness of data pools now demands it,” he explains.</p>
<h4 id="new-responsibilities">New responsibilities</h4>
<p>The rise of the new data economy is made yet more complex by a simultaneous shift of focus from data about ‘things’ – metrics describing the movement of goods or money, for example – to data about people, notes Dobson. “As a bank, we’ve always had data about people, but the idea that we would do more with it other than store it is relatively new.”</p>
<p>Where metrics on liquidity management or account consolidation reporting focus on aiding the banks and their clients’ own needs, there is now a great interest in quantifying human activities, offering new levels of insight and understanding.</p>


<blockquote><p>Whether it’s for autonomous vehicles on the roads, automated medical procedures or a host of other possibilities, improvements in data transmission could open up industries where precision-machinery communicates in ways that, today, we can only dream of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Leigh Mahoney, Head of Wholesale Digital, Institutional, ANZ</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>As the focal point shifts, access to cloud-based data solutions and almost unlimited computing power is delivering some highly articulate results. But concerns are rising around privacy and accuracy of the data held.</p>
<p>Indeed, notes Dobson, there is increasing general discomfort around organisations forming and acting upon deeper data analytics-derived insights into individuals. The opportunities for organisations to push the boundaries of what is acceptable here are a constant reminder that “technology leads and regulation lags”.</p>
<p>Says Dobson: “It’s a new frontier, and those who are accountable for delivering the insights have a huge responsibility to get it right, reassuring all stakeholders that the boundaries within which they are operating are appropriate.”</p>
<h4 id="levelling-the-field">Levelling the field</h4>
<p>Of course, availability of technology is not always followed by its adoption. In this respect, the utility that corporates can gain from data, either created in-house or imported from third parties, largely correlates with an organisation’s technological capacity and willingness to invest in leveraging data. The current degree of variance in technological uptake is noteworthy.</p>
<p>The Australian mineral and energy resources sector is particularly well-evolved in terms of technology and use of data, notes Dobson. This follows from the intensive automation programmes seen across the supply chains of major players, from extraction through to delivery. With drones and GPS-assisted self-driving trucks in remote sites, and the heavy adoption of the IoT to monitor progress, commodities could easily be considered a leader amongst all sectors in Australia. With the country’s iron ore exports alone accounting for 58% of a global US$66.6bn market, it’s not hard to see how optimising efficiencies can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Many other sectors are just beginning their journey towards optimising data-usage. These players are not necessarily laggards and, for Dobson, “there is a correlation between sectoral appetite for data analytics, and the sensitivity of the data held by the sector”.</p>
<p>The highly asymmetric risk faced by companies holding sensitive data – especially given the new power of the regulators – has the effect of curtailing their desire to move too far ahead of the rule-book, he explains. “These businesses are as interested in being trailblazers as any other, but the consequences of non-compliance with data regulations can be severe.” As such, most ensure their investments in the area of leveraging personal data move strictly in alignment with the industry and the law, but as explained earlier, “technology leads and regulation lags” and so it is perhaps inevitable that they appear to be slow on the uptake.</p>
<h4 id="greater-understanding">Greater understanding</h4>
<p>Where freely given personal consumer data (as might be harvested by supermarket loyalty cards) is leveraged, Mahoney notes that it can drive revealing discussions around demographics, customer behaviours and loyalty. With more accurate insight than simple ‘gut feeling’ or customer anecdotal evidence, the effect can be to steer better decisions on investments in product development or business expansion, for example.</p>
<p>Exploitation of private personal data, such as medical or employment records, crosses the regulatory boundary but businesses in this space can still use generic ‘anonymised’ data to gain a deeper understanding of customers.</p>
<p>That said, as people become more aware of the power and value of data, there is an even greater effort towards securing their own privacy. Some of the recent highly publicised data breaches and the exposure of behaviours on certain social media platforms have sounded the alarm bell for many individuals in this respect. Where once they gave their data freely, a more guarded attitude prevails; people know and understand the rights afforded them by the regulators, and why those rights exist.</p>
<p>The development of open banking is also driving further awareness of the value of data, says Mahoney. “With the discussion comes a greater understanding of the consent management frameworks supporting the roll-out of APIs.” Increased adoption of IoT is also shifting market dynamics. This is a technology capable of generating vast amounts of highly specific data with which businesses can potentially target even the most niche areas of consumer life. Once again, as its benefits are explained, Mahoney sees it raising levels of awareness around how data is being used.</p>
<p>Commensurate with this greater understanding are the policy-driven initiatives designed to return rights to the individual. This is changing the dynamics of the relationship between data subject and data holder, but it is also helping to construct a solid framework of understanding for the digital age, enabling the next wave of innovation to push ahead – and businesses to leverage the new data economy in safety.</p>
<h4 id="riding-the-next-wave">Riding the next wave</h4>
<p>With 5G networks rolling out across the world, the capacity of data transmission is mounting. This, says Dobson, is empowering all stakeholders and giving rise to new sources of data. In the future data economy, he suggests machine-to-machine communication could be amongst the most powerful.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s for autonomous vehicles on the roads, automated medical procedures or a host of other possibilities, improvements in data transmission could open up industries where precision-machinery communicates in ways that, today, we can only dream of,” says Mahoney.</p>
<p>The nature of machine-to-machine data transmission may have a huge impact on the nature of commercial models and economies in general. As cutting edge solutions become commonplace, it will impact core commercial activities such as payments and collections. With real-time data, the rise of fractional or micro-payments begins to emerge.</p>
<p>Treasury tends to think in terms of end-of-day batch payments. But where the transmission method increases in velocity, so too does the data flow. This, suggests Dobson, will lead to a “profound change to the way commercial entities operate”.</p>
<p>Indeed, instant automated micro-payments could be made to suppliers based on devices sharing job completion data, potentially several times a day as a project progresses. With confirming transactions taking place at near-instantaneous speed, the velocity of commerce increases in parallel. Batch processing may be fine for now but the positive implications of real-time data exchanges for treasurers are significant in terms of liquidity and working capital management.</p>
<h4 id="getting-ready">Getting ready</h4>
<p>With the increasing speed of networks and data transmission, Mahoney believes that the power of data – and thus its value and price – becomes “inextricably linked to the solution providers capable of transforming data to solve real business challenges”.</p>
<p>However, rather than acquiring data assets en masse, or implementing a broad-sweep approach to the new data economy, he advises corporates to adopt a focused ‘use-case’ approach. Building a use-case first requires data to be extracted from the right sources – potentially challenging in a legacy environment. The data haul must then be transformed into value-adding information; appropriate platforms and in-house skills must be available to achieve this. The final high-level consideration is data distribution. This means getting the insight to the right place, at the right time, in the right format and in a secure and governed way.</p>
<p>For use-cases to succeed, and for businesses to engage successfully with the new data economy, it becomes incumbent upon each function to identify and understand their particular challenges or goals before deciding on the scale of investment. At this point, it is advantageous to work closely with external partners, particularly relationship banks who can offer an appropriate wide-angled view of the business itself and the environment in which it operates.</p>
<p>As the data economy gathers momentum, competitive advantage will most likely be found by businesses capable of leveraging internal and external data. Indeed, when it comes to making effective strategic decisions, driving operational efficiencies, and ensuring sustainable growth and innovation, access to the new king would appear to be vital.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Application programming interfaces (API) have been around since the 1960s. If they aren’t a new concept, why have they become such a hot topic lately? Without APIs, the digital experiences that we expect every day as consumers (eg Google maps) simply would not be possible. APIs have evolved from the very early days, but it was the birth of web APIs in 2000 that really highlighted the potential opportunities.</p>
<p>In November 2000, eBay launched its API along with a developers’ programme. Adoption by Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter increased the level of interest in API technology. In June 2009, Apple launched the iPhone 3G and its App Store began allowing iPod Touch and iPhone owners to download applications through the iTunes desktop software or the App Store on their iPhones. This opened up an entirely new world of mobile applications, all underpinned by API technology.</p>
<p>How does this relate to the world of banking? The drive for digitisation of banking services continues to gain momentum and APIs provide a clear opportunity for real-time services to enhance the overall customer experience, accelerating existing slower and typically manual processes.</p>
<p>Whilst Ping An Group has been using API technology for around six years, the adoption within its Treasury and Finance function is a more recent development. Ping An Group is one of the early adopters of financial API technology within the Asia region, having gone live with it in mid-2018. It initially focused on automated retrieval of real-time balance information. The group is now also using real-time API messaging to enable a fully automated and real-time account statement retrieval process.</p>
<p>Until Q12018, Ping An Group’s OneConnect Open Platform had developed several hundred interfaces; more than half of them were applicable. In 2018, its OneConnect AI Research Institute opened more than 20 core technology APIs, exporting AI capabilities to other companies.</p>
<p>With so many emerging technologies now available, albeit at different levels of maturity, resilience and scalability, Ping An Group’s strategy is to take a more layered approach to help move initiatives forward in a more timely manner. For group-wide problems, a broader analysis is undertaken, with decisions made at a management level. This ensures there is a clear understanding of commercial relevance at an individual business level. It also provides the top-down direction and support needed to help drive a smoother overall implementation on time and in line with quality and cost requirements. However, additional agility is provided by allowing enhanced flexibility at a subsidiary or business unit level where smaller scale initiatives would be more suitable, an example being the use of OCR technology to scan expense sheets.</p>
<p>With any digital transformation project, one of the key issues is around talent. The focus is on people who can understand the business models and challenges as well as the underlying technology. Having people with the skills to understand both aspects ensures the technology remains relevant to the business, and the resulting implementations deliver the required efficiency gains.</p>
<p>The digital transformation journey continues within Ping An Group with a focus on how to extend the use of API technology to solve real business issues. It’s about taking an enterprise level view through two different lenses. The first looks at today, while the second has a more strategic aim and looks to forecast the future. Within Ping An, the executive group views the initial adoption of financial APIs as having been a success. There are always lessons to be learnt from the development and execution process, but it is important to be bold and think big about what can be achieved, with clear focus, commitment and partnership.</p>
<p>Citi sees further opportunities to embed financial APIs to accelerate processes and drive greater operational and financial efficiencies. From a treasury perspective, more accurate liquidity positions could be ascertained to drive optimum hedging and funding decisions through fully automated real-time balance enquiries. At a shared service centre level, accelerating cash application through automated real-time credit notifications could help support the rise in real-time payments systems around the world.</p>
<p id="infographic-video">Financial APIs are just one of the emerging technologies that will help treasury deliver on a digital transformation journey. The Ping An Group’s journey will continue as it explores other emerging technologies that will create more impact, help solve business issues and drive enterprise-wide value.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>The core treasury practices around cash, liquidity and trade are increasingly demanding. The notion that technology is some kind of cure-all is prevalent today, but there is more to optimising performance in each of these areas than simply implementing the latest tools. Subject matter experts from Citi discuss the role of digitisation in the real world and assess the anticipated benefits of innovation for the global treasury community.</em></p>

<h4 class="fn"><img alt="Kanika Thakur, Citi" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/kanika_thakur_citi-133x200.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=C2E7E2ED307A871CE34AA8922077457B" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0;" width="133"/>Kanika Thakur</h4>
<h5 class="title">Director, Head of Asia Trade Finance, Citi</h5>
<img alt="Citi" class="logo org" height="29" src="/i/logo/citi-logo-blue-2012-50x29.png" style="margin: 2em 0 0 0;" title="Citi" width="50"/>

<p style="clear:both;">When working with corporate clients and their extended supply chains to meet trade financing needs, Kanika Thakur, Director, Head of Asia Trade Finance, explains that Citi takes a holistic view, encompassing the full spectrum of product and service offerings.</p>
<p>A major area of client focus today is the creation of more balance-sheet efficient liquidity to optimise their working capital across both buy and sell sides. If the bank can help extend payables, decrease sales outstanding and reduce inventory held, clients could benefit significantly from improved working capital metrics, with liquidity and balance sheet health boosted, and counterparty risk and relationships better managed.</p>
<p>At a macro level, clients are also challenged by the current fractious nature of politics in global trade. Citi is primed to monitor the space closely. It understands how trade tensions impact clients and the resultant geographical diversification of trade flows; it is ready to advise on the most appropriate response.</p>
<h3 id="tech-key">Tech key</h3>
<p>Arguably, technology holds the key to unlocking required efficiencies. The volume of conversation has risen notably in recent times around innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process automation (RPA), big data analytics and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as blockchain. The number of fintechs surfacing has increased options massively, creating a real buzz of excitement. In Citi’s trade team, there is now a strong focus on moving towards an integrated digitised future, not just for clients but for the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>This creates a digital agenda aimed both at streamlining client interactions, and the bank’s own operations. With Citi currently one of the few banks using optical character recognition (OCR) to automatically extract data from trade documentation, it has led to a stepping stone for the wider adoption of AI and the extended roll-out of RPA.</p>
<p>The nature of trade though is that there is a significant dependence within the ecosystem on third parties such as shippers, logistics firms and customs agents. This is where solutions such as blockchain will become critical, at least in the medium term. Enabling all parties to access a common secure platform is essential for the digitisation – and thus optimisation – of the ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="collaborative-approach">Collaborative approach</h3>
<p>Citi has established trade sector projects to promote interest and uptake amongst its own corporate and institutional clients, as well as engaging with wider industry collaborative efforts. It also has three innovation labs for its Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) business to stimulate innovation and help identify potential partnerships in the fintech community.</p>
<p>The reason for such involvement is clear: an ecosystem of partners has to take the digital pathway if it is to be successful; it cannot be a unilateral effort. The immediate benefits of doing so include easier and quicker transacting and enhanced risk management and controls, this paving the way for the application of AI and increased automation.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>
<p>Of course, the movement of the entire ecosystem to intelligent digital processing suggests bank services will be largely commoditised. For Citi, differentiation comes in part through its scale, with a footprint in over 100 countries. The need is to harmonise across these locations and the bank has been diligent in rolling out universal offerings on its global platforms.</p>
<p>With Centres of Excellence built around financial hubs, clients are afforded commonality in terms of user experience. As the digital journey continues, the strength of client relationships will not diminish as Citi’s consultative approach seeks out what is really needed across its full suite of products and services; digitisation in trade will increasingly deliver a more holistic and tailored view of the client’s own ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="deep-dive">Deep dive</h3>
<p>Understanding clients’ trade ecosystems, drivers and goals is key to delivering real-world digital solutions. Citi’s ‘co-creation’ process engages fully with its wide network, setting up whiteboarding sessions, for example, to deep dive into specific client, sector and industry needs. From here it will leverage its pan-industry understanding to offer best practice coaching and the most appropriate solutions going forward.</p>
<p>With access to its vast TTS network, Citi’s trade function draws heavily on curated data and statistics to bring industry KPIs to the attention of individual clients. At the sharp end, this may help them, for example, reduce their DPO whilst simultaneously helping their own suppliers’ cash flows by introducing supplier finance programmes.</p>
<h3 id="one-bank">One bank</h3>
<p>As the transformative power of digital rolls out across the trade space in the next few years, integrated products and services that have a familiar ‘look and feel’ will become critical to the success of trade ecosystems across Asia (especially along the Belt and Road corridors).</p>
<p>Citi’s role as a trusted partner is seeing it bring real-world solutions to bear as it continues to monitor and respond to the shifting macro environment in which clients operate.</p>

<img alt="Morgan McKenney, Citi" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/morgan-mckenney-citii-133x200.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=9AB01969DFEFA9DA4CD17068BFAEF999" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0;" width="133"/>

<h4 class="fn">Morgan McKenney</h4>
<h5 class="title">MD, Head of Core Cash Management, Asia Pacific, Citi</h5>
<img alt="Citi" class="logo org" height="29" src="/i/logo/citi-logo-blue-2012-50x29.png" style="margin: 2em 0 0 0;" title="Citi" width="50"/>

<p style="clear:both;">Three words capture the combined focus of Citi’s cash management clients, according to Morgan McKenney, MD, Head of Core Cash Management, Asia Pacific. These are Instant, Intelligent and Personal.</p>
<p>The development of an ‘Instant’ backbone for Citi has seen it plugging into each new instant payment scheme as it is rolled-out. This is making bank account-to-account transactions for low-value domestic payments achievable anytime, on demand.</p>
<p>The ‘always on’ commercial imperative has also seen Citi launch a suite of API connectors facilitating ‘instant’ processing. In addition, Citi has extended its virtual card accounts footprint, using existing credit card rails, which is already garnering favour with Asia’s burgeoning online travel agency players who use it to pay hotel and airline suppliers.</p>
<p>The theme of ‘Intelligent’ plays out through Citi’s global data lake, itself built around the trillions in value of payments transactions it processes daily. Each can be tracked via SWIFT’s gpi to give treasurers transparency over payment status and the conditions under which they are being processed (such as fees and FX rates applied). Data from gpi is being embedded into the CitiDirect BE® front-end for pilot clients today, with broad commercial release shortly.</p>
<h3 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h3>
<p>Data and AI are also being brought to clients in new solutions to help them better manage their payments activity with the upcoming launch of Citi’s Payment Outlier Detection service. This configurable AI-based solution, built in Citi’s Dublin Innovation Lab, monitors customer transaction behaviours, detecting and reporting outliers in advance of the payments being sent. Applied across a shared service centre environment for example, this could prove invaluable in screening industrial-scale payments activity.</p>
<p>Emerging from Citi’s investment in the fintech, HighRadius, Smart Match applies third-party AI know-how to help customers reconcile incoming payments, using intelligent software to significantly increase the efficiency of processing even the most ‘data-challenged’ of receivables.</p>
<p>Related to the ‘Personal’ theme, with digital disruption impacting almost every industry, Citi’s corporate clients are increasingly able to reach their retail customers directly, leveraging Citi’s instant payments and collections capabilities globally. Using wrappers such as digital wallets and now QR codes, businesses can now reach retail consumers how they want to pay in a specific market while immediately associating each transaction with the relevant individual customer, creating automatic and immediate reconciliation in their system of record.</p>
<h3 id="new-models">New models</h3>
<p>The shift from traditional B2B-only to include B2C and C2B marks an important shift in the cash space. It is shaping Citi’s product development areas of focus and enabling treasurers to become the sales enabler for their business.</p>
<p>Whether working in-house or with fintech partners, embedding innovations such as AI, RPA and DLT into Citi’s solutions and deploying an internal ‘data horizontal’ model (covering the broadest sweep of functions) enables the bank to deliver competitively differentiated solutions and great customer experience for their clients. This includes facilitating a customised approach to optimising balance sheets, data-driven decision-making, optimising treasury, powering sales growth and supporting clients’ digitisation efforts to respond successfully to digital disruption.</p>
<p>Innovating in this space requires early prototyping with clients as well as co-creating with customers to make innovation mainstream. Citi co-creation workshops with clients are providing innovation insights to support how customers are re-imagining business models and processes end-to-end.</p>
<p>Treasury has been the traditional buying centre for cash-focused solutions. As new business models are necessarily being created to meet the onset of digital, Citi is now engaging more with operations, product, marketing and sales teams. Treasury is now at the heart of a much deeper and broader ecosystem and the cash management products being offered by Citi – and the way they are collaboratively developed with fintechs and clients who are often disruptors in their own space – reflect this.</p>
<p>The need to differentiate in the cash space, where digital could arguably commoditise processes, has seen Citi adopt a ‘digital delight’ programme. In essence, digital must be executed better than the competition.</p>
<p>Consumers know when something works well; treasurers are no different. Delivering the right experience is therefore Citi’s differentiator both for new digital natives operating solely in the e-commerce space as well as for existing ‘traditional’ clients.</p>
<p>Having an innovation ecosystem that reaches across Citi’s network of over 100 markets, which itself represents a depth of experience and knowledge of customer behaviours, is a source of ideas around the newer technologies that can be shared and leveraged for clients right across the board, from commercial, to consumer, to institutional.</p>
<h3 id="future-state">Future state</h3>
<p>Cash management in the future will continue to reflect the disruptor-driven reshaping of business models. No industry will be spared.</p>
<p>The next decade or so will be about connecting devices and using AI to automate flows. The Internet of Things (IoT) will become the source of information and status about almost anything, from healthcare to car care.</p>
<p>In the treasury management space, Citi’s strategy is thus set on building a connected financial ecosystem for global commerce to support its clients. In cash management terms, intelligent and real-time payments network connectivity, and simplicity and optionality for customers is driving innovation to the point of becoming ‘business-as-usual’.</p>

<img alt="Sandip Patel" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/sandip-patil-4-133x200.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=E72A55BD7FE4035B01B4740B9FD96BD7" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0;" width="133"/>

<h4 class="fn">Sandip Patil</h4>
<h5 class="title">MD, Regional Head, Liquidity Management Services and Financial Institutions, Citi</h5>
<img alt="Citi" class="logo org" height="29" src="/i/logo/citi-logo-blue-2012-50x29.png" style="margin: 2em 0 0 0;" title="Citi" width="50"/>

<p style="clear:both;">Digital disruption is impacting practically every industry and it is becoming a key factor for every treasurer and CFO to navigate, says Sandip Patil, MD, Regional Head, Liquidity Management Services and Financial Institutions.</p>
<p>To this can be added the currently heated nature of geopolitics and the impact of ongoing market volatility. The problem is that not every finance professional has the time nor the resources to fully manage these obstacles as they assist in expanding the business in this disruptive environment.</p>
<p>In a liquidity management context, treasurers always need delivery on the fundamental KPIs. With the changing environment meaning this is not always easy to achieve, Citi’s solution focus is set on helping realise these goals. Indeed, by establishing a parametrised universal platform within which treasury clients can automate responses to many of the external and policy variables, the challenge of assisting growth is solved.</p>
<p>Shifting surplus funding and matching currency needs of different entities within a group, for example, is being handled automatically (even across different banks), ensuring treasury is only using bank liquidity when needed and is always optimising their own internal surplus. Doing so ensures treasury’s policy and KPIs are met as a matter of course; assisting growth now becomes the focus, not worries about the day-to-day liquidity of operating entities.</p>
<h3 id="to-the-cutting-edge">To the cutting-edge</h3>
<p>Even with a core platform capable of controlling group liquidity, there is still a vital role to play for cutting-edge technologies such as AI, machine learning, blockchain and advanced data analytics.</p>
<p>Take the latter, for example. Within Citi’s vast global transaction banking network, it is harvesting huge amounts of data from customer activities and cash flows. This activity is now being mapped and presented as one ecosystem to a client. This helps in the visualisation of their banking structures and patterns of liquidity within, enabling existing cash flow forecasting methods to be applied as inputs.</p>
<p>Treasury policy and governance programmes associated with liquidity data can then be fine-tuned. Perhaps more important is the industry benchmarking opportunity – for a host of KPIs including liquidity and forecasting efficiency – that this data presents.</p>
<p>Treasury always has an internal target but having access to sector and industry best practice – at a national, regional or global level – drawn from Citi’s client analytics, takes each of those KPIs to a new level of delivery.</p>
<p>However, even with Citi now engaging in various pilots and projects that are exploring the possibilities of AI, blockchain, data sharing and open architectures, the banking sector in general is only just scratching the surface of their potential. Collaborative development is the key.</p>
<h3 id="building-bridges">Building bridges</h3>
<p>Having long since developed a culture that promotes innovation as an inclusive activity, Citi works broadly with clients and other institutions (including ‘outliers’ such as the insurance sector) to turn possibilities into real-world solutions.</p>
<p>The bank understands that creating an industry-wide ecosystem based on new technologies will provide maximum benefit for all. Although many innovations are active across the sector, seeking to build such an expansive ecosystem will generate some tension between the collaborative and the competitive and this must be overcome. Naturally, players with demonstrable success in this space will lead the experimentation towards this end.</p>
<p>For Citi, by working with partners that are not in direct competition – those in non-overlapping regions or those in other sectors such as insurance, for example – progress is evident as it continues to integrate innovation within its own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Predicting the shifts of the regulatory landscape as new technologies emerge, and responding accordingly, is the next challenge. Having access to the authorities is advantageous in that it helps shape the future landscape in line with real client needs.</p>
<p>“Citi has always played a critical partnership role with regulators across all our markets eg in China’s journey of liberalising its economy, we have partnered closely with the Chinese regulators from free trade zone establishment to changing documentary processes. We continue to represent our clients’ current and emerging needs proactively. It has helped us bring a positive change in the regulatory paradigm and also helped our clients deploy the right solutions to benefit from the regulatory changes using digital tools.”</p>
<h3 id="futurescape">Futurescape</h3>
<p>For treasurers, one of the most likely future scenarios is the dominance of real-time ecosystem from payments to foreign exchange and liquidity. In liquidity terms, value dates will become ‘value moments’ as treasuries become ‘just-in-time’ providers of liquidity across the group entities. Further, treasurers are looking forward to the expansion of open banking. By leveraging APIs, banks will be able to support customers with pooled data drawn from across the industry; bank-as-silo will no longer be sufficient. Citi continues to help its clients with multi-banking solutions. With the rise of AI and robotics in a changing and volatile world, it will similarly enable companies to attain an otherwise impossible near-perfect imagination of, and response to the future.</p>
<p>Blockchain is being lined up as the secure system of record for many different applications, and online marketplace-based economies will eventually allow investors and borrowers to create new private and public liquidity marketplaces. This will enable corporates to become participants in the secondary markets. Citi continues to incubate such ideas in its innovation centres.</p>
<p>Treasurers and CFOs need to be even more capable of operating in a dynamic world, staying alert to the possibilities of innovation as well as digital disruption. Citi’s strategy is about preparing such stakeholders for this environment, offering ideas and insights and, through effective collaboration with its partners and the industry, the means of future-proofing client business models with innovative real-world solutions. The future is here!</p>

<p><em>Recent conferences show signs of a healthy shift from technology hype to pragmatic solution focus. Blockchain hype is giving way to practical implementation. Terminator style AI is giving way to more modest but still world-changing machine learning (ML). Fast payments and open banking are spawning bank connectivity APIs but standards are conspicuously missing.</em></p>

<figure class="portrait left">

<h3 id="history-lessons">History lessons</h3>
<p>Recent conferences have provided plenty to think about. I noticed that several prognosticators referenced long-term historical patterns in their presentations.</p>
<p>Emmanuel Daniel cited David Ronstadt’s “Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks: A Framework About Societal Evolution” which posits four phases – tribes, hierarchies, markets and networks, which neatly correlate to village, country, region and global. The key risks for each also give pause – nepotism, corruption, exploitation and deception.</p>
<p>Stephane Garelli pointed out that technological revolutions have been happening all along (agriculture, writing, printing, steam over 10,000 years) but that change is accelerating (PC, internet, mobile, AI over 30 years). How management responds to change is critical – in the past 60 years the average tenure in the S&amp;P 500 has dropped from 61 years to 18 years and at current rates we can expect 75% of the current S&amp;P 500 to have disappeared within a decade.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) has its own take on historical change, where it talks about the fourth industrial revolution. The WEF phases are steam, electricity, digital, and convergence (through ML and ubiquitous connectivity). In line with statements like “data is the new oil”, many see this convergence as a major inflection point.</p>
<p>Chris Skinner’s phases are becoming human, becoming civilised (and creating money), becoming commercial (and creating banks), and becoming digital – hence his latest book title “Digital Human”. Before we are all augmented with silicon, our evolution towards “augmented intelligence” will progress from currently relying on Google as a clunky memory prosthetic to ever greater dependence on and integration with digital technology.</p>
<p>The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is working on machine brain interfaces – initially to help injured soldiers with prosthetic limbs but recently to control multiple aircraft at once. So our cyborg days may not be so far away – “You will be assimilated; resistance is futile!”</p>
<p>Change takes longer than expected but is often more profound than expected, especially as we tend to ignore the social implications while focussing on technological changes.</p>
<h3 id="blockbust">Blockbust</h3>
<p>Garelli cited Peter Drucker who warned that technology should be an enabler, not an end in itself. (The end, per Drucker: “The purpose of business is to create and keep a customer”.) Recently it seems that there has been a hunt for buzzwords in treasury technology – people want to have blockchains and big data and AI on their checklists. This despite the evidence that most treasuries have not yet implemented basic functionality like straight through processing and dashboards, and many still use Excel for day-to-day processing.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it is good to see that conference talk is turning from technologies towards solutions. To paraphrase Deng Xiao Ping, it does not matter if the solution is blockchain or SQL so long as it works.</p>
<p>Taking the example of KYC, there are interesting solutions based on blockchains but they are more or less experimental. There are plenty of existing solutions using SQL databases available. The real issues are regulatory (getting the regulators to approve a given solution) and social (getting multiple parties on board). While many treasurers are waiting for blockchain solutions to go mainstream, some treasurers are reaping the benefits of current solutions by insisting that their banks go digital for KYC.</p>
<p>An analogous point came from a cyber-security discussion at SIBOS – most of the conversation was about social engineering (tricking humans) rather than technology. There was a strong consensus that human and social factors are most important – there is little or no cooperation between countries and generally security technology is adequate but not used properly by humans.</p>
<h3 id="fast-payments">Fast payments</h3>
<p>With PSD2 going live in March 2019, there is a lot of buzz around fast payments – somewhat ironically since some countries have had fast payments for decades.</p>
<p>The use case for fast in retail is clear – it provides a faster, cheaper and more efficient alternative to cards. For business to business, it is less clear. This is partly because, since many fast payment systems have deferred settlement, they often have transaction limits. For example, Singapore FAST recently increased to S$50,000, after MAS determined from the first few years of operation that bank liquidity management was robust enough to handle larger transactions. (Payments over US$50,000 will go through RTGS, which is also very fast but costs more.)</p>
<h3 id="apis">APIs</h3>
<p>For use in e-commerce and retail, fast payments need fast processing. Although file upload (of instructions) and download (of statements) can be done quite quickly, APIs are a better way to communicate fast payments and status. APIs process atomic transactions and are better suited to real-time status messaging which is required for example for e-commerce sites to provide feedback to customers on the progress in clearing payment.</p>
<p>This together with regulatory pressure for open banking, is driving intense interest in APIs. Just to be clear, APIs are not new – every programme (what we now call “app”) uses API calls to the operating system to draw windows and buttons and access data. APIs are not even new in banking – credit card processing runs through APIs for example. APIs are the glue that hold systems together – for example e-banking front ends use APIs to communicate with core banking systems to fetch and post user data.</p>
<p>What is new is that regulators are pushing banks to open their systems to third-party service providers. For example, a fintech or ERP could replace the bank provided e-banking front end with something better or more convenient for the user. Another attractive use case is for a personal finance site to be able to aggregate users balances across multiple banks – something like SWIFT bank connectivity for retail. (In fact, these use cases could be done with file transfer but APIs add the real time element.)</p>
<p>If all this sounds too good to be true, it may well be. One major issue is that banking APIs are not standardised. When we do file transfer with banks over SWIFT we use either 50-year old FIN messages or 20-year old ISO 20022 messages, both of which are standardised. In fact, the ISO 20022 are working on applying their standards to APIs via JSON and ISO 20022 is standardising the additional messaging required for near real-time fast payments, but we also need banks to agree to standardise their APIs on ISO 20022. Currently the banks who have opened APIs have all invented their own wheels, making a mess for customers and service providers and a boom in API management.</p>
<h3 id="ai">AI</h3>
<p>It’s official – AI no longer means artificial intelligence – henceforth AI means augmented intelligence (humans doing better with help from machines). Wiser heads prefer to talk about machine learning. Machine learning will do the boring stuff while we humans do the fun stuff – like dealing with other humans.</p>
<p>As the technology that was previously known as AI trickles into the real world, we see that it is more about pattern matching than the magic we had imagined to be AI. And to get the most out of pattern matching, we need lots of clean and structured data – so treasurers who want to get on this bandwagon have to ditch Excel and implement a proper TMS. With decent data, treasurers can progress from data analytics (what used to be called reporting) through statistical analysis and on to machine learning.</p>
<p>Moving terminology from AI to ML does not diminish the changes that are coming. Yuval Noah Harari gives a great example in terms of macroeconomics: currently perhaps 1% of the population understands the economy; in 20 years when most of the economy will be run by algorithms no one will understand it; decision makers will be given policy directions by machines that cannot explain their rationale because humans do not have sufficient bandwidth to understand. The machines will not be conscious nor intelligent in the way Hollywood expects; they will not take over in the sense of pursuing their own agenda because they will have no sense of self; they will take over in the sense of making most tactical decisions because they will be much better and infinitely more consistent than human decision makers.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many issues with all this and as Harari points out, managing the advent of ubiquitous ML is one of the three big challenges facing humanity. A critical challenge is biases that ML may pick up from their coding and their training data sets.</p>
<p>If this seems far-fetched, consider the stock market “flash crash” phenomena. These are caused by algorithmic trading that we do not properly understand. We suspect it has something to do with stop loss and technical chart levels, but we do not have enough understanding to be confident of being able to manage it. So we have slowed down trading and tightened daily trading ranges to mitigate the risk.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall it seems healthy that the discourse on technology is shifting from hype to more moderate terminology and more modest expectations. Most important is the shift from technology to solutions. There really are better ways than Excel! <br class="t-last-br"/>

<p><em>Sridhar Kanthadai, Head of Treasury Services for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan, provides an update on the business and what clients in the region are prioritising.</em></p>
<h4>How’s the business doing and what are your priorities in the region?</h4>
<p>We are having a great year in terms of business momentum; revenue is up strongly year to date driven by increased business flows and as a result we continue to gain market share, particularly in the corporate franchise.</p>
<p>Our priorities in the near term include expanding business in our chosen targeted segments and markets, which would be the top-tier multinationals from Europe and the US doing business in Asia, as well as Asia’s emerging large local corporations. We see huge potential in e-commerce as more corporates migrate their commerce activities onto electronic platforms. J.P. Morgan has been investing in and building out an e-commerce gateway to facilitate the ease and experience of online transactions.</p>
<p>We also see opportunities in the non-bank financial institutional space, and we believe our cross-border expertise, leadership in US dollar clearing and advisory-led approach to solutions can bring value to businesses in these sectors.</p>
<h4>What is J.P. Morgan investing in?</h4>
<p>We continue to invest in two key areas. The first is in technology as we look to support clients in their digitalisation journey. This involves not just developing innovative solutions for treasury but also offering bespoke advice and tailored solutions for clients. We recognise that many corporates are still in the early stages of leveraging emerging technologies to improve their business processes, and we spend a lot of time during our engagements with clients to demystify innovation and walk them through what digitalisation really means for them.</p>
<p>Growing our bench strength is also a priority for us and we are focused on investing in high-quality talent across not just front office roles but also in adjacent functions like controls, operations and technology. We are on track to increase headcount by 15% this year across Asia Pacific with equally strong recruitment plans for 2019.</p>
<h4>What are some of the new innovations that have made a difference to clients in the region?</h4>
<p>We remain focused on helping clients solve their problems and that’s how we are prioritising innovation in this region.</p>
<p>A key challenge facing treasurers is managing the huge volume of documentary requirements involved in cross-border payments and collections across most of the 14 Asian markets we operate in. Our virtual branch solution that digitises the documentation process has successfully resolved the issue; instead of having to dispatch reams of physical paper to us, clients can send us the documents in digital format which is more efficient and eliminates risk of misplaced documents. The solution is live in India, China, Indonesia and Thailand and we are planning to launch in the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam next.</p>
<p>Another innovation that’s originated from Asia is our data visualisation tool, where clients have a bird’s eye view of their transaction flows and can develop strategies as necessary to improve the management of cash and liquidity. With this capability, we have been able to help clients shut down or move accounts because of idle or ineffective use of balances, and instead putting in a structure that allows them to fund accounts just in time for payments. These are all material benefits.</p>
<h4>What should clients be thinking about now as they plan for the future?</h4>
<p>A priority practically all our clients talk about is the need to reinforce their organisations against cyber threats. A recent poll we conducted among our top clients consisting of CFOs and senior treasurers across Asia Pacific show two-thirds of them rank cyber-security as one of their top three risks but only 30% have high confidence in their ability to detect and respond to cyber risk.</p>
<p>At J.P. Morgan, we have a comprehensive fraud detection programme we run with clients underpinned by sophisticated technology involving data and machine learning. Effectively, every transaction processed globally goes through a multi-point check that validates the consistency of that payment with what we expect, and we have been able to help clients prevent fraudulent payments even before they leave the bank.</p>
<p>Another area treasurers are looking into is how to better manage liquidity. As we emerge from a low interest-rate environment, funding is going to become more expensive so optimising cash to maximise liquidity will be increasingly top of mind. Again harnessing the technologies available today, we have been able to help clients build better liquidity structures and benchmark their current set of operations to uncover areas where they can improve their working capital. There is a great depth of advisory and consulting we can offer around this.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>This is the second episode of the Thriving Treasury Podcast series, brought to you by Treasury Today and HSBC. In this podcast we look at new and innovative ways of using virtual accounts. We speak to Matthew Wagstaff, Global Product Manager Virtual Accounts, Global Liquidity &amp; Cash Management at HSBC to find out about the ways they are being deployed by corporates today. Matthew is an expert on virtual accounts, leading HSBC’s innovation in this space, and helping many clients implement solutions.</i></p>
<p>Listen as Matthew describes how corporates can use virtual accounts to rationalise the number of physical accounts they manage and gain increased visibility over the underlying transactions passing through these accounts.</p>
<p>Matthew explains that although virtual accounts aren’t new, having been in the industry for some years, they have typically only been used to identify payers. “Where we are taking virtual accounts now, is to give them more functionality so that they look and feel more like a real bank account, so you can do not only collections, but payments also.”</p>
<p>Virtual accounts are here to stay. They won't replace existing cash management techniques, such as cash concentration or notional pooling, but can be seen as another tool in the cash management arsenal. Over the coming years, says Matthew, “I think that we will see more and more corporates adopt a virtual account solution within their cash management structure”.</p>

<p><em><img alt="BNP Paribas logo" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/bnp-paribas-logo-2019-160x33.png?la=en&amp;hash=D97F7E90B3DCD71B3978C664A2B279B1" width="130"/></em></p>

<p> </p>
<p><br/><br/>Instant payments are to the benefit of all, if only everyone realised it. When the UK’s Faster Payments mechanism went live in 2008, it could so easily have become a costly exercise in cannibalising existing payments methods.</p>
<p>By 2017 the system had broken the record for the highest amount of payments processed in a single year (at over 1.7bn, 16% up on 2016). But it had also become an integral part of the country’s payment infrastructure, creating additional volumes through new channel activity and new ways of doing business.</p>
<p>While the consumer sector seems to be enjoying the benefits of immediate, secure and irrevocable payments through the host of wallets and instant payments systems deployed in several countries around the world, there is work still to be done in the corporate space to ensure these mechanisms are being leveraged by treasurers to tap its potential, says Bruno Mellado, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, BNP Paribas.</p>
<h3 id="new-uses">New uses</h3>
<p>For some corporates, it will become a different way of settling debt or of enabling customers to pay. For example, traditional payments models had required one major manufacturer of food supplies to secure payment before delivery or agree on a credit risk exposure with its smaller retailer buyers, says Mellado. “Cash was risky and cheques were rarely a practical option. With instant payments, payment-on-delivery will be easy, allowing the manufacturer to receive payment straight into its systems, fully reconciled.” All parties win and the economic activity is being supported by efficient and less cumbersome payment processes; at some point, the action of making a payment will just become a simple notification to release the goods at point-of-sale or to be shipped.</p>
<p>Despite this and other examples, the adoption by corporates of instant payments has, to date, been somewhat driven by “niche use-cases”, he admits. To this point, he says treasurers should now be asking how instant payments systems can fit in with, and even advance, the wider digitisation programmes that their companies are almost certainly undertaking.</p>
<p>The reason, says Mellado, is simple. “Instant payments can be the enabler of new models of business. E-commerce players, seeking an alternative to card payments – where interchange costs, cardholder inconvenience and lower credit limits may be holding back sales – are likely to drive its greater adoption, but other sectors will follow as new business models are realised.”</p>
<p>Indeed, with the advent of payment APIs, where payments can, for example, be triggered from a third-party account, Mellado predicts that the use of instant payments will soon deliver a “totally new payment method, beyond cards”.</p>
<p>For an e-commerce business that operates through one of the global retail sites, if that site facilitates the payments process, instant payments enables the business to be paid faster for goods it has sold; this frees up credit with its own suppliers, facilitating greater sales volumes. Other businesses can also enjoy this benefit.</p>
<h3 id="new-models">New models</h3>
<p>With new use cases changing business models, for Mellado, this is an opportunity for treasury to support the development of such models, enabling the means of handling new customer and supplier payment methods supporting direct selling strategies.</p>
<p>From a purely treasury perspective, the ability to have immediately-banked funds presents an obvious working capital advantage. However, relatively low instant payment transaction limits (€15,000 in most countries) mean treasury payments themselves are some way off in most jurisdictions, says Mellado. The example of the UK, which has now reached £250,000 for individual payments as system integrity is proven, suggests those limits will soon reach practicable levels.</p>
<p>However, the idea that instant payments will replace all other forms of payment is a fallacy, declares Mellado. After a decade of operation, the UK system now covers just 25% of UK credit transfers, suggesting that they are complementary to existing mechanisms. Indeed, treasurers may prefer to continue with well-timed slower batch payments via these mechanisms. “To change a system wholly to real-time will probably require more treasury effort to keep balances and positions under control,” he comments. “I see instant payments being used only when needed.”</p>
<p>This comes with a caveat. Treasurers who do not wish to explore instant payments at all will be doing their organisation a disservice, as the worlds of commerce and information exchange become fully digitised and 24/7. “You may not want real-time operations but your clients may want to pay you after hours or at weekends; you need to prepare for the coming reality of real-time,” he advises.</p>
<h3 id="seeking-standards">Seeking standards</h3>
<p>Instant payments are not perfect, and some issues are beyond treasury’s control. One operational issue of which treasurers will be acutely aware is the lack of cross-border payment standards. Even within SEPA, Mellado acknowledges that local requirement ‘interpretations’ can cause disruptions.</p>
<p>“What is interesting is how different countries and communities are now organising to adopt interoperable instant payments, especially the local clearing systems which seek to harmonise processes,” he says. In this respect, the ECB’s TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) service is a significant advancement; as a regional real-time gross settlement system, it should provide for higher-value transactions going forward.</p>
<p>Banks are building this infrastructure for euro in Europe at this time, with several countries going live in 2018 (Spain and Belgium), others in 2019 and many others probably in 2020. There is no competitive advantage for a bank to be alone in a local market with this service as it only works with full reachability. It is the community that decides on the timing. Mellado says that BNP Paribas is building its instant payments platform for both a local community initiative and a pan-European ambition.</p>
<p>The ‘standard’ experience may, however, come via a different route. Domestic uptake is being driven hard by person-to-person behavioural changes, where individuals want to be able to pay each other in a frictionless way for small amounts, notes Mellado. “As growth and demand continues apace, it becomes a commercial imperative for merchants and the Payment Service Providers to develop Person-to-Business or Business-to-Person use cases. Development of harmonised cross-border instant payments must follow, not least as e-commerce seeks to flourish fully.”</p>
<h3 id="call-to-action">Call to action</h3>
<p>There is a way to go yet but being able to offer an end-to-end payments process and new payables and receivables options to customers and suppliers, while improving visibility over cash and customer credit positions, is a compelling proposition.</p>
<p>Of course, treasurers need to look at their own processes to see how instant payments will affect these. But Mellado suggests that long-term success lies in understanding the wider possibilities derived from changing business models, rather than focusing on the impact on treasury processes.</p>
<p>“As momentum gathers, treasurers should be reaching out to the business units within their organisations to see how instant payments can help improve outcomes for all,” says Mellado. New complexities may be created but the global trend for digitisation and real-time is not about to reverse. Indeed, he adds, “as the idea of the ‘value-date’ slips into history, treasurers who assess the risks and adapt now to instant payments will be best-placed to support their organisations’ strategic goals”.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Evolution of different types of virtual accounts has created a potentially confusing array of solutions of different levels of sophistication and serving different corporate needs. This article looks at the different types of virtual accounts and clarifies where they should fit in the treasurer’s toolkit.</em></p>
<h4 id="different-virtual-account-types">Different virtual account types</h4>
<p>Early virtual accounts were designed to facilitate accounts receivable reconciliation – the first idea being to assign one virtual account number to each customer.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Account owner</th>
<th>Free format</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;root&gt;</td>
<td>&lt;customer&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corresponds to the legal account owner identifier (often four characters).</td>
<td>Any corporate customer identifier (subject to clearing system constraints).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>Early virtual account systems required corporates to ask their bank to load each customer virtual account into their back-end systems – often, ironically, on paper forms. This was called static virtual account. An early natural enhancement was the dynamic virtual account where any customer code – so long as the root account number is correct and the whole complies with clearing rules – is accepted by the bank.</p>
<p>Some corporates have experimented with unique virtual account numbers for each invoice. This can work for collections from retail customers but corporate governance around procure-to-pay processes makes it unwieldy for business-to-business collections.</p>
<p>Once dynamic virtual account came along, creative minds quickly realised that the &lt;customer&gt; free format segment could be segmented in different ways to suit corporate requirements.</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Account owner</th>
<th>Free format</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;root&gt;</td>
<td>&lt;profit-centre&gt;&lt;customer&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Same legal account owner identifier.</td>
<td>Multi segment corporate identifiers.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<h3 id="virtual-accounts-beyond-reconciliation">Virtual accounts beyond reconciliation</h3>
<p>Once the dynamic virtual account had brought in the concept of multiple segments in the free format section of the virtual account number, more functionality became conceivable.</p>
<p>As shown above, while &lt;root&gt; must identify the legal entity owning the account, the free form part can be used for profit centre, cost centre, business unit, or other organisational entity within the account owning legal entity.</p>
<p>After the concept of including multiple organisational entities within the virtual account gained acceptance, the next evolution was to extend beyond reporting to bank account operation and authorisation. Using a virtual account for reconciliation is simply a reporting exercise – the single bank account can be viewed and reported as if it was multiple virtual accounts corresponding to each customer or to each profit centre and customer segment. This has no impact on the account from an operational perspective – no change to authorisations and other governance, and no major change to ebanking for example.</p>
<p>To make the virtual account work more like a normal bank account requires full operational capabilities by virtual account with different signatories and governance for each organisational entity within the virtual account structure. Then virtual accounts can be used for payments and indeed can fully replace what might have previously been separate legal bank accounts.</p>
<h4 id="multi-entity-virtual-accounts">Multi-entity virtual accounts</h4>
<p>With the virtual account evolving beyond the reporting functionality required for reconciliation to full bank account functionality, the next logical step was to go multi-entity, following the IHB concept.</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Account owner</th>
<th>Free format</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;root&gt;</td>
<td>&lt;subsidiary&gt;&lt;customer&gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IHB is the account owner.</td>
<td>Multi segment corporate identifiers.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>Normally IHB is run on ERP or TMS software which segments flows into separate participating entities. In this scenario, the bank’s virtual account software is providing IHB functionality for the corporate – not without irony.</p>
<h4 id="multi-currency-virtual-accounts">Multi-currency virtual accounts</h4>
<p>A further evolution comes from the increasing popularity of multi-currency accounts. In many ways, multi-currency accounts resemble virtual accounts – one legal bank account which is segmented into different sub parts. In the case of multi-currency accounts, it is segmented into different currencies. In the case of the virtual account, it is segmented into different organisational entities.</p>
<p>Once we have the concept of multiple segments within the free format section of the virtual account number, we can combine the two.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-account-functionality">Virtual account functionality</h3>
<p>We can summarise the evolution of virtual accounts as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Reconciliation.</h5>
<p>Segmented reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Multiple organisational entities.</h5>
<p>Segmented governance and ebanking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Multiple legal entities.</h5>
<p>Functionally similar to above, includes legal entities not just departments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Multi-currency.</h5>
<p>All of the above plus multiple currencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>It is important to be clear that even a sophisticated multi-currency multi-entity virtual account structure can still support reconciliation of both collections (eg by customer) and payments (eg segmenting direct versus indirect procurement). As virtual accounts become more sophisticated they have retained the basic functionality. In other words, the extra virtual account functionality is additive.</p>
<h3 id="cash-management-landscape">Cash management landscape</h3>
<p>It is also helpful to situate virtual accounts within the cash management landscape. Cash management requires that treasurers manage flows and balances to optimise ‘cost effective risk reduction’ (CERR).</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Cash management</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Balances</td>
<td>Flows</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concentration Pooling</td>
<td>Payments Collections</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>There are two ways to pool cash balances – as intercompany balances and as bank balances.</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Balance management</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Intercompany balances</td>
<td>Bank balances</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Intercompany loans</p>
<p>ZBA and sweeping</p>
<p>IHB</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Notional pooling</p>
<p>Interest optimisation</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>Intercompany balances require journal entries into the general ledger and give rise to withholding tax in the many countries where withholding tax on intercompany interest applies. Bank balances generally require less accounting and most countries do not apply withholding tax on bank interest.</p>
<p>Managing flows focuses on cost reduction, process efficiency and control.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-virtual-accounts">Comparing virtual accounts</h3>
<p>Virtual accounts combine different functionality that touches on different parts of the cash management landscape.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Reconciliation.</h5>
<p>Helps flow process efficiency, especially for collections and accounts receivable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Multiple organisational entities.</h5>
<p>Primarily helps flow process efficiency and also helps balance management through account rationalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Multiple legal entities.</h5>
<p>Helps balance management by pooling different legal entity balances into one account, generating intercompany balances, analogous to IHB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Multi-currency.</h5>
<p>Helps balance management by pooling currency balances, analogous to single entity multi currency notional pooling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The basic reconciliation functionality helps flow management by improving flow process efficiency, especially for collections. It can have a benefit for balance management when virtual account permits account rationalisation.</p>
<p>Account rationalisation solves the common historical problem of excess bank accounts often set up to facilitate collections management – for example, one account per department or per business unit. With a virtual account, these can be combined into a single bank account balance without losing control over collections. In fact, virtual accounts normally improve collection efficiency by allowing one virtual account per customer.</p>
<p>Virtual account structures including multiple legal entities are in many ways functionally equivalent to IHB. Because multi-entity virtual accounts outsource the system work to the bank, this can be an attractive solution for corporates who struggle with IHB. This is typically because they have heterogenous accounting systems and/or do not have the resources to implement IHB with an ERP or TMS.</p>
<p>Multi-currency virtual accounts – to the extent that they allow negative balances (overdraft) in some currencies – are functionally equivalent to single-entity multi-currency notional pooling. They solve the cross-currency problem which is not intrinsically addressed by any of the intercompany balance management solutions. This can be attractive for established IHBs using their ERP or TMS to manage intercompany current accounts (and who therefore may not need the other virtual account functionality described above).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Virtual account technology is wonderful for cash managers. To make best use of virtual accounts requires understanding of their different functionalities and how they compare with other cash management tools that are available.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Depending on what report you read, we are either all about to be usurped by robot overlords or enjoy far greater productivity and job satisfaction with technology’s help. Although not yet mainstream in treasury or corporate banking, what should we make of the threat/opportunity that is artificial intelligence?</em></p>
<p>The truth about any situation when monumental change is predicted is often surrounded by equal parts hype and fear. The reality, usually, turns out to be somewhere in between. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in business has risen up the agenda in recent times and is now a fixture with content providers in many sectors. But for those at the sharp end of treasury, is it a threat or an opportunity?</p>
<p>AI is sometimes seen as an all-knowing, all-conquering conscious mind; something to be feared. But worrying about AI taking over our lives is the equivalent of worrying about pollution and over-population on Mars, according to AI expert Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist at Chinese web search giant, Baidu, and an Associate Professor at Stanford University. We are, Ng writes, a very long way from facing up to the killer robots. Thoughts of this kind, he has concluded, are “an unnecessary distraction” to progress in this field of endeavour.</p>
<h3 id="ai-today">AI today</h3>
<p>AI at the moment is not much more than a complex mathematical equation, says Matt Armstrong-Barnes, Chief Technologist, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Asked if AI will change business processes, he responds with an emphatic ‘no’. “AI today is a tool that ingests a lot of information and uses machine learning to provide a critical input for humans to make a decision.” The emphasis here, he says, is on ‘human’ decision-making.</p>
<p>Of course, it can be hard to work out the reality of AI through all the noise. But whoever or whatever is taking the decisions, one thing is certain and that is “AI is revolutionising every industry and is transforming our lives”, says Alex Housley Founder and CEO, Seldon, an open-source machine-learning framework vendor.</p>
<p>Housley concurs with Andrew Ng’s belief that AI is “the new electricity”. Indeed, he says, with the ready availability of some “fantastic tools”, businesses should now be taking advantage of what AI can offer. But AI has been around since the 1950s (and arguably even before then), so why is it only now coming to prominence?</p>
<p>For Kristian Luoma, Head of financial services firm, OP Financial Group’s OP Lab, the stars have now aligned. Key ‘stars’ include the availability now of so much more data, the pace of technological development at the heart of computing (particularly CPUs and GPUs), and consumer behaviour trending massively towards digital channels. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Luoma agrees with Armstrong-Barnes that, for business, back office processes won’t be subject to wholesale change. However, he does see an opportunity for certain processes or interfaces to be replaced by the introduction of what he calls “maths-based recommendations”. Currently, this notion is serving to reduce the amount of time consumers must spend interacting with the services being created for them, increasing their satisfaction – and expectation – levels. As more is expected from the digital experience, it will play a significant driver for the uptake and eventual cross-over into business applications.</p>
<p>Indeed, for Husayn Kassai, CEO of identity verification software company, Onfido, the need for businesses to address customer satisfaction is one of the drivers for why AI is now coming to the fore. The capacity, for example, for banks to on-board customers quickly and cost effectively in an environment where fraud is such a huge regulatory issue, will increasingly rely on AI-based tools to keep them engaged, he believes.</p>
<h3 id="light-and-dark">Light and dark</h3>
<p>Despite Ng’s reassurances, with the acceleration in the past couple of years of ‘deep’ machine-learning capabilities, and the increasing pools of data from which AI can derive answers, people do worry about it. Less about evil super-intelligence perhaps but certainly about losing their jobs and their place in the labour market to machine-learning technology.</p>
<p>The increasing presence of AI as an agent of change has seen opinions polarise. PwC research has shown that AI is a commercial opportunity that could boost global economic output by 14%. This, it noted, equates to GDP gains of US$15.7trn, making it “the biggest commercial opportunity in today’s fast changing economy”. Furthermore, US-based not-for-profit think tank, the Institute for the Future, and its panel of 20 technology, business and academic experts from around the world, expectantly suggests that 85% of the jobs that will exist in 2030 haven’t been invented yet, so there is much to look forward to.</p>
<p>But then McKinsey reported the darker side of AI. Using conclusions drawn from detailed analysis of 2,000-plus work activities for more than 800 occupations, it reports that about 30% of tasks in 60% of occupations could be automated using current technologies. “As automation advances in capability, jobs involving higher skills will probably be automated at increasingly high rates,” it warned. Realisations of this nature have led to Bank of England Chief Economist, Andy Haldane, to claim that in the US and UK alone, about 80m and 15m jobs respectively could be taken over by robots.</p>
<p>Hope and fear, it seems, are pedalled freely. In the treasury space, because AI is yet to be adopted with any real vigour, the facts are few and far between. Here, readers of a certain age may be reminded of the battle between VHS and Betamax video formats; consumers and producers followed one or the other trend, initially the outcome being difficult to predict. Eventually VHS came out on top and was everywhere, at least until that too was superseded.</p>
<p>The point is that following the ‘right’ technology can be a gamble at the early stages – precisely where we are with AI in the context of treasury and corporate banking. The talk is loud but the action limited as the ideas and use cases jostle for position. Making a point of understanding the trends has great value because those heeding the advanced warnings will have a clear advantage over those who do not.</p>
<h3 id="consumer-driver">Consumer driver</h3>
<p>Just as it has with the advance of mobile technology, the consumer space is likely to lead the march of AI into the realm of business adoption. The advent of High Performance Computing and massive leaps forward in GPU and CPU technology has enabled the vast data processing and presentational needs of AI to be met in non-specialised environments.</p>
<p>The consumer world now abounds, for example, with online chatbots using powerful and quick-learning AI technology to steer sales conversations to a positive conclusion. As Armstrong-Barnes points out, in the insurance sector, chatbots are more successful at selling than their human counterparts. With the so-called millennials more aligned with the culture of messaging than previous generations, he argues that this format will only grow in strength.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the corporate space is not without its adventures in AI. Some banks are offering a practical nod to its adoption with applications handling banking back office operations, trading, risk management, fraud detection and KYC compliance. Others have deployed AI in the realm of customer services, having recognised the need to reduce the time customers spend interacting with online portals.</p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, for example, are using ‘virtual assistants’ to help deliver a quicker and more relevant service to their retail customers, so how long will it be before the more complex needs of corporate clients are tackled in this way?</p>
<p>It is true that a treasurer presiding over multiple accounts, multiple locations and currencies, and even multiple access rights, is a much bigger challenge. But just as mobile has ridden high on a consumer wave that is now breaking over the commercial space, the use of AI tools in retail seems to be a warm up exercise for the committed bankers of corporates – and not just as a risk management tool.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan is said to spend around 40% of its US$10.8bn annual technology budget on new technology including AI, RPA and blockchain. It has already rolled out mobile apps for its trading community, and now it is deploying Amazon’s voice-activated assistant, Alexa, to give its investment banking clients an easier AI-driven way to use its research database.</p>
<p>The plan is eventually to enable AI to help its treasury clients navigate the bank’s online portal and be able to ask an online assistant for balance information. By continuously learning from user questions and online behaviour, the so-far nameless system, which the bank reports as being in pilot mode, is expected one day to be able to offer clients alerts and actionable options based on predictions.</p>
<h3 id="ai-at-the-cusp">AI at the cusp</h3>
<p>The stage AI is at now makes it a useful tool to manage vast quantities of data. It has the capacity to tackle highly complex business processes and to create new opportunities, offering the kind of rapid insight – including behavioural and pattern analysis – that otherwise would not be possible. This, says Housley, could be a vital boost for treasurers who lack immediate insight into how efficiently subsidiaries are using cash, for example, with this data subsequently fuelling improvements in their working capital, forecasting and funding models.</p>
<p>Through the identification of patterns and characteristics within increasingly vast data pools, AI can also begin to move beyond simple insights and start to assist the improvement of processes. For treasury, a prescriptive model is envisioned where the dynamic use of data – on cash flows, balances and so on – can be turned not just into warnings on limits but also suggestions to optimally route payments, for example.</p>
<p>Virtual assistants could even be used to provide help with supplier negotiations or make bespoke recommendations for certain FX exposures. The transaction banking community’s oft-repeated claim that its advisory role is taking a bold step forward would certainly be supported by such tools.</p>
<h3 id="a-question-of-ethics">A question of ethics</h3>
<p>As with most forms of data use, AI is subject to ethical and social enquiry. For Housley, the need to maintain ‘explainability’ of decisions is a vital consideration. As data users use AI to move away from hand-crafted rules-based processing, and simple ways of drawing conclusions, and start to hand over decisions to “highly complex and uninterpretable black boxes”, he feels there is a risk of not being able to offer clear reasoning for the decisions being returned (why was this loan not granted?), a state that is not acceptable under GDPR, for example.</p>
<p>Armstrong-Barnes argues that the discipline of “algorithmic accountability”, dissecting how an answer was arrived at, is something that must be fully developed as decisions become more reliant upon AI. This is essential to address any notion that business is entering a dark age where “the computer says no” and that’s the end of it.</p>
<p>AI decisions can be based on extremely complex data manipulations and their formation, he notes, can become almost impenetrable for normal human intellect. “If we get to the point where we can’t understand and explain the complexity of the machine-learning algorithms, we have to build something that will understand them.”</p>


<blockquote>AI is a tool and it is one that needs to be used effectively; you need to choose and to plan how you use it and it needs to be part of a wider strategy.</blockquote>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Both Kassai and Housley raise the idea that bias exists in most data 
sets. Even if sensitive fields are removed, machine-learning algorithms 
can find patterns elsewhere in the data, or make assumptions based on 
insufficient data, inadvertently reintroducing those biases. Machine 
learning programmers need to be mindful of such cognitive bias, just as 
those interpreting output need to avoid applying their own partial 
readings, if the output is to be of any use.</p>
<p>As a mark of the seriousness with which this is taken, Microsoft has 
formed an academic team, FATE – Fairness, Accountability, Transparency 
and Ethics in AI – to try to tackle this issue. “As we move toward 
relying on intelligent agents in our everyday lives, how do we ensure 
that individuals and communities can trust these systems?”, it asks.</p>
<p>For OP Financial Group’s Luoma, the opportunity to derive more from 
data, whether that’s using data in medical research to detect problems 
ahead of time or in banking to reduce fraud, the advantages to all 
stakeholders can be compelling. However, he says, even though protection
 regimes such as Europe’s GDPR offer “sound principals on how privacy is
 taken care of”, it will be quite a “balancing act” between function and
 fairness going forward.</p>
<h3 id="human-after-all">Human after all</h3>
<p>“AI needs a human being,” states Armstrong-Barnes. As a defence 
against an unlawful decision, for example, “the computer told me to” is 
unlikely to be acceptable, he notes. “AI is a tool and it is one that 
needs to be used effectively; you need to choose and to plan how you use
 it and it needs to be part of a wider strategy.”</p>
<p>As with any data source, whatever is put in, dictates what you will 
get out. As Armstrong-Barnes has said, AI is just a mathematical 
algorithm: “we need to make sure that humans beings are the 
decision-making entity”.</p>
<p>For Kassai too, “the importance of human judgement should never be 
forgotten”. As such, he believes that it must be possible for 
data-related issues to be dealt with as exceptions by small teams of 
highly skilled individuals, not large teams of unskilled personnel. The 
implication for professional treasurers is clear; expertise will always 
be required.</p>
<h3 id="job-or-not">Job or not?</h3>
<p>Ultimately, will AI lead to job losses? Most likely it will: “fewer 
resources with higher skills, but becoming a lot more effective”, 
explains Luoma. With treasurers typically operating in lean teams and 
almost always charged with doing more with less, AI presents an 
opportunity to remove many or all mundane, repetitive tasks. This can 
enable treasurers to focus on adding value, tackling more complex and 
unexpected situations, where experience is essential. As McKinsey has 
said, “the majority of the benefits may come not from reducing labour 
costs but from raising productivity”.</p>
<p>AI’s raison d’être is, arguably, to learn and take over certain tasks
 from humans. For some professions the human touch remains essential to 
the task. Just as few today would be happy to know that the commercial 
plane they are travelling in at 38,000 ft has no pilot (the basic 
technology to fly planes without pilots already exists), so removing the
 human element when it comes to an organisation’s financial existence 
would unsettle all but the most committed.</p>
<p>‘Turn it off and turn it on again’ is common but often-experienced 
reality when working with technology. This is a somewhat flippant 
argument perhaps, but the fact is, human intervention will always be 
necessary. Direct contact with the situation (an airline pilot 
correcting computer error, for example) is often required for successful
 decisions to be made.</p>
<p>This is perhaps why the concept of Expert Automation and Augmentation
 Software (EAAS) may offer the right balance that Luoma talks about. 
EAAS uses machine learning to seek out highly complex patterns in data 
and to automate tasks, leaving the human to step in where professional 
skills can be applied to context.</p>
<p>Whilst tomorrow’s treasurer may have a whole new approach to that 
intervention, preparation for what is to come should start now. The 
future of the profession lies not in worrying about being replaced, but 
in accepting the challenge to keep up to date with the skills, knowledge
 and the technologies that are on the horizon today. The rules of 
progress then are simple: first start, then keep moving, but make sure 
skilled humans keep a watching brief.</p>

<h4 class="fn">Ingo Czok</h4>
<h5 class="title">CTO Cloud Payments</h5>
<p class="title"> </p>
<img alt="Hanse Orga Group" class="logo org" height="23" src="/i/logo/hanse-orga-logo-2017-170x23.png" title="Hanse Orga Group" width="170"/>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cloud technology, myths abound. Sifting through the hype and trying to uncover the real benefits can be a chore, especially as most treasurers already have enough work to keep them permanently occupied. But attitudes are changing.</p>
<p>Stepping up to the plate to explain what this means is Ingo Czok, CTO Cloud Payments at Hanse Orga Group. “Our first cloud customers were all large corporates,” he recalls. These firms wanted to be faster and more agile but wanted to be up and running in the shortest possible time. “They found that setting up a complex payments or treasury operation is much quicker in the cloud. But now we have many medium-size companies working in our cloud environment too,” he notes.</p>
<p>Despite the uncovering of key benefits, of which more in a moment, there is still resistance to cloud in some organisations. One of the main concerns is that of placing data beyond the ‘safe’ walls of the business. Where it is encountered, the main fear is that data can more easily be accessed by unauthorised persons. However, Czok cites a recent KPMG study that revealed on-premise installations suffer more breaches than their cloud-based counterparts.</p>
<p>The reason, argues Czok, may be this. With constantly evolving cyberthreats, it is extremely difficult for one business to keep on top of the changes. A specialist provider will have the resources and experience to hand. Furthermore, an on-premise system can be a known target for criminals whereas, arguably, the relative anonymity of a data centre provides cover. It is food for thought.</p>
<h3 id="data-protection">Data protection</h3>
<p>Mistrust aside, there can also be regulatory prohibition of moving data into the cloud. The tightening of controls under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25<sup>th</sup> May this year, is only serving to heighten the belief, in some jurisdictions, that cloud is outlawed altogether for businesses.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the case, states Czok. In fact, it is quite the opposite. GDPR is data protection for the digital age, regulating how data on EU citizens is stored and used in the cloud. However, the controls that stem from GDPR mean contracts with service providers must be scrutinised for compliance, he warns. “Making sure your cloud provider is GDPR-compliant is essential.”</p>
<p>Companies will need to establish strict data access rules governing their own and the service provider’s personnel. This may sound onerous for the client, but checking is quite easy. Whilst there is no GDPR certification yet, there are international assurances such as ISO 27001 and, in the US, SSAE 16, that can be seen. These are well-established information security management system frameworks that cover policies and procedures for work with client data (governing all the legal, physical and technical risk management controls that are used).</p>
<p>Of course, working with a certified European provider, such as Hanse Orga Group, means GDPR compliance has already been taken care of. “Our customers can take advantage of the work we have already done, instead of doing it all themselves,” says Czok.</p>
<h3 id="different-models">Different models</h3>
<p>The different deployment models of cloud range from private to public. Public may cause some companies to question whether their data is held as separately from other businesses as they would like. Indeed, some may even feel that sharing a server with another business increases the risk of unauthorised access to data.</p>
<p>“We offer different deployment options according to need,” says Czok. With customers ranging from a major German savings bank co-operative (with around 450 domestic banks offering a portal to their own clients), to private and public companies, these needs are varied.</p>
<p>The banking set-up is held within one database but using data protection mechanisms to ensure that none of the banks can see each other’s data, and none of the end clients can ever see another client’s data. Banks are ultra-sensitive to data breaches and, on a regular basis, undertake penetration tests to try to compromise the system.</p>
<p>“It is fairly safe to say that having all the data in one place can be achieved in a very secure manner,” says Czok. “But we have customers with policies that state that their data should never be in the same database, or on the same system, with data from other companies.”</p>
<p>In this case, the customer can be provided with its own dedicated server, using the same software and platform. The cloud is perfectly suited to infinite scalability, so this is entirely achievable for any number of clients. But for Czok, other than adherence to policy, a private instance is an unnecessary extra expense.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-benefits">Cloud benefits</h3>
<p>Handling the objections only serves to put cloud on the same level as on-premises solutions. But there are some quite distinct advantages to cloud, suggests Czok. The main driver for cloud adoption – the speed of implementation – remains unchallenged. But, in terms of functional benefits, the centralisation of data and processes means accessibility is enhanced way beyond that of any installed version. Firstly, data can be viewed immediately from almost anywhere in the world by all personnel with the right URL (web address) and access rights. If the corporate then wishes to consider integrating specific on-premises systems with its cloud applications and managed services, the practical value of both increases exponentially.</p>
<p>With e-banking stations scattered throughout an enterprise, often in different regions and countries, payments are often managed separately by individuals (and away from the scrutiny of the treasurer). Cloud offers a centralised payments factory which enables greater visibility. It also makes it easy and quick to incorporate and activate the payments function of new entities following a merger, for example (certainly far easier and quicker than rolling out yet another instance of the ERP).</p>
<p>Cash visibility is further improved by cloud centralisation, says Czok. The manner in which the ‘single source of truth’, delivered in real-time, benefits working capital management, for example, is well understood.</p>
<p>The benefits of having data in one place for fraud detection and prevention, on a global scale, are clear too; being able to monitor and analyse data movements across a siloed infrastructure is almost impossible, especially where mobile devices are in use. The single source means data access controls, auditability and visibility are vastly more manageable, even if companies must still be alert to the human element of fraud.</p>
<h3 id="practical-advantage">Practical advantage</h3>
<p>The sheer practical ease with which cash can be made visible is a positive that all treasurers will understand. Previously, to gain cash visibility, technical adaptations were required for each bank and possibly each account, across all jurisdictions, acknowledging every respective format and connection.</p>
<p>In a cloud environment, cash information is downloaded from each bank, but each bank’s formatting and connectivity requirements are managed by the provider, data being gathered using a simple Representational State Transfer (REST) API.</p>
<p>These APIs take advantage of existing protocols so there is no need to install new libraries or additional software. With a single interface now in place, formatted bank data can be moved to the client’s ERP system easily and quickly, explains Czok.</p>
<p>With cloud solutions largely ERP-agnostic, Hanse Orga Group’s strong route into SAP in no way restricts it to this product. “We are bringing all the technologies and features that we have in our SAP products to the cloud,” explains Czok.</p>
<p>The vendor is already offering hybrid solutions, allowing them to combine on-premises instances of its SAP-integrated FS² applications with cloud applications and managed services to enable centralised cash management, rolling liquidity planning and automated actual data assignment. “Customers can do all their payment runs in SAP. When the time comes, with the push of a button, they can move these payments files to the cloud.”</p>
<p>Once in the cloud, files can be mixed with other payments (that might stem from non-SAP users in the organisation or from special requests). Each can be checked for fraud and compliance, be authorised, formatted for each beneficiary, and sent to the relevant bank.</p>
<p>“The aspect of end-to-end security is particularly interesting,” says Czok. When payment instructions come into SAP, each can be encrypted so it is almost impossible to modify it before it leaves the system. With Hanse Orga Group’s acquisition last year of US-firm Dolphin, the electronic processing of legitimate invoices right through to payment in the ERP is, he believes, “a major advance in end-to-end security”.</p>
<p>There is still a due diligence requirement, and possibly some exceptions to manage, as would be the case with every system. But the benefits of such a unified connection with immediate cash visibility go beyond treasury and finance, into areas such as sales, production and supply chain.</p>
<h3 id="getting-connected">Getting connected</h3>
<p>To be able to enjoy the benefits of cloud, all that is required for an installed system is a single connection between the ERP or TMS, and the cloud system provider, using web services APIs. “There is no requirement to move on-premises systems to the cloud,” explains Czok.</p>
<p>In Hanse Orga Group’s hybrid offering, it provides its own open software connectors. These allow any permitted independent software provider to interface with its solutions, creating a singular architecture. Its team of consultants are positioned to help clients assess their needs and select the most appropriate pathway before implementation.</p>
<p>“With our managed services, customers can decide how much they wish to outsource,” adds Czok. “This may be just the software and basic hosting, the operating of the software, or possibly outsourcing the whole process including all the bank connectivity.” The flexibility inherent in cloud ensures customers of all sizes can adapt to it progressively, he believes.</p>
<p>Once the benefits of getting connected are revealed in practice, the myths and legends of ‘cloud’ that have built up over the years become just that: unsubstantiated tales. Any treasurer who wishes to focus more on being a treasurer and adding value to their organisation will soon find the reality so much more appealing.</p>

<p><em>The increasing pressure on all business functions to deliver more with less is not going away. What’s needed, argues Mark Evans, Managing Director, Transaction Banking, ANZ is a communicative, connected and agile business environment. For treasurers, this includes exploring new technologies.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><img alt="Mark Evans" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/markevans_photosept09-150x200.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=57F1ABFDB9FD5B02779FA0697F482A34" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;" width="150"/></em></p>


<h4 class="fn">Mark Evans</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director, Transaction Banking</h5>
<br/>
<img alt="ANZ logo" class="logo org" height="30" src="/i/logo/anz-logo-2015-93x30.png" title="ANZ" width="93"/>


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>There is absolutely no doubt, states Mark Evans, that over the past decade, the role of the treasurer has become more strategic. The role is no longer just about funding or managing short-dated risk as increasingly the treasury is relied upon to supply timely decision support for the board and C-suite’s long-term goals.</p>
<p>The need to optimise is one that all companies in all sectors would benefit from, says Evans. In particular, the larger publicly-listed companies, which are naturally subject to closer external scrutiny and the pressure of multiple reporting regimes, might experience heightened urgency to seek change. A different pressure to perform might also be seen by companies operating internationally; by virtue of their exposure to complex, multi-jurisdictional activities, they almost inevitably must focus on extracting maximum efficiency from their processes.</p>
<p>In treasury terms, progress to optimal status has in part been an extension of where the role has historically sought to achieve efficiencies. But as the wider business demands increase, moving beyond a pure accounting view of working capital efficiency, for example, risks missing the bigger picture, says Evans.</p>
<h3 id="a-helping-hand">A helping hand</h3>
<p>But in achieving that wider view, the treasury aim is not to run other functions but to have greater ability to influence how those functions achieve their goals, for the greater good. Through collaboration – including the appropriate deployment of technology – Evans believes there is more opportunity to drive enterprise-wide efficiencies. A sales department might benefit from lengthening trade terms but if this is not possible from a balance sheet perspective, the treasurer is in a position to assess the advantages of, and perhaps implement, a payables financing solution.</p>
<p>Over the years, the need for more treasury input at the corporate level has been a push-pull affair, with the business asking and treasury offering. Progress has been steady. But the speed at which global and domestic economies are changing, driven in part by technology’s enablement of more rapid processing, means business unit silos really should be a thing of the past, says Evans. “All good organisations have to collaborate to succeed.”</p>
<p>The C-suite increasingly understands that treasury has a broader role to play and is empowering treasurers with the right to engage with colleagues in other areas. But well-developed soft skills for all involved in seeking to optimise the business are critical here, Evans warns. “People are naturally protective of their roles and suspicious of those who seek to influence. But no one has all the information and all the ideas; the real need is to be able facilitate the sharing of opportunities.”</p>
<h3 id="softly-spoken">Softly spoken</h3>
<p>To become the most agile, responsive and business-sensitive treasury, there must first be an acceptance that other functions may not necessarily welcome what could be seen as ‘interference’ from areas where there has been no previous engagement.</p>
<p>If success is absolutely dependent upon collaboration, then that must be derived from empathy for each other’s part in the business, says Evans. But he adds that it is also incumbent upon the treasurer to be upfront about the agenda of any proposed engagement, and why it is good for the business. “It helps to identify some quick wins with their colleagues so they can buy into the value-add that treasury can produce.”</p>
<p>For the treasurer, an “inquisitive mindset” is vital in helping bring about these quick wins. Taking an interest in the other functions will, says Evans, help create a learning curve that in turn delivers the capacity to identify pain points and where treasury can add value but to honestly assess where it has no facility to help.</p>
<p>The logical areas of development from where treasury can start building out an assistive role are commonly around automation and straight-through processing. In being able to harvest specific data to improve reconciliations on accounts receivables it could speed up the working capital and cash conversion cycles to the benefit of sales planning.</p>
<p>In managing multiple risks (credit, interest rate, country, currency et al), treasurers are uniquely placed to provide guidance to other functions on how to incorporate risk management into their own processes. Even something simple such as alerting sales to the possibilities of using different trading currencies, or advising on the commercial impact on buyers and suppliers of geopolitical risk, has value.</p>
<p>In the context of practical solutions, it may be that sales has willing buyers but the credit team places constraints on deals by putting on conservative limits. Extending credit terms through supplier finance or applying credit insurance to buyers are not traditional considerations for sales team, yet with treasury guidance on the options, sales volumes can be increased.</p>
<h3 id="keep-it-clean">Keep it clean</h3>
<p>One of the keys to success of any treasury optimisation plan will be the adoption of appropriate technology. Of course, treasury and technology are known associates but developments in the technology space in recent times seem to be ushering a new era of agility. With advances in APIs, robotics, artificial intelligence and distributed ledger tools (such as blockchain), progress can be rapid.</p>
<p>The overarching goal from the outset should be for clean data, explains Evans. This, he notes, “is what will unlock a lot of the currently constrained opportunities for the organisation”. APIs, used to connect third party systems through a variety of digital channels, will only be of worth if the underlying data is both accessible and sound.</p>
<p>The viewing of aggregated data from internal or external sources could be through an app or a bespoke dashboard, depending on the needs of the user. A departmental manager will already understand the impact of credit limits or the flow of receivables, for example.</p>
<p>With access to clean data of this nature, the treasurer will be able to overlay and configure relevant and possibly real-time external market, sector or client data, drawn through APIs to suitable third parties such as banking partners. This will start to bring a deeper and broader understanding of the fundamentals for each function, says Evans. With the application of modern business intelligence (BI) and analytics tools capable of processing multiple data sources, the level of information achievable today is unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="outsource-for-expertise-and-advantage">Outsource for expertise and advantage</h3>
<p>This sounds like an expensive ideal rather than an achievable aim. With the outsourcing of some treasury activities to shared service centres or to cloud-based third-party service providers, treasury costs can be reduced, says Evans. Instead of having to build and maintain their own infrastructure, the operational element can be divested by treasury to professional providers whose expertise, developmental capacity and economies of scale in these areas could exceed those of treasury or in-house IT.</p>
<p>Where a provider works with a number of clients across sectors and jurisdictions, Evans says the accumulated knowledge allows each user to benefit from the insights and experiences of the other users whilst still respecting confidentiality. At a high level, this might be in terms of understanding and responding to emerging trends. Where these trends indicate a need for a system change across the board, the outsource provider can do so for all in a single iteration yet individual needs can still be met. Depending on sector, the early heads-up on trends provided by the vendor’s broader connection to the market could even be extended to its clients’ clients.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-tools-on-the-block">The new tools on the block</h3>
<p>Few treasurers could have failed to note the recent increase in volume of conversation around robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain-type solutions. “These solutions will impact treasurers positively if they embrace them, or if they don’t they will impact them negatively,” warns Evans. “The technology is just getting better and better.”</p>
<p>RPA is focused on tackling high-volume repetitive processing. As a means to the end of straight-through processing, it is a means of reducing operational risk and increasing efficiency, explains Evans. “The technology is available, its application is clearly an efficiency driver and it is being embraced by corporates large and small,” he notes.</p>
<p>Looking at AI and the idea of machine learning is generating much more speculation and excitement. Where process repetition is a factor but decisions are not always black and white, judgement is required on every exception. Algorithms within RPA can adopt ‘fuzzy logic’ – the IT equivalent of a ‘maybe’ – so that decisions based on calculated probability can be made. As each decision is accepted, the basis of that decision can be formed into a rule for future action where similar conditions exist, further promoting automation.</p>
<p>Within ANZ, a number of fintech solutions are being explored in the trade finance environment. With some recent successes in this space, the accuracy rates of machine learning have risen from around 50% to over 90%. With some institutions now claiming over 98% accuracy “we’re getting at or beyond the levels achievable by humans,” says Evans.</p>
<p>The application of these tools is being deployed in areas such as document checking, reconciliations and the provision of customer advice and information. In this context, optical scanning and character recognition technology can be used to further automate data extraction prior to decisioning.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-real-issues">Fixing real issues</h3>
<p>The exploration of further developments in this space is very much part of ANZ’s strategy. It has a dedicated in-house lab populated by engineers who fully understand the technology. Their skill is augmented by the Bank’s business units that are charged with bringing an understanding of the clients’ pain points, and thus commercial viability, to the IT concepts.</p>
<p>In taking on projects, it would be a mistake to work on a solution looking for a problem, says Evans. “First we must have an understanding of what the problem is that we are trying to resolve. We then have to work out what a good outcome looks like. Only then will we engage with the technologists and the operations experts to explore what options we should consider applying.”</p>
<p>One of the loudest conversations today is around blockchain as the great panacea. But the most appropriate solution for an issue, taking real client needs into consideration, may be as simple as moving them out of the branch and onto phone banking, says Evans. It could give a much better customer experience yet still reduce processing times and operational errors.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake too for a bank to doggedly pursue a technology roadmap that in some instances does not align with current client needs. “It cannot be a case of ‘our way or the highway’,” comments Evans. “We have to work hand-in-hand with our customers.” Indeed, he adds, progress through technology is not about banks investing in the latest and dragging customers with them. As Evans says, “we can’t do everything overnight and we have to respect that customers may not be able or want to either”.</p>
<p>In the spirit of collaboration – and in the spirit of finding solutions that really work – a key part of ANZ’s development strategy is to involve its customers in a collective discussion on how best to remove pain points and optimise the technology experience. The real benefit for customers here is that they stand to shape the solutions they need rather than explain how they should be developed after the fact. “It also demonstrates that we are listening to them,” adds Evans.</p>
<h3 id="a-business-case-for-agility">A business case for agility</h3>
<p>The key activity-based metrics and KPIs (such as cycle times, treasury process costs, throughput and available liquidity) used by treasurers will remain as relevant going forward as they have always been, says Evans. However, the success of the treasury function across the business may not be reflected in these metrics.</p>
<p>If treasury is going to contribute to the success of the organisation, the way in which it has made an impact needs to be counted. It will be necessary to secure feedback from the functions that the treasurer has worked with in order to ascertain the level of value added as a result of that relationship. This may be tied in with a reduction in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) or increased sales off the back of a working capital initiative. The bank itself may also be in a position to quantitively assess the value added by treasury to different functions through analysis of activity across different banking areas.</p>
<h3 id="get-involved">Get involved</h3>
<p>More and better collaboration is the message for treasurers in the new technology landscape. Ensuring other functions understand the context and purpose of treasury involvement will encourage cooperation. But treasurers also need to exercise curiosity and learn about those parts of the business that may not traditionally be on their radar. Only then will they see the opportunities to add value that lie ahead.</p>
<p>“Engage with the financial services providers and ask what they are doing in the technology space too,” advises Evans. “Most will be more than happy to share their thinking around it and learn from the practitioners. A treasurer with a proactive and collaborative approach asking if they can work together on a problem is a signal that this issue could be affecting many more businesses.”</p>
<h3 id="the-end-of-treasury-or-a-new-beginning">The end of treasury or a new beginning?</h3>
<p>As the march of technology continues, will the treasurer eventually be automated out of existence? There may be no value in speculating what the treasury of 10 or 20 years’ time may look like, says Evans. But look back by that same period and who could have confidently stated the degree by which technology would have advanced by today and how it has helped treasurers reach a position of genuine strategic importance? It is, he adds, almost certain that the work of tomorrow’s treasurer will be intrinsically plugged into the company’s strategic roadmap, enabling them to continue to holding elevated positions within their organisations.</p>
<p>The role of the treasurer and the CFO will become more closely aligned, says Evans tentatively. It may be that the CIO function will also become more closely aligned with treasury, because technology will be deployed across the whole organisation for both external and internal benefit.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, if you think the job you do today will be the same in ten years’ time, you’re probably not going to be in that job,” cautions Evans. Today’s treasury professionals, including bankers, “have to be flexible, to anticipate and embrace change, and be responsive to the opportunities that those changes bring”. To avoid being bitten, agility, it seems is more than just having the latest toys.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Blockchain has become the buzzword in finance. Why has it captured so much attention, what is being done with the technology today and where is it going in the future?</em></p>
<p>Blockchain has created a buzz in financial services unlike anything else in recent memory. Since being introduced to the technology through the rise of Bitcoin, the industry has been awash with talk of blockchain and its potential impact. Some see this technology as a cure for all ills; others fear the unknown and the disruption it might have. One thing everyone agrees on is that blockchain is here to stay.</p>
<p>In brief, the blockchain is a distributed database that irrevocably records and confirms the ownership and transfer of a digital asset. Although this does not sound especially exciting, it has the potential to be revolutionary, bringing increased transparency, speed, trust and reduced costs in the financial ecosystem and beyond.</p>
<p>Despite the promise of blockchain, it would be remiss not to highlight that the industry has a long way to go before the benefits can be realised. Legacy processes, technology and thinking are not easily changed. The transformation will therefore not occur overnight – but the industry has set a course for the road ahead.</p>
<h3 id="the-emergence">The emergence</h3>
<p>The story of blockchain begins in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto, the alias of a still unknown computer programmer, pressed the button that unleashed Bitcoin into the world. This was a seminal moment in finance. The launch of Bitcoin highlighted that technology had advanced to a point where a fully digital currency could be created and exchanged directly from A to B without the involvement of traditional financial institutions, central banks or governments.</p>
<p>Yet the initial reaction to this game-changing technology was muted outside of the realm of technology enthusiasts. It was not until 2011/12 that Bitcoin began to make the headlines as the crypto-currency increased in value and was accepted as a method of payment by a limited number of merchants.</p>
<p>From this point on, interest in Bitcoin began to gain momentum, due in part to several high-profile negative news stories. These included the use of the currency on the Silk Road – an online black market – and the criminal investigation into the collapse of Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange at that time. Although these stories brought Bitcoin into the public consciousness, they may have proved a death knell for the ambitions some had for it to replace fiat currencies as corporates, banks and other traditional institutions quickly moved to distance themselves from the crypto-currency.</p>
<p>As the financial industry moved away from Bitcoin, it quickly became apparent that all the attention had been focusing on the wrong aspect of this technology. The most interesting opportunity is not in the token of exchange, but in the underlying technology that facilitates the exchange.</p>
<p>“This was an eye-opening moment for the industry,” explains Anthony Macey, Head of Blockchain R&amp;D at Barclays. “Blockchain provides a more efficient and transparent way of exchanging digital assets and this plugs a gap that we all knew existed in the digital age of banking. Once this became apparent, we, like many other banks, quickly began to explore the improvements the blockchain could drive in financial services. We identified 45 use cases initially, and this very quickly expanded to over 100.”</p>
<p>Also important, according to Macey, was the work done by fintech companies to expand upon the technology and principles of the Bitcoin blockchain to create more advanced solutions better suited to the complex nature of financial services. Macey highlights Ethereum as being especially innovative as it has enabled logic (smart contacts, for example) to run on top of the blockchain, creating a host of new opportunities for the banks to build new solutions.</p>
<p>Banks did not begin working overtime on blockchain just because of the potential opportunities though; they also did it out of fear. “The emergence of blockchain was the first time the banks were really nervous about the disruptive impact of a new technology,” says Macey. “It was clear that it could create a new way of working that could potentially eat into their margins. They had to act.”</p>
<p>The rest is very much history. Today, nearly every bank has a blockchain strategy and hundreds of fintechs are exploring a seemingly endless array of use cases for the technology. As a result, money continues to pour into blockchain – a total of US$1.4bn was invested in blockchain start-ups in 2016, according to PwC. Blockchain is truly a global phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="the-era-of-exploration">The era of exploration</h3>
<p>Despite all the talk, blockchain is used very little in financial services today, at least on a commercial scale. The technology has therefore had little impact on corporate treasury professionals. Consequently, a degree of blockchain lethargy has entered the profession and it is no longer front and centre of every discussion.</p>
<p>Discussions relating to blockchain are coming to the fore again, however. Over the past six months, several banks have announced the completion of proof of concept (POC) experiments and pilots that utilise blockchain technology. “These are exciting developments,” says Paige Penze, Director, Head of Business Development in Innovation, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). “Completing these experiments is helping us properly highlight the benefits of the technology and frame the path to commercialisation.”</p>
<p>The recent announcements by the banks also show that they are taking a more focused approach to blockchain experimentation. In transaction services, the main areas of focus are cross-border payments, correspondent banking and trade finance.</p>
<p>In the trade finance space, the banks are having particular success. BofAML, working alongside its client, Microsoft, have recently completed a POC for standby letters of credit (SLOC) issuance, for example. The objective was to demonstrate that blockchain/smart contracts can streamline the inherently paper-based and inefficient SLOC process.</p>
<p>Barclays is another bank using blockchain in the trade finance space. Working with fintech partner Wave, the bank completed a blockchain trade finance transaction between Ornua (formerly the Irish Dairy Board) and Seychelles Trading Company. The ‘world first’ transaction utilised the blockchain to allow all parties involved in the transaction to see, transfer title and transmit shipping documents and other original trade documentation with complete visibility. “This eliminated many of the issues created by the legacy process,” says Macey. “It really highlights the impact this technology can have in this space.”</p>



<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">In focus: blockchain technology</h2>
<p>Blockchain (sometimes referred to as a distributed ledger) is a peer-to-peer distributed database that irrevocably records and confirms the ownership and transfer of a digital asset.</p>
<h4 id="diagram-01">How it works</h4>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/2017-09and10-tta-06-t-blockchain-technology-300x227.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=5271034D5F6514340730A8CBA675F6BC" target="_blank"><img alt="Blockchain technology: how it works" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/2017-09and10-tta-06-t-blockchain-technology-300x227.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=5271034D5F6514340730A8CBA675F6BC" style="width: 900px;" width="800"/></a></p>
<h4>Treasury use cases</h4>
<h5>Cross-border payments</h5>
<p>There have already been examples of cross-border payments that can be made quicker, cheaper and more efficient using blockchainbased solutions.</p>
<h5>Trade</h5>
<p>The processes surrounding global trade are being transformed using the blockchain. The technology is looking to drive greater speed, transparency and reduce risk.</p>
<h5>KYC</h5>
<p>A number of fintechs are looking to use blockchain as a means of sharing digital identify, removing a lot of the pain currently associated with KYC processes.</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Cross-border payments is another area earmarked for improvement using the blockchain. Ripple is a fintech that has made a big splash in this space through a mixture of interesting technology and impressive marketing. Traditional players have reacted in kind, with SWIFT announcing that it will be experimenting with blockchain as part of its global payment innovation (gpi) initiative. Banks such as BNP Paribas have also announced the completion of successful pilot blockchain payment transactions with their clients.</p>
<p>Taking a slightly different approach to blockchain innovation, Citi recently launched its ‘bridge to the blockchain’ solution in partnership with NASDAQ. In brief, the solution is essentially a protocol that links the ‘traditional’ financial ecosystem to the ‘new world’ – in this case, NASDAQ’s Linq platform for private markets securities.</p>
<p>In Australia, meanwhile, local banks are making good progress using blockchain technology. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, for instance, announced earlier this year that it has built a blockchain for debt capital markets which has been tested by Queensland Treasury Corporation for the issuance of semi-government bonds. The benefit is that it can eliminate settlement risk because the solution links the transfer of title with the payment, meaning that the transaction is executed and settled instantaneously. Other local lenders, ANZ and Westpac, have also successfully used blockchain instead of paper for bank guarantees on commercial property leasing.</p>
<h3 id="building-blocks">Building blocks</h3>
<p>The next step for all of these projects is full-scale commercialisation. However, there is some way to go before this can happen. Predictions about how long this might be range from two years to a decade or more – essentially nobody is sure.</p>
<p>A big reason for this is that regulation and law is yet to catch up with the technology. Although there has been some progress made in making financial laws and regulations more ‘digitally native’, there is a long way to go, with some countries still not accepting any form of digital documentation. Without regulatory and legal innovation, much of the technological evolution will be useless outside of small scale tests like those we are seeing today.</p>
<p>It is encouraging to see that some regulations are taking the lead. The Bank of England in the UK, for example, has been very interested in exploring and experimenting with blockchain. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is another progressive regulator, actively embracing blockchain and seeing how it can be used to make doing business in the country more efficient.</p>
<p>Away from the regulatory and legal issues, there is also the question of whether there is a blockchain currently suitable for commercialisation. Paul Thwaite, Head of Transaction Services at NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland, does not think there is. “There is no blockchain platform that is currently considered to be finance or business grade,” he says. “However, the platform evolution evident today suggests that we are moving further away from the original libertarian Bitcoin blockchain.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Barclays’ Macey thinks that the Corda platform built by R3 – the blockchain consortium – is one of the closest to becoming a platform fit for purpose in financial services. But even when such a platform exists, there are challenges for the banks when it comes to using it. “Let us assume that the R3 platform works, is scalable and ready to go live – what do you do then?” he says. “You can’t rip out the legacy banking system overnight – even minute parts have to be changed slowly. A big bank can’t risk any disruption to businesses. This is the biggest risk posed by adopting blockchain and thus is the biggest obstacle to large scale commercialisation.”</p>
<p>BofAML’s Penze adds to this point. “We are not going to replace our legacy systems with blockchain overnight,” she says. “It will be a slow and steady process, allowing us to iron out any issues before we expose this technology properly to our clients.”</p>
<p>What about the cost of all this IT work? Asks Peter Farley, Senior Strategist, Capital Markets at Finastra. “To adopt blockchain in a meaningful way, the banks will need to change all the technology in their back offices,” he says. “This is a big issue for many banks, especially the global banks with a large monolithic IT stack looking at blockchain as a cost saver. In reality, IT budgets will need to increase before blockchain allows them to reduce – if this is possible at all.”</p>
<p>Farley also highlights the sporadic nature of blockchain development at present – something reflected by everyone Treasury Today Asia interviewed for this article. “The whole ecosystem is very fragmented,” he says. “This needs to be brought under control sooner rather than later, otherwise there will be many different systems that exist which will not integrate very well, making it hard for blockchain to deliver on all its promise.”</p>
<h3 id="more-to-come">More to come…</h3>
<p>Despite the challenges that need to be overcome before blockchain becomes ubiquitous in the commercial banking space, it is likely that this will happen.</p>
<p>But exactly where and how blockchain will be used remains to be seen. An educated guess would be that trade finance will be first, with payments to follow soon after. The impact this will have on treasury also remains up for debate. The hope is that it will usher in a brave new world where low-cost, automated solutions are the norm. On the other side of the coin, some fear the fragmented development will create an even more complex world than the one that exists today. In reality, it is likely to be somewhere in between.</p>

<p><em>In a turbulent world where change is the only certainty, the technological advancement that is robotic process automation can carve out some distinct advantages for treasurers. Kevin Grant, Chief International Officer, Hanse Orga Group, explains.</em></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>We are living in the age of digital transformation. The Internet of Things, mobile, hyper-connectivity, big data, social media, cloud, in-memory computing – all these elements (and more) are equal part commercial threat and opportunity. Which one depends on company outlook.</p>
<p>Either way, they need to be addressed because customer behaviour is changing and established business models are disappearing or morphing into something new in response. There is also the considerable matter of global economic uncertainty bearing down on profitability, to the point where commercial survival is threatened.</p>
<p>For many businesses across the world, digital transformation is, or should be, very high on the agenda. Why? “The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence; it is to act with yesterday’s logic,” said US Economist and Philosopher, Peter Drucker. Companies worldwide are challenged by turbulence every day and need suitable tools and robust data that enable them to be competitive and to stay sustainably successful.</p>
<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) has a key role to play.</p>
<h3 id="rise-of-the-software-robot">Rise of the software robot</h3>
<p>Forget the images of powerful mechanised arms and futuristic factories; in this context, the robot of RPA is simply defined as the automation of routine processing tasks using rule-based logic. This ‘software’ view of robotics is something many companies are already using, says Kevin Grant, Chief International Officer, Hanse Orga Group.</p>
<p>Indeed, treasurers afforded the luxury of automated compliance with hedge accounting policy and standards will be running forward and reverse exposure analyses on their current hedging portfolios. These ‘simulations’ are entirely within the scope of RPA, says Grant.</p>
<p>Arguably this is a specialist use-case but RPA can encounter a wide set of circumstances and offer an appropriate response. It is being applied not just to the processing of high volumes of data but also being deployed into a broad subset of scenarios and allowing the ‘machine’ to make the decisions, following the logic programmed into it, when it encounters those situations.</p>
<p>This serves to limit the number of exception items that have to be processed by humans. It also serves treasury’s widening scope of interest in corporate financial data and the need for process improvements and efficiencies to deliver better cash management.</p>
<p>Understandably, RPA has become a hot topic in recent times. It is enabling vast improvements in process effectiveness and efficiency, calling upon precisely the kind of forward-thinking logic of which Drucker would approve. The statistics speak for themselves.</p>
<p>According to The Hackett Group’s research, typical finance organisations can cut process costs by 35% by adopting digital technologies, nearly matching the level seen today by world-class organisations.</p>
<h3 id="a-library-of-solutions">A library of solutions</h3>
<p>The reason RPA is so successful is that if during the process of extracting exceptions for humans to fix, the software tools within RPA are used to fix the problem, machine learning begins to understand both the issue and the fix. It then captures both within the ‘scenario library’ so it knows what to do next time it encounters that situation. Rather than humans continually remedying the same problem, once RPA has learnt and stored the fix, it has removed that exception from the sphere of human intervention.</p>
<p>For RPA to begin the good work there needs to be a level of configuration based on the client’s workflows, processes and controls they wish to put in place. As a system supplier, Hanse Orga Group will create pre-configured systems that are designed to tackle certain tasks. These will have been drawn from its wide industry experience across customer-types and built into the scenario library.</p>
<p>“Customers will already be a step ahead,” says Grant. “They will already have access to a greater capability than they are likely to require to begin with.” When they come across a scenario that is likely to be new to them, the chances are that a subset of scenario rules will already have been created. Through an easy interface, and following training, RPA can then bring that scenario into the client’s ever-expanding active library of fixes. “We call it self-learning but the client is really selecting the fix from the library that suits their needs.”</p>
<h3 id="building-and-using-robot">Building and using robot</h3>
<p>Implementation of a user-friendly and pre-configured system, pitched at business people not IT, should be relatively easy. And Hanse Orga Group’s RPA offering is just that, says Grant. Following initial consultation, configuration and training, updating of scenarios thereafter should present few issues.</p>
<p>For SAP users, there is no need to fear tackling Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) code to build new scenarios. Hanse Orga Group has already written this into specific functions in a logical way that allows clients to self-serve. The new functions they create, in turn form new scenarios that are logged in the library as fixes. Think in terms of how an Excel cell knows what to do every time it receives new data, says Grant. It has been configured by users based on current requirements and can be used to automatically tackle the same scenario in the future, or be modified as required. It is not difficult!</p>
<p>The current RPA use-case for treasurers relates in particular to cash visibility, notes Grant. This has historically not always been easy for treasurers. Hanse Orga Group is focusing in detail on accounts payable and accounts receivable and allowing the treasurer to implement efficient processes which are automated to a high degree. This, he explains, takes head-count out of these processes, enabling the focus to shift onto higher value-added tasks.</p>


<blockquote>Our aim is to build robotic solutions with an element of AI across different financial workflows.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>At a more granular level, data can be processed much faster and to a higher level of accuracy. The information being presented to treasury for decision-making is therefore far richer, notes Grant. The explicit understanding of cash positions, for example, can lead to a reduction of external volumes of cash, or, for those long on cash, the confidence to invest more profitably.</p>
<p>“We are doing all the processing at a lower level on DSO, DPO and DIO,” he says. This allows treasurers to have a working capital management solution that takes into account invoice level data, not just data at the reported bank balance level. Taking this with forecasting information, overlaying it with details of any bank credit facility and actual financial transaction data, a far more intuitive and all-encompassing working capital management solution is created.</p>
<h3 id="advancing-ai">Advancing AI</h3>
<p>A core development from this wide-ranging view, and the data that makes it possible, is the move towards analytics. Treasurers can be led to decisions quicker and the availability of key metrics means KPIs can be put in place to drive further process improvements.</p>
<p>If some of this sounds futuristic, the next wave of RPA is upon us already. Automated decision-making based on the results of analytics and artificial intelligence is possible, notes Grant. This is currently practiced in the area of foreign exchange risk management. A system can connect with a trading portal, making requests for an order to be fulfilled and lodging a competitive bid, and then executing that deal before automatically creating trades in the treasury deal portfolio, updating the cash forecasting within SAP and even feeding into the hedge accounting and risk management areas.</p>
<p>Can it go further? It can, says Grant. “But treasury needs to decide what level of AI it is willing to accept.” This amounts to a definition of rules and risk appetite, he notes. A treasurer may be comfortable with the idea of automating processes or even deal execution. But at what point do they want a process to become an exception item with human intervention? And to what extent should intervention be used before the follow-on action is confirmed? This is a matter of choice and confidence in the technology. There is a curious point to make about the latter.</p>
<p>RPA can process far higher volumes of data at far greater speed than any human. Whether matching invoices or making trades, RPA can look at source data and many forms of complementary data. For example, stock price volatility or the volume of credit default swaps being processed against a set of customers can inform a decision to reduce exposure to a sector or individual financial counterparty. Even meteorological data can be analysed to inform trade decisions. “The fact is that RPA gives a far wider vision, building intelligence into decision-making because ultimately, it is about data management.”</p>
<h3 id="the-circuit-breaker">The circuit breaker</h3>
<p>The threat of automation to some livelihoods is real. Is RPA’s move into analytics-based decision-making the death-knell for treasury? In much the same way that pilotless passenger planes are a long way off, leaving key financial decisions to a ‘robot’ is unlikely, says Grant. It is a matter of confidence and this can be managed.</p>
<p>“Companies may wish to put circuit-breakers into their automated processes,” says Grant. “In making a call on risk tolerance and putting in those circuit-breakers, they will achieve the level of control they require relative to the level of automation to which they aspire.”</p>
<p>Any RPA system must be capable of creating an exception when given data outside a certain tolerance, effectively pulling the plug on itself. In the treasury space, a statement may reveal a customer is going outside of its payment terms. Tolerance to this can be set, triggering automated dunning at that point. But that trigger point is not always clear cut. Dunning may be best served with a harder or softer approach, according to the value or volume of trade, for example.</p>


<blockquote>Treasury may have disparate systems but what can be created with them is a unified workflow process in a master SAP system.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Interfacing this process with the sales system, allowing modification of the credit appetite accordingly, would serve to protect relationships. If a customer always pays 30 days late, then the credit risk is minimal. Payment outside of normal behaviour may be a sign of increasing credit risk. This is where AI tools can be deployed to spot patterns over long periods, just as credit card systems track trends in cardholder spend for anti-fraud purposes.</p>
<p>Taking the decision on where to raise the exception and how to handle it will yield different results. It may require human intervention, or automatic reduction of a credit facility for example. The key is to have access to a range of data to inform that decision.</p>
<h3 id="reaching-further">Reaching further</h3>
<p>“Our aim is to build robotic solutions with an element of AI across different financial workflows,” explains Grant. To complement Hanse Orga Group’s own systems it has acquired technology in the past year through Soplex, Dolphin, e5 and Tembit. By using standard SAP treasury functionality and integrating with the AP, payments factory, in-house banking and cash management, credit and receivables management technologies from its acquisitions, it is forging links between historically disconnected treasury and finance processes.</p>
<p>When solutions are embedded within the same technology, in this case in SAP, the workflow follows a natural path, even within multiple incidences of the ERP, says Grant. But workflows from outside this environment, from other ERP providers, can be brought on board and integrated using standard connectivity too. “Treasury may have disparate systems but what can be created with them is a unified workflow process in a master SAP system.”</p>
<h3 id="big-data-is-the-key">Big data is the key</h3>
<p>From localised data capture and processing, treasury gains centralised visibility and control over every aspect of payments. But, as Grant notes, the point of RPA is that with solutions incorporated within an enterprise data processing environment, “there is no reason why treasurers can’t automate on a far wider set of data points”.</p>
<p>This makes the concept of capturing and exploiting big data – including the new notion of the unstructured ‘data lake’ – central to RPA. Using technology embedded in the same environment, such as SAP, provides a single source of truth from that data. This makes for compelling information and intelligence for treasurers. Greater levels of automation are but a step away.</p>
<p>We are indeed living in the age of digital transformation. With RPA’s help, the vast range of data from which treasury is constituted – past, present and future – suddenly seems like an opportunity after all.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Banks are increasingly offering consumers ways to carry out banking activities without the need for human interaction. In the world of corporate banking, development may be less advanced – but banks across the region are increasingly turning their attention to the opportunities and benefits of a self-service model, from a reduction in paper to greater transparency and enhanced decision making.</em></p>
<p>The rise of digital channels is transforming the way in which banking services are provided. Around the world, banks are exploring the use of self-service models to support customers in carrying out banking activities without the need for human interaction, from in-branch self-service machines to chatbots which can issue financial advice.</p>
<p>As with many innovations in banking, development has so far been focused on the consumer experience, with corporate banking lagging behind. But with banks in Asia increasingly asking how they can offer their corporate clients a self-service experience, what are the most significant areas of development and how could corporates benefit?</p>
<h3 id="from-bricks-and-mortar-to-chatbots">From bricks and mortar to chatbots</h3>
<p>The concept of self-service banking has been around for some time – at least in the retail banking domain. Simply put, self-service means that people can carry out activities themselves, without the need for human interaction. ATMs are an early facilitator of this model, but more recently the rise of online banking platforms and mobile apps has provided greater opportunities for people to withdraw cash, check their account balances and send transactions without ever having to set foot in a bricks-and-mortar branch.</p>
<p>Notable developments in this area include the arrival of chatbots, which can perform tasks such as initiating transactions and providing financial advice. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for example, is developing a digital assistant called Erica which uses artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to interact with customers via voice or text message and make recommendations about customers’ finances. In Asia, meanwhile, DBS has rolled out a chatbot called POSB digibank Virtual Assistant on Facebook Messenger. The service currently provides basic information about the bank’s products and services but work is underway to include services such as bill payments.</p>
<p>As self-service models become more common, banks are finding there is less need for the physical branches that have been necessary in the past. Between 2015 and 2016, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi and J.P. Morgan closed a total of 389 branches across America. In Asia, meanwhile, Citi has announced that it will close 80% of its branches in South Korea as part of its move to digitisation, with around 800 workers to be redeployed to “non-face-to-face” channels. However, this trend is not consistent across all markets: HSBC has announced it will close 62 branches in the UK this year, but that it has no plans to close branches in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Even when banks do retain their physical branches, many are exploring opportunities to enhance these with elements of self-service, for example by introducing self-service machines which allow customers to perform their own teller transactions. As well as enabling customers to withdraw funds, such machines can also be used to pay in cheques, make payments and manage direct debits. These developments are enabling banks to readjust the roles of staff within their branches, with a greater proportion focused on providing financial advice instead of carrying out transactional activities.</p>
<p>In other cases, cardless ATMs are being introduced which enable people to withdraw cash using their smartphones. Meanwhile, POSB last year piloted a video teller machine (VTM) which allows people to carry out a range of banking activities and carry out live video chats with staff. VTMs have now been installed at nine locations in Singapore.</p>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-corporate-self-service-banking">The rise of corporate self-service banking</h3>
<p>As consumers begin to benefit from these developments, a number of factors are combining to make self-service a higher priority in the corporate banking arena too. “People are talking about self-service banking now for a number of reasons,” says Francyn Stuckey, Head of Payments &amp; Cash Management at ANZ. “The maturity of the technology is one. Banks have invested a lot in their key systems – you’ve got clearing systems moving to XML and becoming more data rich; you’ve got APIs and apps, so technology has moved on very quickly.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Stuckey notes that with millennials coming up through the workforce and consumerisation hitting a critical mass, buying and servicing behaviour is also evolving. “Another consideration is how competitive the space is,” she says. “Whether it is the fintechs coming in and looking for opportunities to disrupt, or partner banks keeping up with increasing pressures in terms of regulation and cybercrime, everybody is looking for that opportunity to serve their client in a way that is better, more convenient – and ideally more cost effective.”</p>
<p>Manoj Dugar, Head of Core Cash Management Product, Asia Pacific, Treasury Services at J.P. Morgan adds that cross-border expansion is another factor driving development in this area. “As corporates expand their operations especially across borders, they are increasingly looking to connect seamlessly with banking partners for their cash management requirements and self-service banking provides a great platform towards this goal,” he adds.</p>
<p>“Other factors driving the trend include the increased need for transparency, end-to-end visibility and information on straight through processing for transactions, as well as the demand for unified banking access as more corporates adopt a more centralised cash management model via shared services centres and treasury centres.”</p>
<h3 id="which-services">Which services?</h3>
<p>As Dugar points out, there are some key differences between corporate and retail banking which may affect the development of self-service offerings. “For one, clearly corporates and retail differ significantly in both volume and type of transactions,” he says. “Also, there is a large number of unbanked retail clients across Asia Pacific, particularly in the developing markets, which contributes to a difference in channels and requirements.”</p>
<p>So what does self-service actually include? “Some things are obvious, like how can I click into a transaction and see the details,” says ANZ’s Stuckey. “In other cases, it’s about asking whether things are really intuitive to customers, not just to the bank. It’s also important to ask how many clicks it takes to get through a process and whether people stop before getting the information they wanted.”</p>
<p>Dugar says that he sees three types of self-service model emerging: robust real-time decision-making support through analytics and decision-making tools, superior front-end platform for information flow and visibility of transaction and the development of search and investigation modules to digitise query resolution.</p>
<p>Where J.P. Morgan is concerned, Dugar says the bank is continuing to invest heavily to provide innovative solutions for its clients. “As a leader in cash management technology and the digitisation of treasury solutions, we are very active in providing self-service banking solutions,” he says, explaining that the bank’s key offering in this space is the J.P. Morgan ACCESS Online portal which “integrates the services needed to manage cash balances, liquidity structures, daily transactions and information, instantly.”</p>
<p>Dugar adds that as well as being accessible on mobile, the platform also houses the banks new virtual branch solution which was launched in India in 2015 and which has since gone live in Indonesia, Thailand and China. The virtual branches remove the need for physical visits to traditional bank branches and reduce manual intervention. The platform comprises a suite of banking services that can be accessed from desktops and mobile devices, including digital document submission, initiating and approving transactions online and visibility over cross-border transactions.</p>
<h3 id="tearing-up-paper">Tearing up paper</h3>
<p>Damian Glendinning, Treasurer at Lenovo, argues that when discussing these developments, a key question is why paper continues to be used in banking transactions. “Here, we come to an unresolved problem which is, frankly, shameful: the continued use of paper in corporate banking,” he says. “For trade transactions (letters of credit, in particular), we continue to use paper. For know your customer (KYC), paper is, again, often required.”</p>
<p>According to Glendinning, this is often the case because country legislation often does not provide a sufficiently clear legal environment for the use of electronic documents. “Unfortunately, it is also often due to the conservatism of many treasurers,” he observes. “In many emerging markets, another obstacle is often the requirement for a paper receipt or chop, which is often driven by the tax system.”</p>
<p>Glendinning adds, “the sooner we can all get off this addiction to a medium which is not only less efficient, but also less secure, the better.” He notes that banks have made the effort to go electronic in consumer banking “because the economics of doing so are overwhelming: it clearly makes no sense to employ staff to carry out a high volume of low value transactions.” However, in the corporate space the economics are different. “The average value of each transaction is significantly higher, so the overhead of using people and paper is much smaller as a percentage – and the tendency of the client to demand a personalised service is much higher.”</p>
<p>That said, banks are taking steps to get paper out of the system. As Stuckey explains, in order for banks to provide a proper self-service experience they first need to lay the groundwork. “The work that banks have been doing with their core systems – plus building out XML and adopting APIs – means that systems are starting to connect together better,” she says.</p>
<p>According to Stuckey, an important element of this is dematerialisation. Whereas in the past there has been a push to get people off paper and onto online systems, this is becoming more structured: “In our business we are very systematically going through and finding out where the paper is, why it is used and whether it needs to be there.”</p>
<p>However, sometime this requires a certain amount of rewiring. Stuckey points out that banks may need to address not only legacy systems but also legacy regulations. “In one case, where we want to remove some paper that our clients fundamentally have told us they don’t want, regulations require us to send it. It’s about trying to work back and find out how to get that portion of the regulation or the payment code changed.”</p>
<h3 id="barriers-to-adoption">Barriers to adoption</h3>
<p>While self-service banking may have much to offer corporate clients, there are also some factors which may hinder development and uptake. David Blair, an independent treasury consultant based in Singapore, points out that self-service can be limited by KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) concerns, although he thinks this is “over done” in many cases. “Once the legal entity is known and verified, why not allow self-service for opening new accounts?” he asks.</p>
<p>Blair adds that cross-branch consistency is another issue: “To enable meaningful self-service for multinational corporations requires a consistent back end across bank branches, which is not common in today’s banks.” And he notes that corporates need to be comfortable with the internal control implications of self-service, with many effectively relying on banks’ manual procedures in order to enforce their corporate policies.</p>
<p>According to Blair, other possible obstacles include the opacity of bank pricing. “If complex products are available on self-service platforms, banks will have to show some kind of pricing,” he explains. “Since banks like to be very creative in their pricing, this will be a quandary for them.” He also points out that in some cases, banks may feel the set-up of more complex products cannot safely be left to users.</p>
<p>At the same time, regulatory considerations may hinder development in this area. “From a regulatory perspective, some markets like China, Thailand and Malaysia still require physical documents for certain transactions, creating challenges for self-service banking which by definition should allow users to perform banking transactions whenever they like,” says J.P. Morgan’s Dugar. “Also, certain general banking services like direct debit transaction and account opening still require wet signatures.”</p>
<p>Transparency is another possible concern. Dugar points out that the clearing infrastructure doesn’t always capture all the information about an underlying transaction, which can result in challenges in terms of straight through reconciliation.</p>
<p>However, these issues may not be insurmountable. For one thing, regulatory initiatives in some markets may help to transform the cash management industry. “China, for instance, has introduced new rules for electronic submission of supporting documents for foreign currency cross-border merchandise transactions,” says Dugar. “India, meanwhile, has moved to digitise certain sections of its cross-border payments infrastructure.”</p>
<p>In addition, Dugar notes that initiatives such as SWIFT global payments innovation (gpi) will significantly improve the customer experience in cross-border payments by increasing the speed, transparency and end-to-end tracking of payments. “Electronic Bank Account Management, or eBAM, is another solution which seeks to unify banks and digitise account management workflow,” he observes.</p>
<h3 id="the-way-forward">The way forward</h3>
<p>As this area develops, Stuckey points out that it is important to make sure that self-service is actually serving the customer, and not just serving the bank. “I don’t think the two are mutually exclusive,” she adds. “If I’m running a treasury application, I want information when I need it – I don’t want to have to reach out to someone in another system. So it’s convenient for them that I can access the information, and it’s convenient for me.”</p>
<p>As such, the way in which banks display information to customers has evolved over time, with a growing focus on design based thinking. Stuckey notes that in the past, banks tended to create dashboards and fill up all the available space. “Now there is much more of a bite size mentality,” she comments. “I don’t need to see all the payment screen – I may want just the first line, which is balance trends, and I can click in as needed.” This requires banks to have an accurate understanding of how clients use technology and what they want to be able to achieve, rather than providing more information for information’s sake, and more than people can feasibly digest.</p>
<p>While there are a number of obstacles to overcome, the benefits of self-service banking are considerable – and more is to come. Dugar predicts that this area will become increasingly sophisticated as digitisation continues to transform the cash management industry and platforms become more mobile.</p>
<p>“Corporates will start behaving like consumers, expecting real time information at their fingertips, and banks will have to continuously innovate to meet their needs,” he says. “The use of emerging technologies like blockchain, which increases transparency, is expected to boost the adoption of self-service banking.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is also important to be aware that self-service has its limits: the complexity of certain products and services means there will always come a point at which the need for human interaction becomes essential. As Stuckey points out, “if I’m doing a simple transaction I’m very happy with a chatbot, but if I’m doing something more complex I probably want to talk to a human.”</p>
<p>The goal, then, is to achieve the right balance. “It’s important to highlight that even as self-service banking reduces the need for physical interaction, face to face communication remains critical in maintaining client relationships,” Dugar concludes. “The key would be to maintain the right balance of digital versus in-person interaction.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>With more to do and with fewer resources available, treasury professionals increasingly lack the time and patience to deal with clunky and inefficient banking services and systems, and are calling for a better user experience. But are the banks listening and what comprises a ‘good’ user experience? Treasury Today finds out.</em></p>
<p>Apple founder Steve Jobs had a simple philosophy towards product design: start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology – not the other way around. It is a philosophy that continues to influence every product that the company produces and is arguably one of the biggest factors in Apple’s success.</p>
<p>Although simple, Jobs’ philosophy was pioneering. Until then, companies had typically designed products they thought people needed with very little customer input until the very late stages of production. Jobs’ thinking not only brought success but also inspired a whole new generation of innovators who have looked to follow Jobs’ example, designing products and solutions that provide an excellent user experience.</p>
<h3 id="in-perspective-user-experience">In perspective: user experience</h3>
<p>User experience is a very broad concept and definitions will vary depending on who you speak to. The Nielsen Norman Group provides a succinct summary: “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”</p>
<p>Alberts Pumpurs, Partner at the UX Design Agency, expands on this definition, saying that companies who provide a good user experience are those that enable “the customer to meet its objectives in a straightforward and efficient manner”. To provide an example, Uber has revolutionised the taxi business, not only by allowing anyone to be a driver but by enabling customers to easily order a taxi, track its progress and pay for it automatically at the end of the ride. The user experience provided by Uber is better than calling a taxi office and waiting for the car without any knowledge about its status.</p>
<p>Companies that provide a great user experience will typically also offer an intuitive user interface – the platform with which the customer interacts. Uber’s app is intuitive and clearly provides its users with all the information they require.</p>
<p>User experience is not a modern concept. Pumpurs explains that companies have “unconsciously” always been looking to improve user experience, typically through the development of better user interfaces. The science behind it, however, only began to take shape in the 1950s with the publication of American industrial designer, Henry Dreyfuss’ book, Designing for People. In his book, Dreyfuss wrote: “When the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction, then the industrial designer has failed.” But only in the past 20 years have these concepts attained a new impetus.</p>
<p>Indeed, for Pumpurs, the need for all businesses to focus on user experience has only become more important with digital start-ups embracing these concepts and challenging ‘traditional’ companies. “To make themselves stand out in a well-entrenched and highly competitive market they have to make their services useful, intuitive and fast,” he says.</p>
<p>This is especially true in finance, where the proliferation of fintech has saturated an already well-populated market. In the payments space (which we look at in more detail in the <a href="/2017/03/the-payment-revolutions-ttia">Insight &amp; Analysis article</a>), for instance, well-known fintechs such as PayPal and Alipay now offer their users the ability to make payments quickly and easily. With Alipay and PayPal’s registered users numbering 400m and 197m respectively, these services are significantly disintermediating financial incumbents. In response, banks have invested heavily in their own user experience in an effort to retain and deepen their customer relationships – especially in the retail space.</p>
<h3 id="the-corporate-view">The corporate view</h3>
<p>But what about in the corporate space? Are banks and treasury technology vendors keeping up with the pace of change? The corporate treasurers consulted by Treasury Today suggest that there has been some improvement, but that there is also still some way to go.</p>
<p>Damian Glendinning, Treasurer of Lenovo, called out the banking community on the user experience it offers when speaking at a panel moderated by Treasury Today at Sibos in 2015. Glendinning pointed out that he used a better online banking portal as a consumer than he did as the corporate treasurer of a multinational corporation.</p>
<p>This point was recently seconded by Cale Bennett, Group Treasurer at Tatts. “In Australia, the user experience offered by the banks in the consumer space is fantastic,” he says. “But very little of this development has flowed through to the institutional space yet.”</p>
<p>In the United States, Guillermo Gualino, Vice President and Treasurer at Agilent Technologies, has similar comments. “In general, corporate banking systems are not easy to use,” he says. “I believe this is because each bank wants to be ahead of the competition so they will over-feature their online portals in an effort to stay ahead, with little thought about the user experience. As a result, they become more complicated and thus less attractive to use, despite the new functionality.”</p>
<p>Referencing Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who said in 1994 that in the future people will need banking and not banks, Gualino says that banking portals are simply a tool used by treasurers to do something. “We want to get in, make the trade and then get out again,” he says. “It should be simple and efficient – and if it looks nice as well then that is a bonus.”</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-complexity">Overcoming complexity</h3>
<p>There are a variety of reasons why the user experience provided by commercial banks is lagging behind the retail space. As Susan Feinberg, Senior Analyst at Celent, who recently conducted a study in this area, explains: “Commercial banking is far more complex with much more functionality that needs to be delivered. Commercial banks have therefore traditionally been much more focused on functionality rather than user experience.”</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the rise of fintech has highlighted how banks could provide a better user experience. But Morgan McKenney, Head of Core Cash Management at Citi, says that that size of balances and the value of transactions in banking for corporates mean that security is paramount. “Although treasurers are calling for a better experience when working with banks, they are still primarily concerned with the security of the firm’s money and information,” she says. “To offer both security and world-class user experiences each requires a lot of time and resources, which may mean rebalancing priorities sometimes.”</p>
<p>Banks are also hamstrung by myriad legacy technology, further impeding their ability to improve user experience rapidly. “Commercial banks offer a vast number of products,” says James Haycock, Managing Director at Adaptive Lab. “Over time as new products have been introduced or existing ones have evolved the systems have become increasingly complex. Just keeping up with compliance related changes consumes the vast proportion of budgets and that’s before any investments in innovation.”</p>
<p>It is not just legacy technology that Haycock sees impeding the banks. “While banks are experiencing greater cost pressure, most remain profitable so there’s not a great incentive to change. This means many are doing things the way they always have. They’re very product centric rather than customer centric for one. I think this surfaces itself in how they go about improving or designing products with design still often seen as an activity taking place later in the process rather than from the beginning where it can have the greatest impact.”</p>
<p>Haycock believes the operating model of banks further impedes innovation. “Banks operate in silos: which is evident when you call them or in the digital experience you have,” he says. “Digital is still seen by many as a channel when actually it’s a lot more than that. Until banks more seriously reconsider their approach to the design, delivery and improvement of experiences this problem will continue to be exacerbated.”</p>
<h3 id="innovation-in-action">Innovation in action</h3>
<p>Indeed, it is realigning the bank’s different business lines and removing silos behind the scenes that is perhaps key in their efforts to offer a greater experience to their clients. As Citi’s McKenney details: “Providing a great experience to our clients goes way beyond developing a digital platform that is easy for treasurers to use. It is also about looking at the end-to-end process flow within the bank and how efficient this is. You may have a great looking internet portal, but our clients ultimately are impacted by a bank’s full end-to-end processes.</p>
<p>McKenney explains that in essence every step the bank takes is designed to improve the user experience it offers its clients. Such steps include removing paper from processes, providing single access to applications and simply making the answers to frequently asked questions available online – saving clients the time and effort involved in contacting a call centre. “These may sound like small changes and fairly straightforward, but the bank has had to take a conscious effort to take these steps,” she says.</p>




<h3 id="spotlight-on-tmss">Spotlight on TMSs</h3>
<p>Banking portals are, of course, not the only treasury technology used by corporate treasury professionals. For many, a treasury management system (TMS) is the dominant tool. Here Bob Stark, VP of Strategy, Kyriba talks about the user experience in the TMS space.</p>
<p>“Corporate clients want easy-to-use software that doesn’t require a user manual to figure it out,” says Stark. In his view, this is important for two reasons. “Firstly, a unique characteristic of TMSs, compared to other types of software applications, is that the core TMS users are using the software the entire day.”</p>
<p>Stark also notes that TMSs also have a large number of users that log in infrequently – perhaps once or twice a month. “This presents a different set of challenges,” he says. “The system not only needs to be easy to navigate, but it also needs to be intuitive and tailored to their exact needs so they’re not fighting to remember how things work given their infrequent usage.”</p>
<h4 id="fit-for-purpose">Fit for purpose?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, TMS providers haven’t always been the best at providing a good experience to their clients. “There are too many poorly designed treasury management systems in the market that have passed into obsolescence,” says Stark. “The problem in this space is that some vendors are unable or unwilling to evolve their treasury software.”</p>
<p>The consolidation of the market is noted as a key reason for this. “We see this most often with treasury systems that have been acquired, or with those vendors that are looking for an exit strategy,” adds Stark.</p>
<h4 id="client-demands">Client demands</h4>
<p>In conversations with its clients, Kyriba has found that offering personalisation is crucial to delivering a good experience, enabling treasurers to organise their treasury workflow. “Our system allows users to build maps guiding what they want to do in the system and how to navigate to those screens, reports, and processes with a single touchpoint,” notes Stark. “This is important because of the balance needed to support core users and less frequent users of the system.”</p>



<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Citi is, of course, also focusing on the front end. “If we do all this work in the back end and then offer our clients a clunky and complicated online and mobile banking portal then we will still not provide a good experience,” says McKenney. The bank has therefore employed user experience professionals in its innovation labs to work with clients for their feedback to design intuitive online experiences.</p>
<p>“When we redesigned our online portal, we brought in clients and used eye tracking software to understand how they interacted with our products in great detail,” she says. “This insight has enabled us to design our products to be as intuitive as possible for our clients.”</p>
<p>Customisation is also important and Mckenney notes how the bank has built its online portals using widgets (micro apps that can be moved around the screen) to allow individual users to get the information they need quickly. “In doing this, accessing an account balance that might have taken ten clicks is now available straight away on the homepage.”</p>
<h3 id="an-important-future">An important future</h3>
<p>Citi is just one of many banks looking at this area. As development continues, user experience may become a key differentiator for corporates – especially as banking products become more commoditised. “We are already seeing retail customers switch banks to those that offer a superior user experience and why should a treasurer have an experience sub-par to what they’re used to in every other aspect of their job,” says Adaptive Lab’s Haycock. “Customer experience presents a great opportunity to differentiate, give the client more of their time back but ultimately help maintain and deepen the relationship that a bank has with their corporate clients.”</p>
<p>It is a point agreed upon by the UX Design Agency’s Pumpurs: “Focusing on user experience shows that the bank is thinking about its customers and will foster loyalty,” he says. “Transaction banking is ultimately a relationship business and banking portals have, for the most part, replaced people as the main point of contact between client and bank. It is vital then that this enables treasurers to do what they need to do quickly and easily and provides them with all the information they need.”</p>
<p>Celent’s Feinberg is keen to point out that it will be more than simply user experience that informs corporate decision making when selecting banking partners. “The bank still needs to provide a high-quality service behind these channels and offer products and services that save the corporate time and money,” she says. “Availability of credit and the relationship manager will also remain important factors.”</p>
<p>That being said, user experience will continue to increase in importance for corporate treasurers as the user experience provided by companies outside of the treasury raises their expectations. Ultimately, a bank providing a good user experience will enable treasurers to perform better. As Agilent’s Gualino concludes: “User experience is a big part of our decision-making because if the team is able to perform the tasks required in these portals quickly and efficiently, then they are able to spend more time on value-adding, strategic activities.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><img alt="Jose Franco" height="150" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/2017-03-04-tt-15-qa-jose-franco-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=DFC994D7DC7D2CBC3CB94B7EBFF0228B" width="100"/></p>
<h5 id="jose-franco-jp-morgan">Jose Franco, EMEA Product Executive, Treasury Services, J.P. Morgan:</h5>
<p>Technology innovation is reshaping financial services. As a result, the value proposition for payments is expanding and evolving. Banks are transforming how they engage with companies, what solutions and services they deliver, and how they deliver them. The expanded value proposition is helping corporate treasurers provide a new level of value and bottom line impact.</p>
<p>Big Data is critical to this. Technology enables banking partners today to analyse vast amounts of data aggregated from across diverse sources, synthesise the data, identify patterns, and distill meaning to support corporate treasurers with actionable insights. Data intelligence can enhance tactical and strategic execution and when used effectively, will drive improvement in the underlying business model.</p>
<p>Getting better visibility on cash flows is one well-known aim of digitisation but, importantly, new digital payments channels for consumers such as e-commerce and mobile are offering treasurers the opportunity to get far richer insights. Treasury will have greater and timelier access to vast quantities of data and more importantly, a deeper understanding of what that data means.</p>
<p>This data will allow treasurers to become much more strategic in creating actionable insights for their business. One example is delivering better forecasting on a real-time basis as the timeliness of payments and collections improves, with “track and trace” expanding the visibility of payments and collections. In the card space, mining spend data obtained from the business can be married with payments data obtained from your department or bank to surface insights that can be used to develop compelling offers for cardholders that will increase loyalty and revenues.</p>
<h5>Some practical applications of Big Data include:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>KPIs</h5>
<p>Corporate treasurers get a lot out of peer and performance benchmarking. This can include points of efficiency such as a comparison of a company to industry STP rates or average transaction costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Fraud detection</h5>
<p>Identification of unusual activity or patterns can help to uncover and prevent fraud attempts. This has tremendous value in an environment of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Analysis and working with banking partners</h5>
<p>Payment processing, managing idle balances and overdrafts, transaction costs and FX exposures are just a few of the many areas of information that can yield intelligence to improve treasury practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Building for Big Data means building for flexibility and future needs. It is important to consider the value of data points, the frequency, format and application. The data itself also needs to achieve a specific treasury objective, which remains focused on maximising shareholder value by optimising capital efficiency and managing liquidity, currency and economic risks.</p>
<img alt="Olle Malmgren" height="150" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/2017-03-04-tt-15-qa-olle-malmgren-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=616E16F9E54282A638597D94AF174E8C" width="100"/> 
<h5 id="olle-malmgren-standard-chartered">Olle Malmgren, Executive Director, Treasury Solutions Americas, Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered:</h5>
<p>Corporates generate and store huge amounts of data about their business flows and it is increasing exponentially. This data comprises everything from structured data in databases to unstructured data such as video and pictures.</p>
<p>The challenge in the past has been the ability to process large volumes of data from multiple sources quickly for timely informed decision-making. However, a huge reduction in data storage costs, powerful analytical tools and artificial intelligence is making it possible to not only mine huge pools of internal and external data but to also define cause/effect relationships across elongated business processes which involve multiple business functions and internal/external stakeholders.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas where the treasury could benefit from more timely, accurate and comprehensive data, especially when artificial intelligence is added, such as behavioural analytics</p>
<p>The most obvious area would be forecasting, where more accurate information about payments and receipts in near real-time would significantly help the treasurer to plan funding and exposure management.</p>
<p>Big Data could also combine the data from both the financial as well as the physical supply chain, giving the treasury a whole new dimension of information. This, in turn, could help in the cooperation between treasury, procurement and sales so that the treasury evolves from just managing the funding needs and exposures created by the business to proactively working together with them to optimise these functions.</p>
<p>Treasury can work with the supply chain organisation to optimise working capital management by using Big Data to increase visibility across the supply chain. It can help the supply chain organisation to optimise procurement, inventory management and distribution based on real-time supply chain information.</p>
<p>For example, treasury can proactively manage expected bottlenecks in working capital to speed up the release of goods to distributors/buyers or provide additional finance to suppliers who need additional working capital to increase production of critical components/products. Of equal importance, the impact on sales revenue or time to market can be quantified and measured in terms of ROE on the additional capital deployed.</p>
<p>The supply chain organisation can also more quickly respond to changing demand levels, reducing the days of inventory outstanding (DIO) and improving the cash conversion cycle (CCC).</p>
<p>Other areas where Big Data could add value is on counterparty risk management, where behavioural analysis could help the corporate to detect buyers that might become bad credit risks. Today’s tools are capable of relating subtle changes to buying and payment patterns to increased levels of financial stress or default.</p>
<p>Big Data has also been used to detect fraud in the business. This can be fake invoices for example that data analyses comparing income with liquidity could detect.</p>
<p>In general, Big Data can deliver better trend analysis since the mix, breadth and amount of both real-time and historical data that can be covered is much greater than a TMS can cover.</p>
<p>In order to become part of any business-wide Big Data initiatives, treasury must clearly define the outcomes they wish to achieve from the process and what data is needed in order to achieve expected results. The list could include; expected information, reason for the report, benefit of knowing what data should it be using, output format, accessibility and priority.</p>
<p>It is also important to make sure the data storage, analysis and sharing is fulfilling ethical and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Big Data could well be the enabler that will allow treasury to become the truly strategic business partner that so many treasurers aspire to.</p>
<img alt="Steffen Diel" height="150" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/2017-03-04-tt-15-qa-steffen-diel-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=C8BFECF4EEDDF776043C8635707F835B" width="100"/> 
<h5 id="steffen-diel-sap">Steffen Diel, Head of Treasury, SAP:</h5>
<p>Leveraging Big Data can add significant value to treasury departments, but there are numerous challenges to unleashing its power. In a volatile environment, treasurers need broad insight – historic, predictive and real-time – to take appropriate decisions. However, the structured storage, access to and analysis of large amounts of data from a vast number of sources present technological obstacles that need to be overcome before one can explore new opportunities.</p>
<p>In treasury, we are consuming all kinds of structured data from various data sources, not limited to a single system environment. Information is derived from ERP, a treasury management system, a Business Warehouse, FX Trading Platforms, eBanking systems and many other specialised systems. Every application has its own structure of data and that makes it difficult to create a single source of data that one can analyse for smarter and faster decision-making.</p>
<p>Moreover, we might want to add the analysis of unstructured data to our current approach that relies on structured data like forward rates or GDP and unemployment rates. So, the question is, what is the technological foundation for a valuable use of Big Data?</p>
<p>SAP has created the HANA Platform which is based on in-memory technology. Bringing together transactional and analytical data in one in-memory database enables a very fast data insight and on-the-fly scenario analysis. The platform also acts as a data warehouse, integrating data from a wide variety of sources that may come from inside the company or outside.</p>
<p>Based on such a platform, treasury can achieve better control and visibility over the entire treasury-related value chain. The data consumed can be expanded to the complete portfolio of company data and external data can equally be added to the analysis. This combination is instrumental to help manage the exposure of a company and to enable new dimensions of business insights such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cash management – improving cash flow forecasting by leveraging historical data in combination with actuals and planning data resulting from various sources to improve forecasting accuracy. As an additional element, payment and buying behaviour can be added in order to perform predictive planning and ‘what if’ scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of unstructured data derived from social media can be used as trend or early warning indicators for market developments, eg currency movements. Analysis of unstructured data received from information providers can be combined with structured data, eg counterparty risk management, to allow for a more comprehensive picture of what is happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of patterns where business data correlates to certain financial outcomes, ie country-specific data that correlates with the development of days sales outstanding (DSO).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Without technology the world of treasury would be very different. It would be a lot more labour-intensive, that is certain. But what else is modern technology doing for today’s treasurer – and more importantly what will it be doing tomorrow?</em></p>
<p>Let’s start with a few choice numbers. In a recent survey of more than 600 global finance professionals from a range of sectors, sizes and regions, lack of budget was cited as the number one hold-up for 43% of respondents when it comes to full-on treasury transformation projects and for 61% when seeking a simple adoption of new technology. It looks like treasurers know technology is good for them but sometimes the business case just does not seem to persuade the board to release the funds.</p>
<p>Certainly, technology delivers operational efficiencies and enables treasurers to add value to other functions. It does so in part by providing analysis and reporting capabilities with the kind of depth, speed and accuracy that simple spreadsheets will never quite achieve. Even with this obvious advantage, treasury technology ‘spend’ suffers from the kind of roadblock that seems to mark it down as a ‘nice to have’ rather than a necessity.</p>
<p>Despite the grumbles about technology budget, the study (carried out by the consultancy, Treasury Strategies, and technology vendor, Reval) revealed that centralised structures are most prevalent. Some 46% of the survey sample claimed to have adopted this model. It is as well then, given the demands that such structures place on visibility and data management, that the most commonly used technology platform is the TMS (49% saying they own one). However, only 10% have access to an ERP for treasury duties and 27% still rely on spreadsheets (mostly in the mid-market segment).</p>
<p>The survey may have some vendor bias in terms of what questions it asked and how it asked them, but the report is still meaningful because it quantifies the responses of many treasury professionals. It presents a simple ‘structure versus risk’ conundrum for readers and unsurprisingly the top three strategic challenges (other than obvious regulatory hurdles such as Basel III or Dodd-Frank/EMIR) are cash forecasting (65%), cash visibility (59%) and risk management (47%). Drilling down into the risk perspective further shows that the biggest treasury worry is cash and liquidity risk (79%). This is followed by FX (66%), with counterparty risk, mid to long-term funding risk and interest rate risk reaching over 40% a piece. Commodity risk picks up the rear with 20%.</p>
<p>The bottom line of this analysis is that treasurers know what troubles them and even what can help resolve these issues but the fix – in the form of technology – is not always forthcoming. Despite the advantages that a meticulously selected and properly implemented treasury technology solution can afford its users, such challenges are still managed, in the main, by reviewing policies, processes and structures (a practice cited by 73%). Management by undertaking a review of existing technology or by the implementation of a new technology was cited by just 45% and 41% respectively.</p>
<h3 id="bright-future">Bright future</h3>
<p>If these results are anything to go by – and at Treasury Today we hear similar comments and observations on a regular basis – then companies need to understand that treasurers and other finance professionals must be given the right tools for the job if they are to fulfill the expectations of their increasingly strategic roles with the kind of efficiency and effectiveness that can benefit all. Whilst simply throwing money at an issue and expecting it to go away is a mistaken practice, if the adoption of new technology is undertaken with due diligence then the position of treasurer becomes a far more useful proposition for all stakeholders, not least the boardroom.</p>


<blockquote>Things changed when the global financial crisis uncovered many areas of corporate treasury that needed to be smarter – and treasury technology vendors listened and responded with a host of solutions to help.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Todd Yoder, Head of Derivatives &amp; Hedging Strategy and Director of Global Treasury, Fluor Corporation</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>One treasurer who relishes the prospect of a tech-fueled future is Todd Yoder, Head of Derivatives &amp; Hedging Strategy and Director of Global Treasury at Fluor Corporation, a multinational engineering and construction firm. He believes that “now is the most exciting time for corporate treasury in history”. What’s more, he feels it is only going to get better. “Things changed when the global financial crisis uncovered many areas of corporate treasury that needed to be smarter – and treasury technology vendors listened and responded with a host of solutions to help,” he explains. “The rapid provider-consolidations seem to be behind us, and new providers are investing and building some great solutions.”</p>




<h3 id="strong-providers">Strong providers</h3>
<p>The adoption of strong technology presupposes that the banks and vendors actually have the right technologies to offer. To this point, Stark (a vendor) argues that “banks do an excellent job of meeting their clients’ expectations to support bank services online”. Treasury technology vendors, he feels, “complement bank offerings and these providers generally develop functionality that fits the needs of their target markets”. A partisan comment maybe, but the opportunity for treasury technology providers – bank and vendor – is to envision what corporate treasurers will require in, say, five years’ time and then deliver it – and then keep delivering. This, after all, is their business and failure to deliver puts them in a precarious commercial position (especially with industry consolidation still on the cards). The convergence of cash management, working capital and the supply chain is a great example of how treasury is gaining strategic importance and, states Stark, “it is up to treasury technology to ensure the solutions are ready for these evolving needs”.</p>
<p>However, treasurers do have significant influence on the product roadmaps of treasury technology providers. Leveraging social media and collaboration tools, for example, gives treasurers a greater combined voice that makes it very easy for their technology partners to understand the priorities of their client base. Any treasury technology provider that cares about growing with their clients will use these inputs, along with structured client advisory boards and user groups, to ensure that client needs drive a significant portion of the product roadmap (there is an element of pure commercial interest here too of course).</p>
<p>With this in mind, a lot has been done just in the past five years in terms of treasury technology development, says Yoder. He believes that there will continue to be advancement in a variety of areas including risk analytics and visualisation, bank account management, improved integration of core systems, standardisation in formats (especially around ISO 20022), treasury compliance, and ultimately treasury being able to work more creatively with a variety of business functions across the organisation. “I think the providers doing well in this space today are where they are because they have listened and been adaptive to the needs of corporate treasury, legislation and market trends – and I see this trend continuing.”</p>
<p>But there is one area of new technology that has risen so far up the agenda in the past year that anyone would be forgiven for believing it was not only the remedy for all commercial misfortunes, but also that it was already in active service.</p>



<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="understanding-what-you-already-have">Understanding what you already have</h3>
<p>The vendor viewpoint, framed by exposure to many different client scenarios, is slightly more circumspect. “In treasury we still see a technology paradigm shift happening between the old legacy tools and the new cloud technology,” notes Phil Pettinato, Chief Technology Officer at Reval. He notes that some companies are still struggling with disparate systems. They are using spreadsheets “in ways that they really weren’t intended to be used – as operating applications rather than analytical tools”. And although he notes a gradual shift from installed to cloud “some of that shift seems to be towards ASP which is just cloud hosting of legacy software”. This leaves treasurers with systems that do not necessarily communicate well, let alone provide a global platform to assist growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Fluor Corporation may be amongst the eager exceptions but the status quo “still leaves a lot to be desired for many corporates,” comments Pettinato. He does however accept that where systems are operationally embedded it is tough to disrupt that setup. “It’s difficult to be innovative when you’re stuck with old tools and old ways,” he comments. But he offers a cautionary note that when yielding to the temptation to force innovation in such an environment “you don’t get much of a return”. If, however, the technological environment is replaced with state-of-the-art technology to begin with, he believes it creates a virtuous circle of innovation, which helps to explain Yoder’s positive outlook.</p>
<p>For those stuck in a technological rut, it may even feel like a classic Catch 22 – progress has to be made in order to make progress. But maybe this is more of an excuse than a reason, when what is really needed is one bold step forward to set progress in motion. Whilst some organisations are focused on improving the efficiency of existing cash and treasury processes, driving a limited appetite for treasury automation and integration, other organisations are pushing the boat out more and seeking ways to transform their treasury operations into what Pettinato calls “value centres”. These treasurers already see technology as an enabler to achieve their vision and are constantly pushing their boardrooms and the technology providers to deliver the features to drive this change. This, for Pettinato, is evidence of quite a bright light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>But in the quest for optimum performance, simply throwing money at the problem is not necessarily the right approach. From Yoder’s perspective, achieving such a goal is not so much about the use of a specific treasury technology per se but instead harnessing the capabilities and connectivity of the systems used. “In general, IT time is getting harder to find, so how efficiently and easily systems plug in is important to ensure optimum performance.”</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the great levellers in today’s technology space has been the advent of cloud storage and delivery. As Pettinato mentions above, the term is something of a catch-all for any system or application delivered from a remote server where the vendor typically takes the responsibility for its management. Notwithstanding nuanced explanations of what it is, or is not, Bob Stark, VP Strategy, at technology vendor Kyriba, estimates that approximately half of treasury teams leverage cloud technology in some form. As a result, it is missing out on some key benefits.</p>
<p>Indeed, he argues that the absence of cloud technology increases the risk for fraud, adds unnecessary cost to treasury, increases the need for internal IT resources, and restricts the ability for treasury to implement an effective business continuity plan. This may be true to an extent but it is a fact that many treasurers continue to maintain disparate systems across the treasury function and that these do not automatically integrate with each other. As Stark points out, “this impacts visibility into cash and liquidity, as well as risk exposures”. This of course harks back to the key issues treasurers say they are faced with as brought to light in the survey results revealed above.</p>
<p>With organisations cognisant of the need to be more analytical and critical of their processes, the urge to fix the problem is perhaps now rising up the agenda. Pettinato sees ready acknowledgement by treasurers that today’s cloud systems are capable of meeting the challenge. However, whether it is a TMS, ERP or other core platform that is being considered, engaging with new technology can be viewed as potentially increasing complexity.</p>
<h3 id="maintaining-control">Maintaining control</h3>
<p>The key is to have data sources circulating within the same homogenised environment, if at all possible and to this effect, some organisations attempt to leverage the ERP systems they already have in place. Best-of-breed systems are impressive in themselves but if all data sources flow within an ERP, the fabled ‘single version of the truth’ might seem more probable, says Kevin Grant, Member of the Executive Board at financial software and services firm, Hanse Orga. For him, an ERP gives direct access to a host of functions such as planning, treasury, accounts payable and accounts receivable, and supplier and customer contract management information, all in one location and available the moment it is updated – “even if it manually keyed”.</p>
<p>Digitised data can be used for straight through processing and reporting. Business intelligence (BI) and KPI tools, which also reside with the same ecosystem, may also be auto-populated with this data. From here, it is possible to start building management dashboards to address the issues of the business “in a dynamic and real-time way”, says Grant. This can even be viewable in multiple channels, from smartphone to desktop, and be capable of providing group-level information, with resources to drill down into regional, country and even customer level, offering user-insight into various behaviours that impact the company.</p>
<p>The counterpoint to this singular expression of company financial data is that, system-wise, this is asking for a monolithic structure; it will be complex, hideously expensive to build and operate. Installations of SAP or Oracle, for example, have a reputation for being resource-intensive, and criticism has been levelled at the user-friendliness of such colossal systems.</p>
<p>“But things have changed,” retorts Grant. “None of the ERP vendors have been sitting back, failing to tackle ugly and unfriendly user interfaces; none have spurned real-time reporting,” he states. The change in software user-experience, especially in enterprise software, is something that Pettinato (as a TMS vendor) is also witness to. The shift is driven by the need for business visibility and the need to make optimised decisions. But Pettinato further notes “a human angle” to this, with today’s business software users being much more technologically advanced than before. “In using technology in their private lives it is driving the way they want to use technology in their business lives,” he explains. Mobile devices in particular are now part of mainstream commercial activity, even if many treasurers still feel uncomfortable executing transactions in this way (despite the deployment of multiple control and security methods that make mobile as safe as a PC).</p>
<p>The aim, of course, for best-of-breed or all-in-one is to allow greater transparency, analysis and control over all business processes. But modern solutions (including mobile) also need to allow global process owners, particularly the treasury function, to respond more quickly to ad hoc requests and to meet the increasingly strategic nature of such enquires. If treasurers are then able to proactively provide information to senior management and the board, then the function raises its standing in the organisation. If senior managers can be provided with ‘self-service’ access to that information, and receive it in an easily digestible form (Grant suggests a ‘dashboard’ user-interface), then so much the better for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="know-what-you-want-before-asking-for-it">Know what you want before asking for it</h3>
<p>If the case for a technology upgrade is accepted, Yoder warns that treasurers must be comfortable with what the subsequent implementation looks like, what systems they need and how the systems they select will communicate. In addition, there will be a number of key questions that should be asked of vendors (and of treasurers themselves).</p>
<p>First amongst these should be what their department objectives are and how these sit alongside expectations of treasury by the CFO, CIO, CEO and the board. “Many treasurers miss the opportunity to have strategic influence within their organisation, which corresponds to the requirements they ask of their technology solutions,” says Kyriba’s Stark. Secondly, and from the experience of one who has engaged with many treasury departments in his time, Stark notes that treasurers are often “misaligned” with internal information security policies when they select treasury technology. In the end, this increases internal compliance costs and creates unnecessary security and business continuity exposures. Preparatory work in this respect is vital.</p>
<p>But this technology article is concerned about tomorrow too and when treasurers are probing vendors, Pettinato urges them to ask the right questions about future viability of the technology and of the vendor itself. The treasury fintech space has seen many mergers and acquisitions over the past decade or so and anecdotal evidence suggests that as some of the VC money invested seeks a change of scenery, more consolidation is anticipated over the coming years. But with new, smaller entrants popping up and vying for business, sometimes in new niche areas, Pettinato says it is important that treasurers continue with appropriate due diligence to minimise vendor risk and technology risk, removing any operational liability.</p>
<h3 id="its-new-and-exciting">It’s new and exciting</h3>
<p>Given that treasury technology spend can face a frustrating roadblock when trying to build a business case, talking about new and exciting developments may seem somewhat insensitive. But, as Yoder asserted above, “now is the most exciting time for corporate treasury in history” and familiarisation with new tools of the trade is an essential part of the remit, not least because the right technology is potentially the difference between surviving and thriving.</p>
<p>It is a well-worn statement of fact that corporate treasury has to do more with less. But it is the analytical capabilities of some of the newer solutions that are making this feat possible, says Yoder. “It is one thing to access information, but a system that can quickly create customised actionable reporting is instrumental in running lean and smart,” he explains. In practical terms, he is “personally really excited” about some of the new solutions that allow supply chain, procurement and treasury to work together to optimise cash utilisation “while reducing a host of different risks and strengthening relationships with clients, suppliers and sub-contractors”.</p>
<p>This is clearly technology in action and the convergence of treasury, risk management, and working capital is a strategic direction for corporate finance teams that some vendors are currently committing significant development resources to enable. “Treasurers are increasingly being tasked with expanded responsibilities including financing the supply chain and protecting financial assets from a broader array of internal and external risks,” notes Stark. To stay ahead of the curve, he argues that technology solutions are answering that call and that “sooner rather than later”, treasurers will need to familiarise themselves with solutions that provide future core requirements such as multi-bank supply chain finance, simplified regulatory compliance for derivative accounting, and payment centralisation models such as ERP-to-bank integration. For Pettinato, the key is in finding where any new technology proposal adds value and not just seeing technology as an end in itself.</p>
<p>It may be that some solutions are viewed as just nice to have and that a cogent business case is to be found wanting. “Necessary versus nice to have is a matter of perspective,” says Stark. “For those treasurers that want to be strategic and enable treasury to deliver more value to the organisation, technology that integrates cash, liquidity, risk, and the supply chain is necessary.” As the treasurer of an MNC, Yoder says his business case for new technologies is clean-cut. “If you want to run lean and smart they are necessary. The return on investment is strong, and the protection they provide is invaluable.”</p>
<h3 id="the-great-technological-panacea">The great technological panacea</h3>
<p>So, hands up who has not read or heard something about ‘blockchain’ in the past 12 months. Even if you still don’t understand what it is or does or why it might help treasurers, bankers and frankly just about anyone who transacts electronically, the fact is that blockchain is getting massive amounts of coverage. We know many banks are experimenting with it, trying to find a way of seizing first mover advantage and leaping onto an already pretty packed-out exploratory bandwagon. We know too that financial technology vendors and platform providers – including the mighty Microsoft – are wracking their brains to find a way to exploit the multitude of benefits promised by the concept. Even the Bank of England’s governor, Mark Carney, hinted that it could have a role to play in widening access and improving the resilience of the UK central bank’s real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system and its £500bn of transactions processed each day.</p>
<p>Products are beginning to emerge now, most notably in the trade space. Bolero has an offering based on trade finance documentation as does the DBS/Standard Chartered partnership. And there is an offering from fintech firm, GFT, targeting the movement of physical commodities in the supply chain. But it is early days so the work must continue before useful momentum is achieved.</p>
<p>In a way, this is good news. Not only because something beneficial will eventually come out of all this endeavour but also because when it does, it will have been subjected to so much scrutiny by almost anyone with a passing interest that most if not all of the gremlins will have been ironed out before it starts work. In essence, the weight of expectation generated by the hype, and the sheer determination to make something useful out of it, means that one way or another blockchain will deliver.</p>
<p>Before its adoption in the financial services industry is assured, blockchain has to clear several significant operational and regulatory challenges from its path, suggests a new Standard Chartered report ‘Blockchain – the road to mass adoption’ (part of its ‘Beyond Borders’ series). “When it comes to some aspects of the financial services industry, adoption is still a little way off,” says the report’s author, Margaret Harwood-Jones, Standard Chartered’s Singapore-based Head of Investors and Intermediaries, Transaction Banking. But, she continues, “there is no doubt that blockchain’s real-time characteristic and ability to act as a public ledger of all transactions could revolutionise many parts of financial services, reducing risks and bringing cost savings among other benefits”. These savings, when blockchain is applied to cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory processes, could be in the order of $15bn to $20bn by 2022, according to estimates from the Santander banking group.</p>
<p>Harwood-Jones further argues that the success of blockchain depends on “smooth integration with legacy technologies”. Solutions will face “potentially high costs” if this isn’t achieved. She also raises the spectre of cybercrime, noting that blockchain must prove to the market that it is “at least as secure as existing technologies”. But there is another more prosaic hurdle to overcome. Blockchain is likely to take years to come to fruition “simply because it will require harmonised standards and regulation agreed by the securities services industry, regulators and governments”. The scale of this challenge, comments Harwood-Jones, “should not be underestimated”.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the justifiable caution surrounding the adoption of this ground-breaking approach, it is right that those engaged in the technology sector keep researching and pushing the boundaries of possibility. Even the august institution that is the Bank of England has seen fit to probe its potential, with governor Carney having unveiled a fintech ‘accelerator’ programme to encourage start-ups to come up with practical solutions to financial problems, amongst which will be consideration of the “disruptive potential” of blockchain.</p>
<h3 id="hot-housing-technology">Hot housing technology</h3>
<p>The Bank of England accelerator programme will join established independent players such as Startupbootcamp FinTech and the long-running SWIFT project, Innotribe. These help developers with smart ideas to attract funding and to support and shape their ideas into workable solutions for the modern financial markets.</p>
<p>The Startupbootcamp FinTech programme is funded by industry partners typically with fintech interests (including so-called ‘Angel’ investors) and is augmented by a pool of 200-plus mentors drawn from multiple sectors and geographies. Nektarios Liolios, its Co-founder and CEO, says applicants either come with a piece of technology that needs a business model built around it, or they have a business idea and basic IT concept but need to understand more about the complexity of the technology required. All are about delivery to the broadest sweep of the financial industry and its customers, and even sector-agnostic tools for areas such as cyber-security. “We sit down with them, try to identify the gaps and work with them to fill those gaps.”</p>
<p>The ability to plug those gaps is increasingly important because as complexity grows in the FI and corporate space, so too does the number of potential problem areas. The industry really is in constant need of new solutions – not just a flow of highly visible new consumer payments models but also those less visible to the outside world such as for the capital markets or almost anything back office-related.</p>
<p>The reason banks support accelerator programmes is that often they cannot find or fund development of their own; they want marketable and usable solutions and are prepared to invest in the work of others, but share the risk. A number of banks have ‘innovation labs’ but the problem here is that it can be difficult for new technologies to gain client acceptance. The bank response is to aim for the “lowest common denominator” just to get buy-in (and quicker ROI), says Liolios. As a result, he argues that often “the vision is lacking”. However, if an organisation wants to be a leader and change the way things are done, he believes that projects must be “driven forwards bravely, not put on autopilot”.</p>
<p>In practice, innovation is an active process that must engage with as many ideas as possible to test what works and what doesn’t. The key to success with all innovative thinking, states Liolios, lies in “never being afraid to fail”. This is where experts with new ideas come in, and of course where accelerator programmes and investors with vision take up the mantle of responsibility to get those ideas into the real world and into the working lives of treasurers.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Blockchains are a new solution to a fundamental question in the digital world: how do you establish trust between parties over the internet’s untrusted network? More specifically, how do you get perfect, simultaneous, shared data between a number of different people, devices or businesses?</p>
<p>There are two stages of blockchains, and these impact the financial sector in two distinct ways. The first are cryptocurrencies and the second are blockchain applications. Cryptocurrencies are a new type of asset, currency and value exchange medium. They’re a digital token – secured with cryptography – that can be exchanged in a borderless and completely peer-to-peer way, and managed without need for a bank.</p>
<p>Their relevance to banking institutions is straightforward – the value that goes through cryptocurrency markets could completely circumvent the traditional finance value chain. While their penetration isn’t very high yet, some countries’ central banks are even considering cryptocurrencies as a national standard. Removing banks from this trusted central position requires them to do some real soul-searching and reconsider their value proposition. The most innovative incumbent financial institutions will offer cryptocurrency-based services by absorbing or partnering with service providers like cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets and micropayment services, while responding to challenges of Know Your Customer regulations (KYC) in pseudonymous systems and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) data analysis on blockchains’ new structure.</p>
<p>Blockchain applications are the second wave of blockchain technology, and are based on abstractions of the concept of a blockchain ledger. They address a number of historic challenges in finance. These abstractions are possible using smart contracts, a type of blockchain-enforced code, to define the terms and formats of transactions, and often use cryptocurrencies as the incentive or fuel for the application’s infrastructure. The most basic component of almost every financial service is the transaction, whether it’s of a valuable resource or purely data.</p>
<p>Blockchain applications can lend the power of the data structure’s verifiable history to any number of back office systems and records. The opaque systems that govern settlement and payments, and the challenges of reconciliation between multiple parties can be entirely replaced.</p>
<p>Broadly, the reasons these systems haven’t been updated in the past is one of consensus. Connecting systems from many independent banks to each other scales terribly – each new entrant must connect to each of the myriad existing entrants. Blockchains’ immutability allows the creation of a single shared ledger, for which each institution needs only make one connection to, a smart contract based core which sometimes replaces an old monolith like a traditional clearing house’s systems. Some of the most powerful short-term conceptual proofs being developed are around settlement and clearing, with companies like t0 and SETL offering solutions that would offer uncompromising transparency to audit and regulation.</p>
<p>While there’s still some standardisation yet to take place, institutions like R3’s finance blockchain consortium have demonstrated banks’ willingness to work together towards the common goal of benefiting from this disruptive technology. They have a significant stake in the Hyperledger blockchain protocol being developed by IBM, the Linux Foundation and Digital Asset Holdings amongst others. What’s clear is that participation will be the surest route to setting the agenda and staying at the forefront of blockchain technology’s impact.</p>



<img alt="Charley Cooper, Managing Director, R3" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/technology/emerging-technology/2016-05-06-tt-01-qa-charley-cooper-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=807BF9EC6BA3CAD3B15949476D3A5B58" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;"/>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Distributed ledger technology – often referred to as ‘blockchain’ – has received unprecedented attention of late, with everyone from banks and fund managers to exchanges and clearing houses looking to explore how it could streamline processes, reduce costs and improve accuracy and security. In its simplest form, a shared ledger allows for the distribution, verification and record keeping of transaction information more effectively and quickly in a decentralised manner.</p>
<p>At first glance this might not sound like the most revolutionary of technological developments, but building on the broader concept of a distributed ledger and applying it to global financial markets could have a number of positive impacts on the efficiency, cost and risk issues currently associated with corporate treasury. One example is clearing and settlement of transactions – a topic of keen interest to regulators since the financial crisis.</p>
<p>The Bank of England is just one of a number of regulators around the world that has tasked banks to understand how technologies such as cryptography and distributed ledgers can improve the way financial markets operate. When you consider that some of the infrastructure currently used in many aspects of financial services is over 40 years old, it is not wildly revolutionary to consider the idea that they may no longer be appropriate for modern financial markets.</p>
<p>The potential uses of these technologies for corporate treasurers are vast and could transform how financial transactions are recorded, reconciled and reported – all with additional security, lower error rates and significant cost reductions. Treasurers could benefit from more effective management of cash flow and an immutable record of all financial transactions, allowing for improved risk management and liquidity planning.</p>
<p>R3 was early to recognise the promise of distributed ledger technologies and began working in earnest with financial institutions over a year ago to promote understanding of the opportunity presented by them. We believe that the collaborative model is the best way to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively deliver these new technologies to global financial markets, involving participants from across the industry.</p>
<p>Our consortium members understand that the most critical attribute of the successful adoption of distributed ledger-inspired technologies is a powerful network effect. The networks we ultimately develop will be appropriate to the group of counterparties they seek to connect. Corporate treasurers are an important part of that ecosystem, and our aim is to build solutions with applicability to their work as well as on a broader scale.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>In the wider understanding, the truly transformational aspect of blockchain is the business process transformation (or disruption) it enables. Having all of the counterparties understanding all of the transactions within that value chain – that view being indisputable, immutable, distributed and trusted by all participants – is driving some truly disruptive thinking and potentially has consequences for a lot of the current manual processes that corporates have to deal with. This increased transparency helps alleviate untrusted interaction between counterparties and for the treasurer, there is also the reduction in settlement risk of transactions.</p>
<p>At GFT, we look at tracing assets from asset production through to the delivery of that asset whether that be a financial asset such as a bond or a physical asset such as a commodity. Understanding where treasury’s assets are located and who owns them will allow the department to operate in a more streamlined way. GFT produced a prototype which allows just this – to track commodities, and provide history of that ownership and location. Advantages could include: fraud avoidance, de-risking of warehouse receipt financing, a reduction in paperwork and increased visibility in the supply chain.</p>
<p>Following this prototype, a lot of our clients were coming to us with different use cases which they felt were relevant for development within a blockchain ecosystem. We feel that some of these would be better served by automation or transformation within a traditional technology such as a shared relational database. Therefore we enhanced Project Jupiter to include a set of quality metrics that allow our clients to identify the right use cases to develop within a blockchain ecosystem and then give them an advisory and technology execution platform for rapidly prototyping those.</p>
<p>GFT has a team of technology and business change experts that can assess the use cases and if they are relevant, send them through our prototyping process so they can quickly, in terms of time to market, see how that would transpose into a blockchain prototype. A ‘blockchain incubator’, if you like. It’s quite early days but some of them are moving through at the moment – there are possibilities around Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and the bond issuance, for instance.</p>
<p>If you take a bond issued by a corporate, the transparency that is delivered by understanding the location of that bond and who owns it will help negate a lot of manual process that currently exists when paying coupons. If you move along the value chain to bond collateralisation ultimately having an indisputable, immutable, distributed and trusted view by all participants of bond location and ownership, will help improve the collateralisation process.</p>
<p>We feel at this stage that asset tracking, servicing and ownership is a good focus for blockchain use cases. We are also beginning to explore uses cases that include a cryptocurrency to transfer value within a private blockchain when the transfer of ownership takes place. Combining both asset tracking and a cyptocurrency for value transfer will ultimately deliver many of the visionary benefits that we believe blockchain has the capability to deliver. The important thing to remember is that although the technology is developing rapidly, it isn’t in all instances fully fit for purpose for large corporates yet.</p>

<p><em>If you take a quick look around you, it is likely that a smartphone or tablet computer won’t be far away.

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Developments that offer great potential to increase the productivity and improve the flexibility of the treasury function are normally welcomed with open arms. And mobile technology should be no exception, especially in this day and age. “With increased travel commitments and the need to fulfil multiple roles, the ability to manage their company’s transactions – amongst other functions – on a mobile device is going to be invaluable to corporate treasurers,” explains Marie-Caroline Domingo, Head of Client Access for Global Transaction Banking in Asia Pacific, Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>But mobile technology has thus far had somewhat of a mixed reception from treasurers, which many put down to its novelty and intangibility. Completing banking transactions and associated activities on mobile devices in the corporate world is “a relatively new phenomenon for treasurers,” explains Ankit Goel, Treasury Manager at Bharti Airtel.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to the general consumer uptake for mobile banking – which has been impressive, with solutions on offer from all of the major retail banks. These are typically used to complete payments and authorise transfers of small amounts.</p>
<p>In the business world, however, “corporates are dealing with transactions of significant value so a lot of reassurances with respect to security are required,” Goel explains. The result: developments aimed at corporates are inevitably, albeit appropriately, slower.</p>
<h3 id="smart-choice">Smart choice</h3>
<p>The relatively slow adoption of mobile services in the treasury function has not been helped by the lack of available services from banks. Aite Group reported in September 2014 that 63% of global banks are yet to offer corporate mobile banking. “Traditionally, corporate banks have underinvested in digital technology,” says Thomas Zink, Research Manager for IDC Financial Insights. But now that is starting to change.</p>
<p>Deutsche’s Domingo explains how her team have taken time to gather feedback from clients which has been vital in shaping the bank’s mobile developments. “We have adopted a relatively conservative stance in rolling out mobile services because we wanted to ensure, from direct feedback, that any development addressed a problem for our corporate clients and created real efficiency for them.”</p>




<h3 id="emerging-considerations">Emerging considerations</h3>
<p>Unlike desktop computers, mobile devices can bridge a gap created when access to fixed infrastructure is not possible – which is not an uncommon challenge among Asia’s emerging economies. Thankfully, the processing power of tablet computers and smartphones is further increasing and high-speed internet connections continue to improve across Asia. The benefits of which, according to Nidugondi, can be of assistance to consumers at either end of the development spectrum experienced in Asia.</p>
<p>For example, when traditional bricks and mortar banks aren’t financially feasible, how do you reach potential clients that require access to the organised banking services? “For the unbanked or underbanked in emerging markets, you can use innovative mobile methods to reach isolated areas and address the needs of this segment.” Bank representatives from Bank of South Pacific are using tablets to sign up consumers and businesses to financial services in rural areas of Papua New Guinea, for example. Users can then transfer funds and make payments using their mobile phones.</p>
<p>However, as frequently seen in the region, the great disparity between individual nations is problematic for mobile innovation. For instance, Bharti Group’s Goel explains that “Indian banking is highly regulated by Reserve Bank of India; hence major banks are still to come up with mobile banking solutions. It is the MNCs and private Indian banks that have started to offer solutions.”</p>
<p>Based on the different infrastructure and maturity levels of each market, solutions can take different forms but, regardless of the target end-user, “the reality is that, in addition to electronic banking regulation, there are also local outsourcing and local data privacy requirements to comply with,” explains Tony McLauglin, Regional Cash Product Head for Asia Pacific at Citi. Going live with a mobile solution is dependent on compliance and “it’s something we go through market by market.”</p>



<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Similarly, Arafat Sheik Jabbar, Head of CitiDirect Asia Pacific at Citi, explains that by continuously gathering user feedback, Citi has been able to optimise the intuitiveness of their corporate mobile solutions. And, the smart choice in taking time to advance is paying off. According to Srinivas Nidugondi, Head of Mobile Financial Solutions for Mahindra Comviva, “mindsets are changing and corporates are quite excited. Aside from mobile payment solutions being a ‘current’ thing to talk about, a lot of them are beginning to see benefits in this overall way of doing transactions as well.” Sheik Jabbar cites the delivery of time-critical information – such as access to balance information, status updates and alerts – remotely and on demand as an example of how mobile solutions are helping treasurers make informed decisions whilst on-the-go. “Additionally, treasurers are able to translate financial data into global business intelligence with just few taps on their tablet, viewing data globally, by region or country and filter by currency, amount, country in map or chart views.”</p>
<p>Initially, corporate mobile applications were largely informative, providing notifications for the end-user but newer solutions are becoming more interactive and action-orientated. “In Asia, we have seen an increase of functionality being added to the mobile platform,” says Citi’s McLauglin.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-on-the-move">Solutions on the move</h3>
<p>As corporate treasurers grow more comfortable with mobile channels, and the services on offer undergo development, the desire to perform more sophisticated treasury-related tasks via the medium of mobile is increasing. For example, Aite Group’s survey of 45 corporate treasurers in May 2014 revealed that 51% of respondents ranked approving wire payments as ‘important/critical’ and 46% believed initiating wire payments would be ‘nice to have’. According to Zink, “changing corporate client preferences – looking for fast fully-integrated solutions, lean processes, 24/7 access via the web and mobile devices – goes hand in hand with the evolving role of treasurers in modern enterprises.” Treasurers are more accountable for the regulatory compliance and cash positions of their organisations and management ultimately relies on their insights to make the right decisions at the right times.</p>
<p>The treasurer’s traditional role also requires more effective payments mechanisms and accurate cash flow forecasting. This translates into a need for an accurate, real-time and comprehensive view of the liquidity position of an organisation – increasingly on the go, Zink explains. Moreover, further “technological advances like integration with ERP, elimination of hard token login requirement, user friendly applications in a complex multi-entity and multiple accounts banking structure, productivity will definitely improve,” says Goel.</p>
<p>But is such productivity for everybody? For Damian Glendinning, Treasurer at Lenovo, some responsibilities certainly shouldn’t be mobile-based: “Typically, we tend to be formal about the payment approval process. Mobile suggests the tendency to do things on the move – if you’re on the tube home or waiting in a queue – and in my view, that’s not the appropriate environment.</p>
<p>“Payment enablement, however, is very different from passive consultation of bank accounts. If you’re waiting for confirmation of payment, for example, then this can be done in a less formal environment.” KyongSun Kong, Analyst for Asian Financial Services at Celent explains that corporates sometimes prefer face-to-face and formal interactions due to more intricate requirements.</p>
<p>There is some disparity in opinions but certainly, for Zink, greater data analytics and business intelligence capabilities are playing a crucial role in allowing banks to mine large amounts of data increasingly near real-time, while data visualisation and dashboarding makes data more actionable and easier to digest – particularly on mobile devices. Celent’s 2014 survey Mobile Banking in Asia indicated that growth in transaction volume is the top driver encouraging banks to enhance their corporate mobile banking capability.</p>
<h3 id="evolved-security">Evolved security</h3>
<p>Perhaps the largest barrier to adoption remains concerns over security. There is a degree of resistance towards the idea of allowing corporates access to networks over mobile devices. However, the perception that mobile technology is inferior regarding security is reducing as users become better informed. “The same security that exists in the desktop world also exists in the mobile and tablet world,” explains McLauglin. Information is carried using the same bandwidth and, with the exception that a mobile device does not have a fixed IP address, security measures are applied in largely the same way.</p>


<blockquote>As corporate treasurers grow more comfortable with mobile channels, and the services on offer undergo development, the desire to perform more sophisticated treasury-related tasks via the medium of mobile is increasing.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>There is an aspect of joint responsibility where, as Goel explains, “it is important that banks create awareness among the corporates about the security features, data transmission capabilities and authentication mechanisms” but mobile security also depends on the user being receptive to education on safe computing and internet practices. For Nidugondi, “users need to be careful: the weakest link is usually the human. It is a case of educating the user – this is where I believe the adoption curve has been a little slow.”</p>
<h3 id="mobile-dashboard">Mobile dashboard</h3>
<p>Against this backdrop, creating a suitable mobile treasury dashboard or application for corporates inevitably involves a balance between convenience and security. The most frequent solution to achieving this balance is ensuring the levels of security change depending on what the user wants to do. “For example, the user could view a report without a process of authentication but to view balances one level of authentication would be required. To complete a transaction, identification via a touch ID or transaction pin would be necessary,” explains Nidugondi.</p>
<p>In Domingo’s experience, corporate clients generally understand the security mechanisms that have to be in place, accepting the trade-off in terms of what security procedures are required for certain activities. But security should not compromise the user experience. Indeed, collaborative efforts between corporates and solution providers are increasingly commonplace in creating user-friendly yet secure applications. “The key driver behind corporate mobile banking services is the client. Certainly market requirements are putting pressure on banks to deliver increasingly innovative solutions as well but the client’s user-experience is driving developments,” says Domingo.</p>
<p>“You can have all the bells and whistles but if the user experience is bad, then it’s not going to work,” says Nidugondi when describing his own frustration as a user filling in a mobile app registration that required his country code once, only to be asked for the same information again at a later stage. After all, treasury departments are staffed by consumers, and their experience of technology in their personal lives can influence the technology they do or do not introduce into the corporate treasury.</p>
<p>At Deutsche Bank, Domingo explains, they benchmark themselves against what their clients perceive to be a good user experience. “What we know is that client preferences are becoming more and more influenced by the use of online tools outside of the banking industry – social media applications or search engines – and clients are expecting the same ease of use and convenience for their banking applications.”</p>
<h3 id="tapping-into-success">Tapping into success</h3>
<p>Despite certain barriers to the adoption of mobile technology, most believe “the future of mobile banking is bright and strong,” explains Goel.</p>
<p>However, it remains uncertain whether everyone will be willing to adjust their working habits in accordance with mobile developments. The convenience factor, for Glendinning, is limited to general office expenses (such as ordering pizzas to a meeting or arranging for flowers to be delivered) where mobile-enabled credit card accounts are encouraged.</p>
<p>Simply judging by the percentage of corporates still relying solely on desktop methods, persuading them to become avid mobile users could take longer than the banks expect. However, adoption of mobile treasury is predicted to “increase and intensify”, says Zink but “corporate mobile banking is rather characterised by slow evolution than by revolution.”</p>
<p>Arguably, the APAC region is progressively digital, gradually adopting mobile solutions for ubiquitous access to treasury tools. And as technology matures, processing power increases, and data integration deepens, the value for corporates will increase. The true added-value, however, will always come from the skilled corporate treasurer. Ultimately, it is up to them to decide whether and how mobile channels will influence their strategic decision-making going forward.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[


<p><em>The rise of the volatile and decentralised bitcoin has not only seen the term ‘cryptocurrency’ entered into the Oxford English Dictionary, but it has also made headline news and – for some – is seen to be the future of finance. But do cryptocurrencies really have the potential to create such seismic shifts and are corporates aware of their possible application within treasury and the wider financial industry?</em></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Five years ago, British pop star Lilly Allen was offered payment for an online gig through a then obscure and unheard of means – bitcoin. Understandably, the singer rejected the seemingly paltry offer, with no inkling of how popular and valuable the cryptocurrency would become. If Allen had accepted the hundreds of thousands of bitcoins and held them until their December 2013 peak (when each coin was worth $1,240), she could reportedly be six times wealthier than she is today. Such is the benefit of hindsight.</p>
<p>What this story illustrates is that, since its creation in 2009, bitcoin has gone from being a virtually worthless computer algorithm lost in the depths of the internet to being touted as a genuine rival to fiat currencies. And despite there being over a hundred alternatives, bitcoin has become synonymous with the term cryptocurrency. For Gautam Jain, Managing Director and Head of Client Access at Standard Chartered, this is because “bitcoin has ultimately promoted itself better than any other cryptocurrency, it consequently has had the backing and investment, helping it to become the market leader.”</p>
<h3 id="the-bitcoin-lifecycle">The bitcoin lifecycle</h3>
<p>Despite growing mainstream coverage to many, cryptocurrencies remain an area full of jargon and unnecessarily complex concepts – and above all, for many corporates, they seem irrelevant. But before we begin to examine the arguments for and against bitcoin, let’s take a look under the hood of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines a cryptocurrency as ‘a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.’ Unlike traditional fiat currencies that are printed by a central bank, cryptocurrencies are ‘mined’ by individuals and now, more commonly, by specialised mining groups. To mine a cryptocurrency, specialised software and hardware is needed in order to solve complex mathematical algorithms that become increasingly difficult the more coins that are mined. The process is often compared to the mining of commodities, such as gold, that are finite and become increasingly problematic and costly to attain.</p>
<p>The computer power that is used to mine a cryptocurrency is what maintains and keeps the network alive and at the heart of this network sits a decentralised public ledger that records every transaction made using the currency in real-time. All users are given their own unique bitcoin address and the cryptography built into the chain maintains its integrity and chronological order. As such, it is easy to see how much value belongs to a certain address at any point in time. It also makes adjusting the chain very difficult, so it is nearly impossible for a bitcoin user to spend more than they have.</p>
<p>Once mined, bitcoins can be held as an investment, converted into fiat currency or used to purchase goods and/or services. Statistics released by bitcoin payment processor BitPay show that the majority of merchants currently using the cryptocurrency choose to convert their bitcoins into fiat currencies. And the number of such merchants is growing as the benefits of bitcoin become clearer.</p>
<h3 id="revolutionary-properties">Revolutionary properties</h3>
<p>For Ian Benson, Director at law firm Maclay Murray &amp; Spens, the cryptocurrency’s decentralised nature is a key attraction. “Bitcoin operates using a decentralised ledger and on a peer-to-peer basis,” explains Benson. This means that it can be used independently of the finance sector – and the fees that are associated with doing this.” This may spark the interest of corporates who in recent years have been focusing closely on transaction banking costs and looking to reduce fees where possible. Nevertheless, bitcoin transactions are subject to a fee if made through an exchange – this is currently around the 1% mark. But for merchants who may have to stomach fees of up to 4% from card providers such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, the attraction is clear.</p>
<p>Aside from being independent from banks, cryptocurrencies are also independent from national governments. “There is no jurisdiction and no economic underpinning,” says Standard Chartered’s Jain. This has benefits for corporates who are engaging in cross-border activity as it is not subject to the rules and protocols that dictate the movement of fiat currencies across borders. Exchanging bitcoin across borders not only again escapes the often expensive transaction fees, but also avoids FX exposure and any value date issues – bitcoin transactions are made in real-time.</p>
<p>A third characteristic that could make cryptocurrencies an attractive proposition for some corporates is that payment is entirely irrevocable. “Traditional clearing and settlement systems to a lesser or greater extent involve the issue of revocation of payment instructions, particularly in the international system,” says Benson. “Corporates are always faced with this risk and that is why we see companies use letters of credit to mitigate this risk, because these can’t be reversed but of course they also involve paying fees to the issuer.”</p>
<p>Analysts in favour of the cryptocurrency also believe that bitcoin offers a new way for corporates to look after their customers – and protect their data. Consumers who use bitcoin will not need to provide any personal payment information. Comparisons here can be drawn to PayPal. However, bitcoin advocates suggest that it is more secure than PayPal because bitcoin has no database of information that can be leaked if an account is hacked. And while bitcoin wallets have been subject to such attacks, new security developments, such as multi-sig technology are making this more of a challenge for cyber thieves.</p>
<p>As such, accepting bitcoin may prove an innovative way to attract business from security-conscious consumers. Indeed, computer giant Dell, a company currently piloting the acceptance of bitcoin, is seeing positive feedback from its customers. “We’re pleased by the initial response to our current bitcoin pilot on Dell.com for consumer and small business shoppers in the US and purchases have exceeded our expectations,” says Paul Walsh, Chief Information Officer at Dell Commerce Services.</p>
<p>Despite these apparent benefits, uptake still remains small in the corporate world. According to data from CoinDesk’s ‘State of Bitcoin 2014’ Q3 report, just under 80,000 companies now accept bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="treasury-tribulations">Treasury tribulations</h3>
<p>This lack of, or at least rather slow rate of, adoption comes as little surprise when you consider the deluge of negative press that surrounds the cryptocurrency. In late 2014, Bloomberg classified bitcoin as the world’s worst currency that year. And given the fact that the value of bitcoin dropped 56% against the USD during 2014, it’s easy to understand why.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency’s volatility is a huge barrier to adoption, not least in the corporate sphere. In 2013, bitcoin was on average ten times more volatile than the S&amp;P 500 and 15 times more volatile than the EUR:USD currency pair. Against this backdrop, can treasurers really afford to embrace bitcoin? Jain takes an open-minded approach in answering this question. “Corporates need to understand what the underlying value against the USD is, for example, and then understand why this goes up and down,” he says. Like gold, the price of bitcoin is driven by supply and demand but also by trust – and it is this third element that may be key to a more stable price, he explains.</p>
<p>Benson, on the other hand, points to the derivatives market as a potential solution to bitcoin’s volatility. “This is the single most important development that bitcoin can have,” he says. “A futures and options market will assist in taking the volatility out of the currency and also assist corporates in hedging any balance sheet risk.” There are already some companies in the market that are beginning to offer these services, including LedgerX , which hopes to launch the first US-regulated option exchange, and BitMEX, which recently launched the first 30 day Historical Volatility Futures Contract for bitcoin. “Products such as these have the potential to transform the market just as they did the traditional commodities market,” Benson notes.</p>



<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Case study</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading">Air Lituanica joins the bitcoin revolution</h3>

<p>In August 2014, Air Lituanica announced that passengers could now purchase their plane tickets using bitcoins. Speaking at the time of the announcement, Simonas Bartkus, Director of Commerce at the company said: “Bitcoin payments are highly beneficial for the aviation market – this currency helps to attract more buyers from abroad as bitcoins can be used anywhere in the world. The money transfer is fast and there are no added taxes otherwise deducted by banks and agents.”</p>
<p>Since then, Sandra Meškauskaitė, the company’s Communication Manager, has spoken with Treasury Today and explained a little more about the company’s decision to accept the cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin is the most universal and reliable currency in the world. We installed it on our flight tickets booking engine and this has been a very popular decision – it is used by international customers all over the world.”</p>
<p>One of the drivers behind the decision was to give customers more real-world payment choices. What’s more, it’s simple to use. “When customers choose to pay by bitcoin, they are redirected to our payment service provider’s webpage (MisterTango) where they can find a QR code or bitcoin address which they can use to send the currency to. Once the payment is processed, we receive confirmation from our payment service provider and we then sell the ticket to the customer.”</p>
<p>In terms of security and risk management, Air Lituanica does not store payments in bitcoin. “MisterTango sells the bitcoins on the Bitmarket.lt exchange and we receive euro in return. That is why we do not have a lot of risk associated with bitcoin and we treat it like a faster, more convenient payment method for our customers.”</p>
<p>While the company is only using bitcoins for simple transactions at present, Meškauskaitė believes that it has far wider applications and that customers will become increasingly interested in using bitcoin. “It is an extremely useful innovation and in the future it may eliminate current online payment methods,” he notes.</p>



<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="safe-as-houses">Safe as houses?</h3>
<p>The next big issue that bitcoin is yet to fully overcome is security. Instances of security breaches, or ‘heists’, involving bitcoin exchanges have been well-publicised. The most high profile case involved the now infamous exchange Mt. Gox, which in early 2014 announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins were missing, presumed stolen. The value of these coins, which belonged to both the company and its customers, at the time accounted for over $450m. In more recent months, 200,000 of the coins have been found by the company on an old hard drive, yet the rest remain at large.</p>
<p>This incident highlights a separate issue: namely, the anonymity that cryptocurrencies offer. Although any transaction that occurs will appear in the block chain (the decentralised public general ledger) for that day, the lack of identifying information available and the lack of forensic tools to analyse the block chain can make following transactions extremely difficult, if not impossible. Hence why they are often associated with ‘dark net’ trades.</p>
<p>Corporates holding bitcoin will also need to be aware of the myriad security issues as the cryptocurrency cannot be held in a bank account, with the long established security protocols that support this kind of structure. Instead, it is held in a bitcoin wallet. The digital wallet can come in multiple guises including in the cloud, on a hard drive, or even on a device locked away in a safe. All current methods have their own issues, firstly the security of the cloud solution needs to be optimal, as security around bitcoin has been under the spotlight with a number of high profile breaches and ‘heists’. So-called ‘cold storage’ (storing the bitcoin on a device that is not connected to the internet) may be a safer option as the wallet is disconnected from the internet and therefore away from hackers. That said, it poses its own challenges because it is neither easy to access the wallet quickly nor conveniently to make and accept payments.</p>
<p>Progress is being made in this space, however, including the development of multi-sig technology. “Multi-sig technology is the equivalent to a safe deposit box that requires two people to access what is inside,” says O’Brien. “This means that one person with one key to the bitcoin wallet can’t access it and steal what is inside – it is an extra layer of security.”</p>
<p>Whether developments such as these will do enough to ease corporate fears over bitcoin security remains to be seen, however.</p>
<h3 id="regulation-in-uncharted-territory">Regulation in uncharted territory</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, regulation around bitcoin is a genuine concern. In early 2014, US Federal Reserve Chairperson Janet Yellen announced that; “It’s important to understand that this (bitcoin) is a payment innovation that’s happening outside the banking industry. The Federal Reserve simply does not have the authority to regulate bitcoin in any way.” With this statement many in the industry breathed a huge sigh of relief that they did not have to worry about the Fed cracking down on the currency. However, bitcoin has gained the attention of other global regulators both at state and local level.</p>
<p>“Regulation is incredibly important, ultimately it will make or break bitcoin,” says Nathalie Reinelt, analyst with US Boston based research firm Aite Group. And while many experts who commentate on the currency also share this view it remains a bone of contention in the cryptocurrency community. Cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, are decentralised and not tied to governments, yet as they become more popular, and are used more by consumers, there will need to be regulation. “It is a catch-22,” says Reinelt, “as much as those in the bitcoin industry are concerned about regulation and don’t want it, they ultimately need it in order to attract more mainstream users.”</p>
<p>But who can, and should, regulate the space? “There are questions surrounding whether it should be regulated on a country-by-country basis, or if there should be the creation of a global framework,” says Standard Chartered’s Jain. Currently the currency falls under the watch of a wide range of regulators at both national and local level. For example, New York State has been cracking down on those in the industry and in the summer of 2014 issued subpoenas to many bitcoin executives, in order to understand their business practices. Following this, the state launched its BitLicence, a licence that will be required by bitcoin companies operating in New York in order to do business and send the currency to residents. To be awarded the licence, companies must be in compliance with anti-money laundering and consumer protection requirements.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, in China, a country that bitcoin was once very popular in, the regulators have come down hard and restricted its use. Other countries such as Iceland have been even more extreme and classed bitcoin as a foreign currency that cannot be bought or sold in the country.</p>
<p>The Iceland example throws up another interesting question: what is bitcoin? Is it a currency, is it a commodity or something else entirely? And the lack of agreement from regulators seems to suggest that they really don’t know. In the UK, it is classed as private money. In Australia it is seen as property. Inconsistencies such as this place a huge burden on companies accepting bitcoin when it comes to reporting, auditing and tax.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, these issues need to be resolved – otherwise, there will not be mainstream consumer or business adoption,” says Reinelt. “Many bitcoin companies, especially those in the financial institution (FI) space, are in legal limbo regarding being banked and what to do with their earnings. Banks are not banking them because they just cannot stand up to their AML KYC standards.” In essence, bitcoin FI firms are asking to play in the same space as traditional financial services companies but not by the same rules. “This just isn’t going to happen,” notes Reinelt.</p>
<p>Benson thinks regulatory frameworks are what is needed to overcome these hurdles, as a means to standardise its use, as FinCen in the US and BaFin in Germany have started to do. Reinelt doesn’t see this as a realistic proposition, however. “I don’t think it will be possible to get that many regulators to agree,” she says. “I think the best outcome will be if countries watch what the big nations do; the US, UK and China for example, do and then augment those regulatory concepts to meet their own needs.”</p>
<h3 id="a-true-alternative">A true alternative?</h3>
<p>With so many question marks hanging over cryptocurrencies, is bitcoin ever going to be part of day-to-day treasury business? “It’s hard to say,” says Jain, “like with any new technology you really can’t predict what will happen. It may fizzle out, remain a niche, or it may become one of the world’s key technologies moving forward. And this will only happen with wide adoption across the supply chains – and won’t happen without regulation.”</p>
<p>Benson believes that bitcoin’s future rests on the development of the decentralised ledger and its ability to transform the transaction space. “At the beginning of the dotcom era, there was lots of confusion around what it would actually be. Was it going to be a new sector or something else? If we then look at how the internet has radically transformed all facets of life over the last 15-20 years – you can say a lot about that in relation to cryptocurrencies.” Benson doesn’t believe that banks and traditional currencies will disappear but he does expect to see some fairly significant changes. “Bitcoin is the same as the internet – it will just become another way that we do business and construct business models, it will add another dimension to commence.”</p>
<p>Bitgo CEO, Will O’Brien, believes (somewhat unsurprisingly) that bitcoin will be more revolutionary. “I think bitcoin will become more integral to our lives than we can possibly imagine. If you look at the early days of the internet who would have thought we would have companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter and all the effects they have on our world,” he says. “Bitcoin is following the same trajectory. Not everyone will know what it is or have one, but it is superior to our current financial system and it will eventually displace and replace the backbone of finance, capital markets and commerce.”</p>
<p>For Reinelt, it is the platform, built around the concept of a decentralised public ledger (block chain) and not the currency that will be the main talking point moving forward. “We are starting to see companies emerge, like Ripple, who have shifted away from making their cryptocurrency the primary product and focused more on offering the platform as a business to business service that allows FI to move money internationally for lower fees than traditional systems. So just in the way that Napster paved the way for digital content platforms, cryptocurrencies will lay the platform for cheaper, quicker and safer international monetary exchange built around the block chain concept.”</p>
<p>Work has also already begun on looking at how the decentralised ledger can assist corporates outside of the payments space. “At its most basic level, the block chain is used to securely transact. So this doesn’t have to be a monetary value that gets exchanged, it can be exchange of any value,” says Jain. “Theoretically, whenever there is any exchange that needs to be done securely, it can happen on the block chain. eBAM is one area that the block chain may fit comfortably into to; as are agreements and certificate exchanges, such as bonds and share certificates. Transferring letters of credit, and all the instruments associated with this, could also be built around the block chain moving forward.”</p>
<p>While investigations into the full potential of block chain technology are in their infancy, it is certainly an interesting space – and one that may eventually eclipse the debate on cryptocurrencies altogether.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Rather ironically, it was just the kind of incident that would have seemed right at home in the script of a Hollywood blockbuster. A top film studio cancels a major theatrical release starring big name actors after hackers, who had compromised the studio’s systems, threaten violence in movie theatres. The Obama administration declares it to be a national security issue and blames North Korea for masterminding the attack. So what began as a cyber-breach in a famous Japanese conglomerate quickly became an international incident with the corporate caught in the middle.</p>
<p>Given the scale of the hack targeted against Sony Pictures and the level of negative media coverage, nobody should be too surprised that cyber security is once again back at the very top of the list of corporate concerns. After all, if cyber criminals could breach the systems of a company as technologically sophisticated as Sony – and, as it is rumoured, remain inside there for as long as a year without detection, then surely it could happen to anyone.</p>
<p>This realisation might just lead to a significant change in the way corporates perceive the relative safety of different technological set-ups. Everyone knows that in treasury, adoption of cloud technology has, to date, been hampered by reservations around security. That’s understandable. Tell a treasurer that his or her department’s computer systems, used to move money around, store financial data and manage risk, are going to be migrated to remote data centres accessible over the web, then security concerns are likely to be raised immediately. Local systems are not exactly impenetrable, of course, but there is always a tendency, when so much is at stake, for people to conclude ‘better the devil you know’.</p>
<p>Yet, paradoxical as it might seem, some commentators believe this same technology of which businesses have been so wary, may just be the solution that prevents other companies from suffering the same fate as Sony. This is because, when it comes down to it, cloud services providers know much more about security than the typical company. And given that their whole business model depends on customers trusting them with their data, they always take great pains to secure their services from such attacks. Maybe, then, it’s time for those treasurers who have been hesitant about cloud technology to give it a second consideration.</p>
<h3 id="cutting-capex">Cutting capex</h3>
<p>Putting the security issue aside for one moment, the question must be asked: why has there been such a large influx of cloud-based providers in the treasury services market? When this question is put to various cloud providers with a presence in the treasury space, each has their own unique perspective. They all agree on one thing, however: that the cloud offers a much more cost-effective way for a business to obtain the technology it needs to manage its finances.</p>
<p>“The reality [of a cloud service] is that you are subscribing to it,” says Dave Jones, Cloud Solution Marketing Manager of Hyland, creator of enterprise content management platform OnBase. “You are not spending money upfront, there’s no big capital expenditure. You are not making an investment in your in-house infrastructure, buying servers and hiring new staff. You are essentially outsourcing a portion of your IT.” Better value is also created by allowing companies to tailor their solution to their specific needs with minimal fuss. “You’ve got the ability to turn users and/or functionality on and off, and you can scale the amount of storage they want up and down according to their needs very quickly,” says Jones.</p>
<p>Richard Manson, Director and Co-founder of e-invoicing provider CloudTrade concurs. Offering a cloud-based service does, in fact, have several advantages for a company in this particular sector. Although e-invoicing – and the workflow solutions often deployed in parallel – are not, by any means, a new idea, uptake has been sluggish. Until recently. Back at the beginning of the millennium, when Manson began working in the payables space, the first solutions to arrive on the market were delivered at a cost that priced out all but the biggest multinational corporates. If you weren’t a company the size of Unilever or Shell you might as well forget about it.</p>
<p>But thanks to the cloud, large capital expenditure is no longer necessary in this area and, as such, the pool of companies that can use e-invoicing has grown considerably. “What we haven’t got now is a world where we go in and install software locally anymore,” says Manson. “A company simply pays for the service they use rather than buying a big piece of kit, installing it and having to maintain it themselves.”</p>
<p>Supplier adoption rates have benefited too. Although Manson believes providers will never fully do away with the need to pick up the telephone to on-board some suppliers, CloudTrade and many of its competitors have been able to take advantage of the cloud to bring suppliers on board in a more automated fashion, sending out programmed communications and directing suppliers to self-register if the supplier’s volumes are of too low a level to justify a more supplier specific approach.</p>
<p>So the inexpensive nature of most cloud solutions has, at the very least, helped to level the playing field in the treasury technology space. Once there used to be a huge gap between what the biggest, most sophisticated companies could achieve with their treasury technology and, say, a £100m revenue company based in Manchester, UK. Now, thanks to the cloud, capabilities are much more equal. And there are even, as we will hear in a moment, some areas where functionalities available in the cloud surpass that of traditional, in-house solutions.</p>
<h3 id="ahead-in-the-cloud">Ahead in the cloud</h3>
<p>Traditional treasury technology is, by its very nature, bulky and complex. Making modifications in order to address specific problems or challenges can be quite a lengthy, cumbersome process therefore. Take a typical ERP system, for example. These solutions are designed to help businesses create financial statements as well as collect, store, manage and interpret data from a range of other business activities. But what if the treasury department wishes to tailor the technology to pull specific data in order to address a particular problem? If you’re working with a local ERP system, you would probably need to bring in a consultant, and design a customised side-programme to solve the problem. One would be looking at six months to a year, at least, before anything near to a solution is reached.</p>
<p>Solutions in the cloud do not suffer from this disadvantage, says Wolfgang Koester, CEO and Founder of the cloud-based FX exposure management solution, FiREapps. “The depth of actual solutions beyond treasury workstations and ERP systems is a big advantage for any treasury solution in the cloud,” says Koester. In fact, Koester is adamant is that his company would not be able to offer the same quality of analytics around their FX exposures without the cloud.</p>
<p>All treasurers will be familiar with just how challenging it is to get visibility into their various currency exposures around the globe without the right technology in place. Of course, there are some static reports that can be pulled but these, in Koester’s eyes, are rarely of the standard necessary to achieve the desired results. By leveraging the power of the cloud, on the other hand, FiREapps are able to pool data from lots of different sources and then, by applying rules-based data processing and analytics, get them to the answer they want in a much more expedient fashion with little to no internal IT support require.</p>
<h3 id="safety-first">Safety first</h3>
<p>Cheaper, lighter and more flexible solutions are certainly something treasurers should be in the market for, providing that security is not compromised as a result. And although many cloud-based treasury providers say they are registering less anxiety around the concept of cloud technology from prospective customers than they did a year or two back, the fact of the matter is that, for some corporate professionals, cloud-security still sounds like an oxymoron.</p>
<p>A survey of 613 US-based IT and IT security practitioners conducted by the Ponemon Institute in June 2014 underscores this fact. A substantial majority of respondents (66%) said that by using cloud-based services, their organisation’s ability to protect confidential or sensitive information was ‘diminished’. A further 64% believed that it’s more difficult to secure business-critical applications as a result of their organisation’s use of cloud-based services.</p>
<p>Of course, the cloud industry believes that the reality about security is very different from the common perception. To Koester, for instance, it is utterly unfathomable that any cloud-based business service would be more vulnerable than an in-house platform. It is quite the opposite, he argues. “Our entire business model, and that of all true cloud-based providers, is predicated on the highest level of data security. I think that security, for genuine cloud-based providers, is actually an advantage.”</p>

<h3 id="a-world-without-walls">A ‘world without walls’</h3>
<p>Phil Huggins, Vice President of cyber security experts’ Stroz Friedberg’s London office agrees that most cloud providers, at the least the ones he is familiar from doing business with, take security issues with the utmost of seriousness. After all, like Koester says, any cloud-based provider of treasury solutions that was not cognisant of security issues wouldn’t be in business for very long. A certain amount of “buyer beware” is to be expected though, he explains, especially considering that there are known instances in recent years in which treasuries have been specifically targeted by “pieces of malware”.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not they are warranted, Huggins believes that in the long run the shift of business systems to the cloud will not be impeded by treasurers’ security concerns. Sooner or later, he boldly predicts, almost everything that corporates do – especially in their back offices, if not in their production environments too – will be using the cloud in some form or another. This seismic shift, he says, is going to demand a new way of thinking about security from corporate finance professionals.</p>
<p>“Traditionally, businesses have treated themselves like a castle, occasionally letting down the drawbridge for other people when they have to deal with them,” he says. But in the new world Huggins describes there are no walls. “The business is actually in other peoples’ system and the drawbridge is down all the time because of connectivity.” This is not necessarily a bad thing, however. Cloud providers have to automate quite a lot, and manual processes are much more likely to be at the source of a security breach. “So they catch a lot of the problems, purely because they automate so many things,” says Huggins. “That is one of the reasons why all the cloud providers that I’ve dealt with have provided a better level of security than many of the businesses I know of that have dealt with security internally.”</p>
<p>This is not saying that treasurers can now afford to relax when it comes to IT matters. The risks have not gone away, Huggins explains, they are simply manifesting and concentrating themselves in new areas of the IT infrastructure such as the web browser. That the web browser is one of the most hacked parts of any computer is something of which treasurers should take note.</p>
<p>“The web browser and the browsing habits of treasury staff suddenly matter a lot,” he says. “Traditionally, malware might come in through some malicious web or email route to target a treasury application installed locally. Now there is effectively one less step. In terms of security, it is about understanding, clearly, that the PCs that the treasurers use and the user accounts they have within the business are high value targets. Where they prioritise their security activities in terms of managing risk, in terms of monitoring issues, they are a high value asset that the organisation needs to spend some time thinking about.”</p>
<h3 id="is-the-future-still-in-the-cloud">Is the future still in the cloud?</h3>
<p>Back in 2011, in the aftermath of the first high-profile hack to which Sony fell victim, there was much speculation about whether such incidents would cause businesses to rethink plans to move to cloud-based computer systems accessible over the web. The Wall Street Journal, no less, ran a story with the headline “Sony hack casts cloud over cloud computing”. And they were far from being the only media outlet to ponder the future of the technology at the time.</p>
<p>Yet it is notable that in the aftermath of the latest Sony hack there has been very little of this kind of talk, despite the incident being far greater both in terms of its scale and its severity. It shows, perhaps, just how far we have come in the past few years.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is now no longer a radical, esoteric technology existing on the fringes of the corporate world. Of course, there is still a degree of reticence amongst some corporate professionals to the cloud, as recent surveys demonstrate. But increasingly it is entering into the mainstream and, as it does, one would expect these fears to continue being quelled through experience.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Until recently, a large majority of treasurers maintained that they could not see any great functionality benefits from using tablet or mobile applications in their particular roles. Apps simply didn’t help them to do their job better, or offer sufficient benefits to spend time investigating. Add to that a widely held perception, not always correct, that mobile devices are less secure than their desktop equivalents, and it is not that difficult to see why the app breakthrough has taken a while to materialise.</p>
<p>Those initial assessments are evidently changing, though. “It’s an exciting time right now,” says Graham Warner, Global Head of Online, Mobile and Desktop Client Access Products, Global Transaction Banking, Deutsche Bank. “The last time we saw this type of revolution in delivery channels was back in the late 1990s.”</p>
<h3 id="drivers-for-change">Drivers for change</h3>
<p>Part of the reason for this shift might be that software developers are becoming progressively more aware of the richer functionality that can be derived from a mobile app as opposed to a mobile web browser. As these products hit the market, treasurers using them are hastily revising their views. “When tablets first began to become available, banks were initially just sticking with that browser-based format,” says Colin Kerr, who has been working closely with development teams at a number of leading banks in his role as Head of Industry Solutions at Microsoft. Given the larger size of a tablet screen that seemed reasonably logical. But it soon became apparent that there are certain scenarios in which utilising the native software of the tablet or smartphone – such as the ability to receive push notifications – can be used to create fully integrated, actionable workflows.</p>

<p>Treasurers are also finding that the dashboard view that comes with an app lends itself well to activities such as analytics, so much so that some continue to use it for that purpose even when they are in the office and have access to their desktops. Although it is a factor, the benefits are about much more than eliminating the need for users to navigate through multiple URLs and logins on a touch screen keyboard to make transactions. There are also opportunities for integration with the treasurer’s desktop software applications, transforming the app into a tool for cross-collaboration. “We are starting to see a lot of interest in that,” says Kerr. “From a Microsoft perspective, Office is pervasive on the desktop and in Window’s tablets so there can be a very natural integration into the Outlook calendar and emails, triggering off workflow scenarios.”</p>
<h3 id="listen-and-learn">Listen and learn</h3>
<p>Sensing the scope of the opportunities native apps offer over web apps, developers have been refocusing their efforts on user experience. It is an important shift. By listening to the market, developers say they have learnt that treasurers do not care to see all their online tools transformed into a single, cumbersome mobile application. What they want instead, the developers claim, are apps specifically tailored for certain core activities, such as authorisation alerting, actionable analytics and the ability to execute simple transactions remotely (see our article on <a href="/2014/04/payments-on-the-move-ttcm">mobile payments</a> for more detail on the latter).</p>
<p>It is those capabilities that now form the main focus for Deutsche Bank’s ‘Autobahn Mobile’ offering. With ‘Autobahn Mobile’, we have started to introduce selected services from our existing 160 online applications of the Autobahn App Market to the mobile space. More Apps will be added throughout 2014 and will soon also be available for iPhone usage. “Clients are becoming more receptive to mobile,” says Warner. “Keeping our clients involved throughout the development of our mobile offering has created an end product with which they are much happier,” he notes. “It enables us to get where we want to be a lot faster. Rather than offering a long list of solutions, which might not be seen as important by the corporate, we’re able to quickly roll out the key functions we know to be the most useful.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bob Stark, Vice President of Strategy at Kyriba says the TMS provider’s own client research produced similar findings. Like Deutsche Bank, Kyriba asked treasurers how they want to use mobile apps in a professional context and, similarly, found them to be focused on a few key functions. “There are definitely some core things that are really important to them,” says Stark. Above all they want to get visibility into cash – a core activity for treasury teams worldwide – and know that a payment can be both initiated and approved. Finally, they also want complete visibility over reporting. “They just want to make sure that their ability to do their jobs is not device dependent,” adds Stark.</p>
<h3 id="a-size-that-fits">A size that fits</h3>
<p>It seems obvious that certain types of devices are likely to be better suited for different functions. Treasurers might, quite rightly, wonder what value they could possibly derive from attempting to analyse complex analytics data on a small smartphone screen, for example. But the mobile medium also includes larger tablet devices which, with screens often comparable to a laptop, are much more suited for complex activities such as analytics. While early movers in the app space seemed to ignore this distinction, there are examples of apps now coming onto the market designed with a particular device in mind. “Choosing the right information to be consumed through the right form factor is crucial to developing apps that the corporate treasury professional finds valuable”, explains Microsoft’s Kerr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most apps designed for corporate treasurers are not only very restrictive with regards to login authentication and permissions, but also have extra features that provide a safety net should the treasurers device ever become misplaced or stolen.”</p>
<p><cite>Colin Kerr, Head of Industry Solutions, Microsoft</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>About a year ago, the company rolled out a new app developed in-house for the benefit of its treasury team. The Wire Request Tool (WRT), a Windows Phone app that the company developed illustrates perfectly how the capabilities of native apps are allowing developers to do things that wouldn’t have been possible before with web apps. The WRT app checks against the company’s active employee directory and safe approvals list – that details respective authorisation limits – to find the correct person to authorise the transaction and then alerts them to it using a push notification sent to their smartphone handset.</p>
<p>“This is a good example of the right kind of app functionality for the right size form factor,” says Kerr. Unlike a tablet, he explains, a mobile phone is more likely to remain switched on throughout the working day, allowing push notifications to be received when needed. In addition to that, the smaller screen size of the phone makes it safer to reveal private information in a public space. “A tablet is a device that the treasurer might refer back to at certain points in the day, but when there is an urgent issue which requires some kind of resolution, the phone is the ideal way of initiating,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-safe">Is it safe?</h3>
<p>Despite the careful measures outlined above, security is often raised by treasurers when talking about apps. Clearly, given the difference in the sums of money involved, a corporate banking app needs to be even more robust than a retail banking app. Banks and treasury technology specialists, however, insist that the apps they release to the market are as secure as they can be. “Treasurers ask about security every time, as they should,” says Kyriba’s Stark. Often the problem is that treasurers are not typically IT experts with an extensive knowledge of computer security, they are just aware there is a threat. In light of that it is important for treasurers to discuss security with both their software provider and their IT teams.</p>
<p>“Sometimes treasurers are educated and come to us with a list of specific requirements which they ask us to meet,” says Stark. “Other times, they will say this is really important, can we have some help from you to understand what we should be doing.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most apps designed for corporate treasurers are not only very restrictive with regards to login authentication and permissions, but also have extra features that provide a safety net should the treasurer’s device ever become misplaced or stolen, Microsoft’s Kerr explains. “If a treasurer’s tablet or mobile was left on the train, for example, the company’s IT department would have the ability to wipe all of the data held on the device remotely,” he says. “A thief would be picking up a brick, basically.”</p>
<h3 id="the-revolution-will-be-mobilised">The revolution will be mobilised</h3>
<p>It is all very well hearing what developers have to say about their app products, but what do treasurers think? Do those that have mobile access to their treasury software actually use apps much or are they, despite all the reassurance, still questioning the safety of the technology? “I actually use it every day,” says Anita Prasad, General Manager, Treasury Capital Management at Microsoft. Prasad now finds herself at her desk less and yet is still able to approve wire payments using the WRT app designed for Windows smartphone. The app is used by her and executive management with wire approval authorisations. She also finds herself referring back to a treasury analytics app on her tablet at regular points during the day, just to check on how operations are running.</p>
<p>Prasad says that she has demonstrated how she is now able to work away from the office when networking with her peers at conferences such as last years’ Sibos event. Most, she says are very enthusiastic about the technology, even if that is still tempered for some with a degree of caution due to the security question. “Of course, nobody wants to see their face on the front page of the Wall Street Journal because something has gone wrong with an application they were using,” she says. “But we did not take the decision lightly either. We went through vigorous testing and had it in pilot for a long time. What we have found is that there is much greater security in these mobile apps and dashboards on tablets than ever before and this is driving deployment across functions in treasury, finance and business more broadly.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been using it for a year now,” she adds, “and billions of dollars are now getting processed in a far more secure way than was feasible before and in a way that suits the needs of a mobile management team.” Evidently, the lesson that Prasad and a growing number of treasurers are learning is that the key to getting more done at work is, perhaps, giving yourself more to work with.</p>

<h3 id="five-apps-for-the-corporate-treasurer">Five apps for the corporate treasurer</h3>
<p>In addition to the various offerings from banks and treasury software vendors there are also a range of apps available in the Apple and Android app stores that the corporate treasurer might find useful. Here we provide a quick rundown of five essentials that no discerning treasurer should be without.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>EZ Financial Calculators (iOS, free)</h5>
<p>This app offers corporate treasurers – and other financial professionals – a quick and accurate way to perform many frequently used financial calculations including APR and ROI all from their iPhone or iPad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Keynote (iOS, £6.99)</h5>
<p>Imagine the scenario. You are moments away from delivering a presentation to a packed conference room at an international treasury conference. Suddenly, important economic data is released that might bolster your address. There’s no desktop computer to hand but that doesn’t matter as last minute edits can be made on the slides saved on your smartphone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>iSpreadsheet (iOS, free)</h5>
<p>No matter what up-to-date, fully integrated, STP-enabling software one buys, treasury will always need spreadsheets in some shape or form. With this app the corporate treasurer can read, edit and save Excel documents on the go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bloomberg (iOS and Android, free)</h5>
<p>Staying on top in today’s increasingly volatile markets requires constant vigilance from the corporate treasurer to signs of market stress. There are a range of apps out there providing financial markets news, data and portfolio tracking tools, but few better than this one from Bloomberg. One of the app’s many innovative features is the ability to create personalised views of the news by industry, region or popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>CardMunch (iOS and Android, free)</h5>
<p>Treasurers have been using LinkedIn to stay informed with the latest industry trends for many years now. This app utilises the native hardware of smartphones to allow users to take photographs of business cards, which are then automatically added as LinkedIn contacts.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Few in the business world can have failed to notice the concept of ‘Big Data’. Since it first emerged in the early 2000s it has often been used as shorthand for ‘impending meltdown’ as businesses sink under the weight of uncountable bits and bytes. But the volume of data carried by a business as a whole could be a problem or an opportunity – it all depends on how data is managed and what is done with it to make it useful. Treasurers have access to a variety of different data sets that could, for example, be useful in helping them with their forecasts so they can make better decisions. Being able to look at a wider set of data provides better intelligence however mismanaged information is at best confusing but potentially a major source of risk.</p>
<p>To try to quantify just how ‘big’ Big Data is, IBM published an ‘infographic’ last year showing that an estimated 2.3 trillion gigabytes of data are created each day and 40 zettabytes (43 trillion gigabytes) of data will be created by 2020. Data analysis and data-about-data (meta-data) generates yet more data ensuring that growth really is exponential. The problem with having so much data is that it can be difficult to capture, file, store, search, share, transfer, analyse and visualise without coming up against a range of issues such as duplication, inaccuracy, irrelevance or unavailability. In essence, if it takes too long to make a decision it may be too late.</p>
<p>Today, very few businesses will be unaware of the importance of their data. But leveraging Big Data to unlock more business value requires planning. Kelvin To, Founder and President of Data Boiler Technologies (and a guest speaker and lecturer at City University, Hong Kong) says discovery of opportunities “often depends on the correct diagnosis of problems”.</p>
<p>For analysing historical bank transactions, for example, the typical reporting tool in a treasury management system (TMS) will probably limit analysis to a 12-month period at best, especially if the business has an annual, repetitive nature to its cash flows, says Bob Stark, VP Strategy, Kyriba. “You end up narrowing down what you are analysing very quickly.” However, the concept of Big Data in this context is about taking a larger data set, across a larger number of years, to give a better idea of what the cyclical nature of data is going to look like. Expanding reach for Stark is not just how far back in time analysis goes but also how broad a sweep is included – and this even covers macro-economic data. “Big Data is about being able to leverage all those data sets and being able to pick and choose how you want to use them; for treasurers without the right tools it is not something they have been able to achieve in any meaningful way,” says Stark.</p>
<p>The financial crisis of 2008 certainly provided motivation for looking further into and more widely at data, with most forms of risk mitigation higher on the agenda, notes Alex Robertson, Head of Treasury Analytics, Treasury Solutions, Capita Asset Services. The reliance on more data – both internally and externally sourced – and deeper analysis to protect the business (counterparty credit risk might now take in CDS spreads, equity prices, tier one capital ratios, bond spreads and so on) naturally demands increased time, but so too does the need to seek out different investment and funding options and, notes Robertson, “this is all increasing the scope of information that treasurers need to look for and understand”.</p>
<p>If confusion reigns when too much information is available, Richard Childes, Director, Product Marketing, OpenLink Financial, says the problem is usually that people “do not know what they want, they ask the wrong questions and end up being inundated with the data”. In the Big Data world, knowing where to source data and then asking the right questions is critical.</p>
<h3 id="whats-stopping-you">What’s stopping you?</h3>
<p>When it comes to seeking answers, Robertson suggests barriers to meaningful business analytics may arise from existing technology, resources and processes. “Overlapping data sources and contradicting data versions often exist both within and outside the organisation,” adds Data Boiler’s To. “This can be exacerbated by poor vendor performance and integration issues, constant battles with non-standardised technologies and frequent requirement changes.” In ‘fire-fighting’ mode, he notes many organisations are attempting to adapt by rolling out “retrofitting” projects, “trying a hundred different things and hoping some of them will work” and/or using Business Process Outsourcing “to let someone else worry about it”.</p>
<p>For a treasurer, spending time identifying, collecting, cleansing and analysing additional data “to the point where they can make meaningful decisions confidently” means spending less time on core activities, comments Robertson. “Most businesses will have a clear corporate strategy; what is required here is a strategy for business analytics.”</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-project">Starting a project</h3>
<p>Before any project commences, Childes urges all companies to ask this simple question: “What business challenge are you trying to solve?” By understanding what the requirements are it is possible to figure out not only which data should be found and analysed but also what tools will be needed to do that. Business teams and IT should collaborate to reveal those needs. Only then will firms overcome barriers to leveraging their data, such as legacy systems that aren’t easily replaceable, lack of confidence in new technologies, and siloed functionality and data.</p>
<p>Big Data and business analytics issues can be tackled internally as long as the right plan and resources are in place. Alternatively, as To states above, the project can be outsourced to a third party, typically using cloud technology to manage and process data offsite. Cloud technology still raises the issue of security (and may even be prohibited by corporate policy) but in reality the cloud is as secure, or more so than in-house storage, a view now espoused by many IT professionals who, Stark notes, tend to be the drivers behind such moves. Be warned though: data management projects can be costly when IT and final stakeholders who will use the information are not aligned and requirements for the project are unclear, says Leonardo Orlando, Manager in Finance and Risk Business Services at Accenture UK. “When the IT function and those who will ultimately use the data are in agreement about their final goal and have a mutual understanding of the project trigger, such as regulatory compliance, these projects tend to be more readily supported by those involved.”</p>
<h3 id="technical-solutions">Technical solutions</h3>
<p>Centralisation is one of the key components for efficient use of Big Data for Orlando. “Without using a unique golden source, there is the risk of having multiple versions of the truth,” he notes. “Standardisation, however, is not the answer when there are multiple requirements across an organisation.” One of the most efficient Big Data methodologies therefore involves creation of a common golden source, which can provide information at its lowest level of granularity. However, it also needs to offer organisations the flexibility to use additional data sources to meet unique departmental needs.</p>
<p>Current technology is capable of meeting Big Data requirements. What’s important, says Orlando, is to think through how your organisation wants to use Big Data and factor that in before selecting and implementing. “Technology is constantly evolving but there are multiple options that should be evaluated against business use cases to ascertain the most suitable – one size does not fit all.”</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his obvious bias as a technology vendor, Stark believes companies need to centralise as much as possible. “It doesn’t mean that if you haven’t centralised it is impossible, but for a treasurer looking across 18 different systems to try to understand their cash forecast, rather than having it in one system, it’s easy to see which approach is simpler.”</p>
<p>But for Data Boiler’s To, centralisation is not necessarily the answer. “Putting everything into a central data warehouse and maintaining that every year is very expensive; an ‘Enterprise Service Bus’ architecture [a system of connecting and unifying multiple data inputs] is capable of addressing many non-standard data issues, but it too is not cheap.”</p>
<p>He suggests tiered data storage as a potential solution. High-tier, high-availability servers enable real-time delivery and instant backup for business-critical data, whilst the lower-tiered servers are used for non-urgent or archiving purposes. Tiered data storage has been made possible with the advent of new analysis tools. With older technologies, when data analysis was required, it was necessary to load all sets of data into a high-availability server to execute the process, To explains. “With modern in-memory analysis and tiered storage there is no need to do that; you can do the analysis wherever the data is.”</p>
<p>One of the persistent issues, according to Robertson, is cleansing and normalising data. “Unless you have common identifiers to integrate data you will have to spend a significant amount of time doing it manually,” he explains. There are rules-based tools available to help look for and normalise common linkages between data (to quite a granular level), and there are systems to ensure version control and document management, but users must have confidence that their data has been properly integrated.</p>
<p>Standardisation and centralisation clearly have a place in Big Data management, but for To, “firms should focus on optimising what ought to be fast, resilient, scalable and flexible”. In the real world, where funding is limited, this creates a genuine need to balance the cost and benefit of standardisation with the need to preserve IT agility for rapid response to business change.</p>
<p>In order to keep costs down, Orlando urges companies to prioritise goals, information and stakeholder needs. “A company might create a roadmap for change that also factors in short-term compliance considerations, and then slowly move towards an integrated reporting platform that enhances a more efficient decision-making process.” Prioritisation requires cross-functional discussion, the aim being to find a common goal. It demands the buy-in of senior management, to drive fair and equitable discussion, and may even see the provision of a dedicated project manager to ensure focus. Everything should connect back to the business model.</p>
<p>One way of achieving unity when aggregating data from multiple sources, without recourse to a single central data warehouse, is to embrace ‘Lean’ IT processes. The Lean process, To explains, stems from the Japanese motor-manufacturing sector. It is a way of maximising efficiency through organisation and removing the unnecessary through constant refinement. “If you look at all processes together in your system development, you will be able to prioritise the aspects that give the biggest ‘bang for your buck’.” In the context of Big Data, Lean is about building a “flexible and agile” IT system that is capable of handling multiple standards.</p>
<h3 id="human-intelligence">Human intelligence</h3>
<p>Using technology to automate processes is a useful exercise in itself, but Stark believes IT should be deployed to enable treasuries to take their processes “to the next level”. Automation can free-up individuals to concentrate on more valued-added activities, allowing the entire treasury team to contribute to data analysis and the search for new trends and opportunities. In this respect, treasury experience and expertise are still essential. “If you don’t know what you’re looking for and don’t have the experience to know which buttons to press, the technology won’t just magically do your job for you; you need to know what you are doing to learn from data.”</p>
<p>From Robertson’s perspective, designing a system that will do everything is not the point. “What we are really trying to do is give treasurers transparent information to enable them to make good decisions; the process of good decision-making shouldn’t change,” he says. “Becoming over-reliant on any application is a bad thing; it should be a tool to make the best decision, not one to make the decision.” In the risk management space, for example, there is an increasing need for stress-testing, complex simulation and scenario analysis, using higher volumes of data and at a more granular level. Whilst software can steer a decision in a certain direction, ultimately there will have to be a call made based on professional judgement.</p>
<p>“People design computer systems and people are not infallible; their systems will do what they are designed to do but that does not mean they are right,” notes Childes. Data has to be interpreted correctly and anomalies spotted so even with the best technology “treasurers will always have to remain on the ball”.</p>
<p>Whatever technology is used, the final user may make their own analysis and evaluations, says Orlando. “Experience, especially when business-related, may be a factor in data interpretation, but some control may be needed to tie decision-making processes sufficiently to the information provided.” With regards to treasury, risk management will want to define a risk appetite and monitor and control treasury actions so they are compatible with that appetite.</p>
<p>In To’s view, there will always be a need for treasury professionalism, but he suggests technology can offer a different and perhaps unexpected view. “What Big Data enables you to do is look across the board, where places you would never think of may present big opportunities.” He believes that combining the broad sweep of Big Data with a machine-learning approach to analysis is the route to success. “If you don’t make that connection, you will be like everyone else because whatever you can think of, other intelligent individuals will be able to think of too!”</p>
<h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3>
<p>A business is linked by many processes. Where data is generated, the individuals working with it day-in and day-out will have developed specific sensitivities to that data. This unique understanding allied with the Big Data toolset enables every experience and understanding to be drawn together to enhance the view of the business as a whole, through what Orlando refers to as an “interactive and dynamic data flow”. Big Data is thus not just an IT issue, but one for the whole business to tackle and everyone in the organisation who works with data can make better use of it. As Childes says, “you just have to know how to access it, what questions to ask and what tools to use to mine that data to get the answers you are looking for”. Instead of seeing Big Data as a threat, why not embrace it?</p>

<h3 id="big-data-checklist">Big Data checklist</h3>
<p>According to Accenture UK’s Orlando, Big Data does not become a “big problem” if a business has the right processes, the right teams and the right technology in place. He suggests the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are clear functional requirements, which need to come from the information user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a unique golden source (even if the level of data granularity may be different across the organisation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IT architecture is clear, simple and scalable. To help meet regulatory requirements corporates and banks may want to adjust their processes without changing the information source, rather than making manual adjustments which can affect data integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having the right teams with clear lines as to who is responsible for which tasks is key. Many organisations now have a dedicated Chief Data Officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data governance and data management is essential. Not all data has to be physically stored in one big box as long as strong data governance is in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Treasury technology may exhibit a relatively glacial flow compared to consumer banking software, but the treasury landscape is shifting. But in which direction is it going?</p>
<p>Never short of a professional view on how the market is behaving, Kelvin Walton, director of UK-based consultancy, TreasuryWise, believes that whilst TMS vendor consolidation has gone almost as far as it can go, niche systems will continue to thrive; a condition in part being driven by the broadening scope and list of treasury concerns, from risk to regulation to Big Data.</p>
<p>Niche providers will thus persist because as new needs arise technology gaps are created. The main TMS vendors may subsequently offer a competing solution, but not every treasury has or needs a TMS and of those that do, the solution may not be best-in-class.</p>
<p>But niche providers may in time become acquisition targets for the major TMS providers seeking to fill their own functionality gaps (especially if the vendor is losing sales to a better-integrated competitor). Walton believes it is no idle speculation that the commercial threat to a major player is not only its direct competitors but also the smaller vendor “intent on upsizing”. Unlikely? A specialist vendor finding itself with deep pockets, having generated revenues by servicing the small and mid-sized corporate sector, can move into the mainstream if it acquires the right product set; Reval, for example, making a case in point.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-concerns">Cloud concerns</h3>
<p>For Walton, niche vendors – most of which are offering their products via the Software as a Service (SaaS) or cloud delivery model – are thus the “dynamo” of the industry right now, the old argument against the SaaS model – that taking technology offsite multiplies operational risk – having faded, notes Walton. The cloud variant – where a company’s data and applications sit on servers that it controls, as opposed to SaaS servers controlled by the vendor – practically negates this concern. Both SaaS and cloud models have moved steadily towards acceptability and Walton believes both are now seen as “secure, stable and cost-effective” and, he adds, “even a risk reducer” where SaaS/cloud accessibility facilitates the retirement of yet another spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Marcus Hughes, Director Business Development at payments specialist, Bottomline Technologies, believes that for any organisation looking both to reduce costs and manage risk, the cloud model now has “considerable appeal”.</p>
<p>Indeed, states Hughes with considerable confidence, “for those who are considering a new solution there seems little need to bother with the costs and complexities of having an on premise solution”. The wider technology community has already recognised this view, Hughes adding that “most, if not all” vendors are moving their software to a pay-as-you-go platform option. “Considering that the vast majority of the payments process is outside of the business, within the financial networks, it seems almost illogical to try to maintain internal systems for this purpose.”</p>
<p>The next big change which Hughes anticipates over the next year or so is that, driven by budgetary and IT constraints, major banks will begin outsourcing to the cloud core functions such as supply chain finance, payments and multi-network connectivity. “However, cloud should not be seen as inevitable for all organisations,” he comments. “Successful solution providers need to continue to offer both locally deployed and cloud-based options to their customers who must make up their own minds about whether, or how they choose to migrate to the cloud.”</p>
<p>For Justin Brimfield, EVP, Corporate Development at Reval, whilst much attention has been given to the large margins of error, weak security and lack of audit capabilities associated with spreadsheet usage, it is worth noting how reliance on spreadsheets tends to creep back into the lives of those who have invested in conventional, installed treasury applications. “After the initial benefits of automation are recognised, many treasuries find themselves falling behind several versions of their systems without the time, cost and effort to invest in implementing an upgrade,” he says. As regulations change and organisations grow, these same forward-thinking treasury professionals turn back to using spreadsheets as a workaround. “These workarounds become more and more out of sync with their core treasury applications, which in turn, are relied upon less and less.” Brimfield argues that companies automating processes for the first time or facing an upgrade “can leverage SaaS technology to ensure they are always on the most current version”.</p>
<h3 id="wider-choice">Wider choice</h3>
<p>One major vendor that has its feet firmly planted in both the installed and SaaS/cloud camps is SunGard. Whilst its Senior Vice President of Treasury Solutions, Paul Bramwell, understands the treasurer’s reticence to shift to new technology, given that many use mature applications that have been years in the making. User-familiarity carries with it an element of security whilst new technology is risky. But the main reason for slow adoption, he feels, is that there is a predominant landscape of installed legacy technologies which is not easy to integrate. “It’s a project that a treasury has to budget for, not just financially, but in terms of timing and resources.”</p>
<p>SunGard has a policy of supporting all the versions of its software in current use because it understands that treasurers will not change for changes sake. But, admits Bramwell, “it is in our interest to persuade clients to move on to newer versions of the software”. Enticing treasurers to adopt new technology requires forethought, not gimmicks. “We introduce new features and functions but still the enemy of the software vendor in this respect is client inertia.”</p>
<p>The treasurer’s hand may eventually be forced though. The rise of risk, regulation and compliance in the current environment is a strong driver for change; some recent events would not have been considered possible when many legacy applications were first installed (bank default, for example). In technology terms, vendor actions can focus the mind on change too. Where technological change is forced around one aspect it may mean change is necessitated elsewhere if the upgrade (or replacement) software cannot communicate effectively with legacy systems. If legacy technology can potentially constrain progress or at least dictate what can and cannot be implemented, it is surely better to manage change to new technology rather than be forced into it.</p>
<h3 id="a-risky-business">A risky business</h3>
<p>In the broader context of corporate life, Brimfield sees treasurers taking on new challenges, such as managing commodity and price risk. Risk technology (and hedge accounting) has always been Reval’s stock-in-trade for treasury, but like SunGard’s Bramwell, he too sees “the circle of data mining getting bigger” to cover “every last exposure”. To this end, Reval partnered towards the end of 2013 with US-based firm, Atlas Risk Advisory.</p>
<p>Atlas’ proprietary methodology (based on data cube technology) of extracting data from an ERP provides a “complete view” for balance sheet and cash flow hedging. Reval collates the data enabling the user to hedge through one of its trading partners before returning the confirmation. It is, says Brimfield, a “straight through processing relationship”; integration, he feels, is “one of the burning issues of the moment”.</p>
<p>New products are clearly needed to address market change, where manual approaches to risk, compliance and fraud leave businesses overly exposed. Vendors are tackling these needs, says Phil Mattes, Treasury Strategist at Kyriba, but the push for innovative solutions to take treasury to the next stage is a different matter.</p>
<p>Market consolidation over the past few years has removed some of the smaller (and therefore more agile) providers, leaving the mid-sized vendors as the main market-disturbers. But the risk-averse nature of corporate treasury means the dramatic changes in paradigm that can be seen in some industries “is never seen in the treasury world”. The treasury department, says Mattes, “is rarely the early adopter of technology”.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-move">On the move</h3>
<p>The voluble chatter around the anticipated roll-out of mobile treasury services is a case in point. Anecdotal evidence suggests treasurers are yet to be fully convinced, leading Mattes to argue the case for clarification of the message. “Treasurers are perhaps not ready to have their full TMS on their iPad, but for accessing key reports, getting cash positions and for enabling payment approvers to review and release payments, I think there is genuine interest.” Casting the typical treasurer as a “road-warrior” is a mistake too, he feels. “We’re finding that some clients are using mobile when they’re away from their desk but not necessarily out of the office.”</p>
<p>Mobile is perhaps still a ‘want’ whereas tackling the Big Data issue – managing and mining the vast quantities of data stored in treasury solutions to identify trends and anomalies, in order to make more informed decisions – is becoming more of a ‘need’. Mattes’ team is currently working on an initiative to enhance reporting. By integrating treasury and finance data, mining it and using visualisation tools to clearly present it, it is possible to aid the transition of data into information. Where the treasury system, ERP and other in-house finance applications can better share information, Mattes argues that risk management and competitive advantage can be derived. This, he adds, is especially so as the shift is made from periodic data transfer to the real-time world of open API-based live data exchanges.</p>
<h3 id="banking-on-technology">Banking on technology</h3>
<p>Technology strategy for a transaction bank is not just a case of thinking about how well its own toolset is faring, but also how well it connects to its clients’ technology and enables them to operate more efficiently, says Ken Deveaux, Global Head of Channels and Distribution, International Banking at RBS. One of the big connectivity issues for 2014 is SEPA. “We’re driven by a confluence of regulatory requirements and corporate client needs to meet a deadline. I think there will be an opportunity for corporate treasurers to optimise their working capital flows quite a bit further,” says Deveaux.</p>
<p>“Today, technology and standards are driving the exchange of payment instructions and related reporting, for example, in a series of bi-lateral exchanges between banks and corporates,” he notes. “Commerce by nature is a multi-lateral activity, with buyers, sellers, and their banks exchanging information and promises that result in a transaction. As technology and standards become more sophisticated and accepted, I do see the electronic model evolving more to support a many-to-many environment.”</p>
<p>In the supply chain finance space, consideration will be given to improving connections between buyers, sellers and banks so that financing and the flow of payments and information about goods and services being sold is all in one place. “This is an area where we think there is a lot of efficiency to be created in enabling companies to manage this information much more cleanly,” comments Deveaux. The products or tools that create these connections will come from both banks and independent technology firms, but for him it is essential for banks to try to “break out of just pushing payments from one party to another” and deliver services that help treasurers optimise their use of working capital and improve the efficiency of payment and information flows.</p>
<p>In the coming years Deveaux sees connectivity being taken for granted; this is a good thing. “I see a world where connectivity is much simpler and more straight through as standards mature and become more broadly accepted,” he explains. But he also sees better connectivity between all parties to a transaction, from initial inquiry through to final payment. He also believes that over the next few years the benefits of these multi-party exchanges – seamless exchanges of payments, purchase orders and other commercial information – will be seen on a wider scale.</p>
<h3 id="we-want-information-not-data">We want information not data</h3>
<p>“It’s not just about making transactions, it’s also about pushing information,” says Mark Wraa-Hansen, Global Head of Cash Management Solutions, Danske Bank, commenting on the likely form of new technologies. This is particularly so for mobile devices which are “starting to spill over into treasury”.</p>
<p>Wraa-Hansen believes that treasurers are ultimately looking for flexibility. Solutions will be in demand that enable the pre-definition of a wide range of financial situations, ensuring key decision-makers are getting the information they need from their banks, when and where they need it. The persistent talk of the need for real-time data suggests a matching sense of urgency around the implementation of solutions. “In the future we will see more third-party and bank-owned data hubs into which corporates and their banks can connect,” he predicts.</p>
<p>Standardisation is an enabler for full flexibility and visibility. It clearly takes a while for some propositions to make an impact. However, Wraa-Hansen thinks that the time has come for the long-running TWIST standards group and its Bank Services Billing offering. “Corporates are increasingly looking for transparency in the fees they pay to banks and for the ability to benchmark those fees across banks,” he says. “In this respect, TWIST is a great tool that has not received the attention it deserves.”</p>
<p>The Big Data explosion mentioned above by both Walton and Mattes needs steering in the right direction. “When you have lots of data, intelligence must be applied to generate information that you can then act on,” states Wraa-Hansen. With every client having a different set of needs, tailoring of solutions is a current focus for Danske Bank; the key, he notes, lies in clear communication of ideas and added business value. “It’s one thing to have great technology but if we don’t listen carefully to how it should be applied and what kind of outcome is expected then it is useless.” Treasurers may not typically be early adopters of new technology but, he continues, “I don’t think there is any reluctance to adopt new technology; we just have to articulate and explain how and why it is relevant and what it can do for them”.</p>
<h3 id="be-prepared">Be prepared</h3>
<p>With all this in mind, one important consideration when buying technology is its likely longevity in terms of vendor support. Few products will be carried indefinitely but the decision to ‘sun-set’ a certain offering may be driven, not by commercial reasons, but by the product’s obsolescence in terms of outmoded technology. This may make it increasingly difficult to interface and integrate with other software, may bar the use of modern facilities such as web-based functionality or, even if the function is still working well, become harder to find developers with the knowledge to keep the software relevant. TreasuryWise’s Walton thus notes the inadvertent potential for an existing architecture to “condemn you to a certain set of rails as to how you can develop”. For this reason he urges buyers to at least be aware of the underlying technology of the system being purchased, no matter how new and exciting it may appear to be.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>“It’s about options and accessibility,” says Paul Taylor, Head of Regional Sales, Global Transaction Services (GTS), EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), describing the essentials of a mobile treasury solution. Taylor is keen to point out that making available an alternative to desktop treasury is not about replacing one channel with another, but about augmenting the existing model. It is a laudable goal, yet 82% of respondents to Treasury Today’s European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study 2012 said they had not adopted mobile and only 12% said they would consider using it somewhere down the line.</p>
<p>Enabling financial professionals to access and use company data whilst away from their desktops can, admits Taylor, be seen as “trying to solve a problem that does not exist”. In defence of mobile treasury, critics probably said the same thing about the motor car. Indeed, a revolution has to start somewhere. If the first faltering steps in a new direction are seen as a gimmick then so be it.</p>
<p>Indrajeet Maitra, Head of International Cash Management, Asia at BNP Paribas, is an advocate. He notes that the advent of global supply chains with high interdependence has added “another level of managerial complexity” and that on this basis, the industry is looking at every opportunity to “build bridges” between different functions like purchase, inventory management, payments and foreign exchange. “And mobile treasury nicely fits into this new environment.”</p>
<p>The wholesale adoption of mobile devices in the consumer space – smartphones, PDAs, tablets et al – has seen the technology shift from a ‘want’ to a ‘need’. This gives it two distinct advantages, if and when it moves more fully into the treasury sector: rapid development of the underlying technology is assured; and there is a user base that has already bought into the basic concept of doing things on the move. Maitra feels that in the Asian markets there is already a “willingness, ability and need to take decisions on the go”, the option largely being taken up by the so-called Gen Y age group.</p>
<h4 id="generations-and-geographies">Generations and geographies</h4>
<p>Nick Diamond, Head of Cash and Payment Sales, Commercial Banking, Lloyds Bank, believes in the slow but inevitable shift within the treasury sector towards mobile operations. He too sees a new generation of people coming into treasury that are “comfortable working with mobile because it is the way they lead their personal lives”.</p>
<p>Diamond reasons that if mobile devices are used to make consumer transactions on a day-to-day basis, why wouldn’t they eventually appear in business life? There may be a gap between the slick presentation and user-friendliness of a consumer mobile app and that of a business-dedicated portal, but that gap is narrowing. “There is often an overlap between what people do in the personal and business space, and eventually they tend to influence each other,” agrees Maha El Dimachki, Head of Corporate Sales, GTS, EMEA, BAML. Transferring the consumer experience to the working space will be the way forward; it’s what people are used to and they need to feel comfortable using this technology if it is to take off in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Whilst El Dimachki observes that many treasurers are already happy to carry out certain limited functions on a tablet-style device, some geographic markets are more receptive to the overall concept of mobile transactions than others. As ever, it starts with the consumer segment. Asian countries such as India, Korea and Japan are, she notes, extremely well-disposed to mobile activity. Providers are willing to deliver the necessary solutions to take it further too. Indian mobile payment (m-payment) solutions vendor, iKaaz, for example, launched its own ‘Tap &amp; Pay’ reader in July this year, enabling cashless transactions based on near field communication (NFC) technology. Earlier, in April, DBS became the first bank to offer an NFC-based virtual credit card to customers of all three mobile network operators in Singapore with its DBS One.Tap.</p>
<p>China too is moving rapidly forward with NFC technology, announcing in April this year its proposed specification for a national m-payment standard. China Mobile, which is the world’s largest mobile network operator, and the domestic bank card association, China UnionPay, went live in June with an NFC payments service supported by eight banks, including some of the country’s largest such as Bank of China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and China CITIC Bank. Others connected to the platform so far include China Everbright Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corp, GF Securities, Bank of Shanghai and Bank of Beijing.</p>
<p>There is undoubtedly a very healthy appetite for consumer m-payment services in some Asian markets. A June 2012 survey of the sector across China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia by the Asia Pacific office of consulting and research firm, Analysys Mason, revealed that 65% of those who used their phones for non-voice services claimed to use mobile banking (m-banking), 51% used m-payments and 47% used mobile commerce (m-commerce) services.</p>
<p>The dominance of consumer payment devices such as cash, cards and especially cheques is slowly being eroded by m-payment concepts such as ‘tap and pay’ in some countries. But, says a March 2013 KPMG report, ‘tap and pay’ NFC solutions have generally failed to spark consumer interest. “Until silos are broken down, and there is collaboration across the value chain between merchants, mobile phone companies and financial services organisations, the mass audience will remain unconvinced,” says it’s author, Mark Guinibert, KPMG UK Head of Customer and Channel Management. Recent research by TNS Global shows that 11.9% of UK consumers use their mobiles to make payments and just over 20% use m-banking – a fraction of current levels of Asian uptake, but nonetheless a sizeable chunk of business.</p>
<h4 id="retail-therapy">Retail therapy</h4>
<p>With this in mind, Diamond warns that businesses – certainly retail and utilities-based operations – need to understand how consumers are behaving differently in the sales cycle. The smart ones have been re-designing their business model to accommodate these shifts in behaviour. As Taylor says at the beginning of this article, it is about presenting options.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with treasury? Well, the progress of technology from consumer-user to business-user is self-evident, but if consumer behaviour changes to the point where people take their mobile device shopping with them – not just to make payments but also to research prices, order remotely, receive and respond to context-specific targeted offers and so on – the speed of movement and change of payment traffic has more immediate implications around cash flow, cash forecasting and even funding requirements. “More so than ever, the treasury group cannot act in isolation,” warns Diamond. “It will have to get much closer to its commercial departments.” When a payment is made electronically there is always a data footprint attached. This data can be used to steer the business in its response to buying and payment behaviours, as well as product and service delivery models.</p>
<p>But there is a direct potential use of the mobile device for treasurers, and that is in cash management processes – checking balances and exposures, authorising trades or confirming payments and receiving updates for example.</p>
<h4 id="treasury-resistance">Treasury resistance</h4>
<p>Diamond notes that although many system providers have already created mobile versions of what they do, there has been “some reluctance” within treasury to adopt. Part of the reason, he believes, centres on the “very much office-based” sensibility of many treasury operations; it’s all about history and habit. A major concern, he observes, “is in taking the cycle of treasury processes out of the office environment and in doing so stepping outside of the comfort zone”. A similar reluctance to “embrace the new” can be seen in the persistence of use amongst treasurers of the spreadsheet, even though newer, more efficient technologies may be available.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most commonly cited discomfort is security. “Corporate treasurers still have the perception that mobile technology is not secure, which is a concern consumers also hold,” says Singapore-based Amit Sharma, Director and Head of eCommerce and Channels, Asia Pacific for BAML. “Consumer behaviour drives corporate behaviour, as it is the same person whether they are using personal or corporate access. This perceived security concern is the biggest hindrance to uptake, and something that can be seen on a global basis.”</p>
<p>“The viewpoint is that, if you step outside the ring-fence of office security by using a mobile device, you may be compromising that security by offering more opportunity for criminals to hack into the system,” says Diamond. “The fact is that all electronic technologies are open to hacking as criminals become more sophisticated.” Banks invest vast sums to protect clients (and their reputations) against cyber criminals. The authentication and validation tools deployed on a trusted banking partner’s mobile channel will be as robust as that of its normal treasury offering, so even if your tablet computer gets into the wrong hands it should still be safe.</p>
<p>Barclays’ Managing Director and Head of eChannels, Jon Ashton, does not feel that identity and password security is sufficient to safeguard mobile for corporate clients. The bank’s corporate banking unit is focusing on providing information services first, with payments and payments approval to follow once it has the security operating on a mobile device to a level that can support key commercial needs like non-repudiation. “Barclays is very rigid around using smartcards and readers to protect transactions. We haven’t really found a way of doing that on mobile, so we recognise there is a slightly lower bar there when it came to security.”</p>
<p>For BAML’s Sharma, as consumers and corporates become more confident in the security of mobile devices, the advent of bigger screen sizes in tablet computers will mean that navigation will become easier and the whole user experience will change. “On-the-go treasurers are likely to embrace non-critical activities first, for example accessing current balances or removing a signatory if that employee resigns,” he says. “I don’t believe that treasurers want to bring their whole bank onto their mobile devices – no one would want to initiate mass payments via mobile – but they probably will want to make time-sensitive, critical payments.”</p>
<h4 id="the-providers-problem">The providers’ problem</h4>
<p>“The underlying principle is to what extent is the channel being used to achieve business goals and, more importantly, to what extent it simplifies the process,” notes Maitra. Aware of the reticence to adopt mobile solutions, the response from some banks and vendors, adds Taylor, has been to deliver the “logical on-the-move extension” of existing treasury services which means smartphone and tablet access to an existing cash management portal, rather than attempting to provide something new from scratch. Mobile treasury as it stands today is not, and never has been, a means of phasing out all other channels, he explains, but instead is a way of giving clients access to data “wherever they are and on a device they already have with them”.</p>
<p>However, Diamond takes a different stance, believing that the current lack of appetite has dissuaded many banks and technology vendors from venturing as fully into the mobile environment as they might like. As such, not all functions are available on mobile and so, he feels, the user experience can appear to be a pale imitation of the traditional office-based system. “We are in stalemate at the moment: there is not really the demand for the industry to go the whole way with this and make it the same experience treasurers have in the office; but, on the other side, until the treasurer sees all of the functionality to enable the true remote working experience few will take it on with any real enthusiasm. It is a Catch-22 situation.”</p>
<p>In terms of presentation, most banks accept that if they make their mobile offering a mirror image of what is on the desktop “it’s not going to work”, notes Barclays’ Ashton. This awareness applies to core technology vendors too. An adaptive approach has been used by TMS vendor IT2 which currently offers “fluid movement between desktops, tablets and phones”, with full functionality at hand, using an “automatic adaptive interface” which configures the view according to the device being used, rather than shoe-horning the same view into every format.</p>
<h4 id="now-for-something-completely-different">Now for something completely different</h4>
<p>For Ashton, the big problem for banks has been that unless they can come up with something that treasurers can do on a mobile device that they might not be able to do on their desktop, “then there isn’t really a reason to use mobile”. Whilst many providers are merely replicating their desktop cash management services in the mobile environment, he fails to see the point, arguing that treasurers can and will use their desktop for this purpose.</p>
<p>“We have made a conscious decision to structure our mobile application very differently to our desktop environment,” he says. “When you look at how the iPad, for example, presents data it is very different to how you would present it on a desktop. For a start, we have to make it very simple so that the small screen can represent everything they want to see,” explains Ashton. “The amount of data you can put on a desktop is much greater than you could ever put on mobile.” The idea, he adds, is that users neither have to read nor enter a lot of data.</p>
<p>The key to success may be for treasurers to use mobile treasury as a channel in its own right. If it is seen in this light, different products will start to evolve, steering it away from mere desktop replication but retaining its position to complement the other treasury channels.</p>
<p>Currently, the structure of a treasury operation, the segregation of duties within the team and the actual mobility of the treasurer will dictate the usefulness or otherwise of mobile treasury, says BAML’s El Dimachki. Anyone engaged in intensive number crunching, for example, will not want to work on a tablet, for obvious practical reasons. But as mobile functionality and practicality improve and adoption rates rise (looking to Asia as the most likely leader in this space), it could naturally start to change treasury practices just as the PC and the internet changed how we work and how mobile devices are currently changing norms within the retail sector.</p>
<p>“There is a lot that corporate treasurers can expect from mobile solutions,” comments Maitra. Convergence of platforms and systems will give a single gateway to various applications that “obviate the need to access applications through different channels”. Mobile used as a security token will eliminate the need to carry physical tokens for electronic applications, “and faster, concise, customised analytics will truly aid the decision making process”.</p>
<p>Talk of mobile treasury is more than just background noise but it is yet to make a real impact. It may be necessary to ‘consumerise’ the mobile treasury experience – bringing the same level of service as consumer offerings, with instant access and frequent updates – before users feel at home with it. BAML’s Taylor sums up the essentials of the current approach well by stating that a solution should answer a specific treasury need without harbouring “distractions that detract from the usefulness of the device”. And, he adds, it should never be seen as a means of replacing an entire existing traditional platform. At least for now.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>When it comes to buzzwords in technology, ‘the cloud’ is a popular recent addition. But while it may be a relatively new term, the cloud is not actually a new concept. It represents computing remotely rather than locally, with vendors offering technology solutions that are managed, serviced and hosted remotely, outside the treasury organisation. A software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution is a perfect example of a cloud solution.</p>
<p>As with any new terminology, definition is vital. Some vendors will claim that they offer a solution that is cloud-based because some components are run remotely; or they offer an older technology using an application service provider (ASP) model and call it cloud-based. This can lead to confusion in the marketplace.</p>
<p>When looking at cloud-based solutions, treasurers should ensure they are investing in new technology that they can trust will be expanded upon in the future. The benefit of treasury services in the cloud is that the treasurer does not have to worry about managing the technical infrastructure. Instead, they simply order a service.</p>
<p>With a web-based cloud service, there is nothing to install and no implementation programme to work through. The corporate’s in-house IT department is busy enough with their internal systems, so the more that can be pushed out of house to the software experts, the better it is for both the corporate’s business and IT functions. If something does not work, the treasurer simply calls their supplier who will then take care of the issue. In the payments arena this is a huge value proposition for corporates.</p>
<p>“The cloud computing story should be interesting to treasurers because of the level of innovation that they can receive via these services,” says Joerg Wiemer, CEO, Treasury Intelligence Solutions (TIS). “Every customer is always running on the newest version of the software, which is a big difference compared with the way things used to work.”</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-functionality-for-treasury">Enhanced functionality for treasury</h3>
<p>Cloud-based solutions are available for a large number of treasury functions, such as the headline areas of cash management, payments processing and working capital transactions. Today they can also go deeper into functions such as risk management, derivative trading and tracking, and accounting services for the treasury and accounting groups.</p>
<p>Take payments as an example. The way that the treasurer manages their payments business with a relationship bank can be simpler, faster, cheaper and at a lower risk when using remote rather than local solutions.</p>
<p>From a relationship perspective, the treasurer maintains the direct relationship with their bank representatives. Where the supplier becomes involved is with the technical connectivity between the treasurer’s treasury management system (TMS) and/or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and the bank systems.</p>
<p>Using a cloud-based service for this makes sense for the banks as well, as the core competence of many banks generally lies outside the area of systems integration and connectivity. Rather, their core competency in the transaction space is to execute and manage payments originating in different systems. From a bank perspective, if their corporate customer approaches them with a cloud service supplier, they know that the implementation projects connecting the customer to the bank’s technological infrastructure will be quick and reduce the effort on their side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The cloud computing story should be interesting to treasurers because of the level of innovation that they can receive via these services.”</p>
<p><cite>Joerg Wiemer, CEO, Treasury Intelligence Solutions (TIS)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quality of the data that the bank receives from a cloud platform can be higher than that directly from a corporate via different accounting or ERP systems in the front end. Many suppliers will check some customer data before sending it to the bank. They can carry out format mapping of the data, for example from the SAP payment format IDoc into a bank-specific format or the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) ISO 20022 XML format. This means that the error rate should be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>“A benefit of cloud computing is that a single solution can bring you visibility through your whole treasury function and workflow,” explains Phil Pettinato, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Reval. “This means that you can consolidate this data and get value-added business process optimisation to aid your strategic decision making. There is a push by many treasurers to move out of the local processing of data in disparate systems, which is where a single cloud-based solution comes in.”</p>
<p>Following the 2008 global financial crisis, treasury has become much more strategic within the corporate organisation. The treasurer requires the right solutions, analytic tools and technology in order to provide that strategic level of value back to the organisation. Running on legacy TMS that was primarily designed to track cash and payments may not be the most efficient option available today. The type of sophisticated analytics that the treasurer requires include elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Valuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash flow at risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress testing of portfolios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank account management, where accounts are globally and how they feed back in to foreign exchange (FX) hedging and exposure management for different currencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers also need to understand the procurement risk on their commodities side and exposures to fluctuating commodities prices. All of this data needs to be packaged together into information that allows the treasurer to make the right decisions. If you are trying to do this using disparate legacy systems, by the time all of the data has been organised and analysed it is already old information. On the other hand, investment in cloud-based solutions all feeds into the latest version of the software.</p>
<p>“Cloud solution providers can keep up with market trends and compliance changes, ensuring that all service users remain up-to-date,” explains Reval’s Pettinato. “For example, if a currency was to be split out from the euro, the provider can change the software accordingly, roll it out in the next maintenance release and ensure that all clients are running the new version.” You can’t do that in an ASP/client server environment with multiple versions in the market.</p>
<h3 id="a-changing-landscape">A changing landscape</h3>
<p>The shift to cloud computing for treasury is part evolution, part revolution. On the evolutionary side, when systems that the treasury hosts in-house have fallen behind current industry best practice due to either market or regulatory changes, they become due for an upgrade.</p>
<p>At this point, the cost of upgrading the system, which might be several versions back from the current version, can be problematic for the budget. There are also the issues of internal IT cost and the distraction to the business function as the new version of the same solution is tested and rolled out.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, if the treasurer goes for a cloud-based solution instead, they will join the single version of software that they share with the community of other users, and won’t be left behind in terms of the software they are using. This is currently one of the main drivers behind the adoption of cloud computing for treasury.</p>
<p>“I think there is also some revolution at work with cloud computing, as web-based technology is where the focus of technological advancement is,” says Reval’s Pettinato. “Everyone is realising that in order to get the benefit of, for example, global access to software in a real-time perspective so that subsidiaries and central treasury can all see their exposures, hedges and cash positions, you really need to have this technology. The availability of this technology in the market place is causing this change of mindset.”</p>
<p>For most corporates with an IT budget, when looking for a new system to invest in they are looking to new technologies. Investment in a legacy-type product is not an appealing option.</p>
<p>The IT support provided by cloud solution vendors is another driver for adoption among treasurers. If a problem is encountered with a payments batch, for example, this can be solved quickly on the vendor side, without the treasurer having to arrange a long project. Removing any worries on the technical side of operations leaves the treasurer free to focus on the more strategic elements of the job that add more value to the organisation. TIS’s Wiemer provides an example:</p>
<p>“I recently spoke with a CFO who had a new treasurer joining the company. They discovered that the PC-based station the company used to execute payments had broken down on several occasions. There were problems with their salary payments and suppliers were asking about overdue payments. In turn this created rumours in the market that the company had liquidity problems. The CFO knew that this problem needed to be resolved very quickly.</p>
<p>“Therefore, before the new treasurer could focus on the strategic business partner role of the job, he had to clear up the existing problems. This would not happen with a cloud service, as the provider would have identified and eliminated the problem much earlier.”</p>
<h3 id="the-global-picture">The global picture</h3>
<p>Globally, North American adoption of cloud-based treasury solutions has led the way. Today, Europe and Asia are catching up quickly, with request for information (RFI) and request for proposals (RFPs) for treasury systems increasingly showing a preference for the cloud.</p>
<p>“I have spent some time in Asia over the past few months, in places such as Mumbai, Singapore and Shanghai, to find out more about customer requirements,” says Wiemer. “What I see is that the acceptance of cloud-based services is significantly increasing in all parts of the world.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cloud solution providers can keep up with market trends and compliance changes, ensuring that all service users remain up-to-date.”</p>
<p><cite>Phil Pettinato, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Reval</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We have many clients across the Asia Pacific region in places such as Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore,” says Reval’s Pettinato. “Companies in Asia realise that there are technology trends from outside of their region that they can benefit from, and they are focussed on accepting those technologies they can take advantage of.”</p>
<p>For those whose business touches Europe, SEPA can be a driver for the shift to the cloud. Currently treasurers have a systems issues related to SEPA, with the need to produce the SEPA XML format in the TMS/ERP in time for the looming SEPA migration deadline of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014.</p>
<p>There are two basic options available to achieve this. The first option is to bring in an external consultant to configure the system to make sure that it is SEPA-compliant. Such a project can be time consuming, but perhaps a larger problem at the moment is that it is very difficult to hire such a format specialist consultant as they are likely to be fully booked.</p>
<p>The second option is to outsource this to a cloud provider that can deliver a SEPA out-of-the-box service. This takes the strain for the treasurer and can ensure compliance by the time the SEPA migration end date arrives.</p>
<h3 id="data-security">Data security</h3>
<p>With any remotely hosted technology, there are important questions to ask about where the data is and how secure it is.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>A secure data mindset</h5>
<p>The world is trending towards cloud-based solutions, so where data specifically resides is not necessarily going to be as transparent to everyone. The most important thing is that it is maintained in a secure fashion. Evaluate the company you are contracting with and what their security services are around providing these services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Treasury experience</h5>
<p>If you are a treasurer and want to shift into the cloud, be sure that the service has a good quality of management. Quality means experience in treasury – do they really understand your needs? Look for both experiences in developing solutions that fulfil your needs, as well as in operating these solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>ISO certification</h5>
<p>When evaluating the data security available from cloud solution providers, treasurers should also look for ISO security certifications. This is a quality seal and shows that your supplier has done their homework. Does an ERP provider certify the solutions? Are they SAP-certified? It is important to know this information before making any purchase.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-cloudy-forecast">A cloudy forecast</h3>
<p>The application of cloud computing is part of a transformation that is currently occurring in the traditional treasury technology space. With an increasing focus on risk management, treasurers are looking for sophisticated software that can match their ambition. A shift to the cloud is one way to achieve this.</p>

<h3 id="treasury-talk-cloud-computing">Treasury talk: cloud computing</h3>
<p>Treasury Today recently spoke off-the-record to the Treasurer of an international beverage company headquartered in North America and the Group Treasurer of a global sportswear manufacturer headquartered in Europe, to hear their take on cloud computing.</p>

<p><span>Treasury Today:</span> <em>How long have you been using treasury cloud services?</em></p>


<p><span>North American Treasurer (NA):</span> We are relatively new to this type of service, having been using it for less than a year.</p>


<p><span>European Group Treasurer (EU):</span> It is similar for us, we’ve been using cloud solutions for just over one year.</p>


<p><span>TT:</span> <em>Which areas of your treasury use cloud computing solutions?</em></p>


<p><span>EU:</span> Our treasury uses a cloud solution for bank account management.</p>


<p><span>NA:</span> We use one cloud-based TMS provider for all traditional treasury areas, including front office trading and back office confirmations, cash positioning, straight through processing (STP) of payments/settlements, short-term cash forecasting, and the general ledger interface of treasury activity to our ERP system.</p>


<p><span>TT:</span> <em>What benefits do you feel that you receive from using treasury cloud services?</em></p>


<p><span>NA:</span> The cloud solution allows for maximum IT infrastructure flexibility in a straight through trading, confirmation and payment solution model. In addition, unlimited licensed users allow treasury to further roll out forecasting, reporting, and the inter-company netting process to business users outside of treasury.</p>


<p><span>EU:</span> Yes it is similar from our perspective, the ability to run one global standard platform is key.</p>


<p><span>TT:</span> <em>Do you have any concerns about using treasury cloud services?</em></p>


<p><span>EU:</span> Confidentiality would be our biggest concern.</p>


<p><span>NA:</span> Yes, security concerns will always exist. We try to mitigate this risk with several layers of authentication and other methods of protection. The cloud service eliminates the concern of a long-term commitment versus the previous server installed investment model. Given the flurry of consolidation in the industry that we have seen of late, we weigh these concerns against the ability to maintain flexibility to participate in future technology improvements.</p>


<p><span>TT:</span> <em>Are there other treasury functions in your department that you would like to move to the cloud in the future?</em></p>


<p><span>NA:</span> We would like to see additional back office paper for bank signatories, bank account documentation and bank invoice volumes and fees migrated to an all-in-one cloud service.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Widening global footprints and a sharper focus on process efficiency have driven corporates to look for ways to harness the convenience and ubiquity of mobile technology for their financial services. In this piece we give an overview of the applications of mobile banking technology in the corporate environment and take an in-depth look at Deutsche Bank’s mobile authorisation technology solution that is available in Asia.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In recent years, the usage and scope of mobile banking technology has expanded as mobile handsets have become increasingly sophisticated and networks have become progressively more powerful and wide reaching. Indeed, according to Juniper Research it is estimated that by 2011, 150m people around the world will be using their mobile phones to perform banking and payment services.</p>
<p>An important driver behind mobile banking is the fact that the technology is no longer confined to voice activities – today the networks are capable of transmitting data, meaning that a new array of services has become available in the mobile space. Handsets can now act as a portal to a bank’s financial services, in a similar way to internet banking.</p>
<p>So far, developments in the mobile banking area – particularly payments – have largely been focused on the consumer market. As these services expand, however, banks are continuing to improve mobile banking provision for corporates, making payment processes more efficient, secure, flexible and user-friendly.</p>

<h3 id="why-mobile-technology">Why mobile technology?</h3>
<p>Due to its simplicity and limited resource requirements, mobile banking technology is of particular interest in emerging market areas, such as Asia. Typically, the demographics of emerging economies mean that a large part of the population (therefore including employees) is unbanked. Despite this lack of access to banking services, the use of mobile phones is widespread – in fact the International Telecommunication Union’s ICT Development Index, March 2009 suggests that around 61% of the world’s population owns a mobile phone.</p>
<p>As such, mobile technology can be used to bridge the gap through the use of ‘mobile wallets’ for example, whereby companies could pay their employees by crediting a mobile account. Likewise, emerging market countries are often under-banked, meaning that those people that do have a bank account may not have sufficient access to a branch and its services. Mobile banking technology can allow payments to be made and received in remote areas and in real-time.</p>
<p>In terms of purely corporate usage, mobile technology can offer several applications to corporates on the move, which include initiating and authorising money transfers as well as receiving status updates and alerts.</p>
<p>Corporates are becoming more sophisticated in the services that they use to manage their cash and regulators are also looking at leveraging technology to introduce more efficient processes. As a consequence, banks are striving to provide cutting edge solutions and thereby driving the use of technology.</p>
<p>Another reason why mobile technology has taken off in the corporate space recently is the increased emphasis on working capital optimisation and efficient receivables management since the onset of the financial crisis. In order to achieve both of these goals, corporates are looking for real-time information to allow them to react quickly to situations and update their ERP systems accordingly.</p>
<p>In the field of consumer goods, for example, updating the ERP system more rapidly means that goods can be shipped earlier or dealer limits released earlier. In turn, this means that the customer is better served, relationships are improved and company turnover ratios are increased.</p>
<h3 id="enabling-clients-with-innovative-solutions">Enabling clients with innovative solutions</h3>
<p>A leader in the Asian mobile banking technology space, Deutsche Bank has pioneered a mobile authorisation solution for corporates looking to leverage on this technology:</p>
<h4 id="mobile-authorisation">Mobile authorisation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h4>
<p>Leveraging Deutsche Bank’s proven internet banking platform – db direct internet – mobile authorisation is a service that allows corporates to approve electronic transactions through the use of a smartphone such as a BlackBerry, iPhone or Palm Treo. With this mobile authorisation solution, corporates can access transactional information on-the-go in a flexible yet secure environment.</p>
<p>Once the transactions are loaded up by the company onto db direct internet, the workflow is very straightforward.</p>

<p class="source">For best results, it is recommended to use a smartphone with a wide screen such as BlackBerry, iPhone or Palm Treo. This will make navigation easier for viewing and authorisation.</p>
</figure>
<h5 id="security">Security</h5>
<p>Company authorisers log in to the db direct internet mobile connection by loading the URL and typing in their user ID and dynamic token number.</p>
<p>In addition to this two-factor authentication, data transmission between users’ smartphones and the db direct internet server is fully encrypted using a PKI methodology to ensure privacy, integrity and confidentiality of data.</p>
<h5 id="benefits">Benefits</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Roaming access to transaction information for all types of payments and collections through a state-of-the-art infrastructure. Authorisations can be made on the move and in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to real-time information on pending transactions and availability of summary and detail level information as preferred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-friendly interface that can be accessed simply by using a GPRS, EDGE or WiFi enabled smartphone. There is no need for expensive technology set-up or installation.</p>

<h5>How established is the mobile authorisation technology market in Asia?</h5>
<p>Use of this technology in Asia, as in the rest of the world, is relatively new. While consumer banking has taken a leap in adopting mobile technology, the operating model of mobile authorisation for corporate clients is new.</p>
<p>Although the market is pretty much in its infancy, the consensus is that this will grow dramatically over the next couple of years. At Deutsche Bank we have made it a priority to enter into this space now – at a time when markets are being tested and the players really have a chance to prove themselves. This is a good opportunity for us to find a niche in the market.</p>
<p>In rolling out this solution in the Asian market, what we have found is that across the region there are certain countries which are more closely regulated. In those countries, we are still working closely with the regulators to deploy some of these banking products.</p>
<p>Given a fast growing mobile phone ownership rate in China, we feel that this is an opportune time to offer mobile authorisation in China. This solution provides flexibility and ease of access and caters to multinational corporate, large local corporate and financial institutions which have a growing presence in China.</p>
<h5>What differentiates Deutsche Bank’s mobile authorisation technology offering?</h5>
<p>When we were developing this solution, we were conscious as to how we could make the solution popular among corporates. We found that one of the influencing factors was the time it takes to implement the solution. There are two ways in which mobile authorisation, for example, can be implemented: either you have a piece of software which you install on the mobile device, or the other option is to give the client a URL and they access it from their handset.</p>
<p>With the implementation timeframe in mind, we decided that we would go with the URL option as it is much quicker. Also, if someone lost their mobile phone they would have to install the software again on a new handset, which is of course not the case when using the URL solution. This speedy setup is definitely an advantage for all parties involved.</p>
<h5>Who are the target customers for this mobile authorisation solution?</h5>
<p>For mobile authorisation, I would say potentially any type of client, but the benefits will obviously be much greater for clients that are often on the go and for those operating across multiple regions or countries.</p>
<p>There are no specific technological requirements for customers – just a smartphone – so the solution really is open to all corporates.</p>

<h3 id="strategic-developments-going-forward">Strategic developments going forward</h3>
<p>Keen to expand on its current offering, Deutsche Bank’s Global Transaction banking (GTB) division has recently partnered with Luup, a European-based mobile payment provider, to extend its mobile capabilities to 80 countries across Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a major commercial bank has offered a cross-border mobile payments service to both banking and corporate customers. It is expected that the first Luup implementations will take place within the next six to 12 months.</p>
<p>Within the foreseeable future, the bank will also be looking at strategically expanding the scope of its existing corporate solutions and mobile platform by incorporating features such as account and FX information.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As mobile technology solutions develop, it is likely that in the near future treasurers will have both sufficient information and technological capabilities to make effective business decisions remotely.</p>
<p>With high expectations for mobile solutions in emerging, fragmented, or geographically disparate economies, countries in Asia such as China and India, with a large landmass and pockets of economic activity, look well positioned to benefit from mobile banking technology going forward.</p>
