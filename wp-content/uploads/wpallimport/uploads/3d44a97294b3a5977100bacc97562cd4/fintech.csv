<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Technology continues to provide new opportunities for treasury teams to streamline their processes and improve efficiency. Banks, meanwhile, are drawing inspiration from fintechs to accelerate innovation and roll out new solutions for their corporate clients. So what does this mean for treasury teams, and how can treasurers play a more active role in developing the solutions they need?</p>
<h4 id=""thinking-like-a-fintech"">Thinking like a fintech</h4>
<p>In today’s fast-moving world, banks cannot afford to stand still. As such, forward-thinking banks are increasingly taking steps to transform their product teams into in-house fintechs, explains Tony Wimmer, Head of Data &amp; Analytics at J.P. Morgan Payments.</p>
<p>Given that payments are the lifeblood of the world’s economy, and given the role that banks play in ensuring money moves across the economy, Wimmer argues that banks “have a true homefield advantage” when it comes to leading innovation in payments. “At J.P. Morgan alone, we move over US$9trn each and every day,” he says. “There’s a lot of data in there, and data is what powers artificial intelligence and products.”</p>
<p>Wimmer notes that banks have unique knowledge, from client needs to local regulations. Likewise, they have data on “who pays whom, how, when, and how often” for their corporate clients – this “Payment Intelligence” as Wimmer describes “ is very hard for anybody else to replicate.” In addition, he points out that banks have “tremendous access to talent,” not least because of the investments they have made in technology and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>In order to bring all this to life, says Wimmer, banks need to “think like a fintech” and follow the same principles that have made fintechs successful. In particular, banks need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operate a state-of-the-art data product platform with a micro services architecture that enable teams to deliver prototypes early, get client feedback, and make changes with every sprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the highest priority products with a well-defined product vision – and commit to multi-year programmes to deliver against this vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be “obsessed” with clients – client needs are at the centre of a product and “design thinking” is an important part of a product team’s capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace adaptive and iterative development in collaboration with clients</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""power-of-collaboration"">Power of collaboration</h4>
<p>Where collaboration is concerned, there is much to be gained by designing solutions in tandem with clients, says JB Commans, Head of Treasury Data Products at J.P. Morgan Payments. He explains that the bank works with a panel of clients that are excited to participate as thought partners in the cocreation of products.</p>
<p>While every product is different, the co-creation process involves a number of steps: in the first instance, research is needed to pinpoint and prioritise the problems that need to be solved and identify the right client for the product development. J.P. Morgan then works closely with the client at every step in the design process to make sure the original problem is being addressed.</p>
<p>“We rely upon this iterative process to make sure we address the right problems,” says Commans. “That’s key to the co-designing process – we want to solve a practical problem, and co-design is how we ensure this happens.”</p>
<h4 id=""cocreating-in-practice"">Cocreating in practice</h4>
<p>A recent example of this approach was a cocreation project with Evoqua Water Technologies, a leading provider of water and wastewater treatment solutions. Building on the success of other cocreation projects with Evoqua, J.P. Morgan approached the company to propose working together on a new AI-powered cash flow forecasting solution.</p>
<p>“J.P. Morgan is the lead cash management bank for Evoqua, and has seen roughly 90-95% of all the cash transactions we do as a global company,” says Corporate Treasurer Ariel Kuperminc. “To have them come forward and demonstrate a commitment to work with us in transforming our data into actionable information in a consistent solution only emphasises the value of this relationship for both parties.”</p>
<p>As with most treasuries, Evoqua places considerable importance on its cash flow forecast, which is used as the basis of many cash management decisions. “As a treasurer, you wake up in the morning and wonder where your money is, where it’s going and where you need to place it,” comments Kuperminc. “So having a software tool that goes out weeks and months gives us comfort in the decisions we make for borrowing and repaying.”</p>
<p>When it came to collaborating on the new forecasting software tool, the initial discussions about Evoqua’s cash flow forecasting processes and needs were an essential first step in the process. “Sometimes you feel like you’re being interviewed in order to fit into someone’s process that has already been designed,” says Kuperminc. “In this particular conversation, there were questions the J.P. Morgan team returned to several times about how we think about things and how we use our forecast.”</p>
<p>In subsequent stages of the process, J.P. Morgan continued to take a thorough approach, seeking feedback on the tool and making sure it was fully aligned with Evoqua’s needs, adds Jordan McFarland, Treasury Analyst. “Ultimately any feedback I gave resulted in more tweaks, and then J.P. Morgan would ask me for more feedback on how that reacted,” he recalls. “It was truly a collaboration, with a lot of back-and-forth between the design team and our treasury team.”</p>
<h4 id=""benefits-of-ai-powered-forecasting"">Benefits of AI-powered forecasting</h4>
<p>Once Evoqua’s team was comfortable with the layout and features of the forecasting software , the tool was implemented as part of the company’s standard process for forecasting. The resulting tool makes use of a variety of different forecasting models, running an AI algorithm that uses historical transaction data to choose the best fit model for the company’s particular transactions.</p>
<p>“On top of the advanced AI, we have the ability to investigate any specific spike in the company’s history. You can click on any day and find out what happened that day transaction by transaction. This provides the layer of context you need to fully explain the numbers you are presenting,” notes Commans. “And if that spike was a one-off event that is never going to repeat itself, you can choose to take it out of the equation so that the AI won’t factor it in.”</p>
<p>Likewise, treasury teams might know that a large flow is due in three months’ time, and add that one-off to the results. “It’s about creating an end-to-end intelligent workflow solution, where all these layers of human knowledge can be integrated with the AI,” Commans says. “At the press of a button, all this information flows through the process.”</p>
<p>Evoqua uses both top-down and bottom-up forecasting techniques at a company-wide level, as well as a ‘back of an envelope’ forecast. Compared to other methods, the AI model “is very much more informed, keeping a lot of history and being able to look at the patterns we’re unable to pick out,” says Kuperminc. “It’s less prone to human error – and a process that would otherwise take hours now takes just two minutes.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-road-to-self-driving-treasury"">The road to self-driving treasury</h4>
<p>Turning to the future, Wimmer and Commans envisage a future in which companies can use AI to build a self-driving treasury organisation.</p>
<p>“There is a version of our future where Artificial Intelligence is fully trained to recommend, and then even accomplish tasks for treasurers,” explains Wimmer. “In this bionic world, the AI executes day-to-day, simple tasks. It finds patterns invisible to the human eye, bringing attention to critical issues – so humans can focus on what they do best: finding creative solutions to complex problems.”</p>
<p>The cash forecasting solution, for example, not only compares cash flows over time, but also uses AI to build an added layer of insights on top of the company’s data. “The next stage will be to have AI recommending actions – for example, you could programme it to optimise your working capital, or decide what currency to send a payment in, to optimize your foreign exchange fees,” says Commans.</p>
<p>The final step – “and the one we’re all very excited about” – is to create a feedback loop whereby treasurers can indicate that recommendations made by the AI are beneficial, Commans adds. “And when you’ve collected enough information about this, the AI can start doing things on your behalf, which is really what we’re driving for.”</p>
<p>Evoqua’s McFarland agrees that the idea of self-driving treasury is a welcome prospect, noting that some types of recommendations could bring considerable value to many of the company’s routine processes. “If we could get to a place that our banking infrastructure just knows that we need to move X amount from one account to another on Wednesdays, without us having to be reactive to certain events, that would make our lives even easier,” he concludes.</p>

<p><em>By combining banking, technology and innovation, SC Ventures, Standard Chartered’s innovation, investment and ventures arm, is creating new business models that are solving treasury’s most pressing challenges.</em></p>
<p style=""margin:2em 0 2em 0;""><a class=""button--red-stroke"" href=""/podcasts/innovation-at-standard-chartered"">Listen to podcast</a></p>
<p>Set up four years ago, SC Ventures is Standard Chartered’s business unit that promotes innovation, invests in disruptive financial technology and explores alternative business models. It has already incubated over thirty ventures across a number of themes, with ten ventures up and running. One of the high conviction themes is SMEs and World Trade where SC Ventures is creating an ecosystem of ventures. One such venture is Olea, a Singapore-based trade finance origination and distribution platform. The other is SOLV, a B2B digital commerce venture in India that also provides small and medium enterprises access to financing and yet another is TASConnect a bank agnostic supply chain finance platform that unlocks significant value for organisations.</p>
<p>“SC Ventures is distinct from other Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) arms as it brings together an innovation lab, investment fund and venture building under one umbrella,” explains Gurdeep Singh Kohli, one of the founding members of SC Ventures at Standard Chartered, based in the UK. “The venture building arm is creating an ecosystem of business models with partners across six themes and across markets; the investment fund balances the strategic and financial objectives by taking minority investments in FinTechs we have worked with and helps them scale, and the innovation lab has capabilities such as the Fintech Bridge and the Intrapreneurship programme which we are now offering as a service to clients.”</p>
<p>The team has built a diversified portfolio of ventures and investments across six key themes (digital banking and lifestyle; SMEs and world trade; online economy and payments; digital assets; sustainability and inclusion and capabilities as-a-service) all woven together by a keen purpose. “Our aim is to rewire the DNA in banking and be a force for good by fulfilling society’s expectation of banking and finance,” says Kohli.</p>
<p>The work of SC Ventures is particularly timely now. It is at the nexus of technology changing the role not just of banking but also corporate treasury and how companies interact with their banks. The unit also seeks out solutions to corporate challenges in today’s macro environment, like pressure on real-time payments and financing and increasing liquidity costs as governments unwind Quantitative Easing (QE). “Corporates are also facing disruption in supply chains, leading to the need to both ensure the resilience of their supply chains and integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices,” says Singapore-based Amelia Ng, CEO at Olea, a trade finance platform formed as a joint venture between Standard Charted and Linklogis, a supply chain finance technology provider in China.</p>
<h4 id=""strategic-partnerships"">Strategic partnerships</h4>
<p>Partnership is a key tenet of SC Ventures’ model, be it with clients or FinTechs. Most of the ventures either already have or will be built with a strategic partner.</p>
<p>Northern Trust partnered with Standard Chartered to launch Zodia Custody, an institutional grade custody solution for digital assets. Lenovo is the first anchor client and co-creation partner for TASConnect and more recently, SBI Holdings of Japan became a strategic partner and investor in SOLV.</p>
<p>Partnering with FinTech’s has yielded some of the most exciting innovations, in a process where SC Ventures strives for end-to-end engagement. It begins with scouting for solutions, doing a proof of concept and culminating in investment and helping those companies scale. “FinTech bridge is an open platform where close to 2,500 FinTechs have registered to date and where the bank and its clients can post business challenges,” explains Kohli. “The skills are complementary. FinTechs bring new technology, a culture of experimentation, efficiency, and a forward-looking view of the world, while Standard Chartered has institutional knowledge of banking, an understanding of client pain-points and the ability to build secure, bank-grade infrastructure as well as deep institutional relationships.”</p>
<p>Olea illustrates this partnership mindset. The platform offers trade finance to businesses, particularly SMEs and provides an opportunity to invest in trade finance for institutional investors who are keen to tap an asset class less correlated with bonds and equities. Olea combines the two through technology, enabling deal origination, payment services, data value creation and risk management.</p>
<p>Olea’s active promotion of sustainable economic development and inclusion in underserved markets also reflects ESG integration in SC Ventures’ companies. “Emerging markets in Asia are a very fertile ground for origination of suitable ESG or impact assets given the agenda for energy transition and financial inclusion,” explains Ng. “The pressure on treasurers and CFOs of corporations to provide appropriate ESG metrics on their supply chains will be relentless in the years to come. This is a complex topic and an area where technology and data analytics will be of considerable help.”</p>
<p>The new companies emerging from SC Ventures offer treasury solutions across securities services to payments, supply chain, trade finance and FX. Scaling innovative solutions takes time because of the complexity, bank-grade security, and high governance standards, but Kohli and Ng are also convinced that it is one of the most exciting areas of financial services. “This is a space for FinTechs, clients and banks to really collaborate given the complimentary skills. It combines the power of innovation and experimenting with institutional knowledge and scale,” concludes Kohli.</p>

The great technology rethink,"


<p><em>While for some treasury departments technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning remain something of a mystery, the lockdowns and remote working that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic have forced a rethink of treasury technology platforms.</em></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>As the modern financial system has become increasingly complicated, treasury solutions have evolved accordingly to help teams manage FX risk, cross-border payments, inflation and reconciliations, says Ola Oyetayo, CEO at cross-border payments platform Verto. During the past 15 years, digital treasury solutions “have really beefed up and become pretty sophisticated”, he adds.</p>
<p>“The adoption of innovative technologies within treasury is still at an early stage, the signs point to much broader adoption over the next three to five years as the relevance of these technologies to treasury becomes much clearer,” says Himashi Soriano, Managing Director, APAC at the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP). “The move towards predictive and prescriptive analytics will elevate treasury performance and help mitigate several current risks, from forecasting to cybercrime. Modern technologies will certainly redefine what is possible.”</p>
<p>Eric Aillet, Product Manager, Financial Messaging Marketplaces, Finastra, says there is a “clear appetite” for treasuries to switch to the latest technology, but the transition can be slow for a number of reasons. “As a cost centre, treasury needs to justify return on investment to trigger the related investment in technology,” he says. “Additionally, not all treasury ecosystem players, including banks, software providers and internal systems are at the same level of readiness.”</p>
<p>Another factor is risk – because treasuries are by their nature risk averse, many do not want to be first movers, but prefer to adopt proven solutions. This is a point also made by Singapore-based independent treasury consultant David Blair. “Because treasuries tend to be risk averse, most do not rush into new technologies, preferring to be fast followers.” Compared to other functions of a business, treasury “is in the middle of the pack” in its use of advanced technology.</p>
<p>Stephen Randall, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, says of treasuries’ use of technology: “As you’d expect, there’s a wide spectrum out there.” Drawing on Citi Treasury Diagnostics’ global benchmarking survey, he and colleague Duncan Cole, Principal, Client Advisory Group in the Treasury and Trade Solutions division of the bank, say there is good news and “not so good news” about the use of technology in treasuries.</p>
<p>The good news is that companies are continuing to deploy technology to advance treasury, with 68% of survey respondents having already deployed a treasury management system (TMS) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) treasury module. Almost two-thirds of respondents are looking at transformative opportunities across both their core business and treasury function.</p>
<p>“Less than half of respondents now report multiple e-banking platforms at each location, which indicates a shift to data transmission from banks, rather than reliance on accessing multiple bank portals,” says Cole.</p>
<p>The not so good news is that many companies have “significant gaps” in deploying technology, with low levels of automation and connectivity. For example, only 63% of companies concentrate cash at a global or regional level, despite the availability of automated global pooling solutions from major banks. Nearly a quarter (23%) of companies have incomplete (less than 75% of total cash) daily visibility over cash positions. This is despite the fact that visibility and centralisation of cash and risk are a “core mantra for treasuries”, say Randall and Cole.</p>
<p>Randall adds: “Straight through processing is key for timely decision-making and reducing the risk of fraud. However, 79% of companies have not fully integrated their TMS/ERP platforms with banks despite existing well-established standards. This extends even within the firm: 64% of companies report that their TMS is not integrated or only partially integrated with their ERP.”</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is cash forecasting inaccuracy – a “key pain point for liquidity planning” says Randall. Of those surveyed, 80% were reliant on spreadsheets within their technology stack for forecasting. “While it is true that more than half of companies find their TMS technology does not support cash forecasting, today, fintechs and banks (sometimes in partnership) provide viable solutions.”</p>


<blockquote><p>For those companies who have the necessary core infrastructure in place and resolved the data veracity challenges, the focus is one of process automation, process/machine integration through application programming interfaces, and data analytics and insights through machine learning techniques.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The issue with technology gaps, says Randall, is that they “create cracks in the foundations of treasury management. That is never a good place to be but that can get glossed over when times are good, liquidity is plentiful, and risk is muted. But all comes home to roost when there is a crisis.”</p>
<p>Blair also sees gaps in treasuries’ technology deployments, saying the pandemic forced treasuries to digitise in order to cope with remote working. “This has revealed technology gaps and opened interest in the cloud. In this sense, Covid has pushed treasuries to evolve their technology platforms.”</p>
<p>Soriano says the pandemic accelerated the need for a more agile, secure and scalable IT infrastructure at treasuries. “The forces of digital disruption are now driving change and it is really a case of ‘when’ and not ‘if’ a company will embrace treasury technologies. With change and uncertainty becoming the new normal, the need for operational agility cannot be underestimated. It is critical for survival that companies remain both relevant and competitive in these constantly evolving times.”</p>
<p>Oyetayo says treasury teams that relied heavily on legacy software, standalone Excel spreadsheets and working in-person during the pandemic, began to see great urgency in switching to alternative digital ways. “Once the adopters of digital treasury technologies feel the benefits and efficiency of such software, they will be more ‘sticky’ and continue to use them for a long period of time,” he says.</p>
<p>The pandemic instilled much creativity in treasury departments, says Enrico Camerinelli, Strategic Advisor at consultancy Aite-Novarica Group. This creativity included the exchange of digital documents with electronic signatures and systems that enabled treasuries to keep transactions going in the absence of “total electronic facilities” such as for invoices or payments. “A lot of attention was paid to the treasury departments’ technology strategies, mostly devoted to moving from manual and paperwork into digital exchange of documents and transactions.”</p>
<p>Of the technologies treasuries are pursuing as they rethink their strategies, cloud is a standout.</p>
<p>“AFP research shows corporate treasurers view the advance of cloud computing as the most important technological developments over the next three to five years,” says Soriano. “Cloud-based solutions are becoming the technology deployment model of choice, given the advantages like accelerated implementation, lower costs, and greater agility.”</p>
<p>Treasuries are becoming more open to cloud, says Blair as COVID-19 has driven remote working and the resultant need to connect and work from “anywhere”.</p>
<p>Citi’s survey found a broad interest in “all things digital” in treasury and finance, says Cole. This includes the utilisation of emerging technologies for process automation and data-led insights. “Driving both efficiency within treasury and augmenting decision making are now the top two expectations for investing in emerging technologies,” he says.</p>
<p>However, cost and integration of emerging technologies within established environments remain the top two hurdles that need to be overcome for transformational change to take place. Depending on the level of treasury sophistication, appetite/ambition, previous investment in technologies and level of proficiency in data management, a range of proven and emerging technologies are now being deployed, says Randall.</p>
<p>Banks like Citi are helping companies to improve their treasury management capabilities and processes through innovations such as real-time multi banking for cash concentration and real-time liquidity sharing. Such technologies enable treasuries to optimise working capital by facilitating liquidity mobilisation between surplus and deficit accounts in real time.</p>
<p>“For those companies who have the necessary core infrastructure in place and resolved the data veracity challenges, the focus is one of process automation, process/machine integration through application programming interfaces, and data analytics and insights through machine learning techniques,” says Randall.</p>
<p>Three quarters of Citi’s survey respondents indicated that data analytics and insights were the biggest area of opportunity yet only 34% of them are pursuing this area within treasury. This may be due to the infrastructural and data challenges most companies experience today, says Cole.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Oyetayo also cites data analytics as an area of focus. “Analytics, automation and data processing significantly reduce the amount of effort and time needed to manage liquidity, reconciliations and cash flows. The application of machine learning and data science will be most beneficial to creating cash and liquidity forecasts, helping teams anticipate problems and consequently plan ahead.”</p>
<p>He believes that as they rethink their technology strategies, treasuries will be most focused on data processing related to spreadsheet software like Excel, as managing different sets of financial data is “a core part of a treasury’s jobs”. This process involves collecting data, cleaning data, uploading and processing it.</p>
<p>“Since it was first invented and adopted, data processing has helped mundane, data-entry jobs become more efficient,” says Oyetayo. “Over the decades, spreadsheets software has evolved to make entering, cleaning and processing data much more efficient. With data science tools such as SQL and Python coming into play, it will become even easier and quicker to process big data sets. These tools allow teams to generate high quality data to be inputted into other treasury solutions, such as a reconciliation software, easily.”</p>
<p>Finastra’s Aillet says there are several areas where corporate treasuries are looking to adopt new technologies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improving business operations through increased digitalisation, predictability and automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing transaction security, for example, by using AI to scan payments and detect fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streamlining the IT landscape to reduce costs and benefit from better integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing traditional bank fees by adopting fintech solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main areas of the treasury organisation that receive much attention in regard to automation, he adds. “Transaction processing has been an area of focus since 2000 and a lot of solutions are available, including for back office processing, cash concentration, accounting postings and reconciliation. The other area is decision making, where new technologies are bringing another dimension to this area and enabling processes to be automated.”</p>
<p>In decision making, AI and robotic process automation are being used to ensure high quality data is available that can be used as the basis for hedging, delivering greater predictability to treasuries. APIs and RPA are being used to automate and link information across systems, including dealing platforms, position-keeping systems such as TMS, as well as systems for matching and for payment execution. Finally, fintechs and other new players are bringing greater efficiency by digitalising financial services using technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledgers.</p>
<p>“Each treasury is unique in terms of the setup of its banking ecosystem, IT landscape and its appetite to adopt new technology and change the way it operates,” says Aillet. “Each also has a different risk threshold – knowing that the consequences of anything going wrong could be significant for the business. Treasury systems providers need to make it easy for treasuries to adopt new technologies while also supporting integration across the rest of the internal ecosystem so that ERP systems are aligned as well.”</p>
<p>Blair says treasuries should work holistically to identify their biggest challenges in terms of wasted time and heightened risk (which are also great opportunities for improvement), and then find practical solutions. “These solutions may not (and generally do not) require bleeding edge technology. This pragmatic approach will generate the most value add. These challenges vary across industries, business models, and corporate cultures.”</p>
<p>Camerinelli says many treasury departments still have a fight on their hands getting the budget for technology. “Another problem is that many times when I speak to treasurers, they tell me that they have an abundance of offerings, but sometimes what they are offered from fintech vendors are over-engineered or much more than what they need. Technology transition is difficult for treasurers because it is not easy to compare different solutions if you don’t have the specific skill sets required.”</p>

<p>The starting point for successful digital transformation in treasury, says Sharon Wang, Treasury Director at Alibaba.com, does not lie in increasing cutting edge technologies, but in improving business processes. Once this has been done, the technologies can follow.</p>
<p>Speaking during a panel session on instant treasury at financial messaging cooperative SWIFT’s annual operations conference Sibos in October, Ms Wang detailed the impressive treasury capabilities deployed by the online business-to-business marketplace for global trade.</p>
<p>Alibaba.com has developed an inhouse real-time treasury management system, called TMI, which governs all processes. New digital technologies have enabled Alibaba.com to implement instant payments. Technologies include robotic process automation (RPA), application programming interfaces (APIs), big data and artificial intelligence (AI). The company has also piloted a blockchain scheme for instant B2B payments in selected countries. With 17,000 outgoing payments every day, the company has implemented an AI chatbot that tracks a unique ID given to each payment, enabling the real-time status of any payment to be known.</p>
<p>The company has five full-time staff in its payments team and six contractors, none of whom has to handle a payment enquiry manually. “Artificial intelligence saves our time every day,” Ms Wang said.</p>
<p>While Alibaba.com has built an impressive treasury, many firms are still at the starting point of digital transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has, for many, accelerated plans, acting almost as a ‘stress test’ of existing processes and operations. Digitalisation projects that may have been lagging are being accelerated to address inefficiencies exposed by the dramatic changes to consumer and business behaviours that have arisen during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“COVID forced companies online and to embrace e-commerce, new forms of digital commerce and reimagine supply chains,” Mark Smith, Global Head of Liquidity Products, Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking, told Sibos TV. “Banks and corporates saw increases in online payments, reductions of paper-based payments and a shift of momentum and acceleration in digital transformation.”</p>
<p>Mr Smith identified six key technology elements of digital transformation: cloud computing, APIs, RPAs, machine learning, AI and virtual accounts. “COVID has required treasurers to have a better view of their actual and projected liquidity positions to manage risk. Those treasuries with better analysis and data and better prediction tools will have a better view of liquidity and can better serve their organisations. Digital tools such as virtual accounts are a great way for treasurers to embrace new technology to manage risk and improve working capital management.”</p>
<p>Himashi Soriano, Managing Director APAC, Association for Financial Professionals (AFP), says the pandemic has accelerated the momentum toward a digital-first strategy as companies in the region look to stay competitive and relevant in the current environment.</p>
<p>In starting out, treasurers should keep in mind that a digital transformation roadmap is more than just the technology, it needs to embrace the broader business strategy, with collaboration and partnership being the key to success, says Ms Soriano. “Technology is foundational to unlocking both the opportunity for competitive advantage and achieving greater operational and financial efficiency. Establishing a roadmap that focuses on a digital first foundation should be viewed as an essential journey.”</p>
<p>As with any journey, it’s vitally important to have the destination, the end goal, in mind, says Andy Schmidt, Vice-President and Global Industry Lead for Banking, at IT and business consulting company CGI. “For treasurers looking to embark on a digital transformation effort, there are a number of key questions to ask. What is the priority? Is it liquidity? Access to credit? Do I want a single view of my account balances? Does this information need to be in real time? And the most important question of all – does my bank – or any bank – provide these services in the way that I need them, or do I need to work with multiple banks, and possibly third-party providers, to achieve the desired outcome?”</p>
<p>Understanding the desired end state, the mix of products and services that are needed, and the capabilities of providers will help treasurers embark on a digital transformation journey that has the greatest chance of success, he adds.</p>
<p>The AFP has ten guiding principles for digital transformation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spot a lighthouse project to start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital transformation is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware of budgets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ownership and accountability are key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not fall into the buzzwords trap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurture a digital culture. Get your treasury team digital ready with specialised training programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is not a solution, but an enabler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let the big picture change as new data emerges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be wary of the marriage between technology and ethics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protection is vital.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital technologies are providing opportunities to optimise and elevate the treasury function with real-time applications, says Ms Soriano. She identifies many of the same technologies cited by Mr Smith and Ms Wang. Cloud technology can be applied to treasury management and enterprise resource planning systems, APIs for real-time payment and balance enquiry, RPAs for cash positioning and FX exposures identification, AI and machine learning for cash flow forecasting, fraud and risk management and predictive analytics, and distributed ledger technology for know your customer processes and reconciliation.</p>
<p>“The strength of these digital technologies in the transformation journey does not lie purely in the individual technologies themselves. The real strength and value are linked to how companies embed these technologies into their operations to transform the business,” she says.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is not new and has been a key enabler for treasury and business in the past few years, says Ankur Kanwar, Head of Cash Products, ASEAN and Global Head of Structured Solutions Development, Standard Chartered. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated this, he says. “With work from home environments in almost all markets, digitising basic treasury operations like cash flow analytics and payment processing, at the very minimum, has become a top priority for corporates.”</p>
<p>But there are also a number of other factors that are driving an acceleration in digital transformation projects, he adds. These include the shift towards real time. “Real-time information exchange as well as real-time payments are tools leading to a large number of relevant and value-added use cases for businesses, which in turn impacts the pace at which treasury adopts digital transformation,” he says.</p>
<p>The availability of new technologies that significantly simplify the day to day operations of treasury and finance are another driver. For example, by leveraging RPA, many corporate treasuries have saved thousands of man hours.</p>
<p>Consumer behaviour is also playing its part. “The traditional consumer journey of dealing with corporates has undergone a shift in the past few years,” says Mr Kanwar. “From placing orders to executing seamless payments, the entire workflow for many corporates is being automated, which again has an impact on how fast treasury can support business with the transformation.”</p>
<p>The first step on a digital transformation journey is to identify potential development areas, processes or tasks, he says. The next step would be to seek collective feedback from various stakeholders, including business functions, on priority areas. “Once a defined scope has been identified, defining the project return on investment and milestones would be critical in seeking additional resourcing. Finally, treasurers need to identify internal technology capacity and select external vendors, including banking partners, who would support the transformation journey.”</p>
<p>For Krzysztof Rojek, Senior Director, Global Solution Consulting, at software company Finastra, the “most obvious place to start” on a digital transformation project for bank treasuries is to remove any remaining independent data silos, which make consolidation of data for comprehensive insights “very difficult”.</p>
<p>Treasuries create “products” that all departments in a bank should be able to distribute, not just the sales team in a dealing room. “Cross-selling of existing treasury products, like FX, to existing customers in other business units of the bank can help grow revenues immediately and improve customer satisfaction with minimal risk,” he says.</p>
<p>For example, a corporate banking department in a medium-sized regional bank in Asia will have access to tens of thousands of small- and medium-sized enterprises that already have been onboarded by the bank, but the treasury department does not have them configured in their systems with FX limits, as they do for bigger corporations and interbank trading.</p>
<p>“Going beyond inter-department cross-selling, bank treasuries could participate in a wholesale marketplace such as FX as a Service, where FX sellers connect with thousands of regional banks, retail and corporate customers to create a seamless contextual finance experience with help from fintech embedders and orchestrators,” he adds.</p>
<p>A rapid movement towards cloud technology occurred during the pandemic as many treasury operations at banks were “held captive by outdated systems and software that could not be adapted to meet the needs of remote work environments”, says Rojek.</p>
<p>In addition, most treasurers realise that 99% of innovation happens outside of their premises. “Leading players are moving fast to a core competency-driven business model, where they focus on the one or two things they do best and use an ecosystem of specialists to enhance overall value,” he adds.</p>
<p>There are, of course, challenges in digital transformation. For Soriano, these include making treasury a priority as the “ever-changing regulatory environment” causes treasury practitioners to focus on compliance instead of transformation.</p>
<p>A skills gap also exists, with the “modern skilled” treasury professionals needed to digitalise treasury considered scarce. “The modern treasury professional also needs to have technological and analytical skills; knowledge about processing and analysing data in addition to financial modelling and forecasting,” says Soriano.</p>
<p>Treasurers can also be challenged in making the business case for transformation. “Making a proper business case is not as straightforward as it sounds. It might be difficult to get buy-in from other departments and stakeholders because the business case must be reviewed holistically,” she adds. Finally, the maturity of the treasury department will determine how straightforward a digital transformation programme is.</p>
<p>Rojek says a “major challenge” for digital transformation projects is the current and future economic outlook. “Fintech and Big Tech competition has compressed banks’ margins on standard treasury products, and new competitors have attacked profitable areas of the business, leaving established banks to run costly infrastructure and manage ever rising regulatory costs. Online trading companies offer a wider selection of hedging products at better prices, while the cost of operations of a neobank can be 60-80% lower than an incumbent bank.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the pandemic has resulted in higher loan loss provisions, and defaults are on the rise as entire sectors feel the impact of the pandemic. “All of these factors have negative impacts on the profitability of treasury operations that are based on traditional business models. This has led many CFOs and COOs to adopt a “wait and see” approach, with some even cutting the transformation projects already under way.”</p>
<p>Similar challenges exist for corporate treasurers. The biggest challenge Standard Chartered has seen among its clients is justifying a business case and securing investments, including resources, towards digital transformation projects, says Kanwar. “Given revenue and cost pressures, particularly during the pandemic, it is not easy for treasury departments to seek resources for transformation projects. In addition, there is a fundamentally critical issue of finding the most appropriate solution for the pain point. In an environment where a large number of digital tools are now available, prioritising transformation areas and balancing with asks from the business must also be factored in any transformation plan.”</p>
<p>Common pitfalls in digital transformation projects include deviating from the target state due to resourcing and budget pressures, he adds. “Treasury teams should always aim for a proof of concept, prove success and subsequently kick start the full-fledged project to ensure minimal roadblocks. Additionally, with the pace of technology advancement, it is critical to review all potential solutions before selecting the most appropriate one. Finally, staff resistance to change and adopting new technology is one of the biggest challenges, which can be overcome by constant coaching and hands-on experience of digital solutions.”</p>
<p>Rojek says there are three common pitfalls of which treasurers should be aware. “First, denial that the change is coming. Second, a deeply-rooted belief that the banks can best transform their legacy IT themselves, which inevitably leads to failed projects or at best repeating the same outdated processes using a shiny new tool. Finally, treating innovation as a ‘necessary evil’ for PR purposes can lead to many innovation labs having ‘scientific projects’ that never leave the incubation phase because they cannot be monetised.”</p>
<p>The best way to avoid these pitfalls is first to acknowledge which barriers to transformation of treasury operations exist in the bank or corporate. Next, it is crucial to determine what the organisation really excels in. Depending on the context, the next step is to choose the right partner in the wider, open finance ecosystem, in order to best leverage the skills, reach and scale of each participant, he says.</p>
<p>CGI’s Schmidt says common pitfalls include a lack of understanding of the desired end state, the necessary mix of products and services, and the capabilities of providers. “Each of these pitfalls can interfere with the pace of transformation and the likelihood of success,” he says. “Making the effort to digitise workflows without improving them, for example getting access to balance information but not aggregating or analysing it, is an additional pitfall because although it does not impede digital transformation, it limits the benefits of the work that went into it. For many, digital transformation simply means doing work faster when it should mean doing work more efficiently and getting more out of it, including developing key insights on trends that affect the business.”</p>
<p>While there are a number of examples of “traditional” transformation projects, including implementing Swift and ERP upgrades for more automation, Kanwar cites two “notable examples” of successful transformation projects.</p>
<p>The first is a corporate that sells goods through distributors. Previous practice involved its treasury and finance team manually reconciling Swift MT940 statements to release credit lines for respective distributors. This was replaced with a real-time API alert that goes directly into their corporate ERP system to net off outstanding receivable and auto-release credit lines for the distributors.</p>
<p>The second, a credit reporting agency in Malaysia, implemented an automated multi-bank, direct debit cash concentration structure using local clearing infrastructure. This ensured its treasury team no longer needed to manually move funds between banks, improving visibility for the corporate at a very low cost, compared to the traditional way of concentrating cash.</p>

<p>Companies face a number of challenges when it comes to managing payments processes effectively. For one thing, there is typically no global owner for payments within an organization. In addition, many companies also lack technology that can standardize their payment processes.</p>
<p>“What you end up with is a lot of departments working independently to figure out how best to do that,” explains Jon Paquette, Head of Customer Success US at TIS. “And those projects are typically very reliant on internal IT resources.”</p>
<p>This disparate approach can result in numerous challenges for companies, not least of all because it can be difficult to adopt consistent controls in order to minimize fraud and other risks. In addition, valuable data tends to be trapped within silos, making it hard for companies to access it for analytical purposes.</p>
<h4 id=""a-new-way-to-optimize-payments"">A new way to optimize payments</h4>
<p>Recently launched by TIS, the Enterprise Payment Optimization (EPO) platform   supports a streamlined orchestration level – the EPO layer - designed to help companies manage their payments more effectively. As Paquette explains, EPO can be looked at in two different ways. “First, it’s a set of tools that gives you everything you need to break down those historical silos,” he says. “So, it’s a flexible way to connect to banks, with out-of-the-box bank connectivity, format translation capabilities and API capabilities. It’s also a way of leveraging and sharing data freely throughout your environment to different applications.”</p>
<p>In addition, says Paquette, EPO can be understood as an optimized state that enables companies to think about payments more strategically. “Through an EPO process, you have full access to the data you need for decision-making,” he says. “You can analyse your banking relationships and supplier relationships, making sure you are executing payments in an optimized way.” As a further benefit, companies can achieve more flexibility in their payments, making it easier to address any additional connectivity needs that may arise in the future.</p>
<h4 id=""improving-access-to-data"">Improving access to data</h4>
<p>Where data is concerned, Paquette says that companies are increasingly looking to gain more real-time visibility over their cash. “Bank data is typically reported at the batch level, so it’s not that useful for analysing things from a transaction level standpoint,” he says. “And because of these siloed processes, access to data can be very region-specific, system-specific or bank-specific.”</p>
<p>By making payments data more accessible, as well as facilitating different means of viewing or receiving it eg dashboards, EPO enables companies to leverage data on their own terms. Clients can use information more strategically – whether that means creating better cash flow projections, analysing supplier trends or finding out whether there are better and more cost effective payment methods.</p>
<p>Paquette also points out that new technologies such as AI, predictive analytics and pattern recognition all rely on data – “and the solutions are only as good as the data they can leverage.” As such, breaking down siloed processes is a critical first step when it comes to leveraging additional capabilities, whether that means taking advantage of pattern recognition to mitigate the risk of fraud, or harnessing historical payment data to project future cash flow trends. In addition, by working with TIS, clients have access to years of multi-tenant data on the EPO platform which provides additional risk protection.</p>
<h4 id=""driving-improvement"">Driving improvement</h4>
<p>Every organization is at a different stage of maturity, says Paquette, however, it is important for all enterprises to effectively connect, collaborate, analyse, and improve in order to optimize the outbound payments process.  “Essentially what we do is map clients’ processes using what we call the EPO Maturity Model,” he says, adding that the model includes four key stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isolated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controlled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Networked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>TIS’ approach is to look at a client’s payment processes individually and map each of them to one of the four stages. This provides an opportunity to explore the shortcomings of specific processes or gaps, as well as explain the disadvantages companies may face by not progressing to the next stage.</p>
<p>“This tends to be a big eye-opener for most organizations,” says Paquette. “For one thing, a lot of companies don’t have full mapping of their payment processes or understand the current inefficiencies.” Once companies understand the framework, says Paquette, they are better placed to analyze and scrutinize the relevant processes and pinpoint ways to adopt best practices.</p>
<h4 id=""continuous-improvement"">Continuous improvement</h4>
<p>An EPO project isn’t a one-off exercise, and continuous improvement is also an important aspect of payments optimization. Acquisitions, divestitures, ERP migration projects and new bank relationships can all add complexity to a company’s payment environment, meaning that flexibility is essential. “It’s never a static process – so if you don’t have a technology solution that’s really flexible, you could quickly fall back into processes that aren’t optimized,” Paquette warns.</p>
<p>Likewise, as the banking landscape continues to evolve, developments like APIs and instant payments are providing new ways for companies to interact with their banks. “The EPO platform allows them to tap into these developments by providing capabilities that companies can leverage,” says Paquette.</p>
<p id=""video"">In summary, Paquette says EPO is a tool that can help treasurers and finance teams guide companies into a more proactive position where they will be better placed to harness best practices in payments. “Organizations have focused a lot of attention on optimizing incoming cash flows, reducing DSO and getting cash in the door as quickly as possible – but have not paid the same amount of attention to optimizing their payments processes,” he concludes. “So, an EPO strategy provides significant opportunities to take control of payment processes, and to optimize those processes on a continuous basis.”</p>

<p>The evolution of technology continues to dramatically change the world. With robots advising on investment decisions and automated trading enabling the execution of transactions faster than humanly possible, we are going through an unprecedented upheaval in the way we live and work.</p>
<p>Emerging technology like distributed ledger technology (DLT) and artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with the exponential use of mobile and so-called ‘smart’ technologies, has created a truly digital world. These developments in technology are driving the next generation of financial services infrastructure and solutions.</p>
<p>The combination of these factors has influenced the role of the treasurer and the importance of technology, which has never been more critical to effective treasury management. As the global marketplace changes, business models and operations have to adapt to remain competitive.</p>
<p>This is even more profound in Asia, where the growing middle class, multiple markets, languages and regulatory regimes create a unique set of challenges. The right technology can make navigating these challenges easier. It is vital that corporates have an understanding of the technological solutions available to them and how they can be deployed to assist them to operate, scale and succeed across borders and time zones.</p>
<p>The most important questions you need to answer are what problem are you trying to solve, and what is the right technology solution for your problem? More often than not, treasurers understand the areas requiring improvement across their treasury, but they don’t have the right technology for optimum performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s critical to have a clear strategy so that everyone in the organisation is aligned around what you are trying to achieve. Banks, technology partners and advisors are also important stakeholders in this process and should be engaged.</p>
<p>Never before has so much technology been available to treasury and finance professionals to tackle their challenges. There are so many solutions and options available that treasurers need to consider their needs carefully and find the right mix of solutions that gives them optimum results.</p>
<p>Deploying an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or treasury management system (TMS) is no longer enough to implement a best-of-breed solution. Treasurers now need to leverage a mix of fintech, bank and third-party applications to create a bespoke treasury solution. This presents a unique set of challenges as treasurers try to determine the best mix of technology for the organisation and how best to integrate it.</p>
<p>Solutions that integrate cash forecasting tools, TMS, SWIFT and fintech solutions are becoming increasingly common. The key for success is to ensure the focus is on people, process, and technology across the organisation. It’s critical that treasury is clear on what the technology must do. In order to define this, treasury will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get granular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address treasury and organisational challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider timing and output – does it need to manage liquidity or risk in real-time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the ‘must-haves’ versus the ‘nice-to-haves.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the need for customisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make certain that the solution can scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate infrastructure into bank and other fintech solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Building an intelligent treasury function takes planning, foresight, and a keen understanding of existing and emerging technologies. As the pace of technological development accelerates, not being in tune with the latest developments can negatively impact a treasurer’s ability to effectively manage risk.</p>
<p>Under this quick win approach, the corporate instructs its banks to send statements to the SWIFT address or BIC of the fintech, which is a SWIFT member as a Supervised Financial Institution. This has the advantage of a rapid return on investment, which leads smoothly to other phases: treasury payments, then bulk payments and cash concentration. This rapid deployment model delivers fast results, while keeping the option for the corporate to join SWIFT at a later date.</p>

<p>Selecting a business partner can often be a question of perceived information about the reputation for the new partner in focus. This kind of information can come from several sources, such as credit ratings and the creditworthiness of the potential new partner itself, to existing customers, influencers, and more. However, despite the wealth of information available there is hardly any direct references to the needs of the business.</p>
<p>In essence, it means that selecting any new business partner, like a fintech or a bank, requires the same diligent process from a treasurer such as when hedging an FX or interest rate exposure. Primarily, the needs and requirements of the business in question always needs to be determined. In selecting a partner, the process can be partitioned into four main categories, and each segment should be weighted accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>General criteria.</strong> This can be the domicile of the banks head office, subsidiary network of the bank, and the fidelity of the management, for example to measure a partner’s loyalty in case of a hostile take-over, or takeover threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk.</strong> Factors can include credit ratings, risk disclosures, loss of turnover and impact in case of bankruptcy are also key considerations when evaluating risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abilities and potential.</strong> Can a bank play a major role in granting loans or support bond issues? Does it have a professional FX and MM desk and provide SWIFT reporting? Physical cash pooling is also essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The costs involved.</strong> But, crucial to an effective operation of any organisation are the direct costs involved, such as the charge for domestic payments, foreign payments, flat fees and charges for e-banking and software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors are especially important when it comes to Asia, because cash management techniques like pooling or virtual accounts are very common. Asia, compared to Europe and North America is quite underdeveloped regarding best global banking practice. For example, in China cash pooling is somewhat exotic. To get funds in and out of the country, organisations will either have to comply with very strict bureaucratic terms, or not at all.</p>
<p>However, what is clear is that the operational market in Asia has indeed opened itself up to more and more cross-border transactions in recent years. It will get more competitive, mainly for smaller and mid-sized companies. For treasury in Asia, a more comprehensive qualifying view should be taken when choosing a partner, such as direct costs and other economical topics. A few examples include costs for domestic and foreign payments, commitment fees and bond issue costs.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the metrics used and regardless of the country a treasurer operates in, choosing between a bank or a fintech as a partner will always come down to a cost/benefit analysis, free of any external influencing.</p>

<p>Although some suggest the balance has tilted in favour of a fintech over a bank as a service provider, in reality this should be a ‘dream team’ partnership for banks and fintech, working together to jointly deliver enhanced multi-bank payment and cash management services to corporate customers.</p>
<p>Recently there has been a marked reduction in the scale, ambitions and branch network of many cash management banks, to the point that few banks today would claim to have global reach. Some offer overlay banking services and act as a gateway for corporate customers to access a number of partner banks, to extend to their geographical and product reach. But these have had mixed results, dependent on the level of integration and standardisation achieved.</p>
<p>In contrast to this trend of banking de-globalisation, corporates have continued to globalise their operations.</p>
<p>Asia has long been key to supply chains and is gaining importance as a major sales outlet. Corporate globalisation means almost all large corporates have hundreds, even thousands, of bank accounts and numerous bank relationships – from London to Singapore and beyond. So, managing payments and cash across multiple banks is complex and time-consuming, with each e-banking platform requiring disparate security tokens and approval processes, different formats, and reporting features.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis crystallised demand for improved cash visibility, which remains a priority of treasury. The crisis also reinforced a trend for treasurers to prefer technology solutions which are independent of banks, allowing treasurers to continue executing payments and cash management efficiently, even if one or more banks experience difficulties.</p>
<p>This has resulted in the emergence of fintechs offering cloud-based multi-bank payment and cash management (PCM) platforms. But, banks should not view them as a threat, since the treasurers’ choice is not a matter of ‘either or’, it’s ‘both’.</p>
<p>There is no question that banks remain essential for a raft of credit, risk, trade, FX and settlement services, with increasing focus on real-time. Meanwhile, fintechs make it easier for treasurers to orchestrate their multi-bank needs more efficiently. A cloud-based PCM platform delivers increased automation and improved security, with a solution which is highly flexible while also allowing processes to be standardised and simplified wherever possible.</p>
<p>Facing the rise of fintechs, forward-thinking banks are partnering with these innovative solution providers which are keen to distribute their products to banks’ customers. Such partnerships become a win-win for banks and fintechs, to move forward together faster and deliver winning solutions to their shared customers. Crucially, treasurers will benefit too.</p>
<p>By integrating with a multi-bank cloud-based PCM platform, they achieve secure access to banks around the globe. With a pre-configured platform, developers’ sandbox, and a proven implementation plan, a corporate can be live within a few weeks, receiving statements from multiple banks.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Fintechs and banks are increasingly collaborating to develop and launch solutions for corporates that leverage each other’s strengths.</em></p>
<p>Fintechs may have looked to eat bankers’ lunches a few years ago – some are certainly still looking to do so – but collaboration and partnership between the two looks to be more favoured now, with the payments and working capital space generally proving to be fertile territory for them to engage for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Gulru Atak, Global Head of Innovation, Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), Citi, sums up the prevailing environment between fintechs and banks: “Collaboration between fintechs and banks is very important, particularly when looking to new methodologies for product design and analysis. There are great values and abilities fintechs bring to the table, but banks too have an awful lot to offer. Citi for instance has been in some markets for 200 years, we have client relationships going back over 100 years. And we have the scale and expertise to deal with global regulation and licensing.”</p>
<p>With responsibility for innovation across Citi’s TTS business, which shifts trillions of dollars around globally for corporate and institutional clients, Atak says her innovation team works very closely with Citi Ventures, the global investment arm of Citi, to identify fintech partners through multiple channels. “Once we identify partners, Citi Ventures will assess the fintech. They always do their own due diligence ahead of any decision on investment or partnership. Fintechs that become part of its portfolio will be introduced to all constituencies at Citi to best help them add value across the group.</p>
<p>“Our approach is always to solve pain points for clients whether they be corporate or public. My role is to talk to both product and sales teams so we are fully informed, sharing information on common pain points for organisations and then working on a solution. On that basis we can begin searching for potential fintech partners.”</p>
<p>Citi considers hundreds of fintechs a year. Those that are short-listed will be interviewed by phone or visited depending on where they are based. It also arranges annual fintech demo days, where a select group of fintechs will present their propositions to a panel of judges. “After a very rigid assessment of their proposition we may decide to work with a few of them to develop a proof of concept solution which then may progress to pilot stage and thereafter the fintech could become a strategic partner or maybe a vendor.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Atak sees collaborative efforts expanding dramatically. She points out that more and more companies across multiple industries are now coming together to develop solutions that address consumer demands and cites the car sharing industry as an example: “It’s the beginning of a cross industrial ecosystem because to develop car sharing the industry’s players have to talk to government, payments providers for novel payments solutions and software developers.”</p>
<p>Atak adds: “If we can get to a situation where fintechs and banks are more involved in these new cross-industry collaborations, you can imagine very rich industrial ecosystems developing in the future.”</p>
<p>A major current focus for Citi’s TTS innovation team is e-commerce and real-time payments – faster payment rails generally – in multiple countries. “These are areas of very rapid development and as a result the treasurer’s role is becoming much more complicated. The big question for treasurers now is how to evolve themselves to manage real-time funding and real-time liquidity management – we are definitely looking at that area.”</p>
<h4 id=""win-win-market"">Win-win market</h4>
<p>Citi’s strong focus on payments and liquidity management is long standing and is reflected in Citi Ventures’ 2016 strategic investment in C2FO, an online market for working capital. The fintech is a standalone company independent of Citi but is also the technology provider behind Citi Early Payment Programme, which allows suppliers to request accelerated payment of an approved invoice. In practice, suppliers determine which invoices they want to accelerate and what their early payment offer (payment date and associated discount) will be. For accepted offers, the C2FO platform initiates early payment and the buyer receives the discount from the supplier. In turn, the supplier receives early payment to improve their cash flow while also reducing their financing costs.</p>
<p>Sandy Kemper, Founder, Chairman and CEO of C2FO – which bills itself as “the largest working capital market in the world” – is clear about the merits of his firm’s proposition: “A big lesson learned from the global financial crises was how critical free cash flow can be for corporates, their customers and their suppliers. As businesses seek to unlock cash flow from day-to-day operations, savvy treasurers have discovered vendor payments as a means to generate significant benefit for their suppliers and in turn for themselves.</p>
<p>“Part of what we are trying to do is get back to the original mission of banks and create benefits for our customers. By looking at the quality of their accounts receivable, could I find better advancements, could I find better interest rates? But the only way to really validate AR is to match it to the AP.</p>
<p>“The fundamental basis of our solution is we aim to match all the world’s accounts payable with all of the world’s accounts receivable. We’ve really just begun but we do have over 1.2 trillion of accounts payable matched to accounts receivable.”</p>
<p>It is estimated that business transactions globally total about US$260trn per year, but at any point in time, about US$43trn in receivables and payables are outstanding. “We’ve studied it and no more than US$3trn to US$4trn of finance is available to create liquidity against that US$40trn, which explains why most small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups find it very challenging to finance loans.” This represents a hidden finance cost and also risk in the supply chain. The aforesaid savvy treasurers, however, recognise that it also represents a significant opportunity.</p>
<p>Post crisis regulation coupled with the need to repair their balance sheets have made banks risk-averse, which is another big drag on financing for SMEs. “In the banking industry you have to look at risk underwriting of working capital and because of that we have to detail the amount of credit we make available against these assets.</p>
<p>“But just turn that on its head and think about not the asset, and not the account receivable, but rather the account payable. If you then engage in a marketplace where those accounts payable can be matched to the accounts receivable, you can give priority to the account payable owner to pay that payable sooner at a rate that is good for the account receivable holder. The result is a completely new way of looking at working capital. In many ways you have taken the risk out of the working capital which means you can get more working capital into the hands of companies that need it.”</p>
<p>The C2FO working capital platform therefore aims to meet the needs of both sides of the platform, allowing customers to set a target reward for every order, but also allowing suppliers to offer early payment discounts, an incentive for them to be paid quicker. The greatest benefit of this approach, says Kemper, is not only that it improves capital utilisation efficiency, but also reverses the original unbalanced model where the buyer decides when the payment will be issued. “A customer that has sufficient funds can receive a discount for paying in advance and receives a return on their investment, while a supplier in urgent need of funds receives the working capital they need in a timely manner. It’s a win-win situation. Having a strong, healthy supply chain is in everybody’s interest.”</p>
<h4 id=""best-of-breed"">Best of breed</h4>
<p>Now boasting hundreds of thousands of customers across 171 countries and able to handle 60 currencies, Kemper is confident about the outlook for the company. As a former banker himself, he is acutely aware of what Citi brings to the partnership with C2FO and vice versa: “Banks often have very deep, loyal strong ties with their customers, not to mention very strong branding. So what the banks can offer in partnership with the fintechs is a complete solution – powerful customer relationships and innovative, best in class fintech solutions. And that is what we have with our partnership with Citi.”</p>
<p>In considering the outlook for the fintech sector more broadly, Kemper foresees “a little separating of the wheat and the chaff”, with banks increasingly in the position of being able to pick best of breed providers and take them to their best customers. Echoing Citi’s Atak, he says: “You’ll see more partnering between fintech and banks but quality will increasingly be key. Banks will want best of breed, want them to be tested, want them to be strong and accretive in any relationship.</p>
<p>“We picked Citi because they gave us an extraordinarily strong global relationship footprint. And I think they picked us because we gave them exactly what I have just described – a tested, well created and very robust solution for their customers.”</p>
<p>Parvais Dalal, EMEA Head Supply Chain Finance, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, echoes Kemper, saying that the bank’s partnership with C2FO has been an integral part of its overall agenda: “It allows us to combine both Citi solutions and the solutions offered by our partners, to provide a complete product offering to clients addressing their varied needs.”</p>
<p>Dalal adds: “Our product capabilities around supply chain financing are now offered on a fully automated basis, delivering working capital efficiencies through the Citi platform and dynamic discounting via the C2FO platform. This structure offers better returns for clients’ excess liquidity, and assists with payment efficiencies to a large universe of beneficiaries in an automated and digitised way.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Dalal sees the C2FO solution as helping Citi to complete its overall offering in the payables space, specifically its client supply chain, to control cash flow and improve financial metrics on demand. “It allows accelerated payment of approved invoices at a rate that works for our clients, in a fully automated and unique fashion.”</p>
<h4 id=""mission-possible"">Mission possible</h4>
<p>Bottomline Technologies is another long established fintech focused on cloud-based working capital and automated payments solutions. Having been in business for 30 years, the company is, says Ed Adshead-Grant, General Manager, Payments, “in that interesting space of not being a trendy start-up fintech nor a 300-year-old legacy, bank-driven financial services technology company.”</p>
<p>He is clear about Bottomline’s unwavering mission: “Our purpose is to help businesses pay and get paid. Over 80% of FTSE companies and over 60% of the Fortune 500 are our customers, so we have some very rich insights into how corporate payments work and that helps us develop novel solutions for customer pain points. It’s the intelligence we gather and our speed of response in addressing customer needs that explains our longevity as a fintech.</p>
<p>“We’ve got multiple types of payment solutions but we’re not tied to any one financial services organisation. Payments is our core focus but our footprint extends to areas like cash management, fraud checking and compliance.”</p>
<p>Currently Bottomline is investing heavily in areas like open banking, PSD2 and GDPR and is registered both as an Account Information Service Provider (AISP) and Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP), which means it is fully authorised to use open banking APIs. Such expertise, combined with it being a fully accredited SWIFT service bureau, provides Bottomline with an edge in the market, says Adshead-Grant.</p>
<p>As well as offering its services to firms directly via its platform, the company also works closely with banks to develop ‘white label’ solutions. This entails Bottomline, as technology provider, powering banks’ corporate payment solutions. Referral arrangements, whereby banks will refer their corporate and business customers to Bottomline to help them on payments, collections, compliance and solutions, make up another important element of the company’s relationship with banks.</p>
<p>“Working with banks makes up a large part of our business. We’re always looking to collaborate with banks to combine the best elements of their offerings with our own to try and help businesses pay and get paid, in line with our core mission.</p>
<p>Bottomline’s institutional partners include UK’s digital, mobile-only Starling Bank. Here the focus of the collaboration has been on real-time access to the UK’s Faster Payments Service (FPS). The partnership has led to the launch of a new ‘Real-Time Payments Express’ solution that will allow banks, payments service providers and corporates to access the full benefits of 24x7 real-time payment rails without the need to become an FPS scheme member themselves or wait behind the sometimes-challenging service levels of a larger sponsoring bank.</p>
<p>Adshead-Grant says the Starling solution is delivered as a plug and play SaaS cloud model that “offers full visibility of payment transactions and provides a portfolio of open banking and PSD2 solution sets that allow customers to improve their propositions and service their business more effectively in a digital world”.</p>
<p>Bottomline also works with a number of major banks, including Unity Trust Bank, a specialist in banking services for trade unions and charities, to provide a white label bank-branded BACS payment solution to their customers. The Unity Trust branded solution, called ‘Unity e-Payment’, provides full BACS credit and direct debit payment services in the cloud, enabling the smooth operation of payroll, accounts payables and account receivable functions for their customers.</p>
<h4 id=""keep-it-simple"">Keep it simple</h4>
<p>So how does Adshead-Grant sum up the key benefits of the Bottomline platform for corporates? “What immediately comes to mind is expertise. Yes, the technology is important, but there’s never been such a need for expertise as now because the landscape is changing so much. Consider the plethora of initiatives corporates have to contend with right now: open banking, request to pay, confirmation of payee, PSD2, new payment architecture – the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>“There’s a tsunami of compliance changes coming through, but the key benefit for those corporates partnering with cloud-based solution providers, is that all that compliance is ‘gone’ for the corporates – we are the ones that invest in compliance so that firms don’t have to worry about it. Our international payments module, for example, makes that task as simple as making a domestic payment. All the complexity is hidden, taken care of, the compliance is checked and it’s all done. Or there’s the account visibility module that we offer, so companies can see all their bank account information in one place, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>“Using a combination of open banking and the SWIFT data flows, we can ensure that all of a corporate’s real-time data is at their fingertips. And again, no complexity, no compliance issues, it’s just a smart, secure solution that you plug into. These are probably the key conversations we have with our customers, where they end up saying, ‘Oh, wow. That makes life easier’.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>The impact of fintech is starting to be felt around the world – and even though most of the development sits in the retail space, the corporate world is also benefiting. What should treasurers be doing to take advantage of the possibilities?</em></p>
<p>Treasury professionals have heard lots about the transformational impact of fintech. Everyone involved in financial services is keen to outline what they are doing, who they are working with and what’s included in their vision of the future. And all the talk is being backed up by significant investment: KPMG’s latest Pulse of Fintech Report notes that global fintech investment topped US$31bn in 2017. This has pushed total investment over the past three years to US$122bn, with banks, corporates and venture capitalists pouring money into start-ups. But has this talk and investment had much impact?</p>
<p>This is a tough question to answer because the global fintech marketing machine is running at full steam. Whilst this is raising awareness about fintech, it has also made it hard for casual observers to distinguish between hype and reality.</p>
<p>Take Bitcoin, for example. When the cryptocurrency first emerged, commentators couldn’t stop talking about its transformative power. One expert told Treasury Today in 2014 that Bitcoin would “become more integral to our lives than we can possibly imagine”, adding that it would “replace the backbone of finance, capital markets and commerce”.</p>

</img></figure>
<p>For a while, this prediction looked like it might be correct. Bitcoin hype soon reached fever pitch and the value of the currency exploded. In late 2017, one Bitcoin was valued at US$17,000. Bitcoin hype (and value) has since trended negative, with confidence in the cryptocurrency rocked by severe volatility, scandals and adverse regulatory rulings. Few are now predicting that Bitcoin will become the world’s dominant global currency and have a dramatic impact on our lives.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be a surprise. Bitcoin and several other fintech trends are closing following the course predicted by Gartner’s Hype Cycle. The Hype Cycle shows that after an initial explosion in excitement around a particular technology, interest wanes once it fails to deliver on the early promise. Then, as the time horizon expands, the technology quietly matures. Eventually, mainstream adoption occurs, growing in line with the widespread applicability of the product.</p>
<h3 id=""instant-impact"">Instant impact</h3>
<p>This isn’t to say that fintech has had no impact. In China, for example, technology firms Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) have brought financial services to the masses. Individuals in China today can bank, invest and borrow using their mobile phone. Indeed, US$12.77trn was transacted on mobile platforms in the first ten months of 2017.</p>
<p>Businesses in China have responded accordingly. Many have partnered with BAT to accept payments from their platforms, and banks are now building aggregation services to streamline this. More recently, businesses outside of the C2B space have also begun to leverage these platforms. For example, a company that uses contractors to carry out maintenance has embraced WeChat Pay. This has removed the risk of contractors handling cash, while creating additional value through the automated and straight through reconciliation of payments.</p>
<p>Fintech is also shaking up developed economies, albeit in a less spectacular fashion. In the UK, for example, a range of challenger banks have emerged. These include Monzo, which launched in 2015 and captured the retail market’s attention with its simple onboarding process, intuitive app and innovative features. Monzo now has over 750,000 current account customers.</p>
<p>Development in commercial banking is less obvious. There has been a steady trickle of new solutions, built in collaboration with fintechs. One example is Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Intelligent Receivables solution. This was built with fintech firm High Radius and uses AI, machine learning and optical character recognition to match incoming payments with disparate remittance data.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the industry remains in a period of experimentation defined by small-scale pilots and proof of concepts, especially around transformative technologies, such as blockchain.</p>
<h3 id=""focus-on-partnerships"">Focus on partnerships</h3>
<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise that fundamental change is not happening overnight: commercial banking is an entrenched, complex industry, with high barriers to entry. Corporates are also rarely willing to make significant internal changes or take a gamble on technology with no track record.</p>
<p>Change is coming, however. PwC’s 2017 Global FinTech Report highlights this, showing the growing influence of fintech on financial services. Most notably, the report suggests there is a considerable awareness amongst banks that fintech poses a significant risk to profit margins: over 80% of respondents said that a part of their bank’s business is at risk from innovators.</p>
<p>To combat the risk of losing business, banks are investing heavily in technology to upgrade legacy infrastructure and develop new solutions. HSBC has announced it is investing US$17bn in new technology as it looks to return to “growth mode”. British lender, Lloyds Bank, also said it was investing over US$3bn in technology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, traditional banks are increasingly working in partnership with fintech firms. The objective of these partnerships is to learn about the technology that such firms are using and to see where and how this could be applied by the bank. Additionally, banks are looking to replicate the culture and ways of working associated with fintechs in a bid to become nimbler and more innovative.</p>
<p>This also points to an interesting change in the approach of fintechs themselves, many of which marketed themselves as disrupters of the traditional financial system. Today, this thinking is no more. The aim of most fintechs is to partner with a bank, as this strategy is considered the best way to achieve the scale required to survive in the long term.</p>
<h3 id=""bank-unbundling"">Bank unbundling</h3>
<p>These trends are what Sam Hall, Managing Director at Rainmaking Singapore believes has led to the unbundling, and in some cases selective rebundling, of financial services. The term refers to the splitting of combined services at scale into component parts or modules, which can now feasibly be positioned selectively to deliver highly sophisticated value props for particular user segments – somewhat like being able to buy individual tracks on an album, rather than just the complete album.</p>
<p>Hall explains that the impact of emerging technology, access to customer data, cloud, regulatory changes, availability of capital and customer expectations have created a context whereby fintechs are able to create value in far more niche areas of the traditional financial services value stack than was previously possible. This means the banking landscape will collectively evolve to be everything to all people, although for individual banks the historic reality of operating at scale across capital, platform and application layers is long gone.</p>
<p>“The emergence of fintech has given the end-users of financial services more choice,” says Hall. “For example, if your bank provides a poor payment experience, you can now use one of the fintech payment providers. And regulation such as PSD2 and Open Banking – which give third-party providers access to customer data and the possibility of offering bespoke and segment-specific front-end financial services – will drive this trend, exposing banks to more competition.”</p>
<p>This will have a big impact on banks in the long term, as they will need to overhaul most aspects of their operating models, adds Hall. “Banks are burdened with significant legacy technology that is expensive to maintain. They are being outcompeted on cost of technology and must evolve their business models to focus on areas where they have capability and can seek to remain competitive.”</p>
<p>Hall says that this will see banks evolve differently. He expects some to take a platform-based approach, leveraging API layers to connect with best of breed fintech firms and offer retail and corporate customers a one-stop shop for all their banking needs. Others will become back-end infrastructure providers or utilities for other firms.</p>
<h3 id=""digital-transformations"">Digital transformations</h3>
<p>This is already happening, at least to a degree. J.P. Morgan, for example, has been bullish in its willingness to partner with fintechs. “There are instances where we are willing to partner with fintechs,” says Manoj Dugar, Head of Core Cash Products, Asia at J.P. Morgan. “The reason J.P. Morgan takes this approach is simple: it is about ensuring that we deliver cutting edge innovation to our clients.”</p>
<p>Dugar adds that J.P. Morgan also wants to assist its clients with their own digital transformation journeys. “In a recent survey of our clients, we found that the majority are going through a digital transformation,” he says. “We must be ready to help guide them through this journey, not just with products and solutions, but by sharing our own experiences to help them build a roadmap for the future.”</p>
<p>Raof Latiff, Group Head of Digital, Institutional Banking Group at DBS echoes this point. He explains that DBS is currently undergoing a technological and cultural transformation to become akin to a “24,000 people start-up”. Latiff adds that to achieve this, the bank is working with fintechs and bigtechs to digitise its internal technology stack. “We are moving all of our data and platforms into the cloud and reimagining our internal processes,” he says. “This will enable us to cut costs, be more agile in innovating, and deliver solutions to customers more rapidly.”</p>
<p>These back-end improvements will take time to complete. However, it will be worth the wait. Not only will corporates be able to enjoy a wide range of new products and services; banking costs may also fall. Indeed, a report by Bain &amp; Company suggests that this investment, tied in with increased competition for business, will cause a structural decline in prices for services such as cross-border payments and trade finance.</p>
<h3 id=""new-engagements"">New engagements</h3>
<p>Fintech isn’t only impacting banks behind the scenes – it’s also changing how they interact with clients. Most notably, banks are paying attention to how fintechs design their solutions and the user experience they create. “We are working hard to bring the experiences we have in our consumer lives to the corporate space,” says Jennifer Doherty, Head of Innovation, Asia at HSBC. “To achieve this, we are ensuring our products and propositions have intuitive user interfaces and are easy to use – which hasn’t always been the case with banking products.”</p>
<p>It goes beyond look and feel, however. Doherty explains that HSBC is redefining how treasurers interact with the bank. “Traditionally, if a treasurer had an issue or needed something, they would make a phone call or email,” she says. “Today, clients can initiate these questions through our chatbot, which can deal with many of these enquiries instantly. The idea is to remove the friction between bank and client.”</p>
<p>As well as changing how banks and corporates interact, fintech has also pushed banks to design solutions differently. In the past, banks followed a model of designing and building a solution in-house that would then be pushed out to the market. But today, banks are keen to have corporates involved in the design process.</p>
<p>“We look to solve business problems with our clients,” says Latiff. “Rarely do we talk about basic treasury solutions today as a starting point. Instead, we talk about digital solutions addressing business problems. For example, one of Asia’s largest leading general insurers, MSIG Insurance came to us because they were seeking a way to improve the speed and convenience of the claims process for customers, whilst streamlining internal processes and reducing costs. We worked together and solved this through a real-time payment solution, enabled by DBS’ API solution, IDEAL RAPID. This transformed both the efficiency with which insurance claims are processed, and the quality of the customer experience, setting a new precedent for the insurance industry and strengthening MSIG’s position as a market leader.”</p>
<p>Pricing models for solutions are also likely to change. Rather than banks charging corporates per service, it is likely many will package services together and charge a single fee. This is similar to the switch made by the telecoms industry several years ago.</p>
<p>Alternatively, product pricing may become more bespoke as technology gives banks new ways to track what their clients are doing. Commerzbank, for example, recently announced that it had struck a deal with machine tool manufacturer, EMAG, to create the world’s first data-based, pay-per-use loan. This innovative structure sees the repayment of the loan linked to the usage of capital equipment – data which is shared with the bank through tracking devices installed into the tools produced by EMAG. Elsewhere, Nordea has publicly said that the pricing of the loans offered to corporate clients will be directly influenced by their cyber-security awareness and readiness.</p>

<h4>Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer</h4>
<p><img alt='Ferguson""""' class=""logo org"" height=""17"" src=""/i/logo/ferguson-logo-2018-110x17.png"" style=""margin: 1em 0 1em 0;"" title=""Ferguson"" width=""110""/> </p>

<p class=""management-summary"">Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer at Ferguson, talks through why technology is so important to his treasury operation. He also reveals what emerging technology will have the greatest impact on treasury.</p>
<h5>Why is technology vital to your treasury department?</h5>
<p>Technology is very important to us. It provides enhanced visibility over our cash, accounts, loans, FX activity and payments. This is crucial because we are managing treasury for a decentralised business and need to know what is happening.</p>
<p>We also want the technology we invest in to have a good ROI. We are therefore keen that any technology we use should connect with the other systems used in our organisation. This then allows us to drive efficiency and cost savings through automation and straight through processing.</p>
<p>Finally, new technology, especially cloud-based offerings, such as our TMS, BELLIN, provide greater security, which is crucial for treasury.</p>
<h5>Which emerging technologies are of interest?</h5>
<p>AI and robotics will be game-changers. We are already seeing these impact shared service centres by automating manual processes. I am now investigating how these might benefit our treasury.</p>
<p>Harnessing Big Data is also of great interest. Everything we do relies on having access to reliable data. The challenge is that this data often sits in disparate systems across the organisation. A technology that brings all this data to a central location would be interesting and allow us to better support the business.</p>
<h5>What about blockchain?</h5>
<p>Blockchain is interesting as it can solve many issues we have, such as KYC. If blockchain can facilitate true-digital document exchange and matching, it will reduce the time and effort it takes to conduct KYC. This would be a huge benefit for both corporates and banks.</p>
<p>I would be open to using a blockchain solution if it solved this issue. The problem is that the technology is largely unproven.</p>
<p>What is most important for me as a treasurer is not the technology itself, but the value it can deliver. So whilst blockchain is very interesting, my real focus lies in not how it works but the business problems it might solve.</p>
<h5>Has new technology had a positive impact on financial services more broadly?</h5>
<p>Yes, without question. The focus on fintech has delivered new solutions to individuals and businesses. These provide greater speed, accuracy and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Beyond that, new technology has also enabled businesses to scale up and reach a wide array of new customers around the world. This is revolutionary.</p>
<h5>How will the continued evolution of technology impact treasury in the years to come?</h5>
<p>Some argue that increased technology usage and automation will make treasury teams redundant. I don’t believe this to be true. Technology is not replacing the role; it is replacing the process. And making the process more automated will mean that treasury has more time to focus on the data and act on it. So in five years I foresee treasury departments being slicker and driving greater value in how they support the business.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""taking-action"">Taking action</h3>
<p>It’s an exciting time for treasury. The main advice is to be engaged with banking partners, technology providers and industry peers to understand what is happening and split hype from reality.</p>
<p>Those who want to benefit from new technology at the earliest opportunity must ensure they’re ready. HSBC’s Doherty notes that treasurers should look at their existing technology stack and see if it is ready to integrate with the new technology coming through. “Most importantly, it must be able to consume APIs as these are the future of bank/corporate connectivity,” she says. “I would also recommend that treasurers are involved in the company’s annual technology plan. This will ensure that the treasury function is not being overlooked when deciding what areas of the business receive attention and investment.”</p>
<p>The future is bright for corporate treasurers who will eventually benefit from all the investment in fintech. This will see them enjoy improved services, products and greater choice and flexibility. So, whilst the fintech revolution is yet to fully deliver on its potential to improve financial services, it’s just a matter of time.</p>

<p><em>Fintech has the promise to completely revolutionise finance. And whilst we are seeing plenty of examples of this in the retail space, in the corporate world, revolutionary change is less forthcoming. That doesn’t mean it’s not happening though. Here, we explore the impact fintech is having on banks, regulators and corporates and peer into the future to see what finance may look like in the years to come.</em></p>
<p>Twitter’s 140 character limit has not only changed how we communicate and consume information, it has also shown how complex, emotional and important matters can be communicated simply and succinctly, without losing any meaning or importance.</p>
<p>This is arguably the real impact that digitisation has had on our lives. It has brought efficiency and the ability for us to access information, communicate, and act in ways that we perhaps could never have done before. And it is this promise that has driven the rapid pace of technological development in the financial services industry, widely referred to as fintech.</p>
<h3 id=""new-dynamics"">New dynamics</h3>
<p>It is important to note that fintech is not a new phenomenon, although it is often reported as such. Individuals and businesses have been able to leverage the technology offered by banks for decades – banks by their very nature are fintech. What is different about the current wave of fintech however, is the pace of change and the sources of innovation. Banks are no longer the only innovators in town.</p>
<p>“The internet and the proliferation of mobile devices has provided the tools for fintech start-ups – sometimes just one person and a laptop – to begin looking to fix some of the problems that exist in the financial services industry,” says Antony Eldridge, Financial Services Leader at PwC Singapore. And sometimes these nimble and focused companies can ignite quite dramatic change.</p>
<p>Take the consumer cross-border payments space, for example. This has been a particular area of focus for fintech and has received a substantial proportion of the $19bn invested into fintech start-ups around the world in 2015. As a result of this focus, there are now numerous companies that have developed tools that enable individuals to transfer money across borders, instantly and for little cost. Many of these solutions also utilise mobile wallets which has driven a more dramatic change, extending the reach of financial services to meet those who would normally fall out of the banks purview.</p>
<p>In doing so, not only have these solutions made finance more democratic, they have also disintermediated the banks in some areas. “Fintech companies big and small are picking off aspects of the banking business, typically the profitable areas,” says Eldridge. “And whilst the banks are not being completely disintermediated given the money often flows through them at some point, to the user of the solution it certainly seems like the banks are being bypassed entirely.”</p>
<h3 id=""friend-or-foe"">Friend or foe?</h3>
<p>No bank wants to be losing business of course, especially in profitable areas, so the growth of fintech outside of the bank poses an interesting question – are the current wave of fintech firms a friend or foe to the financial establishment?</p>
<p>“We generally see fintech as a friend,” says Morgan McKenney, Head of Core Cash Management for Asia Pacific and Singapore Innovation Lab at Citi. “Collaboration with fintech start-ups is an important strategy for the bank because these companies are able to bring different skills and way of thinking to the table. These companies are incredibly focused on the customer and their pain points and are building solutions to alleviate these, whilst banks in the past arguably have not approached solutioning in this way. We believe this new approach will help us build on our strengths as a bank and help enable us to deliver innovative solutions to our clients.”</p>
<p>To provide an example of this collaboration, Citi have recently announced a strategic investment in blockchain-as-a-service firm chain.com. “They are now a strategic partner of the bank and we feel that this company has the skills and expertise that don’t already exist within the bank to help us develop and commercialise the blockchain,” adds McKenney.</p>
<p>The focus on collaboration is a point echoed by Singapore-based lender DBS, and their Head of Global Transaction Banking, John Laurens. “At DBS, we have had extensive engagement with the fintech community, by both partnering and mentoring.” For Laurens, following this strategy will not only ensure the bank is able to utilise the solutions developed by these start-ups, but also continue to drive a change of culture within the bank itself. “Working with these firms is playing an important role in shaping how we think as a bank, how we design our products and the impact that these can have on our clients.”</p>
<p>This change in mind-set was also picked up by Citi’s McKenney, who identified the threat of disintermediation as being a key motivation behind the change. “The competition offered by fintech has proven to be very important from a leadership point of view and in driving more open-mindedness across the institution,” she explains. “Within transaction banking we have spent a lot of time embedding a more innovative culture into the organisation which is very different from the traditional structured bank thinking.”</p>
<h3 id=""going-it-alone"">Going it alone</h3>
<p>Despite being classified as disruptors, to date many start-ups have had the objective of either being bought by, or partnering with, a bank, according to Steven Tong, Managing Director at Startupbootcamp Fintech Singapore. “The vast majority of fintechs are small start-ups that have little to no reputation and no customers,” he says. “This is why it is a myth that fintech is there solely to disintermediate established institutions. They want to partner with these to piggy-back off their reputation in the market and reach their customer base.”</p>
<p>Of course, the danger of this approach is that fintech may get lost in the monolithic structure and architecture of a bank and suffocate. And for PwC’s Eldridge, this is a real concern and one that may change the thinking of many fintech start-ups, pushing them to look away from banks and offer their solution to other market players – most notably the big technology firms.</p>
<p>At present, Eldridge believes that it is these companies, many of which have already made skirmishes into financial services, which pose the biggest threat to the financial establishment. “The question is not can they replace banks,” says Eldridge, “it is do they want to? These companies are very happy to be picking off the profitable areas of financial services but once you become a fully-fledged bank you step into a quagmire of regulation and compliance.”</p>
<p>There may need to be a change in approach therefore to ensure banks maintain their position. “Banks are often asking the question what can fintech do for us?” says Eldridge. “But I am increasingly of the belief that banks need to be asking what can we do for the fintechs.” In his view, the landscape is changing so quickly and these firms are developing highly sophisticated technology so readily that a situation could exist where banks end up as simply a utility service behind fintech, providing compliance and risk management.</p>
<p>However, it would be fair to say that corporate treasurers probably shouldn’t expect to be buying their next cash management solution from a well-known technology firm anytime soon. But looking further in the future, it is not a completely unrealistic scenario to imagine banks playing a diminished, yet important role in the background.</p>
<h3 id=""digital-regulators"">Digital regulators</h3>
<p>Back in the present day, perhaps one of the most unique characteristics surrounding the current wave of fintech is its widespread regulatory support. In Asia especially, the regulators have been very vocal in outlining their support for the fintech industry. Hong Kong, for instance, has developed a Fintech Facilitation Office that looks to support the sustainable development of the fintech industry and to keep the public confidence in fintech services and the banking system.</p>
<p>Singapore is another country looking to lead the way with its Smart Financial Centre initiative, led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). And this has given the mandate for banks in Singapore to begin ramping up their experimentation with new technology. “Regulatory involvement in the fintech space, particularly in supporting the development of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies, is critical,” says DBS’s Laurens. “The MAS has suggested to banks to ‘just do it’ when it comes to experimentation with new technologies, whilst introducing a ‘regulatory sandbox’ that offers controlled boundaries for banks to conduct experiments.”</p>
<p>In the view of Startupbootcamp’s Tong, this liberal regulatory approach is a must for the industry to thrive in the region. “The easiest way to sink the fintech industry is through over regulation,” he says. “So it is encouraging to see this liberal regulatory approach that many of the countries in Asia are taking. That being said, there are some regulators in the region’s less developed markets that are still feeling their way around the space and there will inevitably be some countries where fintech fails to take off because of over regulation.”</p>
<p>But Tong is also acutely aware that a paradox exists in respect to fintech also needing regulation to thrive. “One of the big challenges that fintech has is its perception,” he explains. “One way for companies to gain this reputation is to be regulated, this will put individuals and companies using the technology at ease. It is smart regulation that is needed from the regulators.”</p>
<p>And just as fintech may have the potential to revolutionise the financial services industry, it may also, in the view of some, revolutionise regulation. “Today, regulators regulate institutions,” says PwC’s Aldridge. “But fintech is about products, not institutions, so I believe that regulators need to start thinking about regulating products if they are to keep abreast of all these changes.”</p>
<p>In some cases this has already happened, but only after the hand of the regulators was forced. Aldridge offers the example of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in China. “P2P lending as a product is now regulated in China, but this is only because the market expanded to such a scale where it could no longer be ignored as a product,” he says. “So it is about scale of the industry for regulators as well.” As a result of this, Aldridge believes the majority of fintech companies fall into a regulatory ‘grey zone’ and that this could pose a problem going forward.</p>
<p>This ‘grey zone’ only expands when one considers the cross-border nature of many fintech solutions. “Cooperation between regulators around the world will become increasingly important because of this trend,” says Aldridge. “But, this need comes at a time where there is an increasing balkanisation of regulators, so it remains to be seen how this will play out.”</p>
<h3 id=""how-are-you-impacted"">How are you impacted?</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that the current wave of fintech is impacting the financial industry. And as we have explored, banks, regulators, individuals and SMEs are all seeing some change. But are large corporations and their treasury departments?</p>
<p>At present, it would be fair to say that the impact has been limited when compared to some other areas of finance, a view supported by both anecdotal and quantitative evidence. Of course, corporates are now able to utilise numerous digital offerings from banks and sit in their impressive innovation labs while big data is sliced and analysed to show how trade flows can be better managed, for instance. But the brave new world promised by the explosion of fintech is not here yet for corporate treasury.</p>
<p>A recent study by PwC titled ‘Blurred Lines’ highlights this, showing that the digitisation of cash and treasury management, whilst being reasonably important for banks and something they are likely to act on, remains less important than other areas which have a more board focus for the banks. Interestingly, it seems that there are also fewer fintech players in the market focusing on treasury and cash management, relative to other areas such as P2P lending, for instance.</p>
<p>For PwC’s Eldridge, these results are consistent with his own view. “In transaction banking there has been little major change, apart from maybe in the payments space,” he says. “There is a lot of talk at present, especially around the blockchain and this will continue to gain momentum as banks look for cheaper and more efficient ways of doing things. I think blockchain will revolutionise transaction banking in the next ten years – but how remains to be seen.”</p>
<p>The fact that corporate treasurers are seeing little tangible change being driven by fintech has divided opinion in the treasury world. Some treasurers that Treasury Today Asia have talked to speak of a future where a technology company can provide fully automated solutions without the need for a bank. Others, meanwhile, dismiss the subject and simply want banks to deliver solutions today that fit their requirements.</p>
<p>“Corporate treasurers typically possess a healthy degree of scepticism when it comes to fintech,” says DBS’ Laurens. “They want to see practical, value-adding solutions that they can apply to their financial and commercial business processes. They expect banks to be close to and drive innovation in financial technology, and in the process deal with the complexities inherent therein, so they don’t need to spend an undue amount of time looking at what’s ‘under the hood’, beyond necessary due diligence.”</p>
<p>That being said, interest certainly exists – especially around the more innovative technological developments, like blockchain – and banks such as DBS and Citi are now seeing digital advisory blossom as a function of the bank in its own right. As Citi’s McKenney explains: “We are fielding numerous questions from corporates on a daily basis around emerging technologies, the future of payments, what can be done with data and, interestingly, how we as a bank innovate and how treasury can look to embed this into their corporate culture. There are also lots of questions around how businesses might evolve more broadly, because this of course can potentially have a fundamental impact on treasury in the future.”</p>
<h3 id=""keep-abreast-of-the-change"">Keep abreast of the change</h3>
<p>For any cutting edge treasurer that wants to be at the front of the queue once this technology becomes widely available, it is important to keep abreast of the changes in the space and see what really can make an impact. But how can this be achieved?</p>
<p>For DBS’s Laurens, corporates should engage with fintech in the same way as banks do. “Mentoring fintech start-ups has been an enriching experience personally,” he says. “It’s a great way to contribute to and be part of driving change, whilst learning about new and alternative ways of thinking and approaches to business and proposition development. Involvement with the fintech community also provides opportunities to network and engage with like-minded companies and banks that possess the leadership and aptitude to invest time and money in pushing innovation forward.”</p>
<p>This point is echoed by PwC’s Eldridge, who recommends that corporate treasurers seek out their local fintech accelerator programmes and attend the demo days to see what is being developed and by whom and how this may be able to help with treasury operations.</p>
<p>But perhaps, for now at least, the best place for a corporate treasurer to look for new and innovative solutions remains their banks. Fintech certainly has lots of promise and its impact is already being felt in numerous areas. Nevertheless, in the corporate treasury space there remains a big question mark over how this story will unfold, both in Asia and globally. One thing is for certain however, change is and will continue to happen. The financial services landscape will look very different in the years to come.</p>


","Fintech has the promise to completely revolutionise finance. And whilst we are seeing plenty of examples of this in the retail space, in the corporate world, revolutionary change is less forthcoming. That doesn’t mean it’s not happening though.
