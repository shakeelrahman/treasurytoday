<p>Corporations should re-disperse any monetary savings that may have occurred as a result of office buildings, space reduction, being sold and maintenance cost savings as staff work from home.</p>
<p>We should see not just how and where we work as having changed but also how and what we spend our budgets on. Whereas in the past office space and employee perks may have focused on physicality, these will now look quite different, but the cost will still be there, albeit in a different form. Flexibility and adaptability are the key elements for today’s workers and organisations. People will think of themselves, not as the job that they do, but the bundle of skills that they have. People should be focused on life-long learning and as such will want to be invested in by their organisations, to feel growth and skill evolution in their roles.</p>
<p>In 2020-21, people, more than ever, seem motivated by their own personal ethics and situations to choose organisations and roles that work for them, rather than the other way round. People want to believe in the purpose of their organisations, to be aligned with their CSR goals and to move if that is not the case. This momentum appears only to be growing. This is particularly the case with millennials and generation X talent who will only represent more and more of the workforce. To attract talent, companies will need to be ready to offer not only competitive salaries, but also to show social purpose and a belief in career long development and flexibility in their talent management.</p>
<p>There are regional variations that affect the ability of companies to shift from their previous bricks and mortar set-up. The US, being geographically spread over an entire continent, can offer employees the ability to work remotely from anywhere within the country. The set-up in Europe, Africa and Asia is very different – we have number of countries with their own specific regulatory and tax requirements towards employees and employers. Without moving to another country, staff can choose now to prioritise their personal lives and commitments and avoid the major cities that were the reserve of top corporate roles pre pandemic. The next stage is how to work geographically from wherever we choose. This is tricky, as there are compliance and tax implications from country to country. But if this is the way forwards, then crossing from one country to another will need to be allowed and policies on how to support this can be worked out.</p>
<p>Meeting people every so often is important but the flexibility that (remote working) is going to give people is going to make a big difference. We will be able to attract completely different talent, for example hopefully more women as their roles can be more flexible. The rigid demands of certain roles may be in the past.</p>
<p>There is no one size fits all when we talk about future of work. For example, collaborative areas can be organised for employees who come to the office for only a couple of days every week instead of the usual desk/PC set up. The governance around this new way of work is yet to be finalised and implemented. Very important is to re-design the system of employees’ performance and contribution assessment so remote workers are properly measured and not disadvantaged when it comes to salary and bonus discussions. This will not be an easy process and companies are in very different stages.</p>
<p>Fintech companies have already been ahead of the game in this aspect. At the moment everyone is thinking about this and we are certainly not going to go back to what we had in pre-COVID years. It might take some time, but we are certainly going to have flexible work options as a key differentiating factor to attract great talent.</p></div>

<p>The pandemic has kept treasury professionals very busy, with various unprecedented business challenges, liquidity risks, market volatilities, etcetera. At the same time, it has put many things into perspective. What is the role of strategic treasury, what is the philosophy of risk management, and how do we ensure company liquidity is safeguarded, through structural ways and at all times, even post pandemic?</p>
<p>The pandemic also forced people to learn to work remotely. This is a fundamental change for us, in treasury and all functions. I have been very happy with the treasury systems and control processes we put in place prior to, and enhanced during the pandemic. It allows us to work remotely and efficiently. As I used to say, treasury moves billions of dollars, we must be the golden standard of control and compliance.</p>
<p>Besides obvious business continuity, I also observed some key benefits of remote working. First, I always believe in measuring people by their output not presence. But the pandemic proved out in practice that people can be productive anywhere. Second, it equalises people. Pre-pandemic, we used to have many telephone conferences with people not on-site. Having video conferences as a norm now with everyone actually brings people who used to be far “closer”, and we can “see” and “interact” with them the same way as with my team in the same city. Third, it does help to better integrate work and life. My family moved during the pandemic to another country. The fact that I have been physically at home created a safer environment for my children’s transition. My family also developed better appreciation of my work (and associated dedication, pride, perseverance) as they observed first hand.</p>
<p>But at the same time, remote working also brings significant challenges. We all see the line between work and life are further blurred. As a result, many of us work much longer hours and don’t ever “disconnect”. It can also be very difficult for some who are isolated: far from their families, and don’t have opportunities to interact with colleagues or friends. In my team, we organise virtual socials like happy hours or holiday gatherings from time to time, in an effort to talk about things other than work, and create bonding as a team, and my company promotes many health and wellness initiatives. But it can take a toll on people.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for my team. They have been demonstrating support, empathy and rigor during the pandemic. I do personally look forward to getting back to a hybrid model where we can interact and care for our teams by collaborating in person, and also allow work flexibility from time to time to better integrate work and life.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>As companies move toward hybrid working arrangements, there are many broad issues to tackle from tax and regulatory compliance to real estate and business strategy. Finance and treasury departments need to be attuned to these different impacts and plan effectively alongside other parts of the business. And when it comes to tax and human resources, there are real obligations to consider by allowing people to work in different countries (in the US this applies to different states too), away from their home working locations. Treasury will need to assess what this means from a cost perspective, and where the company is putting its funds.</p>
<p>Earlier in the pandemic, authorities announced reliefs to mitigate unintended tax consequences of having people work in places where ordinarily they wouldn’t be. Largely, however, these no longer apply. Where employees are still working remotely or in a hybrid arrangement, there is now the potential of companies accruing tax risk in these different countries. Treasury will have to think how this could impact the audit and how the business should address this.</p>
<p>It is important to remember, however, that while the working landscape has changed, the tax regulatory landscape hasn’t – we are back to where we were pre-pandemic, governed by double tax treaties and other bilateral and multilateral tax and social security agreements. This means employees in a different country could foreseeably create corporate tax exposure. Treasury and finance teams will have to determine if that individual could, by virtue of how long they are there or what they are doing, create a permanent establishment, which is deemed as a corporate taxable presence for the company and could force the company to pay corporate tax in that foreign jurisdiction.</p>
<p>There are also risks for companies as employers. Companies may need to register as an employer or operate a payroll. If companies don’t do this, they are potentially liable for the tax not withheld for the employees in that location. In short, it could open the company to employment taxes it might not otherwise be subject to, and in Europe particularly, the employer social security costs can be significant.</p>
<p>Although it’s still early days to identify what enforcement activity will be taken by tax authorities, we’ve seen cases in Israel and New Zealand where employees working remotely have been contacted by tax authorities and told they need to pay taxes. This tax season could put employees on those tax authorities’ radar when tax returns are filed – and companies must be prepared to address any tax consequences that arise.</p>
<p>The workforce has been liberated in a way unforeseen at the start of 2020, with many businesses that wouldn’t have considered hybrid working now accommodating what employees want – which is now amplified, given it’s an important source of talent attraction in a post-pandemic work environment. Companies must find a way to navigate a path forward that meets their business needs and manages tax and employee obligations. By leveraging tools to track the correct tax requirements for an employee’s work locations and the element of change management around the payroll, companies can effectively tackle these new complexities.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We are seeing our corporate clients adopting various work arrangements, with some bringing staff back and others offering the flexibility to work from home. There are some who have adopted new approaches such as designating a specific day per week for people to be in the office for in-person interaction and meetings. One of our clients did that and I thought that was an interesting approach.</p>
<p>For us, we are also gradually getting our employees back into the office, in line with local guidelines in various markets. We believe that an office environment works best for our employees and that it helps with the interaction and culture building. Our juniors and interns will also benefit from the in-person coaching and mentoring that will take place by being in the office.</p>
<p>We are also seeing changes to recruitment practices. There is now more flexibility such as hiring talent from locations outside of the office where the role is based. For instance, some of our US headquartered clients are now asking if they really need to have in-country roles for their Asia Pacific operations. They are exploring if it may be best to hire in the US for now then relocate those employees in Asia as the business grows to meet local regulations and guidelines.</p>
<p>While there have been various upsides to remote working, it has also brought to the forefront the importance of mental health and well-being of employees. Working from home over such a long period of time meant that the lines between working and personal hours are now blurred. It is not unusual to hear that people are working longer hours, with commuting time now spent on emails and calls instead. There is a real element of virtual fatigue as people are working much harder to stay connected with colleagues as compared to being in the office.</p>
<p>As the world moves on to gradually reopen, we will start to see various models being tested and adopted but one thing is certain, the future of work will continue to evolve.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We had a flexible working policy in place even before the pandemic and our approach to ways of working will remain flexible and the individuals will continue to be managed by outputs and measured in terms of meeting their goals. We know some colleagues would benefit from more time spent together and some individuals have expressed a desire for a blend of office and remote working. Our response to this will be to introduce a “Hub, Home, Roam” approach which will rely on trust and flexibility.</p>
<p>We have used the feedback gathered from colleagues to put together a plan for future ways of working at Golding Homes and consider how colleagues can safely return to the office over the coming months. We will be doing everything possible to support and keep both colleagues and customers safe. We always had a flexible working policy and given the success of remote working over the past 18 months, we will explore the possibility of further expanding the flexibility of recruitment policy in treasury as necessary.</p>
<p>Clearly there will be fewer face to face bank meetings in the short to medium term and it’s likely the trend will continue in to the long term. As the treasury team is small, we managed to keep the team dynamics broadly the same during the pandemic and made a conscious effort to have more frequent conversations with the team members. Whenever possible we reduced the number of emails and had video calls with the colleagues instead. We set aside some of the saved commuting time to have non-work-related catch ups.</p>
<p>We will continue to use various internal communication channels to promote treasury successes to the wider business. Long working hours and the blurred work life balance was clearly harmful. As a result, we are having ongoing discussions in the team to constantly remind each other of the importance of having a clear separation between work and personal lives. Also, the blend of remote and office working going forward will hopefully aid in getting the right mindset to have a clear separation and avoiding potential long working hours.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>There’s a real acceptance that the office is all about connecting with people now to develop collaboration, swap ideas and to illicit support and development. At the same time, the ability to work remotely is also extremely useful especially when you just need to “get things done”. A healthy balance between both is our rationale for the way forward here.</p>
<p>The benefits to take from our working patterns over the last 18 months is the flexibility afforded from a hybrid working style. If used correctly it should boost productivity. We are all aware now of the toxic side of working remotely. It can be very difficult sometimes to switch off, especially when you see colleagues and external contacts burning the midnight oil. Not many of us really miss the commute, but the separation it gives between work and home life has an important purpose.</p>
<p>Other aspects of the job are harder when carried out remotely. Training people for example is often something best done when sitting someone down and focusing on the subject matter. Picking up on body language and directing towards an objective can also be much harder to do on a Zoom or Teams call.</p>
<p>It’s not so much a question of what’s changed with remote working, as what hasn’t. The level of professionalism, dedication to the cause and hard work have been maintained throughout the last eighteen months. The department has faced many challenges, many of which were not even considered a possibility pre-pandemic, but these have all been overcome.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>With a third of the world’s population experiencing some form of lockdown, working from home has suddenly become commonplace. In some companies, the transition from working in the office to working remotely has been seamless. Indeed, many companies offered remote working models to their employees pre-COVID-19, making it easier to adapt to the current situation. For others, however, the challenges involved mean that it isn’t a feasible long-term option.</p>
<p>Eric Sim, Founder of the Institute of Life, believes that with some adjustment and the right knowledge, corporate employees can easily work from home – and that this will become the norm for at least one day per week for most companies.</p>
<p>But for Ramana Konda, Director, Treasury Asia, Middle East and Africa at Mondelez International, remote working is more nuanced, especially for treasurers. Konda explains that for the data management side of a treasurer’s role, remote working is easy, owing to the limited requirement for interaction with others in the business. But he also asks, to what extent is treasury only about data? Treasury is playing an increasingly strategic role within businesses and Konda feels that they need a physical presence in the office to do so effectively.</p>
<h4 id="happy-employees-happy-company">Happy employees = happy company</h4>
<p>There are, of course, many benefits to working remotely. For Helen Hanby, Director, International Treasury at Biogen Idec, a big benefit of working from home is the ability to save two hours per day by not commuting. People may choose to put this time to good use: Sim, for example, spends the time he has gained on learning, and is currently educating himself on positive psychology and video editing.</p>
<p>Home workers generally report better productivity and a higher quality of work than when they are in a traditional office, and the flexibility that home working offers can also help companies retain employees that might otherwise leave. For parents, working from home isn’t a substitute for childcare, but it can enable a better work-life balance by removing commuting time and allowing them to be more present at home, whilst also keeping them in the professional loop.</p>
<p>Likewise, disabled employees who struggle to commute may be able to handle a regular workload from the comfort of their house. Sim also points out that when employees are feeling slightly under the weather, they may be able to work from home instead of using up sick days that might be needed for serious illnesses.</p>
<p>Employees whose families may be relocating, perhaps because a partner has secured a new job elsewhere, may be able to use home working to continue in their employment. And of course, in times of crisis or other disruption – such as severe weather conditions – having the infrastructure already in place means that the switch can be as seamless as possible.</p>
<h4 id="cybercrime-is-on-the-rise">Cybercrime is on the rise</h4>
<p>Security is one major consideration when weighing up the pros and cons of home working – particularly given the current focus on this topic. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused such an increase in cybercrime that the World Health Organisation had to post an advisory on its website as fraudsters are impersonating it in phishing emails.</p>
<p>The increase in cybercrime comes as fraudsters and hackers try to take advantage of the upheaval that many companies are experiencing in going remote. Treasurers, as always, are primary targets for these attempts, and so need to be vigilant about any suspicious activity. In particular, emails that ask for files or links to be opened, bank details to be changed or payments to be made should be inspected thoroughly and secondary authorisation should be sought if necessary.</p>
<h4 id="is-remote-working-cyber-secure">Is remote working cyber-secure?</h4>
<p>However, Anish Kapoor, CEO of AccessPay believes that if approached in the correct way, remote working can actually be more secure than working in an office. “A prime example of what we see is when treasurers have a SWIFT workstation, that’s just sat on a desk in the office,” he explains. “With access to that SWIFT workstation, an individual can pretty much do whatever they want. But when you move to having a different technology stack that lets you work from anywhere and you’re not linked to that one workstation anymore, you can normally build a lot more control, having maybe biometric authentication, or two-factor authentication.” Alongside that, there are also multiple layers of access control, and the potential to have other layers of approvals processes.</p>
<p>From a cyber-security standpoint, there are also other things individuals can do to ensure they are staying safe when working remotely – many of which should be company policy. Cyber-security and anti-virus provider Kaspersky recommends making sure that a home WiFi router is encrypted, meaning it requires a password to connect. If using a public WiFi, and indeed sometimes using a personal one, it is also recommended to use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt all data from any potential prying eyes.</p>
<p>Additionally, using a company’s regular corporate services to transfer files and data between colleagues can help security. These services are regulated by a company’s IT department, whereas file-sharing services such as Google Drive can become public very easily if someone has the correct keywords.</p>
<h4 id="can-remote-working-replace-face-to-face">Can remote working replace face to face?</h4>
<p>Remote working may be more convenient for some employees, but Konda feels that the importance of face-to-face interaction and a physical presence in the office cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>He cites the example of carrying out an FX hedge. “Even today in most markets across the globe, the application for FX involves a manual vetting process,” he explains. In Asia this is especially true, with the array of regulations across countries meaning that many of the processes associated with FX hedging must be done on paper, and often in person. “FX transactions are one of the activities that the company conducts in ‘live mode’, where the coordination of the paper signature is crucial to reach the central bank, or a specific market, and is just one example of why it’s important to stay close to the transaction,” says Konda.</p>
<p>Indeed, aside from the business benefits of having a physical presence in the office, it has also been suggested that physical interaction serves communication better than virtual meetings. Use of video conferencing tools like Microsoft Teams, Skype and Zoom have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year, and their usefulness cannot be ignored. Being able to connect with people across any distance, the only requirement being an internet connection, is revolutionary for businesses.</p>
<p>Hanby, who is based in the UK whilst working for an American company, explains that she is currently working from her home, with three members of her team working from their respective homes in the US, and her treasury analyst working from home in Poland. “We are regularly checking in with each other and the company has been hugely supportive, offering many wellness and mental health support initiatives and opportunities, including virtual training and community groups,” she says.</p>
<p>Konda is in a similar position, as his role sees treasury managers reporting to him from 18 countries. As such, the ability to communicate effectively is important. “Some of my team members are data-driven, and some are also sitting in their respective leadership teams and managing a sub-cluster of the region,” he says. “For the people dealing with the day-to-day operations of letters of credit which are not immediately payable now – particularly treasury transactions like card repatriation payments or interest on loans – those can definitely be managed remotely.” He continues: “I think for my team specifically, 50% are happy working remotely – and so am I, as long as they’re getting the job done.”</p>
<h4 id="options-for-treasurers">Options for treasurers</h4>
<p>As the world moves to more digital solutions, so too does treasury – or rather, it should. Many companies are trying to move away from a reliance on spreadsheets by implementing treasury management systems (TMS) and ERPs. When it comes to working from home, these sophisticated systems become more important, as they keep information centralised and easier to access.</p>
<p>For Biogen’s Hanby, having the right equipment and software is an important first step. “The company has been very supportive, providing essential IT equipment, and we use online systems which are all still accessible remotely,” she explains.</p>
<p>Kapoor notes that in 2018, AccessPay conducted a Finance &amp; Treasury Automation Adoption Survey, which found that spreadsheets were still the predominant tool used by most treasurers. When it comes to working remotely, Kapoor explains that this approach “would involve emailing around lots and lots of spreadsheets – which isn’t great from a technology and data protection perspective.”</p>
<p>If cloud-based systems aren’t feasible for a company at the moment – for example, implementing a TMS can prove very costly – then there are other options available. These might include the use of a reliable remote desktop – using a secure VPN, of course.</p>
<p>Virtual project management tools such as Basecamp, Microsoft Teams or Trello are also a necessity, particularly if a treasury team has more than two or three members. But, Konda reminds, technology is an enabler and not an alternative to the core conduct of business in treasury. He notes that new projects that arise, especially automations such as implementation of automatic debit or an ACH, require partners to be connected to the physical office rather than remotely.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are some aspects of treasury that move so fast – the enormous and rapid fluctuations in the markets are evidence of that – that Konda feels a physical presence in the office is a necessity, if only for the strategic ease of being able to contact someone and take action immediately, rather than have to wait for a reply to an email.</p>

<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Can virtual offices work?</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p><img alt="graphic 1" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2020-05-06-tt-06__tech_remote-working-the-new-normal____598x493.png?la=en&amp;hash=5D5A41BE88C1BCE90B736FEA4365D410" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em" width="140"/></p>
<p>The extent to which virtual offices can replace a real-life meeting is questionable. One study found that the inevitable delays in virtual communication, both over the phone and online, cause significant feelings of awkwardness and confusion. Transmission delays of just 1.2 seconds meant that other parties were rated as “less attentive, friendly and self-disciplined than if there was no delay”.</p>
<p>Sim has a few tips to help with making video conferencing run more smoothly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always use headphones to ensure good audio quality and, if possible, use an external webcam. “I see a lot of bad audio and video quality, as the hardware that comes with computers is not always the best.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the camera at eye level, “otherwise participants will be looking up your nostrils”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sit next to a window if you can, so that one side of your face is nicely lit up. “If that’s not possible, then use a desk lamp aimed at the wall, to bounce the light off.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to maintain professionalism on business calls. “I put on my standard white shirt and navy suit, but long pants aren’t necessary!”</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="from-the-bottom-up">From the bottom up</h4>
<p>In Kapoor’s experience, the main problems that come from working remotely aren’t generally technological, but rather human ones. For essential treasury activities like cash forecasting, input is required from a variety of people across the business, bringing with it the risk of human error.</p>
<p>“A number of cloud-based TMS projects have been entered into with the thought that ‘oh we’ll just put this TMS in place and it’ll solve all our problems and we can work from anywhere’, and actually it doesn’t work like that,” Kapoor explains. “The problem is how you get all this information from all the people and systems in the business.”</p>
<p>As a result, the businesses that have transitioned seamlessly to working remotely have been the ones that have put a great deal of thought into how these systems work. “They’ve used technology to automate as much of that input as possible, working from the bottom up,” says Kapoor. “So when everything started to happen with the coronavirus and they had to go remote, they didn’t have some of the problems that other companies have experienced.”</p>
<p>The best way to overcome the data-input challenge, aside from automating everything, says Kapoor, is for the treasurer to engage with the people they need the data from and ask them ‘what can I do that would make your life easier? How can I help to take some of the burden from you, because presumably pulling all this data together every day is not something you look forward to?’ This type of empathetic engagement and human connection can help overcome problems while paving the way to a smoother remote working experience.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="ill-remote-become-the-norm">Will remote become the norm?</h4>
<p>“This isn’t going to go away,” says Kapoor. “There are going to be more of these events, and so everyone we talk to is thinking long term, thinking that actually they’ve got to be prepared for a world where we have to work from home not all of the time, but certainly more of the time.”</p>
<p>Konda, despite his belief that a fully functional treasury department requires a physical presence in the office, is of a similar view. “Five years ago, we had a lot of offices and many rooms in companies. There came a trend where a company would hire a floor with just cubicles, no offices, and so we graduated down into that space. We saw hot desks, where you could walk into any of them and start working. Now, the gradual transition will be towards working remotely.”</p>
<p>A lot of companies already offer remote working as a benefit, and Konda notes that Mondelez has offered it for a while. In the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic though, he says it’s important to note that the remote working instigated by the virus is not indicative of a future of remote working. “Entire communities have gone into lockdown; your colleague community, your external party community, such as banks, meaning a reduced number of available banking hours, the situation is different.” He’s hopeful that post-COVID-19, remote working will be a possibility for all employees by default.</p>
<p>Hanby is already a supporter of remote working, and like Kapoor and Konda she sees it becoming more popular in the future. “I think across a huge number of businesses there will be a massive shift in how people work post-pandemic. I think this enforced working from home has made people realise that in a lot of cases it is absolutely possible, and that there are huge associated benefits such as saving time and money, environmental considerations and being able to spend more time with family,” she concludes.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In this environment, corporate treasuries are being impacted profoundly, needing to adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>An example of this successful approach can be seen in Xiaomi. Founded in 2010 as an internet company with smartphones and smart hardware connected by an internet of things (IoT) platform at its core, it became the youngest company on this year’s Fortune Global 500 list.</p>
<p>Xiaomi’s business model comprises of three pillars. The first is hardware. It is the fourth largest smartphone maker in the world and has established the world’s largest consumer IoT platform, connecting 196 million devices (excluding smartphones and laptops). The second pillar is retail, with a significant portion of revenue coming from its online platform. Pillar three is internet services, with Xiaomi leveraging the user-base it acquired through sales of smartphones and IoT devices. The three synergistic pillars form what Xiaomi refers to as its ‘triathlon business model’.</p>
<p>Efficiency underpins all business-model decisions made by Xiaomi. With the company having built its own retail platform, the cost to acquire customers is a lot lower than channelling sales through layers of distribution. Xiaomi also requires robust solutions for C2B payments and for the integration of its business/finance systems. This helps achieve straight through transaction processing, ensuring speed, scalability and cost efficiency.</p>
<p>Xiaomi makes only its core products itself. For the remaining products, it provides a hardware incubation platform through which it has encouraged and invested in over 200 ecosystem companies. With efficiency in mind, Xiaomi provides these companies with incubation services, including design, product management, supply chain and funding.</p>
<p>Xiaomi believes that supply chain financing (SCF) enables its partners to access more efficient funding, leveraging Xiaomi’s own credit strength. Xiaomi aims to rebuild a comprehensive risk-control model, similar to that of the credit rating companies.</p>
<p>This model enables evaluation of business scenarios under which its partners can access SCF and factoring programmes. But Xiaomi sees these as more than financing tools, deeply integrating them into what it wants to achieve as a company.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is one of the few Chinese corporates that is learning how to be a global consumer company. Last year, 40% of its revenue came from international markets, growing more than 100% year-on-year by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Today, Xiaomi is present in over 80 markets. Throughout its journey to internationalisation, it has faced many new treasury challenges. Currently, FX risk tops the agenda. Some countries it has entered have more rigid currency controls and exchange rate volatility. While acknowledging that companies with FX exposures could mitigate FX risk through effective hedging schemes, Xiaomi believes that companies should first ask some fundamental questions. These include the probing of key drivers behind each new market, and asking what are the key factors in the long-run that will decide the value of each currency to which they have exposure.</p>
<p>Only in this way is a company able to formulate strategic and long-term solutions. In addition to a long-term FX management perspective, Xiaomi also chooses to be very cautious when adding new billing/settlement currencies, making sure the embedded dynamics and risks are well understood before proceeding.</p>
<p>As part of its overall strategy, Xiaomi is building its global treasury centre in Hong Kong. This initiative has been in planning for a couple of years. Currently, Xiaomi operates most of its treasury operations out of headquarters in Beijing. Setting up a global treasury centre would enable it to be more efficient in handling various treasury requests from international markets, including activities such as global liquidity management, FX trading and hedging.</p>
<p>In the long run, as business models and regulations evolve, Xiaomi believes it might need to combine its global treasury centre, regional and, in some cases, even local treasury teams, as it seeks a balance between efficiency and business needs.</p>
<p>However, the most critical and challenging issue for treasury at the moment is to manage information flow, to have robust and integrated systems, to ensure processes are in place and to clearly define roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other initiatives that may be taken by corporate treasuries to adapt to business model changes. These include setting up reinvoicing centres to streamline trade flows and aggregate FX exposure, the adoption of different hedging approaches for G10 and emerging market currencies, and the optimisation of global liquidity structures to best support international expansion.</p>
<p id="video-infographic">While the initiatives taken by each company may vary from case to case, the key to enable treasury to excel is always found in staying adaptive, agile and innovative.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>“To what extent is treasury being changed by consumer behaviour?”</em></p>
<figure class="portrait left" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 2em 0em 0;"> <img alt="Mina Nasif" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/mina_nasif-133.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=B39E07FEA942FC72513E000444682B6A" width="133"><br/>
</img></figure>
<h5 id="beacon-consulting-mina-nasif-and-associates">Mina Nasif, Corporate Treasury Consultant, CTP Instructor, Beacon Consulting/Mina Nasif &amp; Associates:</h5>
<p>Treasury and consumer behaviour are two sides of the same coin; technology is the bridge. Within a corporate finance function, I believe treasury is the most affected by technological change because as obsolescence arises through the introduction of new consumer technologies, it falls to treasurers to bring on board new solutions to meet both the consumers’ and the business’ payments and collections needs.</p>
<p>With digitisation becoming the strategic imperative to meet these needs, companies will focus more investment on digitising their customer interfaces. But their R&amp;D investment in digitising their back-end systems and processes should receive no less attention. This is because the back-end can be the greatest driver of profit-margin improvements for many companies; it’s what makes consumer payments easier and it helps the business gather data, keeping clients loyal.</p>
<p>In fact, the evolution of big data retail analysis systems has made it possible to implement sophisticated pricing structures, right across the business. Such intelligence is critical to maintaining the balance between revenue and margin. It doesn’t mean a race to the lowest price – not everyone can be the cheapest – but it is about pricing and stocking correctly and as often as possible.</p>
<p>As consumer preference for digital over physical shopping rises, we see ever-larger turnovers for Amazon, AliExpress, Best Buy and others. Technology is clearly opening up new business opportunities and channels, particularly in China where e-commerce growth is driving huge changes. But it brings a new set of challenges for businesses.</p>
<p>When dealing with digital payments and service providers, whether the business sets up its own account with AliPay or WeChat Pay, or it uses a service provider or distributor as an intermediary, there is a cost. Where intermediaries are used for B2C businesses, there is an additional concern in some jurisdictions about the regulation of these intermediaries and how data is protected.</p>
<p>With 24/7 sales via these platforms, there is also a time component to consider, both from a supply chain and a cash management perspective. Finally, there is lot of data being produced, and this must be used in the right way to develop insights that help businesses drive better consumer relationships in the face of stiff competition.</p>
<p>I believe that e-commerce has an impact on the entire business model. Where companies previously packaged products in pallets to go to distributors, increasingly they ship directly to consumers, demanding a rethink of the packaging and delivery model. But digitisation also demands a response to the fact that it is no longer just the company that sells; influencers on social media, bloggers, celebrities are all now playing a role. If a blogger calls out a particular beauty product, there is a spike in demand. You can’t plan for a disparate host of influencers deciding to talk about your products, so it becomes very difficult to anticipate consumer behaviour and demand. Treasury needs to make sure it can support a supply chain that is becoming more difficult to predict and that means getting much closer to the business. Consumer behaviour is having a major impact on the shape of treasury!</p>
<figure class="portrait right" style="float: right; margin: 0em 0em 0em 2em;"> <img alt="Antti Kyyro" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/antti_kyyro-133.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=2B12DF1AB1D6AED93F192AB8379B5B44" width="133"/><br/>
</figure>
<h5 id="standard-chartered">Antti Kyyrö, Executive Director, Treasury Solutions, Europe, Standard Chartered:</h5>
<p>Many argue that there has never been a better time to be a consumer than today. Advancements in mobile connectivity, global internet penetration and the general falling cost of technology are empowering the consumer through price and product transparency and access to marketplaces.</p>
<p>Disruption to businesses is set to continue, as commercial success increasingly hinges on the ability to follow rapidly shifting consumer trends. Companies need to function as cohesive teams to be able to provide seamless, personalised on-demand customer experiences available 24x7x365.</p>
<p>At the same time, from an external perspective, demographic shifts such as millennials’ preference of experiences over products and the rising importance of emerging markets increase business complexity through the need to localise vs the traditional lift and drop approach to global business.</p>
<p>What does this mean to treasury? No industry or individual business function is isolated from the impact of technology and how it reshapes the interaction with customers and the wider market.</p>
<p>Take the typical example of a business moving from a bricks and mortar reseller model to a direct local online sales model. Treasury will now need to insource many of the treasury tasks that were previously assumed by the reseller. Among other things this requires providing a payment gateway solution to support various local payment options from traditional cards to mobile wallets to instant payment systems possibly connected to your TMS or ERP through APIs in real time. The treasurer will also need to find ways to manage the associated FX requirements and develop a liquidity management model that will allow selling an imported product to a local end consumer without material increase in costs and complexity. The online model may need to be further enhanced with various ancillary services such as customer financing or insurance that the treasury team will need to deliver.</p>
<p>For some consumers the rise in a sharing economy has taken away the need to own physical products altogether. Whilst there are various examples of this from clothes to even pets, most obvious is transportation. Ride hailing companies have shown how a seamless on-demand experience may shift consumer preference through convenience. Some even argue that the decline in young people acquiring driver’s licences in the US over the past years is due to the availability of ride hailing services.</p>
<p>The shift from selling a physical asset to providing a service will have fundamental implications to the corporation and their treasury department. Instead of managing large collections from a few distributors, treasury now needs to set up cash and liquidity management processes for fragmented local cash flows from single service transactions via various channels. AI applications and predictive analytics are increasingly utilised by treasurers in managing this growing complexity of creditor relationships and the associated risks. In the broader finance context, treasury may also need to seek ways to optimise capital structure through SPVs and various asset light funding models to manage balance sheet size.</p>
<p>The above are just a few in a sea of examples of how consumer behaviour is driving end-to-end business transformation, but what they imply is clear, great products are not enough. Treasurers’ role in providing the latest cash management technology to the business directly serve the overall customer experience and convenience.</p>
<p>Often these solutions, such as the ability to settle real-time in an online environment or providing automated FX hedging solutions, are critical to the overall sustained success of a new business model. In addition to understanding the local markets and their complexities, leveraging technology, such as APIs and predictive analytics, are key enablers in becoming a strategic partner to the business. Long gone are the days of deriving treasury success from a reactive ivory tower approach through rigid policies, processes and governance only.</p>
<figure class="portrait left" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 2em 0em 0;"> <img alt="Stefan Leijdekkers" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/stefan_leijdekkers-133.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=7F473930B0BB396EA974C00E26859364" width="133"/><br/>

<h5 id="bank-of-america-merrill-lynch">Stefan Leijdekkers, Head of Regional Sales, Asia Pacific, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch:</h5>
<p>Global smartphone penetration has increased steadily in the past decade. Today, according to the Forbes article published in August 2017, “How much time do you spend using apps?”, we see US consumers spending an average of five hours daily on their smartphones, carrying out most of their daily tasks.</p>
<p>The mass adoption of smartphones has also reinvented commerce. We’ve seen the growth of ecommerce in the past decade, giving rise to the change in consumers’ behaviour and expectations. This has facilitated the growth of mobile wallets, contactless payment modes, payments via QR codes and so on, where consumers can simply pay by waving their smartphones across point of sale (POS)/near-field communication (NFC) terminals in retail stores.</p>
<p>With the widespread adoption of digital technology, educated consumers are seeking enhanced convenience in payments, with the emphasis on speed and flexibility in the way they pay for their purchases. This has urged merchants to reconsider their business model and provide payment acceptance platforms that support mobile payments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increased focus on security measures for making such digital payments has also contributed to the level of comfort, facilitating such digital payments. Treasurers need to adapt to the changes and have a mobile strategy, especially (but not only) in B2C business models.</p>
<p>The exponential growth in the e-commerce market over the last few years, coupled with demographic shifts and the emergence of tech-savvy millennials into the workforce, have seen a change in consumer patterns. Consumers are beginning to shop more actively in real time and on the go, as compared to traditional brick and mortars.</p>
<p>Retail businesses now have to revamp their business models and explore an ‘omni-channel’ retail model where their customers are able to enjoy a seamless shopping experience, both online and offline in the physical stores.</p>
<p>With increasing consumer preference for online shopping, the ability for a merchant to facilitate seamless online payments becomes crucial. Consumers are moving away from cash payments to online payments as part of the online shopping experience. As a result, it is imperative for treasurers, also beyond the typical e-commerce players to add to e-commerce channels with payment capability linked to ERP systems via application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>With the migration from paper to electronic payments, a payment no longer signifies the closure of a successful business transaction. On the contrary, it opens up doors to many more business opportunities by leveraging the accompanying data from aggregated payments. A digital payment allows merchants to capture payer information or details from the underlying payment transaction as compared to a cash payment where there is no personal information required or involved in the transaction. As a result, the treasury function today is no longer viewed as a utility function, but one that is able to value-add by providing a wealth of data analysis to identify business growth opportunities and formulate business strategies going forward.</p></div>

<p>In today’s evolving regulatory and interest rate environment, it is essential that organisations’ investment policies continue to meet the needs of current market conditions – and this means having the right tools in place. A cash investment policy statement is an important part of the equation when it comes to supporting sound cash investment decisions.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-cash-ips">What is a cash IPS?</h4>
<p>Organisations can use a cash IPS to set out their short-term investment goals and the strategies they will use to achieve them, as well as documenting the segmentation of cash into different categories based on the company’s liquidity needs. Typically the cash IPS will define the organisation’s parameters in terms of liquidity, quality and return, as well as specifying its return requirements, risk tolerance and permissible investments. The cash IPS should also document any investment constraints, such as tax considerations; environmental, social and governance guidelines.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons for adopting a cash IPS. As well as providing more clarity for everyone from the investment team to the board of directors, a cash IPS can help organisations optimise cash, while promoting accountability by building in governance. The statement can also be used to help navigate regulatory change and adapt to changing interest rates.</p>
<h4 id="in-with-the-new">In with the new</h4>
<p>While organisations may already have a cash IPS in place, current market conditions are prompting many investors to adopt a new cash IPS, or to update the existing statement. Regulatory developments such as Basel III or money market fund reform in the US and Europe may lead companies to adjust their cash IPS. Likewise, the evolving interest rate environment is making it more important for investors to be flexible in the face of market changes. As well as, evolution in products such as ultra-short exchanged-traded funds (ETFs) and liquidity private placement funds.</p>
<p>In any case, a cash IPS is not set in stone: treasury teams often update their cash IPS frequently so that they can take advantage of new investment opportunities and cash management products.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this takes time – so it is important to get the ball rolling at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-build-a-cash-ips">How to build a cash IPS</h4>
<p>When it comes to creating a new cash IPS – or reviewing the existing IPS – companies will need to set out their cash investment objectives, draw up a cash forecast and, where applicable, segment cash into different categories based on considerations such as liquidity and purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Set objectives</h5>
<p>First and foremost, the cash IPS should detail the organisation’s goals for its short-term investment strategy, as well as specifying how the organisation will meet those goals. The objectives section of the cash IPS may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Capital preservation.</h5>
<p>Protecting the principal will likely be a primary goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity.</h5>
<p>The cash IPS should stipulate the level of liquidity needed in order to mitigate avoidable risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Yield.</h5>
<p>The organisation may include yield among its goals, although the cash IPS will need to weigh this against the likely increase in volatility of principal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Tax-advantaged returns.</h5>
<p>In some cases, organisations may be seeking tax-conscious liquidity management, for example by using tax-free short-term funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Above-benchmark returns.</h5>
<p>Objectives may also include exceeding a benchmark that mirrors the portfolio’s underlying investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Produce a cash forecast</h5>
<p>The treasury team should then inventory the company’s expenditures in order to produce a detailed cash forecast. This can be used to identify what portion of a portfolio needs to be readily accessible, and which portion can be treated as surplus cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Segment cash</h5>
<p>Drawing upon this information, the cash IPS may then detail how cash should be segmented into different categories based on different objectives and liquidity requirements. Typically these categories will include key ‘buckets’ such as operating cash, reserve cash and strategic cash. Operating cash is used to fund the company’s operating needs and therefore requires same-day or short-term liquidity. Reserve cash – which may be earmarked for purposes such as acquisitions, research and development, or stock repurchase – may have an investment horizon of six to 12 months, while strategic cash may be invested for one year or more.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="key-components-of-a-cash-ips">Key components of a cash IPS</h4>
<p>Once the objectives of the cash IPS have been defined, and the cash segmentation strategy clarified, the next step is to provide greater detail about the level of risk which can be tolerated within each segment. In some cases, organisations will adopt a higher-risk strategic cash allocation – but the impact of the decision will need to be understood and documented within the IPS.</p>
<p>For each segment, companies should therefore consider a number of different risk factors, including their tolerance for liquidity constraints, the portfolio’s sensitivity to interest rate volatility and the possibility of liquidity fees being imposed in times of market stress. Companies should also assess their tolerance for short-term negative returns and the acceptable range of realised gains/losses over a given period.</p>
<p>When considering risk tolerance, the following types of risk should be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Interest rate risk.</h5>
<p>A change in interest rates can affect the value of a security – so for each segment, the cash IPS should stipulate the organisation’s interest rate risk tolerance. Typically the operating cash will have the lowest interest rate risk tolerance, while the strategic segment will have the highest tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity risk.</h5>
<p>The cash IPS should define the level of liquidity needed so that companies can meet their obligations without needing to sell longer-dated securities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Credit risk.</h5>
<p>The value of a security can change as a result of a rating downgrade or a credit risk default. The IPS should define the minimum credit quality required for individual securities. It is also advisable to specify an average credit quality limit on the portfolio as a whole in order to ensure credit quality diversification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Loss of principal risk.</h5>
<p>In certain circumstances, a major downturn could result in the loss of principal for longer-duration cash products. The cash IPS should define whether the organisation can accept a level of short-term volatility, as well as its requirements in terms of steady dividend income and diversification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h4>
<p>As well as looking at the risk factors detailed above, companies should also consider a number of other elements when creating the cash IPS. For one thing, it’s important to state the types of securities permitted by the cash IPS, including any parameters relating to credit quality maturity and diversification. The IPS should also detail what the company should do if a security or issuer is downgraded, or if ratings differ between rating agencies.</p>
<p>When it comes to tracking performance, the IPS should specify portfolio benchmarks in line with the company’s investment strategy, as well as spelling out any tolerance for portfolio gains or losses. Likewise, the IPS should set out duration strategies for each cash segment, specifying in each case whether the strategy is a target duration or a buy-and-hold strategy.</p>
<p>In addition, the cash IPS should identify any sustainability or environmental, social and governance (ESG) parameters which may be applied.</p>
<h4 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and responsibilities</h4>
<p>Another requirement of the cash IPS is to provide clarity over the roles and responsibilities of those involved in approving, implementing and modifying the statement. Adopting an IPS is not a one-off exercise, so provision should be made for how the cash IPS will be evaluated on a regular basis, and how compliance will be enforced.</p>
<p>It is important to bear in mind that circumstances can change: regulatory developments may affect the company’s cash management strategy, while risk tolerance can change over time. Actions such as acquisitions and share buybacks may reduce available cash, while a divestiture or bond issue could generate a significant inflow.</p>
<p>The IPS should therefore define who is responsible for reviewing the IPS and who can recommend modifications. Typically this will include the CFO, treasurer, assistant treasurer and other members of the treasury group. Likewise, the IPS should specify who has authority for final sign-off: this will usually be the CEO, CFO and/or board of directors. Procedures should also be put in place for any exceptions to the investment policy which may arise, and how these should be approved.</p>
<h4 id="seeking-an-external-asset-manager">Seeking an external asset manager</h4>
<p>Finally, companies will need to consider how to go about implementing the cash IPS. Some will have the resources needed to manage short-term investments in-house, such as portfolio management systems and risk control expertise. Companies managing their investments in-house will also need to have a credit team and a procedure for providing the necessary compliance monitoring reporting.</p>
<p>In other cases, it will be appropriate to seek assistance from an external asset manager which may be better suited to provide the relevant knowledge, resources, time and infrastructure. When choosing an external manager, it is essential to ask some rigorous questions about the capabilities of any managers under consideration. For one thing, companies should assess the asset manager’s tenure in the short-term fixed income business and its track record in credit and risk management. Likewise, organisations should consider the size of the firm’s dedicated credit team, the background of team members and to what extent credit teams are separated from the portfolio manager.</p>
<p>Other criteria should include the asset manager’s geographical scale and business model, as well as the diversity of its client base. Last but not least, companies should pay attention to the firm’s total AUM in short-term fixed income, its share in the money market business and how this has changed over time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is essential that companies continue to evaluate their investment strategies in line with changing market conditions – and the cash IPS is an important tool in defining and enforcing an organisation’s investment goals. Whether companies are creating an IPS for the first time, or reviewing an existing statement, they will need to approach the process rigorously in order to create a robust IPS with the flexibility to meet their evolving needs.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>“When Serrala created its Managed Services group in early 2018, its aim was to deliver a suite of modular services capable of improving the clients’ operations and reducing their costs,” says Mickey Vonckx, the group’s VP. Can that really work for specialised treasury functions?</em></p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn"><img alt="Mickey Vonckx, Serrala" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/mickey_vonckx_serrala-133x200.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=7A3463BBC0725ACF44058013EF8EFFD7" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0;" width="133"/>Mickey Vonckx</h4>
<h5 class="title">VP Managed Services</h5>
<img alt="Serrala" class="logo org" height="40" src="/i/logo/serrala-logo-2018-80x40.png" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0;" title="Serrala" width="80"/>
</div>
<p style="clear:both">Most treasurers will recognise this scenario: the need for specialised resources are urgent but the competitive differentiation derived from the task is, at best, moderate. It’s a hard sell when it comes to creating a business case for something that, in the eyes of senior management, won’t make that much difference. And yet the truth, as most treasurers will also recognise, is that outsourcing some of the basic operational tasks around payments, for example, would free up time for real business-wide value-adding activities.</p>
<p>But is outsourcing, traditionally based on a ‘time and materials’ (T&amp;M) type contract, a suitable model for treasury activities, where knowledge and expertise are still required? It is when the old T&amp;M approach is replaced by one of an “outcome-based relationship” that is capable of rapidly delivering readily available services governed by clear service level agreements (SLAs), says Mickey Vonckx, VP Managed Services, Serrala.</p>
<p>Vonckx advocates a ‘managed services’ model for treasurers, especially those beating a path to digitisation. “They want to benefit from new software solutions immediately, not engage in lengthy implementation cycles,” he explains.</p>
<p>The desire for instant access is a result perhaps of how, as consumers, many of us have got used to going online and having “everything available at our fingertips”, notes Vonckx. That same level of expectation is feeding into the finance functions – including treasury – of the corporate world.</p>
<p>But with intense competition from many other functions travelling the path, treasury’s access to the internal technical resources needed to help deliver a digital transformation can be limited. The creation of Serrala’s managed services group presents a “readily available and flexible means of addressing treasury’s pain-points”.</p>
<p>Indeed, by bundling Serrala’s expertise and experience, Vonckx says clients can benefit from quickly integrating cloud-based micro-services within their own business processes. This can be achieved either with Serrala’s own payments, receivables and treasury software, or supplementing software from third-party providers. “Feature-function is important but it’s increasingly important to have flexibility around the fast and seamless integration into the processes of the customer,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="responsive-to-change">Responsive to change</h3>
<p>For a global treasury, the need for change – driven internally and externally – can be constant, says Vonckx. Existing within this dynamic environment means being able to respond quickly to change. A treasury with global and local banking partners will, for example, wish to substitute one institution for another or bring on board an additional one. If a need has been defined, treasury will want to have its new accounts operational in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>
<p>In a managed services context, the speed with which new connectivity and transactional services are delivered will be governed by the SLA. But the SLAs offered by Serrala precisely define delivery not only in terms of the initial set-up but also for managing changes in the bank formats, bank connectivity, banking partners and so forth. As Vonckx says, with the ongoing demand to keep ahead of the curve, fighting over project delivery times is a distraction most treasurers could do without.</p>
<p>What’s more, with the arrival of developments such as open banking, APIs, instant payments and SWIFT challengers such as Ripple, corporates need to stay alert, taking up the challenge where it suits. But treasurers also need to consider whether they can and will adequately develop and maintain the necessary skills within the team to manage such changes or use a third party to act as its on-call skills-centre. For Vonckx, a third-party service provider that can deliver all these changes with the backing of an SLA for each should be a serious consideration.</p>
<h3 id="tackling-pain-points">Tackling pain-points</h3>
<p>One of the major pain-points for treasuries today is around connectivity, says Vonckx. This includes essential but potentially time-consuming sub-processes such as payment format handling which can require some niche skill-sets, depending on factors such as location, bank and payment type.</p>
<p>Indeed, whilst target formatting for a corporate moving in-country from one provider to another is a relatively simple process, the same corporate opening a bank account in overseas countries can experience a serious challenge when seeking to understand different payment types.</p>
<p>With treasury needing to ramp up its local knowledge every time the business moves into a new jurisdiction, Vonckx says it can be a lengthy process assessing and understanding what is required before payments can be made and received. “With the number of accounts typically needed by a large international corporate, it’s easy to see how the complexity of this task increases,” he says. “Treasurers should be asking if they really want to build up that expertise as a series of one-offs or if they can hand it over to a specialist provider.”</p>
<p>For Serrala, having built up and continually developed its experience and expertise of both core and niche treasury processes with multiple corporate customers and banks, in multiple locations globally, there is a cumulative benefit that can be enjoyed by all clients, says Vonckx.</p>
<p>Another domain in which inefficiencies and challenges often exist is receivables. Although banks can provide EBS and lockbox statement details, there are still a lot of paper-based remittances provided by customers that cannot be processed automatically, says Vonckx.</p>
<p>As such, he believes in the increasing relevance of cloud-based services that can, for example, automatically combine information received in a statement with invoice and remittance details. “Often these documents need to be interpreted, sometimes using OCR technology or predefined templates,” he notes. “Having this done on an outsourced basis, being provided with a streamlined file that can be automatically uploaded into the ERP, is a huge benefit.”</p>
<p>This opportunity extends downstream, notes Vonckx. Accurate information on paid invoices means credit lines are more effectively cleared, enhancing sales streams. Perhaps even more advantageous is the way in which same-day visibility on paid invoices enhances working capital management and forecasting accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="business-case">Business case</h3>
<p>Whilst employing third-party services will present a new cost, Vonckx argues that taking this path actually delivers cost efficiencies. Retaining processes such as format conversion and remittance handling in-house creates a number of hidden costs that can quickly add up, he says. Having prepared many business cases for customers he is in a position to know that “significant gains” can be made when using the right managed services provider.</p>
<p>There is a logic to this; in offering services to multiple customers, economies of scale apply. In Serrala’s case, these are translated into its pricing model. A treasurer required to present a business case for taking this path can be assisted in its creation, with supporting qualitative and quantitative data stacking favourably against the costs of in-house processing which often lack transparency, says Vonckx.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as part of the consultative approach, the Serrala team will assist the client in defining process best-practice, this being benchmarked against the many implementations it has already carried out.</p>
<p>In staking his claim that Serrala aims to give its clients a “best in class process that is a lot more efficient and transparent”, Vonckx confirms that ‘transparency’ relates not only to the SLAs that ensure correct delivery but also to the pricing of those services. “Clients always know what to expect so that if their service needs grow, they will know exactly how it will impact their costing structure. Treasurers using internal resources will find this aspect much more difficult to assess.”</p>
<h3 id="making-the-difference">Making the difference</h3>
<p>Of course, managed services and classic outsourcing providers all claim a USP. Serrala appears to have one that really does have mileage. In the past few years, the company has extended its product portfolio to cover the entire accounts payable, accounts receivable, treasury, data analytics and document management functions.</p>
<p>In doing so, it has built what Vonckx describes as a “comprehensive end-to-end service for incoming and outgoing payments and related financial processes”. This, he adds, not only manages format handling and bank connectivity but all workflows from invoice to payment, and remittance to cash application.</p>
<p>One of the additional advantages of an end-to-end service is that it can play a key role in the essential fight against payments fraud. “If a service provider focuses on a single function within that chain, it is difficult for them to capture and control information outside of that process,” comments Vonckx. “By covering the entire process, we are in a better position to manage our clients’ security, fraud and compliance concerns.”</p>
<p>Of course, as clients’ demands evolve and demand new services, Serrala is continually developing its solution set to meet their evolving needs. Following an intense period of acquisition and integration, enabling “strong emphasis on end-to-end service provision”, it underwent a rebranding earlier this year.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to accelerating the extension of its work in the multi-ERP space to include all the main platforms, Vonckx reports “full commitment to extending Serrala’s functionality in the cloud and the creation of additional managed services”. The quest to improve niche treasury operations and reduce costs is not only possible, with the managed services model it is now a proposition that has wings.</p></div>

Treasury Prism helps solve these issues.”</p><span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); cursor: text; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: 100%; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 30.4px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">

Treasurers can discover what benefits will result from adopting different treasury structures, and obtain insights into solutions suggested by Treasury Prism. For example, it prompts the treasurer with insights concerning regulatory approvals when modelling Chinese cross-border pooling structures. The tool also reveals untapped opportunities, such as tax incentives for particular markets and solutions.</p><span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); cursor: text; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: 100%; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 30.4px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">

This provides treasurers with a real-world figure to present to management when making the business case. “The optimiser works by calculating the expected interest yield and debt cost, withholding tax for interest paid including tax exemptions, and bank fees and implied corporate costs,” explains Farnhill.</p><span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); cursor: text; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: 100%; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 30.4px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">

And Treasury Prism goes further. By using complex proprietary algorithms, it scores the selected solution against other options. “This allows treasury teams to quickly understand what solution will deliver the optimal benefit,” says Farnhill. “So with the click of a button, treasurers can find out what previously took hours. It is revolutionary.”</p><span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); cursor: text; font-family: Roboto,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: 100%; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 30.4px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">

Farnhill provided testimonials, including one from the treasurer at Isuzu who said: “What takes a week today can be done in two minutes with Treasury Prism. This is the most innovative solution for corporate treasury I’ve seen this year.”</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The creation of a global or regional treasury centre can bring greater uniformity, visibility and control. It can also reduce costs and enable treasury to become more strategic in the way it supports the business. Here we talk about the different models of centralisation and where best to locate your treasury centre.</em></p>
<p>Treasury centralisation has been a hot topic for some time now. Indeed, over the past decade and more, corporations around the world have moved to established global treasury centres, often supported by regional outposts in places where they have significant overseas operations.</p>
<p>The centralisation trend has been especially prevalent in Asia Pacific, as multinational companies have built regional treasury centres to support the growth of the organisation. More recently, many Asia-domiciled multinationals have begun to follow suit, centralising their treasury operations as they expand overseas.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to centralising treasury. It can bring greater visibility; enable more efficient use of global/regional cash flows; improve pricing structures due to the extra leverage created by economies of scale; drive cost savings by removing duplicated tasks and effort and standardising procedures and techniques. Centralisation can also facilitate the rise of corporate treasury as a strategic partner to the business.</p>
<h3 id="levels-of-centralisation">Levels of centralisation</h3>
<p>Whilst the results of centralising treasury will be similar for all companies, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Indeed, centralisation is a broad term and companies may vary in their understanding of what constitutes a centralised treasury. This is because the nature of a company’s business, its operating model and strategic objectives, dictate the level of centralisation that treasury can achieve.</p>
<p>Regulation is also a factor. For example, in Asia, cross-border flow restrictions mean that treasury may not be able to sweep and centralise liquidity. Thus a centralised treasury in Asia may look different from a centralised treasury in Europe where it is possible to centralise liquidity.</p>
<p>As a result, it can be helpful to bucket treasury departments into three broad categories of centralisation.</p>
<h4 id="decentralised">Decentralised</h4>
<p>In a decentralised treasury structure, individual subsidiaries conduct policy-making, decision-making and functional activities. Subsidiaries may have their own local banking arrangements, will organise their own funding and handle cash management (including short-term borrowing and investments) locally. The company may still employ a small treasury team in it’s headquarters, acting as consultants to the subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Whilst decentralised treasury departments may not deliver the benefits of a centralised treasury, they can work well when subsidiaries are independent and autonomous units with limited complimentary needs. The local operational knowledge and risk awareness of each treasury team can also be beneficial – especially when the business needs to adapt to unexpected events.</p>
<h4 id="fully-centralised">Fully centralised</h4>
<p>In a fully centralised structure, a global treasury centre will undertake policy-making decisions and most, if not all, banking and financial activities. These centres may offer 24-hour services to ensure round-the-clock coverage for all subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Centralisation ensures that group treasury has standardised operations, greater control across the company with streamlined bank accounts and improved transparency of cash flow. The natural hedge created by the matching of financial positions can result in better margins. A fully centralised model can also enable treasury to reduce costs through economies of scale.</p>
<p>However, such a degree of centralisation has its potential downsides. For example, it can lead to a lack of local expertise. In Asia, this can be a hindrance given the complexity of many of the region’s markets. Take China, for example: Treasury Today Asia has frequently heard from treasurers about the importance of having a treasury professional in-country, forging relationships with the regulators and ready to react to the sudden changes common in that market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the treasury is viewed as remote by the in-country teams, they may be less interested in treasury matters and, potentially, resistant to any measures that may be introduced, making it challenging for treasury to change processes.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="shared-service-centres">Shared service centres</h3>
<p>The shared service centre (SSC) is a common centralised structure found within organisations. SSCs are often located in low-cost markets, such as the Philippines, and can be defined as an entity that provides certain services to several different group entities. From a treasury and finance perspective, these services may range from managing payroll, accounts payable, foreign exchange dealing or even short-term cash management.</p>
<p>The advantages of operating a SSC include reduced operating costs, economies of scale, efficiency gains, improved control and better performance management. What is more, offloading routine operational tasks to a SSC can free up the treasury department’s time to focus on more value-adding strategic activities.</p>
<p>An interesting trend of late is the evolution of SSCs into value-adding centres of excellence through the adoption of technology. This can have a positive impact on treasury, as the SSC is able to support treasury at a more strategic level by providing accurate and granular data to drive more informed decision making.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="fully-centralised-with-regional-hubs">Fully centralised with regional hubs</h4>
<p>This model is nearly identical to the fully centralised structure. The difference is that treasury is coordinated regionally, with business units reporting to their respective regional treasury centre. The regional treasury centre model provides a comparable level of control to the fully centralised model centralisation, whilst ensuring that there is at least one member of treasury who has expertise in a particular region and is based in the relevant time zone.</p>
<h4 id="hybrid-centralisation">Hybrid centralisation</h4>
<p>Hybrid centralisation is known as a ‘best of both worlds’ approach that sees treasury centralise in global or regional teams. However, in complex markets that require special attention – think China – there will also be a treasurer within the subsidiary(s) in that country to carry out on-the-ground treasury operations – following the treasury policy set by a central or regional centralised treasury team.</p>
<p>In theory, the structure delivers more control than a decentralised model, whilst still enabling subsidiaries to maintain a degree of autonomy within the front office function. It can also help to increase uniformity in treasury policies and procedures across the group and allows key decisions to be made at a global level with a comprehensive view of cash flow.</p>
<p>However, by giving the local subsidiaries the mandate to execute certain transactions and control certain functions, central treasury can benefit from the ‘bottom-up’ view that the local subsidiaries can offer. For example, in some Asian markets, strong local banking relationships can be the best way to obtain favourable funding or liquidity terms.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="in-house-banks-the-final-stage-of-centralisation">In-house banks: the final stage of centralisation</h3>
<p>The growth of centralised treasury models in Asia has led to the rise of the in-house bank (IHB) structure in the region – often regarded as the ultimate form of centralisation.</p>
<p>An IHB is best described as a centralised treasury organisation performing activities for subsidiaries that are otherwise performed by banks. These structures can enable treasury to reduce the company’s bank borrowing, reduce the cost of FX transactions, cut interest payments on debt and improve yield on investments.</p>
<p>Although it is possible to build these structures in Asia, it can be challenging given the region’s fragmented regulatory environment. This often means that corporates operating an IHB in Asia are unable to deploy the full range of solutions in the markets they operate in. Therefore, treasurers should work closely with the business and external advisors to weigh up the pros and cons of implementing an IHB in the region.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="prime-location">Prime location</h3>
<p>With the structure of the treasury selected, the next big decision is where in Asia the treasury centre should be located. When making this choice, treasurers must consider numerous factors, including taxation, the regulatory environment, available talent and the location’s banking capabilities and access to capital markets. Perhaps most importantly, treasury should also consider the business’ overall strategy – if much of the company’s business is in China, basing the centre in or close to the mainland might be the most suitable location.</p>
<h4 id="singapore">Singapore</h4>
<p>The Lion City is arguably the region’s prime treasury centre location and is the long-term home to the regional treasury centres of many multinationals including AkzoNobel, British American Tobacco, DHL, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lenovo and Nokia. In recent years, several Chinese companies have followed suit, building out treasury centres in Singapore to support regional and global growth ambitions.</p>
<p>Singapore is an attractive location because of its liberal regulatory environment, AAA sovereign credit rating, large number of free trade agreements, deep and liquid FX market and legal system based on English common law. As one of the world’s top financial centres, most, if not all the major Western and Asian banks have a significant presence in Singapore, giving treasurers access to best in class banking services.</p>
<p>The regulators have also developed a competitive incentive scheme to encourage companies to use Singapore as a base for conducting treasury management activities for the region. Most notably, an approved finance and treasury centre company is eligible for a reduced corporate tax rate of 8% on income derived from qualifying services. Approved companies are also eligible for withholding tax exemption on interest payments, such as interest on loans obtained from banks and non-bank financial institutions.</p>
<h4 id="hong-kong">Hong Kong</h4>
<p>Hong Kong also makes a strong case for a treasury centre location. The territory is frequently ranked as the world’s freest economy, has a legal system based on English common law and a liberal and well-developed regulatory framework. Like Singapore, its status as a global financial centre means that corporates have access to a wide range of banking services. It is also the world’s largest offshore RMB hub and a gateway to the international capital markets.</p>
<p>Despite these qualities, Hong Kong is home to fewer treasury centres than Singapore. This is largely due to its tax regime, which until recently did not extend concessions to companies with treasury centre activities, causing many companies to opt for Singapore. To close the gap and attract more treasury centres, the authorities in Hong Kong amended the law in 2016 offering almost identical tax incentives to Singapore.</p>
<p>By making this change, Hong Kong is hoping that it can convince Chinese companies going global to set up a treasury centre in the territory. It has already had some success, with at least three mainland Chinese companies announcing plans last year to set up treasury centres in Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. At least 30 other companies are actively considering the move as well.</p>

<h3 id="alternative-options">Alternative options</h3>
<p>Whilst Singapore and Hong Kong stand out as the two most popular treasury centre locations in Asia, there are other options available to corporates. Shanghai, for example, offers an option to those companies wanting to be based in mainland China, although the restrictive nature of the economy limits its appeal.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Malaysia offers an attractive Treasury Management Centre incentive package to encourage domestic corporates to build a treasury centre in the country. Thailand also operates a similar scheme. Meanwhile, Japanese firms have been bringing their treasury centres back home to Tokyo and other major cities in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="areas-for-consideration">Areas for consideration</h3>
<p>Before making any shift in treasury model, no matter how extreme, treasurers must consider the short- and long-term impact of the upheaval. To ensure a smooth transition, treasury should consider the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cost and cost-saving:</h5>
<p>Treasury should complete a cost/benefit analysis to understand whether the cost of the centralisation project and ongoing costs are less than the potential benefits and savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Group-wide support:</h5>
<p>The centralisation project must have full support at management and board level. Local units must also understand what is happening and why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Legal, regulatory and tax implications:</h5>
<p>Treasurers must consider how changing the treasury structure and establishing treasury centres in different locations will impact its legal, regulatory and tax arrangements. Particular attention should be given to the OECD’s BEPS initiative as any treasury centre will need to prove that it is staffed by people with adequate qualifications, experience and knowledge who will form part of the decision-making process for the transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>External relationships:</h5>
<p>Centralisation is likely to lead to a change in relationship with banks and vendors and the impact of this needs to be carefully managed. This includes negotiating advantageous terms and handling the share of wallet and business appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Technology:</h5>
<p>Treasurers should consider what technology is needed to support the new treasury structure. Of consideration here is whether legacy systems can be integrated or if they have to be renewed – this could have an impact on costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Operational aspects:</h5>
<p>Treasurers should address transition procedures, project management and staffing issues early on to limit the impact on daily treasury activities.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading">Delivering a world-class regional treasury centre: the DHL story</h3>
<div class="copy__body"><img alt="DHL" class="logo org" height="20" src="/i/logo/dhl-logo-2015-90x20.png" style="float: right; margin: 0em 0em 2em 2em;" title="DHL" width="90">
<h5>Stephen Hogan<br/>
Vice President Regional Treasury Asia Pacific</h5>
<p class="management-summary"> </p>
<p class="management-summary">DHL has one of the most successful and respected centralised treasury departments in Asia. Here, Stephen Hogan, Vice President Regional Treasury Asia Pacific at Deutsche Post DHL, explains how the company’s treasury oversees the financial matters of 140 legal entities, spanning four business divisions and 42 countries.</p>
<p>DHL’s regional treasury centre supports the business across Asia Pacific in a wide variety of activities. These range from the typical treasury activities such as bank relationship management, cash and liquidity management, financing and debt management, and risk management. Treasury is also responsible for the legal structure of subsidiaries.</p>
<p>According to Hogan, the regional treasury can support the business across such a wide variety of areas because unlike other regional treasury departments, which are usually separate from the global organisation, DHL’s treasury is closely linked to the head office in Germany and operates as a corporate function.</p>
<p>“In many respects, the only reason we sit in Singapore and not in Germany is to be close to our business units in the region and their regional management,” Hogan says. “The treasury department in Germany manages all the treasury systems; they give us access to these and we get on with our work, avoiding some of the more mundane tasks that treasury can sometimes be associated with.”</p>
<h4>On-the-ground support</h4>
<p>When it comes to the in-country operations across Asia, Hogan believes it is important to forge strong relationships with the business units. To that end, his team is constantly seeking ways to add more value to the regional management and the local business units. Hogan personally visits the various businesses regularly, not only to understand their work more intimately but also to understand the cultural nuances across the region and the business environment.</p>
<p>In addition to these visits, Hogan has also utilised the power of modern communication channels, running regular training webinars. “This is in reaction to a major internal study where one of the key findings was that there is a real desire from employees to learn and understand what the various functions do and how,” he explains. “We don’t force people to attend but if it is on a topic of interest then they can join the webinar and learn. It is just another aspect of our continuous outreach.”</p></img></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="a-central-journey">A central journey</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that centralising some, if not all, treasury 
activity can benefit most organisations. However, there is no such thing
 as a standardised centralisation project and treasurers will need to 
set their objectives carefully by evaluating the business and its 
strategy. Ultimately, a move to centralise is not just about improving 
treasury – it is also about putting the department in a position to 
drive value for the organisation as a whole.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The shared service centre is evolving to become a value-adding utility for the business. What does this mean for treasury?</em></p>
<p>The concept of shared service centres (SSCs) is not a new one. For over 30 years, corporates around the world have established these centres to consolidate and outsource operational tasks – often in low-cost markets – as part of broader centralisation projects. This has allowed them to drive economies of scale, increase efficiency and control – and, most importantly, reduce operating costs.</p>
<p>The role of the SSC is changing, though. Forward-thinking organisations are beginning to see these centres as more than mere cost-saving devices, and are giving them the tools needed to become value-adding centres of excellence. This is a trend that is not only redefining the role of the modern SSC but is also impacting corporate treasurers.</p>
<h3 id="origins-of-the-ssc">Origins of the SSC</h3>
<p>The first SSCs were created in the late 1980s by European multinationals keen to consolidate offshore operational processes in areas such as finance and accounting, procurement, HR and IT. These companies had many different reasons for establishing SSCs. Some, for example, were looking for economies of scale, while others were chiefly interested in improving efficiency and control.</p>
<p>For most companies though, the main goal was to cut costs – something that remains a key priority today. To do this, organisations located SSCs in markets with cheap operating and labour costs. To this end, SSCs have been a roaring success, helping to cut costs by as much as 70% in some cases.</p>
<p>From a treasury perspective, the first SSCs offered very little benefit. As Karlien Porre, Partner, Treasury Advisory Services at Deloitte, explains: “Treasury itself was still an emerging function and it was keen to keep its processes in house. Also, the complexity of many treasury tasks, even those that are operational in nature, didn’t make it an easy function to outsource.”</p>
<h3 id="centres-of-excellence">Centres of excellence</h3>
<p>Over time, more treasury back office functions began to shift to SSCs. “Moving some of the operational tasks conducted by the treasury to the SSC became a necessity for many treasury teams,” says Porre. “This is because many departments were increasingly being asked to do more with less and simply no longer had the time or resources to conduct these tasks.”</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>Today, SSCs are doing more than they ever have before, covering everything from liquidity management, inter-company netting, accounting, tax and FX to interest rate management.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As the role of treasury has become more strategic in nature – and SSCs have matured – more treasury activity has moved to the SSC. “Today, SSCs are doing more than they ever have before, covering everything from liquidity management, inter-company netting, accounting, tax and FX to interest rate management,” says Sara Castelhano, EMEA Core Cash Head at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>“What is interesting about this trend is not that SSCs are taking on more functions, but that they are increasingly responsible for more complex functions,” adds Castelhano. “This is part of a broader trend that is seeing business leaders look to transform SSCs from processors to value creators and giving them the tools and mandate to do this.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Deloitte’s latest Global Shared Services report states that the adoption of more complex, knowledge-based processes has doubled, or in some cases tripled, since 2013. As a result, many SSCs are now much more focused on accurate and reliable reporting, cash optimisation and reduced error rates. They are also developing the processes and knowledge needed to become a centre of excellence.</p>
<h3 id="stepping-up">Stepping up</h3>
<p>By becoming centres of excellence, SSCs can transform into what HSBC calls global business service providers. “These are SSCs that have moved beyond simply being reactive to the business to ones that are considered as business partners,” says Kee Joo Wong, Asia Pacific Regional Head of Global Payments and Cash Management at HSBC. “These have increased responsibilities including advisory, analytics and full ownership of certain finance and treasury processes.”</p>
<p>For the most part, it is technology that is enabling this to happen. Deloitte’s Porre highlights how companies have worked hard over the past decade to modernise and drive uniformity in their technological set-up – especially the ERP. “In treasury, the proliferation of cloud-based TMS systems has enabled users to access a standardised and consistent data set no matter where they are in the world,” she says. “This has boosted the ability for the SSC to develop analytical capabilities and better predict the needs of the treasury department.”</p>
<h4 id="chart-01">How many functions (such as HR or finance) are performed in your largest SSC?</h4>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2017-09and10-tta-08-trm-how-many-functions-are-performed-in-your-largest-ssc-300x64.png?la=en&amp;hash=1855FBDF2127176069750C5462EC3364" target="_blank"><img alt="How many functions (such as HR or finance) are performed in your largest SSC?" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2017-09and10-tta-08-trm-how-many-functions-are-performed-in-your-largest-ssc-300x64.png?la=en&amp;hash=1855FBDF2127176069750C5462EC3364" width="800"/></a></p>
<p class="source"><em>Source: Deloitte, Global Shared Services 2017 Survey Report</em></p>
<p>Leading SSCs are now taking this one step further by introducing more innovative technology into the SSC so that they can harvest and utilise all this data. “New technology and the application of big data will be a positive disrupter underpinning the SSC’s transformation from a processor to a value creator,” says HSBC’s Wong. “We are already seeing some of our clients begin to leverage intelligent process automation (IPA) by using robotic automation and machine learning to mimic the activities once performed by people within a SSC.”</p>
<p>Deloitte’s SSC report puts this point into context, highlighting that over 50% of organisations are currently using, piloting or researching tools that leverage robotic process automation. Unsurprisingly, cost cutting remains a big driver for this work, with a third of SSC professionals expecting that robotics will deliver cost savings of 20% or more.</p>
<p>However, the use of robotics is about more than cost savings. The report notes that the technology might “lay the groundwork for more advanced cognitive technologies that augment or replace the need for human judgment in complex, knowledge-based processes”. This will allow the SSC “to efficiently perform higher value tasks and analysis – such technologies could lead to fundamental changes in how SSCs operate and deliver service to customers”.</p>
<p>In many cases the banks are leading the way, experimenting with innovative technology within their own SSCs. Citi, for instance, talked to Treasury Today Asia earlier this year about how it is using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to digitise and more readily process the paper-based trade documents that it receives. This is allowing the bank to improve its processing and turnaround times and more readily share information with its corporate clients.</p>
<p>The use of such technology can also help the SSC protect the business better against emerging risks such as cyber-fraud. J.P. Morgan’s Castelhano explains that SSCs have already gone a long way towards mitigating risk by taking on more complex tasks and establishing robust controls around these. “If the SSC can have access to a wealth of data and tools to analyse this in real-time then they can be even more effective in mitigating the risk of cyber-fraud,” she says. “This is what banks have been working on for the past few years and we are seeing an increasing focus on cyber controls within corporates as well.”</p>
<h3 id="a-true-treasury-value-creator">A true treasury value creator</h3>
<p>The growing scope and effectiveness of SSCs will clearly have an impact on treasury departments. And with effective communication between the treasury and SSC, this impact can be very positive. “The ability for the SSC to support the treasury effectively has always been dependent on the communication between the two departments,” says Castelhano. “The need for more effective communication will only increase as the SSC takes on more treasury activity and operates as a value-adding support function to the department.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Revered and reviled perhaps in equal measures, derivatives have been traded for many years as both a risk mitigation tool in their simplest form, and as an instrument of profit generation in their more exotic incarnation. Treasury Today goes back to basics on this multifaceted topic.</em></p>
<p>Mention derivatives and thoughts often turn to the financial crisis of 2008. Whilst it is hardly fair to blame these admittedly potentially unwieldy financial products for all of the ensuing woes, their misuse by people who either failed to grasp what they were buying into, or worse, knew exactly what they were doing, will resonate throughout the years. Not for nothing did Warren Buffett called derivatives “financial time bombs”.</p>
<p>So, what are they that they can cause so much interest, misunderstanding and chaos? In essence, they are financial instruments where the value is generated over time on the back of the performance of an underlying asset or set of assets (commonly referred to just as the underlying) such as equities, bonds or commodities. Derivatives trade typically involves two parties – counterparties – who submit to a set of pre-agreed terms and conditions that determine individual rights and obligations.</p>
<p>Unless collateralised (guaranteed), the value of a derivative is dependent upon on the credit status of the counterparty. Earnings, said Buffet, are often “wildly overstated” because they are “based on estimates whose inaccuracy may not be exposed for many years”.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Although sometimes highly leveraged instruments (where investment is through borrowed money – a high-risk strategy), it is important to know that derivatives can be either vanilla or exotic. There is no precise definition of either but vanilla instruments are traditionally the simplest form. These are typically used for basic risk mitigation, especially hedging, and are usually based on standard calls and puts found on major exchanges. Exotics are relatively more complex, often using non-standard underlying assets. Although they are generally used to mitigate and manage risk, derivative contracts can also be used to speculate on the price fluctuations of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>Using derivatives to speculate on price movements gives price exposure to an underlying asset such as a commodity, index or exchange rate or even something ‘exotic’ such as weather conditions in a region. Such derivative contracts – especially futures and options – are often settled in cash. Cash is just a more convenient method of executing these contracts. In a commodities deal, cash is used to pay the difference between the spot and futures price, rather than taking ownership of the physical commodity.</p>
<h3 id="corporate-use-of-derivatives">Corporate use of derivatives</h3>
<p>If using derivatives to mitigate risk of future price movements in the underlying commodity, currency or interest rate, treasurers can achieve more accurate budgeting and forecasting. Fixing prices for a period also means monitoring price fluctuations of the underlying is redundant, allowing treasury to focus on more value-added tasks. Of course, derivatives are eminently tradable so treasurers are not tied in to them unnecessarily.</p>
<h4 id="trading-options">Trading options</h4>
<p>Derivatives can be traded either on or off exchange. Exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs), traded through exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange, offer publicly available pricing. Contract terms, using standardised contracts, are non-negotiable.</p>
<p>However, off-exchange derivatives trades made over-the-counter (OTC) use tailored contracts with specific terms and conditions pre-agreed by the counterparties. The lack of standardisation means OTC derivatives are less liquid (because terms may not suit other buyers).</p>
<p>Today, most buying and selling is conducted over electronic trading networks.</p>
<h3 id="frequently-used-derivatives">Frequently used derivatives</h3>
<p>The most common types of derivatives are options, swaps and swaptions, forwards and futures.</p>
<h4 id="options">Options</h4>
<p>Exchange-traded options are based on standardised contracts whereby one party has a right to purchase an agreed quantity and class of underlying at a future date at a pre-agreed ‘strike’ price. The right, however, is not an obligation as the buyer can allow the contract to simply expire. There are two types of option contracts that can be either bought or sold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Call options</strong> give the right but not the obligation to buy the asset at the strike price either before or on the future date. The seller is obliged to sell the asset at the strike price if the buyer exercises the option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Put options</strong> give buyers the right but not the obligation to sell the asset at the strike price either on or before the agreed expiration date. Sellers are obliged to repurchase at the strike price if the buyer exercises their option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The nature of options means the greatest loss a treasurer will face is the cost of the premium paid to buy that option: if the market goes against them, the option is not exercised.</p>
<h4 id="swaps">Swaps</h4>
<p>Swaps allow treasurers to exchange one series of future cash flows for another. The value of underlying assets, which do not need to be the same, will usually be sourced from publicly available data. Swaps are often used by treasurers to hedge against movements in interest rates. A company with a fixed interest rate may wish to swap it for a floating rate if it believes the reference rate will fall. It may also seek to fix an interest rate of a payment to eliminate some uncertainty around its cash outflows, or to hedge against an anticipated interest rate rise.</p>
<h4 id="swaptions">Swaptions</h4>
<p>A non-standard method of protecting against interest movements is through a swaption. In exchange for an option premium, the buyer secures the right but not the obligation to enter into an underlying swap. A buyer securing the right to pay fixed rate and receive floating rate takes a ‘payers swaption’. The right to exercise a swap where the buyer receives fixed and pays floating has a ‘receivers swaption’.</p>
<h4 id="forwards">Forwards</h4>
<p>Another non-standardised derivative contract is the forward. Here, counterparties agree privately to buy or sell an asset at a specified future data at a price agreed at the time the deal is transacted. Popular types of forward contracts are currency forwards and commodity forwards. The former may be used to hedge an FX exposure when the company has a known future payable or receivable in a foreign currency.</p>
<p>The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position.</p>
<h4 id="futures">Futures</h4>
<p>Futures are similar to forwards. Both give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset/commodity at a future date, although futures are exchange-traded not private agreements as per forwards. A futures contract may also require physical delivery of the underlying asset or be settled in cash. Either way, futures can be risk-laden because both counterparties are gambling on winning (when clearly only one can). At least counterparty risk is reduced because the clearing house of the exchange used to trade acts as the third party to the deal.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>An account with a brokerage firm is required to buy and sell futures contracts. Having agreed a futures contract, the buyer and seller must deliver an initial margin (typically 1% to 5%) of the total purchase price of the futures contract. The profit or loss of the contract for each party is calculated on a daily basis, this being added to or subtracted from the relevant margin account. This reduces counterparty default risk.</p>
<h3 id="the-key-regulations">The key regulations</h3>
<h4 id="dodd-frank-act">Dodd-Frank Act</h4>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into US law in 2010. This established a new framework for regulatory and supervisory framework for the OTC derivatives market. Derivatives subject to regulation under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act include interest rate, credit default and equity swaps.</p>
<p>In meeting G20 objectives of increasing transparency and reducing systemic risk in the derivative markets, Dodd-Frank has moved all OTC derivatives onto exchanges and swap execution facilities (SEFs). This ensures most derivatives are processed through clearing houses and central counterparties.</p>
<p>The main requirements include reporting swap transactions to a swap data repository, clearing sufficiently liquid and standardised swaps on central counterparties, trading standardised swaps on trading platforms, and establishing higher capital and minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps.</p>
<h4 id="emir">EMIR</h4>
<p>The EU’s European Markets and Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) came into force in August 2012. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) drafted its Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS). These provide the detailed specifications of the regulation. EMIR applies to all OTC derivatives even when an EEA-based company is trading with a non-EEA counterparty.</p>
<p>The main objective of EMIR is to reduce the risks and large credit exposures seen in OTC derivative transactions. Other than some additional reporting requirements, exchange traded derivatives are less of a focus as these are already subject to rules around central clearing.</p>
<p>EMIR’s headline requirements are for central clearing and margining of standardised OTC derivatives, the reporting of all derivative transactions to a trade repository, and risk mitigation measures for all uncleared derivatives (including collateral exchange and confirmation and reconciliation procedures).</p>
<p>Given their heightened importance under EMIR, firms providing central clearing services (known as central counterparties or CCPs) were subject to additional requirements around their structures and procedures.</p>
<p>Most non-financial companies using derivatives for hedging purposes are not expected to put their OTC derivative transactions through central clearing. This means they will not have to put up margin to cover the daily mark-to-market valuation (the most recent market price) of their derivatives.</p>
<h4 id="frs-102">FRS 102</h4>
<p>For many years, derivatives non-balance sheet items. Organisations entering into OTC products recorded the impact of these instruments in their books only when settlements occurred or when they reached maturity. FRS 102, applicable to accounting periods commencing on or after 1st January 2015, changes all that.</p>
<p>Derivatives now have to be presented on the balance sheet at their fair value, and the credit risk to both counterparties in the transaction needs to be reflected in the calculation. This usually requires a valuation, provided by the counterparty bank, or external advisors, deploying relatively complex derivative valuation models. Additionally, changes in the derivatives’ fair value now have to be recorded in the income statement.</p>
<p>Under FRS 102 the derivative is accounted for independently from the hedged transaction, which can be an unrecognised cash flow – for instance, a highly probable forecast transaction, sale, or purchase in foreign currency, or future variable interest rate payments.</p>
<p>This means the impact of the derivative on the income statement may not occur at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction, nor in fact be represented in the same line item (that is, it not being part of EBITDA or interest expense).</p>
<p>Organisations can reduce or eliminate income statement volatility arising from derivatives by applying hedge accounting. But they can only do so providing they can meet certain requirements, and then actively elect to do so. These requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To document the existence of a hedging relationship between derivative and hedged transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To demonstrate an economic relationship (that derivative and hedged transactions are expected to move in opposite ways), usually by the coincidence of the critical terms of both transactions or by undertaking a quantitative analysis of their correlation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To specify and quantify causes of ineffectiveness – possible mismatches between the derivative and the hedged transaction – by modelling the hedged transaction, usually using a ‘hypothetical derivative’ (the best possible hedge, being a proxy for the hedged risk and transaction).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="margin-rules">Margin rules</h4>
<p>On 1st September 2016, new initial margin (IM) and variation margin (VM) rules for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives were introduced globally. The rules ensure appropriate collateral (such as cash, various debt securities and corporate bonds) is available to offset losses caused by the default of a counterparty.</p>
<p>Although only financial firms and systemically important non-financial entities are covered, each jurisdiction is able to set out its own definition of in-scope, out-of-scope and exempt entities. Most jurisdictions’ rules do not yet require the exchange of margin with certain types of non-financial entity, such as those trading below the EMIR clearing threshold (ranging between €1bn and €3bn, depending on class of OTC derivative). For now, at least, threshold value alone will exclude corporate contracts.</p>
<h3 id="asia-expanding-derivatives">Asia expanding derivatives</h3>
<p>Exchange-traded equity and commodity derivatives trading is a developing market in Asia. Hong Kong and Singapore are of course the leading trading hubs, being fourth and fifth largest globally in turnover of OTC interest rate derivatives (behind the US, the UK and France).</p>
<p>China is now opening up overseas investors access to its foreign-exchange derivatives market. Access is limited to the hedging needs of private-sector investors’ onshore bond positions. According to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the move in early 2017 enables hedging of bond positions and is seen as a means of driving greater investment inflow. China’s interbank bond market was opened up in 2016 and can trade products including forwards, swaps, cross-currency swaps and options using domestic settlement agents. Whilst there are no specific restrictions on the notional amount of FX exposure, steps such as market access, liquidity, reporting rules, settlement dates are anticipated a future point to bring the market in line with international access.</p>
<p>The key to securing the investment of international institutions in any new jurisdiction is the establishment of rules around close-out netting (the payment of a final sum in the event of insolvency). In this respect, Malaysia is a prime example how a framework can be used to good effect. In March 2015, the Netting of Financial Agreements Act 2015 came into force, providing legal enforceability of close-out netting provisions under Malaysian law.</p>
<p>In seeking to encourage derivatives market trading, Indonesia has sought to improve local banking knowledge and is now allowing international institutions to establish operations in the country in exchange for market training and guidance.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also allows foreign portfolio investors to trade commodity options and equity derivatives through International Financial Services Centres. SEBI has also set up a risk-based supervision framework for brokers.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Pakistan’s Securities and Exchange Commission talked about developing new regulations to allow the country’s stock exchange (and supported by Chinese investor cash) to issue a wider range of derivatives. This could open up the market to hedge fund trading. Cash-settled futures and single stock options were on the starting list. And in April this year, Vietnam’s Hanoi Stock Exchange published listing, trading, settlement and membership rules for derivatives trade.</p>
<h3 id="global-acceptance">Global acceptance</h3>
<p>Asia Pacific jurisdictions seem not to be diverging too far from existing international standards and have notably been establishing processes, including confirmations timings and reporting fields, that are mostly aligned with more established trading hubs in other regions. This should serve to make market development a more cost-effective process.</p>
<p>But it also demonstrates that whilst emerging markets see the value of derivatives, they also heed the lessons from previous errors of judgement. The market, despite what the likes of Buffett say, is here to stay.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Many treasury departments already benefit from payment and receivables on behalf of (POBO and ROBO) structures.  However, many others are still striving to reach this level of sophistication.  Here, we go back to basics to find out how these structures work and how treasury teams can adopt them.</em></p>
<p>Payments and collections are bread and butter processes for treasury departments around the world.  Yet for many treasury teams, these processes still remain burdensome, costly and inefficient.</p>
<p>There is good reason for this: payments and collections are riddled with complexity, especially when the organisation is operating in multiple jurisdictions with many bank accounts and currencies.  But there are solutions that, in some parts of the world, have enabled corporates to centralise their payments and (sometimes) collections processes to drive efficiency and cost savings.</p>
<p>On behalf of structures (OBO) are not a new concept, especially to those organisations that have centralised their treasury operations in an effort to drive efficiency.  But it is a space that is evolving and a structure that many corporates could benefit from.</p>
<h3 id="in-focus-obo">In focus: OBO</h3>
<p>A payment on behalf of (POBO) or receivables on behalf of (ROBO) – sometimes also known as collections on behalf of (COBO) – structure is a single point of payment or collection, which is set up as a separate entity and administered from a commercially convenient location for the benefit of other entities within a group of companies.</p>
<p>Instead of each entity owning and operating its own external bank accounts, a single legal entity sits at the heart of the company, often supported by an in-house bank (IHB) that manages collections and all payments on behalf of participating entities.  The structure enables treasurers to consolidate bank accounts and transactions across the group by using a standard payments process and streamlined bank account structure.</p>
<p>“OBO structures are typically introduced within many corporates with the objective of cutting costs by significantly reducing the number of bank accounts they operate,” explains Cédric Derras, Global Head of Cash Management at UniCredit.  “Forward thinking organisations will also use this as an opportunity to better manage their liquidity as money will be concentrated in one physical account without the need to use pooling structures and without the costs and haste of making intercompany transactions.”</p>
<p>As a result of these benefits, OBO structures have crept up the corporate to do list, especially since the financial crisis.  Derras notes that regulatory developments have also facilitated the proliferation of OBO, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>“SEPA really triggered this trend,” he says.  “It gave corporates the opportunity to standardise and rationalise their multiple bank accounts and payments formats, potentially down to just one for the entire SEPA zone.”  Increased automation of payments processes has become a very real prospect under SEPA too, especially with the homogenisation of electronic direct debits and credit transfers facilitated by the across-the-board adoption of ISO 20022/XML payments standards.</p>
<p>In Asia Pacific (APAC) there has also been movement in the direction of POBO/ROBO, with numerous international banks helping their most sophisticated clients adopt the structure – although this is not without its challenges.</p>
<h3 id="the-journey-to-obo">The journey to OBO</h3>
<p>As companies develop, collections and payments commonly start with local execution by subsidiaries.  From here, regional centres of liquidity may evolve to include shared service centres (SSCs).  An IHB banking structure may extend the centralisation programme, replacing most or all external bank accounts for subsidiaries with one in-house operation.</p>
<p>With the technical and operational structure of an IHB in place, the next logical move is to establish a regional payment factory.  With a change in the internal bank account structure, a POBO operation may be deployed so that the company can make payments using a single bank account per currency or country for all participating group entities.</p>
<p>“POBO/ROBO are tools that can be deployed in structuring treasury flows which can bring about tremendous benefits for treasurers,” says Shirish Wadivkar, Global Head of Payments and Receivables at Standard Chartered.  “POBO is really the penultimate step on the journey – one account for payments in one currency is a very neat structure.  ROBO is the last leg, although very few corporates, even in Europe, are there yet.  Such initiatives typically require a deep understanding of the client’s corporate structure and various local regulations.”</p>
<p>“Whilst there is a common path to putting in place an OBO structure, there is no one route.  “How these structures look and how they are used is very much dependent on how the group is organised in the first place, its business model and level of treasury sophistication,” says Jeffrey Ngui, Head of Regional Sales Asia, Cash Management at BNP Paribas.  “Simply putting an OBO structure in place without considering how it might impact all areas of the business is unwise, as the change can be drastic and it will shock the organisation.”</p>
</div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="the-problem-with-pobo">The problem with POBO</h3>
<p>Despite delivering numerous benefits, POBO is still not the complete solution that corporates are seeking – even in Europe, notes Francisco de Barros, EMEA Regional Treasurer at AbbVie.</p>
<p>Following the spin-off of AbbVie from Abbot Laboratories in 2013, the company inherited over 500 bank accounts spread across over 25 banking partners.  Payments were typically managed at a local level by affiliates.  This was clearly inefficient on many levels and the treasury set a goal: to create a simple and streamlined best in class treasury organisation that allowed our affiliates to focus on their core competencies.”  The team set about doing this by building an IHB that included local accounts for each of the major currencies used by the company.</p>
<h4 id="surprising-difficulties">Surprising difficulties</h4>
<p>Core to AbbVie’s plans was a POBO structure.  The treasury had many positive conversations about the solution and its benefits with its banking partners and peers.  However, when implementing the solution, de Barros admits that he was surprised by some of the limitations that exist around POBO, even within the Single European Payments Area (SEPA).  Even more surprising was that these were not discovered until the structure was being implemented.  “Most of the banks, which are big advocates of the solution, or papers on the topic, often don’t talk about these limitations or how to address them,” comments de Barros.</p>
<p>Within the SEPA region, the main problem arose from the fact that some institutions in a number of countries, including Italy, Portugal and Spain, do not allow or recognise payments made on behalf of by a sister company.</p>
<p>These are mainly payments related to taxes, regulatory agencies or payroll related items, says de Barros.  “Also, despite the SEPA mandate, we still see some of the local institutions mandating older legacy formats or payments being made from accounts in-country, meaning that these cannot be included in our POBO structure.”</p>
<p>Outside of SEPA, the hurdles around OBO structures are more well known, but de Barros found that these were still not well communicated by advocates of the solution.  “A good example is China where under certain structures cross-border POBO is allowed, but domestic POBO is still regulated,” he explains.  “Also, the standardisation around bank coding and payment formats needs to be improved and standardised further for this to be truly effective for corporate treasury.  In fact, across many of the emerging markets, the regulatory environment is one of the key impediments for POBO.”</p>
<h4 id="taking-the-solution-forward">Taking the solution forward</h4>
<p>The result of these issues is a solution that doesn’t deliver on all its promises.  And for de Barros it may take some time for these to be resolved because there is “little to no open discussion with the different authorities to find a path forward”.</p>
<p>“By now most treasury organisations are aware of POBO and its advantages.  We now need to move towards highlighting the issues so the discussions around the topic can start,” says de Barros.  “At this point, however, I have not seen any discussions around the issue, nor workgroups to attempt to address it.”  He also calls for more standardisation in payment formats and regulation so that the needs of corporate treasuries can be better met.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up</h3>
<p>Therefore, before undertaking any OBO project a number of elements should be in place to ensure success.  Having a centralised treasury and all participating entities on the same IT systems is nice to have, but not essential.  What is critical, though, is to ensure that all the centralised payments and reconciliations processes are standardised and controlled by one process owner.</p>
<p>The starting point of a POBO operation will usually be a payments factory, which manages a centralised standard payments process for participant entities.  With the technical infrastructure and processes in place, a single legal entity will be established to pay the third-party debt obligations of another legal entity in the group.  The process requires the exchange of external bank accounts owned by the group entities for IHB accounts (owned by the payment factory) per country and/or currency.</p>
<p>ROBO has a similar structure, requiring entities to substitute external accounts for IHB accounts.  In this set-up, a central collections factory initiates a claim on behalf of a group entity for payment from a third party.  The third party will make the payment into the relevant central account for the currency country.</p>
<p>Corporates must also consider the tax implications of their OBO structures.  Some areas to consider include assessing whether withholding tax and thin capitalisation rules are applicable for a proposed OBO operation.  There may also be issues around transfer pricing and Controlled Foreign Companies legislation.  In addition, VAT and stamp duty may impact the feasibility of an operation or the entities it covers.</p>
<p>“To put either a POBO or ROBO structure in place, the corporate needs to work closely with a bank who understands the structure of the corporation and how it operates,” notes Derras.  “There are so many nuances involved – especially when doing this in multiple countries – that it is vital that the banks understand relationships between the holding companies and subsidiaries, their legal structures, and what the group is trying to achieve overall.”</p>
<h3 id="virtual-accounts">Virtual accounts</h3>
<p>When talking about OBO, it is hard to avoid a discussion about virtual accounts, a solution that all banks are currently keen on discussing.  And there is good reason: they facilitate OBO structures.</p>
<p>Although virtual account solutions vary slightly from bank to bank, with some nuanced functionality, they largely operate in the same way.  Essentially each account is a ‘subsidiary’ or sub-account of the client’s own physical account with the bank; they cannot exist outside of that immediate relationship, hence they are virtual.  The key to a virtual account is thus the virtual account number/identifier.</p>
<p>“We have virtual IBANs in every country that we have a branch in,” says Dick Oskam, Global Head of Sales for Transaction Services at ING.  “These enable our clients to route their payments from their main bank account through these virtual IBANs.  This means that the payment is still centralised but the routing mechanism makes it look like it is a domestic payment from a domestic account, so the supplier can understand better who is paying them.”</p>
<p>Virtual accounts can also help on the collections side.  “ROBO is more challenging for corporates because of the reconciliation issues that exist,” says Oskam.  “We have therefore deployed our virtual account solution to enable our clients’ customers to pay to local IBANs, which then route the payment directly to the corporates header account.  This includes information about who has paid and for what.”</p>
<h3 id="regulatory-complexity">Regulatory complexity</h3>
<p>Even if a company has a highly sophisticated IT structure, uses a centralised treasury function with a highly streamlined bank account structure and is leveraging virtual accounts, it doesn’t mean that OBO will definitely be possible.  This is especially true in APAC where the regulatory and taxation landscape prohibits OBO structures in many of the region’s markets as it translates to inter-company borrowing.  Further if the OBO structure is envisaged to be cross-border then it ends creating cross-border capital flows too.  “If it is hard to set up an OBO structure in Europe, it is more challenging in Asia,” says Standard Chartered’s Wadivkar.</p>
<p>“If you look across the markets in Asia there are only a few that are liberal in nature,” adds Shi Wei Ong, Global Head, Cash Liquidity Management Products at Standard Chartered.  “So whilst you can do OBO to some degree in Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan, it is nearly impossible to get the full benefit by setting up a regional programme.”</p>
<p>The regulatory challenges differ from one country to another.  Some have capital controls, for example.  Others come with onerous conditions, such as per-transaction reporting, that add another layer of complexity to an already complex structure.  “We support numerous regional treasury centres in Asia and very few are in the POBO/ROBO space,” says Ong.  “It is the holy grail in Asia.”</p>
<p>BNP Paribas’s Ngui agrees that true POBO/ROBO is hard to achieve in Asia.  The bank has clients which operate hybrid structures whereby true OBO structures are deployed in the countries where this is possible.  “In the more restricted markets where POBO is not allowed, ‘payments in the name of ‘can be applied,” he says.  “This is quite similar to POBO and sees them operate an account belonging to the entity in the country from a centralised location.  This doesn’t offer the full benefits of POBO but it does help, to an extent, and there are savings in terms of resource, IT deployment and economies of scale because it is still a shared service centre style model.”</p>
<h3 id="making-the-change">Making the change</h3>
<p>OBO clearly has many benefits if done correctly.  But the big issue for corporates is the sheer amount of work required to get there.  And although this is a solution that can benefit many corporates, it may just be one step too far for some.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, the decision to head in this direction should be made as part of a broader structural overhaul of the company.  The project will touch all corners of the business and all impacted departments must be intimately involved from the start if it is to deliver the desired results.  But if the work is put in, the reward may be a truly best in class treasury department.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Last August, Vodafone locked in record low borrowing costs for decades to come in two back-to-back sterling bond issues totalling £1.8bn. The celebrated borrowing made tapping the capital markets look an attractive option for treasury teams pondering how best to raise capital in the year ahead. “We do the vast majority of our borrowing in the bond market because we can get cheap, long-term finance,” says Neil Garrod, Director of Treasury, Vodafone.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, different borrowing options have fallen in and out of favour. In the mid-90s it was banks, more than the capital markets, where UK housing associations went to borrow money, recalls Fenella Edge, Group Treasurer at The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC), which borrows from the capital markets and on-lends to UK housing associations.</p>
<p>“Bank lending was used to fill much of the borrowing needs of our sector. Back then the bond market lost popularity because banks offered more flexible terms and bond markets were viewed as expensive – our 11.5% bonds have just matured,” she says in reference to a batch of mature THFC bonds which had yields at levels hard to imagine in today’s low interest rate world.</p>
<p>Now it is a different story. The pendulum has swung in favour of the bond market as banks remain reluctant to lend long-term, while borrowing costs in the capital market remain at historic lows. For corporates ready to take the plunge and swap cosy banking relationships for refinancing risk and a global investor base, today’s climate couldn’t be better. It’s an arduous process, but the benefits can be worth it.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>
<p>A corporation seeking to raise funds from a bond issue needs to tailor the offering to suit its own requirements, and ensure it is attractive enough to draw investors. A US private placement is a typical first step for a company expanding beyond bank finance for the first time. Available to both US and non-US companies, this market provides an alternative source of liquidity to the traditional bank market without the need for a credit rating or reporting requirements, which are generally needed in the public bond markets. The fact that public markets can close also makes public issues a more challenging debut.</p>
<p>The private US market comprises about 50 active investors, mostly US insurance companies, and is flexible. Issues range in size from less than US$100m to up to US$1bn; the market typically provides fixed rate US dollar debt in tranches of between three and 15 years, though longer maturities are available for certain issuers. “Private placements are sold to smaller groups of investors and as there is less expectation of any trading, they can be compared to the bank market,” says Jeremy Froud, Managing Director, Head of UK Debt Capital Markets at Barclays, who says tapping public markets and the US dollar market are the typical next steps that follow on from a US private placement.</p>
<p>The amount a corporate wants to borrow – the size or face value of the bond – will also influence the type of issue. Indices apply minimum size constraints, so smaller bonds will not be able to access the bigger investor universe of an index. In the UK, a bond has to be £250m or above to be included in certain indices; in Europe it is €500m. But although its bond issues started small, THFC has still been able to access the index.</p>
<p>“We tend to issue bonds in small sizes like £100m,” explains Edge. “These bonds are not benchmark size and not index eligible, but we then add to them, tapping the bond over and over again so it grows. We will have a bond of say £500m but that will have been achieved in four or five chunks.”</p>
<p>It is worth noting that treasury teams require board approval before they set to work. Some corporations go to the board on a case-by-case basis for approval, but at Vodafone borrowing is approved annually.</p>
<h3 id="refinancing-risk">Refinancing risk</h3>
<p>Getting the maturity right is another consideration that will vary from organisation to organisation. Vodafone’s key priority last August was to reduce its refinancing risk by lengthening the maturity profile of its debt when rates were low. “We were able to lock in long-term interest rates of 35-40 years at 2.6% on a euro equivalent basis before tax deductibility,” says Garrod. “Our post-tax borrowing cost is around 2% for 40-year money. The future economic environment is uncertain and the less frequently you go to the market to refinance, so you reduce refinancing risk.”</p>
<p>The maturity a corporate chooses will also depend on the purpose of the debt. If the bond has been issued to provide finance for a specific project, treasury may want to term the bond to match the point at which the project will begin to generate cash for the company. “It is difficult to see what a high-tech company will look like in 30 years, so you might see shorter maturities here. But a utility wanting to finance long-term infrastructure is likely to require long-term debt,” says Rory Renshaw, a Managing Associate at law firm Linklaters. Companies will also want to avoid different bond issues maturing at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="get-rated">Get rated</h3>
<p>A key decision before deciding to issue in the bond market is whether or not to obtain a rating. A rating is generally required for public bond issuance and helps open the door to a wider investor universe. “A credit rating is used by fund managers to measure corporate performance and most indices only include rated bonds. Investors in public bonds don’t want an off-index bet by buying on an unrated basis,” says Barclays’ Froud.</p>
<p>“A credit rating is a measure of the likelihood of the company defaulting during the life of the bonds. Any credit rating, and particularly if it is investment grade, will increase the number of investors able to invest in you,” says Renshaw. An issuer with a high credit rating will pay a lower interest rate than one with a low credit rating; the higher the rating, the greater the investor appetite.</p>
<p>Acquiring a rating takes six to eight weeks and involves “SWOT analysis of your company” by the ratings agency. It will examine “in minute detail”, explains Froud, how the company compares to peers, as well as its historical performance, management structure and aspirations going forward, paying particular attention to any acquisition programmes that could put the credit rating under pressure.</p>
<p>The credit rating is also a vital piece of the jigsaw because it sets a company’s refinancing risk. “Every investor will buy a AAA but not every investor will buy a BBB,” says Garrod. Treasury teams have to weigh the increasing cost of capital as the amount of debt grows and investor appetite slows, with the fact that debt is tax deductible.</p>
<p>At the centre of this balancing act lies the credit rating. “Vodafone is likely to have debt forever,” says Garrod. “So, debt to us is permanent capital. Permanent capital is like equity, but needs to be refinanced. The better the rating you have, the lower the refinancing risk.”</p>
<h3 id="staying-local">Staying local</h3>
<p>What happens if the credit rating is downgraded? It is not always a disaster, as the experience of THFC, which runs one bond programme that is guaranteed by the UK government, reveals. When ratings agencies downgraded the UK’s credit rating after the Brexit vote, the rating on THFC’s guaranteed debt fell too. However in this case it hasn’t made much of a difference.</p>
<p>“The lower rating really has been by-the-by,” says Edge. “For our last bond issue we achieved the tightest spread over gilts ever done.” Tight, or narrow spreads, reflect a cost of borrowing that is close to the sovereign and therefore relatively cheap. Edge adds: “We are a good match with the institutional market because they like investing in long-term residential property assets. Investors are also keen on long-dated sterling assets, and anything they can pick up over gilts is attractive.” Low investor returns from government bonds have helped create demand for riskier corporate debt that gives a better return.</p>

<p><cite>Neil Garrod, Director of Treasury, Vodafone</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is heartening news for treasury teams mulling issuing debt in the UK, but worried about the health of the UK sterling market. Indeed, Vodafone’s August issue was its first since 2009. That was the same year that UK companies had 50% of their outstanding corporate bonds denominated in sterling, according to research from Bank of America Merril Lynch. This has now dwindled to 28% as the euro and the US corporate bond markets have lured UK companies away with more favourable conditions.</p>
<p>Now the Bank of England’s 18-month £10bn bond buying programme begun last year is also boosting the market, believes Froud: “The Bank of England programme has put the sterling market back on the map. It shows the UK is open for business in a post Brexit world.”</p>
<h3 id="currency-conundrum">Currency conundrum</h3>
<p>Corporates can issue debt in any currency; deciding which is therefore another consideration. Organisations often choose the currency and location of their issue according to their revenues streams and where they do business. THFC issues all its debt in sterling because that is the currency required by the housing associations it lends to. Others may have acquisitions to consider. “If a UK corporate has just bought a company in the US, it could make sense to issue in dollars,” says Froud.</p>
<p>Vodafone, which trades its shares in sterling but uses euros as its functional currency, both runs a euro medium-term note (MTN) programme, and has a US shelf programme where it borrows in dollars to access the deeper US market. But for many, price is the driving factor.</p>
<p>“We issue debt in any currency, making the decision according to which is cheapest by comparing all borrowing costs when bought back into euros. It is basically a question of which currency is providing the best credit spread,” says Garrod. Corporations typically swap the issue currency into the currency it wants at the same time as the bond issue, in a strategy based on the overall cost being lower than if it had raised funds in the swapped currency.</p>
<p>Importantly, the MTN programme does not limit a company to borrowing only in euros. A euro MTN bond could, of course, include bond issues denominated in euros, but it could also be in any other currency from yen to swiss francs.</p>
<p>Corporates also issue in the currency where demand is strongest, and in many instances this is in the US. “We go where the market is deepest,” says Garrod. “Multi tranches do happen in Europe, but the US does them on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>Microsoft, which kicked off 2017 by borrowing US$17bn, is just the latest example. US investment grade, or low risk, corporate bond issuance reached US$1.2trn in 2016, breaking annual issuance for the sixth year running, according to IFR data. In contrast, in 2015 there was US$360bn of new euro-denominated corporate bonds sold in Europe.</p>
<h3 id="picking-the-team">Picking the team</h3>
<p>The right team is another important consideration, particularly if markets are challenging. The banking teams behind Vodafone’s bond issues are drawn from the company’s relationship banks. “We have a backstop overdraft facility with a banking syndicate,” explains Garrod. “Although we have never used it, we could borrow from these syndicate banks if we needed to. The banks prepared to lend into this facility are our relationship banks and the quid pro quo, or the price of that subsidised balance sheet availability, is that they get to bid for our ancillary business.” Ancillary business accounts for a whole suite of banking services from FX transactions to currency swaps and, of course, bond sales.</p>
<p>A corporate could also opt for an independent advisor who is not acting as book runner, or providing services. “Some treasurers make their own decisions, others prefer advice,” says Froud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Timing the market around strong demand is more important for corporates with a lower rating than for those with higher ratings. And teams have to anticipate any sudden macroeconomic news that could affect book building, the process when banks market the bond, taking orders and ‘building a book’ of demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Banks are also important for their role as underwriters of a corporate bond issue. This is not a guarantee of the successful execution. If the bond doesn’t clear, the bank doesn’t appear as borrower. Rather it refers to a commitment from that bank that in the unlikely scenario an investor says they will buy bonds but then doesn’t ‘settle’ – ie stump up the cash – then the bank comes in.</p>
<p>Other support services include a paying agent, who acts as an intermediary between issuers and investors, and a trustee, who is a spokesman for the bondholders. The team of investment bankers and lawyers doesn’t come cheaply. Banks charge a percentage of the issue and a legal team could range from tens to hundreds of thousands of pounds, says Renshaw.</p>
<p>Next comes the roadshow, when corporates travel the country selling the company to analysts, fund managers and potential investors. “The roadshow will quickly reveal whether the banks have got their pricing right,” says Froud. It is also a time when corporations are grilled on acquisition programmes, particularly plans to finance them through debt. Acquisitions may worry investors and “companies will need to put their vision across.”</p>
<p>For seasoned issuers like THFC, roadshows are almost a formality. “We may have a roadshow for investors, one-to-one or in a group, but there is not always a roadshow because investors know us well,” says Edge. At THFC, bond issuance has become a slick and well-worn process. The “documents are on the shelf,” drafting takes two to four weeks and the lead managers know the business and the sterling market well.</p>
<h3 id="herding-cats">Herding cats</h3>
<p>Timing the issue is the next priority. Vodafone has an eye on the market long before its bonds are due to mature. “We are an opportunistic borrower, not a calendar borrower,” says Garrod. “We think about when the right time is to refinance based on when credit spreads are low. We would happily refinance up to a year ahead of maturity if the market gives us a better level of financing.” No surprise then that last August, Garrod and his team seized the opportunity around the government’s efforts to boost the economy post-referendum, such as relaunching quantitative easing and buying up to £10bn in corporate bonds, to secure the lowest cost of borrowing possible.</p>
<p>Timing the market around strong demand is more important for corporates with a lower rating than for those with higher ratings. And teams have to anticipate any sudden macroeconomic news that could affect book building, the process when banks market the bond, taking orders and ‘building a book’ of demand.</p>
<p>At THFC, timing bond issues is driven by the needs of housing association borrowers, rather than by the market. Any bond issue involves gathering a critical mass of two or three housing associations ready to borrow between £50-70m. “We don’t issue debt and then sit on the proceeds,” says Edge. “We have to get our borrowers to come to the market together and it is quite complicated. We call it herding cats.” It means she is unable to time issues around market opportunity – although if she does have her borrowers ready, and sees an opening, she will make sure the borrowers are aware and able to come to market quickly.</p>
<p>At the end of the process can treasury sit back and relax? For Garrod, his eye is already on the secondary market, where investors who bought the primary issue go on to sell to other investors – and the next bond issue. “You want bonds to trade well in the secondary market because it encourages investors to participate in the next issue,” he concludes. “On the other hand, if they trade too well it means you’ve left a lot of money on the table!”</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Optimising supply chain activities is a priority for many companies in Asia. As well as centralising procurement processes, some companies are seeking further efficiency by setting up global supply chain centres which can centralise both procurement and treasury activities.</em></p>
<p>For companies in Asia, managing supply chain activities effectively is an essential component of a business’ success. Companies which do not perform well in this area can be at a considerable disadvantage when it comes to reducing costs, minimising risk and ensuring the quality of goods.</p>
<p>“Companies increasingly recognise their supply chain as a competitive advantage and acknowledge that failure to optimise its performance can lead to extra costs such as lead time, flexibility, quality, lost sales and added risk in a global environment,” comments Hari Janakiraman, Head of Core Trade at ANZ. He notes that there is “increasing recognition of the relationship between optimised supply chain management and financial performance”.</p>
<p>In order to manage this area effectively, companies are adopting different approaches tailored to their industry profile, customer needs and size, Janakiraman says. “There’s no longer a one-sized approach to supply chain management, as product positioning and distribution is becoming more decentralised into multiple local or regional centres,” he adds. “Adoption of this model enables global synergies, while also remaining sensitive to local requirements.”</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>While the concept of supply chain centres or hubs is nothing new, the way in which companies approach this area is evolving – as are the geographical locations being chosen for centres. Supply chain centres tend to be closely associated with global manufacturing locations.</p>
<p>“Typically many of these manufacturing locations are in Asia – especially in countries such as China, Vietnam, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia,” says Venkatesh Somanathan, Global Head, Supplier Finance Solutions at Deutsche Bank. “We are also seeing a lot of new manufacturing companies coming up in Eastern Europe, while agreements like NAFTA have created significant manufacturing bases in Mexico. The architecture and the formulation of global supply chain centres have basically been to map this location out.”</p>
<p>Somanathan says that in addition to existing supply chain hubs and logistic centres, newer centres are also emerging in other locations. “We’ve seen the emergence of Dubai within the MENA region, while in Asia, Sri Lanka is positioning itself as the critical supply chain hub between the Middle East, Europe and Africa on one side, and the Asian bloc on the other.”</p>
<p>Somanathan says that companies need to locate their supply chain centres in jurisdictions which have open economies and which are relatively close to the relevant supplier communities. “For example, many of the largest industries around the world have suppliers based in China,” he says. “As well as controlling the quality and quantity of output, it is also essential to speak to suppliers in their local languages in order to understand their challenges and concerns and avoid any shocks being transmitted into the supply chain.”</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that centres are needed in every country, however. Somanathan says that a global supply chain centre based in Hong Kong can be used to talk to suppliers in Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan in the same time zone and in the relevant languages. “If there are any issues or bottlenecks downstream, companies can be quick to react and do their part in addressing those issues,” he explains.</p>
<p>In addition, Somanathan says that different industry sectors may have different requirements when it comes to setting up global supply chain centres. For example, many garment and textile companies based in the US and Europe have suppliers located in Vietnam or Bangladesh.</p>
<p>“It is essential for them to have somebody on the ground to assess the quality and quantity,” Somanathan says. “In order to have that capability, global buyers have inspectors or agents who ensure the quality and quantity and supervise the purchase. It is essential for companies to be close to suppliers – but they don’t have to be located in each of these locations.”</p>
<h3 id="combining-treasury-and-procurement">Combining treasury and procurement</h3>
<p>Companies have long been developing techniques and structures to centralise their procurement processes in order to operate more efficiently. Likewise, many companies have taken steps to centralise some of their treasury activities. While these activities have tended to be managed separately, some companies have now developed structures which can be used to centralise both the treasury function and the procurement and sales function.</p>
<p>Michael Vrontamitis, Global Head of Trade, Product Management at Standard Chartered, says that global supply chain centres can combine both the treasury function and the procurement and sales function. “We are increasingly seeing that companies have centralised procurement, they have centralised sales – and they are now moving into these centres which manage not just the treasury piece of it, but also the logistics of the whole supply chain.”</p>
<p>Aziz Parvez, Head of Asia Pacific Trade and Supply Chain Finance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch adds, “In some cases, we have seen supply chain hubs develop very closely with the treasury. While treasury may not be involved in the logistics side, treasury is very closely involved in working capital.” Parvez points out that procurement and treasury can have competing goals in some cases: the treasury might see the benefit of increasing DPO in order to improve working capital, whereas procurement may be focused on getting early payment discounts from suppliers. As such, hubs which combine treasury and procurement can support a more consistent approach.</p>
<h4 id="benefits-of-a-combined-approach">Benefits of a combined approach</h4>
<p>Vrontamitis says that where supply chain management is concerned, the benefits are about optimising the gross profit margin. “Then you get the treasury benefits, which are around managing FX risk,” he explains. “If you are doing all the purchasing and selling into the local market, you sell in local currency and buy in whatever currency is most appropriate, depending on your inputs. You can therefore do all the basic treasury techniques to eliminate and reduce FX risk.”</p>
<p>Vrontamitis notes that companies using global supply chain centres can also manage the leading and lagging in order to take control of the working capital side, as well as building liquidity management structures and structures such as receivables finance or supply chain finance.</p>
<p>Parvez adds that cost savings are a key goal when setting up a supply chain hub. “The more decentralised the set-up is, the higher the cost in terms of both infrastructure and people, so bringing it all together in one location means saving on the cost,” he says. “This model also increases efficiency: if people are more aligned, there is a more standardised approach in terms of both procurement and financing. Combined with this, companies can then link procurement with the financial part of the supply chain.”</p>

<div class="copy__body">
<h3 id="reconfiguring-global-supply-chains">Reconfiguring global supply chains</h3>
<p>Hari Janakiraman, Head of Core Trade at ANZ, says that the following six trends are driving the reconfiguration of global supply chains across various industries:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Emerging markets as an economic opportunity with simultaneous rising labour costs.</h5>
<p>Janakiraman says that emerging markets have had the dual effect of becoming increasingly attractive distribution locations in their own right, while being affected by rising labour costs. “Global dynamics can change the relative attractiveness of these countries as manufacturing locations, but also necessitate the development of distribution capability,” he adds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Near-shoring and re-shoring supply chain operations.</h5>
<p>Janakiraman comments, “A report by the Global Supply Chain Institute found that focusing on short-term cost reductions can neglect the hidden costs associated with an offshoring decision. Hidden costs identified include: (in)flexibility, cost to quality, cost of lost sales and added risks. Optimising the customer service offering and rapid response times by locating near home markets is an important consideration for organisations today.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Trade agreements focusing on trade facilitation.</h5>
<p>With increasing numbers of trade agreements being negotiated globally, Janakiraman says that companies should consider multiple opportunities and challenges. “These include duty expenses, compliance costs and harmonised trade finance (including supply chain finance) procedures between markets to maximise the efficiency of their supply chain.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Supply chain risk.</h5>
<p>According to Janakiraman, the changing nature of supply chain risks includes reputational risk quality and safety, supply disruption/shortages, legal issues, security challenges and regulatory and environmental compliance requirements. “Each company considers its unique footprint and exposure to these risks in the design of their supply chain,” he says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Digital supply chain evolution.</h5>
<p>“Increasing adoption of technology such as RFID, GPS and sensors have enabled business process automation, greater organisational flexibility and enhanced visibility into supply chain and opportunities for data analysis,” Janakiraman says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Advances in supply chain finance (SCF).</h5>
<p>Janakiraman points out that in March 2016, a set of standard definitions were launched for terminology, nomenclature and techniques related to SCF (the Standard Definitions for Techniques of Supply Chain Finance), which was released by a joint initiative of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Banking Commission, BAFT, the Euro Banking Association (EBA), Factors Chain International (FCI) and the International Trade and Forfaiting Association (ITFA).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“This was a joint initiative amongst major bodies in the trade finance community and is an enabling framework for SCF,” explains Janakiraman. “These standardised definitions are intended to support the use of SCF in international and domestic supply chains by creating a consistent understanding of SCF.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="integration-and-centralisation">Integration and centralisation</h4>
<p>While more companies are reportedly bringing treasury and procurement together in supply chain hubs, in practice this can mean different things to different companies.</p>
<p>Vrontamitis says that such centres can operate using different models where treasury is concerned. “One is a fully integrated model, where the global supply chain centre runs the treasury as well. Then you see centres which see treasury as a functional service alongside.” According to Vrontamitis, companies which have a decentralised treasury tend to opt for the integrated treasury model, whereas companies with a more centralised treasury team may choose to keep treasury as a centralised function.</p>
<p>Parvez says that companies with suppliers in multiple locations may prefer to use the hub model in order to bring in more standardisation and cost control. However, companies with fewer suppliers in fewer locations may continue to use a semi-decentralised model – such as having a hub in China to cover Chinese suppliers, as well as a hub in Hong Kong to cover the rest of Asia.</p>
<p>“The biggest obstacle is to understand the regulations around this as multiple countries are involved,” he notes. “Once you move to a centralised location, there could be certain regulations governing the entire process, how the information flow, and how the financing aspect can work.”</p>
<p>Vrontamitis says that while this can be a very effective model from a corporate point of view, it is also extremely hard to execute. He adds, “These centres tend to be in pretty developed locations, with good infrastructure, telecommunications, tax regimes and transparent governments – and in locations which are fairly core and central to the company.”</p>
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p>It is also important to note that integrating treasury and procurement can be challenging. “I have a pretty simple view on this, which is it has to be strategic to the company, and has to be recognised as strategic to the company,” says Vrontamitis. “This means that you need senior sponsorship. This isn’t a situation where one day the treasury guy can say to the procurement guy, ‘Why don’t we work together?’ If you want to have a fully integrated global supply chain centre, or a centralised one, you’ve really got to have this sponsored from the top.”</p>
<p>Janakiraman adds that companies setting up global supply chain centres “need to consider tax and transfer pricing mechanisms, given the increasing regulatory sensitivity around these areas.” He also says that companies should consider both direct and indirect costs incurred within the supply chain. “For example, impact on customer service, lead times, potential for lost sales, added risk, quality levels, etc should also be considered in this decision.”</p>
</div>

<div class="copy__body">
<h3 id="bridging-the-trade-finance-gap-with-supply-chain-finance">Bridging the trade finance gap with supply chain finance</h3>
<p>The adoption of supply chain finance has become increasingly widespread in recent years, with more companies choosing to set up structures in order to benefit suppliers. This is a particularly relevant topic in Asia: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has identified a global trade finance gap of $1.6trn, with developing Asia accounting for $692trn of the gap. The report also found that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face the greatest obstacles when it comes to accessing affordable trade financing.</p>
<p>Supply chain finance is one type of arrangement which can give SMEs access to the finance they need. Somanathan says that a few years ago, the companies typically adopting supply chain finance structures were in sectors such as garments, textiles, retail and consumer durables. “Increasingly, what we are seeing is that newer industries are also adopting supply chain finance solutions,” he says. “In the last 12 to 18 months, we have seen the entry of companies in mining, tyres, fertilisers, agro-chemicals and aerospace for example.”</p>
<p>Somanathan adds, “Many of these suppliers are SMEs, which are typically also the industries that help create job opportunities, so there is a social angle to it. There is a lot of support from governments and regulators to give further impetus to supply chain financing which will help suppliers’ viability. To further support this, there have been various initiatives from multilateral agencies and even global financial institutions.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="future-developments">Future developments</h3>
<p>As this model matures, companies are continuing to achieve greater levels of efficiency. “One key thing that seems to be improving over time is the technology part of it,” says Parvez. “Companies tend to have a higher amount of integration across their processes, and are moving away from manual processes.”</p>
<p>But despite the work that some companies are doing to unify procurement and financial processes, there continues to be a disparity in the level of automation available in the physical and financial supply chains. Vrontamitis explains, “Some large global corporates are talking about using mass customisation robotics in the factories, which means you can order something online it goes straight to the machine that makes the product without any human intervention, before being shipped to the end buyer and potentially delivered by a drone. That’s what the future could look like for some of these products. In contrast, the data in the supply chain is completely underutilised.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Vrontamitis says the bank is improving its analytics capability in order to help clients as part of its ‘Banking the ecosystem’ strategy. “If we can analyse data to improve risk management, and how we extend credit within the supply chain, we think that our clients can benefit from the same kind of information and data. It’s about taking the information you have and creating data pools, being able to merge data well and then use machine-based analytics to improve on it and understand what’s happening with your supply chains.”</p>
<p>This may, in turn, enable companies to gain a clearer view of who they are selling to and buying from, the terms on offer and whether there is scope to work with banks to offer finance. Vrontamitis adds that this involves banks shifting the way in which they think about credit from a backward-looking approach to real-time monitoring and understanding.</p>
<p>Janakiraman says that new challenges and opportunities may emerge in the future for companies designing their supply chains. He notes that the ability to adopt and leverage new technologies such as RFID, GPS and sensors may lead to improvements in areas such as supply chain visibility, analytics and process optimisation. Meanwhile, increasing the harmonisation of definitions related to supply chain finance will enable companies to optimise their working capital positions.</p>
<p>As Janakiraman concludes, “The most effective supply chain strategies support the business strategy. Whether this is product differentiation, price leadership, exceptional customer service or focused markets – the design of the supply chain is what ultimately delivers value for the customer.”</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>A syndicated loan is often part of a wider financing strategy, allowing a company direct access to both banks and institutional investors. But why might a corporate use a syndicated loan and how are these arranged and managed? We go back to basics to find out.</em></p>
<p>A problem shared is a problem halved, or so the adage goes. This certainly rings true when corporates need an amount of funding which cannot be supplied by one bank. In cases such as this, a syndicated loan can be used effectively to share the financing burden between banks – and, increasingly, other institutional investors such as hedge funds and pension funds.</p>
<p>Corporates certainly noticed the value of the product pre-crisis. Indeed, global deal values peaked at just under US$5trn from over 9,000 issuances in 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data. While the market contracted significantly during the financial crisis, it has picked up in recent years: total global deal value reached US$4.2trn in 2013, up 29% from 2012. In 2014, global syndicated lending reached US$4.8trn, although this figure was slightly lower in 2015 at US$4.7trn.</p>
<p>As of Q216 (the latest figures available at the time of writing), syndicated lending is down 9% compared to the first six months of 2015. From a regional perspective, the Americas are leading the way with 2,127 deals totalling US$1.2trn. Elsewhere, Europe accounted for US$439.7bn of the global total whilst Asia Pacific (APAC) accounted for US$202.3bn.</p>
<h3 id="the-purpose-of-the-loan">The purpose of the loan</h3>
<p>Companies obtain syndicated loans for different reasons. Some, for instance, may use this as a key tenet of their core funding portfolio. This could be a typical strategy for corporates with a lower credit rating which are unable to access funding readily through the bond markets.</p>
<p>Syndication may be a good option for these companies because investors are able to limit their exposure to the corporate’s risk. To account for the increased risk, companies in this situation are likely to have to pay higher margins for the loan. Investors may also put covenants in place as further protection.</p>
<p>For companies that have a higher credit rating, and thus more financing options available to them, syndication may be used more strategically and as a backup to other sources of finance. For example, companies may use the loan to finance gaps in funding between the maturity of one loan and the receipt of funds after a divestment.</p>
<h4 id="chart-01">Chart 1: Global syndicated loans volume</h4>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2017-01-02-tt-11-b2b-chart-01-global-syndicated-loans-volume-t.png?la=en&amp;hash=59CA2D35AE73DE0F74A7EC328AFC7253" target="_blank"><img alt="Chart 1: Global syndicated loans volume" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2017-01-02-tt-11-b2b-chart-01-global-syndicated-loans-volume-t.png?la=en&amp;hash=59CA2D35AE73DE0F74A7EC328AFC7253" width="967"/></a></p>
<p class="source"><em>Source: Thomson Reuters</em></p>
<p>With a higher credit rating the margin payable to the investors tends to be lower and few, if any, covenants restrict the way the company operates. The existence of the facility may also reassure investors holding other instruments issued by the company, such as commercial paper, allowing the company to benefit from a lower overall cost of funds.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-loan">Types of loan</h3>
<p>Syndicated loans primarily come in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Term loan.</h5>
<p>A term loan is a more traditional type of loan. The full amount is drawn either initially or in pre-determined instalments. The principal is either repaid over the term of the loan or at maturity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Revolving syndicated loan.</h5>
<p>This will have a specified term limit, but, in contrast to a term loan, the borrower can draw down funds and repay them as necessary, as long as the terms and conditions of the loan are met. This style of loan is more suited to companies which view the syndicated loan as a secondary source of finance or have a periodic need for funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Corporates also have a choice regarding how the loan is structured. For instance, some companies may wish their syndicated loans to comprise both a term loan and a revolving loan. This is most common if the company is a lower rated issuer. Investment grade credits are more likely to structure their loans into different revolving tranches, however. One tranche will be repayable in under a year whilst the other will have a longer maturity (typically three to five years). This provides the company with a longer-term source of funding, which is particularly useful as a backup to a commercial paper programme.</p>
<p>The maturity of the loan can also be designed to reflect the borrower’s needs. For instance, if a loan is sought by a shipping company to finance the purchase of a new fleet of its ships, the company may want to delay repayments until these are fully operational and bringing in revenue.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-management">Relationship management</h3>
<p>Before any bank is consulted about arranging the loan, the treasury needs to have a clear understanding of the role the loan will play in the company’s wider funding strategy. This will provide a crucial focal point when the company states its case to investors. A repayment strategy will also have to be outlined.</p>
<p>With a strong case built, treasury can appoint one or more arranging banks. This is typically completed through a tender process and, as with any selection procedure, can be difficult without prior experience.</p>
<p>In particular, treasurers need to be aware of the relationship implications of syndication. Appointing a bank to arrange a syndicated loan can be an effective way of rewarding a bank – or banks – which already provide the company with credit. However, the selection should take into account the entire relationship, how long it has existed and the company’s future plans.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, a company can arrange a club loan – when no arranging bank is appointed and the loan is instead arranged by the company. However, this will result in a more labour-intensive process for the treasury.</p>
<p>A second consideration when selecting an arranging bank(s) is its geographic footprint. The selected bank(s) will need to have coverage in all the appropriate markets, particularly if the aim is to attract institutional investors.</p>
<h3 id="further-considerations">Further considerations</h3>
<p>The company will also need to work with the arranging bank to decide if the loan will be underwritten. If this is the case, the borrower will receive the full amount of the loan, irrespective of whether the arranger has successfully syndicated the deal. If the loan is to be underwritten, the arranger will usually try to involve other banks as underwriters as part of the syndication process – particularly for very large deals.</p>
<p>A ‘best effort’ understanding exists if the loan is not underwritten, meaning that the arrangers do not have to meet any shortfall if the syndication is not fully successful, with the borrower receiving the reduced amount. This type of arrangement is typically found when the aim of the loan is to provide backup financing.</p>
<p>Treasury must also be fully aware of the fees associated with the loan, which can include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Margin.</h5>
<p>The lenders will charge a margin over an agreed market benchmark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Commitment fee.</h5>
<p>Where a loan is not fully drawn, borrowers will be charged a commitment fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Utilisation fee.</h5>
<p>In some cases, banks may be able to charge a small additional fee if a high proportion of the loan is drawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Arrangement fee.</h5>
<p>The arranging bank or banks will normally receive a fee once the syndication has been successfully completed. This will be determined by the size of the syndication and the associated credit risk. In some cases, other lenders will receive an upfront fee (of only a few basis points) for participaltion in the syndicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Legal fees.</h5>
<p>Companies will have to meet the costs of their legal advisors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<div class="copy__body">
<h3 id="the-art-of-negotiation">The art of negotiation</h3>
<p>Negotiation takes place at all steps of the syndicated loan process. It is therefore important to understand what the other side wants. Treasurers need to identify each potential bank’s approach to, and appetite for, syndicated loans. Considerations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The type and size of banks and whether they will sell their participation right away, or take a longer-term view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of the relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arrangement fee. If smaller syndications are divided between arranging banks, they may be dissatisfied with the reduced fee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, it is important that the company gets what it needs from the syndication. In particular, the treasurer needs to identify any potential covenants or other restrictions which the company cannot accept.</p>
<p>Syndicated loans are increasingly popular because of the variety of ways they can be structured and the funds used. However, the treasurer does need to be aware of the company’s future funding requirements before the negotiations start so that appropriate terms and conditions can be agreed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="send-and-receive">Send and receive</h3>
<p>The final step before the syndication is closed is to appoint a bank to act as administration agent. The primary role of this bank is to collect interest payments from the borrower and distribute these among the lenders.</p>
<p>This bank will also administer any interim drawdown notices. Under the terms of a revolving credit, the borrower is entitled to call for a drawdown of funds at any time. Ensuring that all participants meet their obligations is a key determinant of the success of the syndicated loan.</p>
<h3 id="secondary-market">Secondary market</h3>
<p>For lenders, an important factor is the secondary market, where exposure to the syndicated loan can be managed by selling on part or all of a bank’s participation in a syndicated deal. The exact terms and conditions for this are set out in the loan documentation. Most transfers are made ‘by novation’, in which case the new lender becomes a ‘lender of record’. In these circumstances, the new lender simply replaces the original lender. The original terms and conditions apply, with the only change relating to which bank receives the interest payments.</p>
<p>The key factor in all cases is that the bank’s ability to sell loans in the secondary market reduces the counterparty risk associated with the decision to participate in the syndication. As a result, the secondary market enhances liquidity in the syndicated market.</p>
<p>What is sometimes less well understood, however, is the importance of the secondary market for borrowers. Indeed, the transferability of loans is an important component in the growth of the market. For the corporate borrower, the development of the secondary market has also enhanced liquidity in the primary market, arguably bringing down margins for all borrowers.</p>
<h3 id="digital-disruption">Digital disruption</h3>
<p>Arranging and managing a syndicated loan can be an inefficient, labour intensive and lengthy process. While the various loan market associations around the world have made great strides in simplifying this process through the creation of standardised loan documentation and championing best practices, complexities remain.</p>
<p>The syndicated loan industry is, therefore, ripe for digital disruption, and a number of parties are already looking to digitise this space. In September 2016, for example, a group of banks including Credit Suisse, the R3 blockchain consortium, and fintech start-up Symbiont announced that they had taken steps to improve the process. The trial loan, arranged by Credit Suisse, employed smart-contract technology that sees contracts exchanged on the blockchain to quicken and increase the efficiency of loan trade settlements. Using this type of solution, paperwork can be reduced dramatically, as can the hurdles and inefficiencies that any trade market routinely sees.</p>
<p>“This project demonstrates the potential for blockchain technology to fundamentally reshape the syndicated loan market and the capital markets more broadly,” said Emmanuel Aidoo, head of the distributed ledger and blockchain effort at Credit Suisse following the announcement of the trial. “This demonstration sets us on a path to increase efficiency and reduce costs, which will benefit banks and clients alike. By connecting a network of agent banks through blockchain, we can achieve faster and more certain settlements in the loan market.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how long it will be until solutions such as these are fully implemented. But one thing is for sure: disruption in the syndicated loan market is coming, and will hopefully benefit the whole ecosystem.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>When the time is right to introduce or replace a key part of your treasury technology or to establish a major new banking or service relationship, the selection process can be demanding. Treasury Today considers a key part of any major project: the Request for Proposal.</em></p>
<p>Regardless of the driver for change, sometimes the choices available to treasurers when selecting new technology or service relationships can be bewildering, particularly when considering a complex proposition such as a treasury management system (TMS) or a multi-country banking partner. The difficulty often lies in the fact that the differences between offerings may be subtle but nonetheless important to the success or otherwise of the outcome.</p>
<p>In such a case, a well-managed request for proposal (RFP) can be a valuable tool in helping to ease the selection process whilst the drafting process can potentially alert treasury to any other issues that should now also be addressed. A good choice at this stage may well obviate the need for yet another project down the line.</p>
<p>In essence, a RFP is the governing document that contains all the key business requirements based around the new solution that treasury is looking to implement. The importance of developing a document that will allow treasury to obtain the information it needs to make an informed decision cannot be overstated.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-definition">Requirements definition</h3>
<p>No matter where a RFP is carried out in the world, a coherent and managed requirements definition is essential beforehand. This is the foundation stone of the entire project and may call upon input from other functions within the business to highlight some of their specific requirements and to give an indication as to how any new system or process will affect others up and downstream.</p>
<p>However, it should be understood from the outset that a degree of flexibility on the part of both client and vendor (used in this context to mean technology vendor, bank or other service provider) is desirable as to the means of arrival at the final destination because as the project progresses new ideas are often revealed. In a complex treasury setup, a fully-scoped project may not even be possible until the core functions have been implemented and the ancillary requirements become apparent. There may also be the need for a discretionary trade-off where the lack of a certain aspect may be outweighed by the presence of another more important one. A suitably researched and worded RFP may go some way to revealing the preparedness of the vendor to accommodate the client in this respect.</p>
<h3 id="project-manage">Project manage</h3>
<p>The consultation process, though hugely beneficial in the long term, will run the risk of developing ‘scope creep’ (continuously adding to it) unless from the outset there is a coherent and simple project definition, a means of deflecting unnecessary diversions, and of taking firm and intelligent decisions. Scope creep can confuse and confound the end-result and add substantially to the final cost. For this reason, the backing of a project sponsor (in the form of an executive with higher status than anyone else involved with the project) and a strong project manager (PM) are essential.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>However, scope creep should not be confused with the controlled and planned modification of the project in the light of acquiring more detailed understanding of the capabilities of the technology. This can add new benefits that had not been previously thought of – but even here the change process must be managed.</p>
<h3 id="consider-your-initial-options">Consider your initial options</h3>
<p>Deciding which vendors to approach will involve some background research. Using publications such as Treasury Today, talking to other treasurers and having preliminary discussions with vendors at conferences and exhibitions will all provide valuable initial insight. It may even be prudent to send out your basic requirements definition to a wider panel of vendors, in the form of a request for information (RFI) first. A RFI is a high-level call for product information that can at least put you in the right ball-park regarding which vendors have suitable offerings.</p>
<p>Having created a long-list of potential candidates (and this may include half a dozen or more), building a RFP can provide structure to the selection process, enabling you to focus only on the most appropriate offerings.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-rfp">Building a RFP</h3>
<p>It is vital from the treasurer’s point of view to ensure that the same document is issued to each prospective supplier and that it conveys precisely and clearly what is required, according to the circumstances underpinning the project. A complex treasury will probably generate a larger RFP document and this should be broken down into manageable sections for the benefit of the vendors and for your own team when it comes to assessing the responses.</p>
<p>The actual layout of the RFP can vary but be aware of the importance of laying it out clearly, with a logical progression between each section, and giving sufficient space for suppliers to respond if it is intended to be a physical document. And just as it is possible to fail to explain your needs clearly, or to provide too little information for the vendors to be able to respond in depth, it is also possible to over-burden suppliers with information; providing an in-depth view of the group’s entire business operations may not be required if it is only relevant to the project to offer a view of the structure of treasury and where it sits within that operation.</p>
<h3 id="incorporating-functionality">Incorporating functionality</h3>
<p>A major part of building the RFP concerns functionality. This is where the work that went into creating the requirements definition comes into play: the requirements definition states what you want so that when translated into the RFP it enables the treasurer to assess which vendor is best placed to deliver. But whilst some RFP responses may call for a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, others may need more in-depth explanations of how certain functions are supported and processed and, if it is a technology project, how this relates to the way in which your treasury operates (including its connectivity with third parties, such as banks and/or SWIFT).</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In addition to pure functionality, a key objective for a technology project is to configure sets of functionalities into workflows that fulfil the project’s business process objectives. This is where ‘how’ questions can help, as the buyer needs to understand how effectively the solution can automate a specific treasury activity. Be aware that open questions may be necessary to unearth how a supplier intends to meet some complex, potentially deal-breaking issues, but too many open questions will push the analysis phase into overdrive, making it difficult to draw accurate and fair comparisons between vendors.</p>
<p>In all cases, the questions set out in the RFP have to be considered – and tested – carefully, to see if they are understandable, unambiguous, and likely to yield the answers sought. You are, after all, asking for and should expect more than just a cut-and-paste response from the vendor.</p>
<p>When asking about the implementation process it is necessary not just to pose questions but also to state a host of facts to assist the vendor. The fact list may include points relating to the intended timescale, how many users, locations, functionality required in each location, how satellite units are structured within the company, the existing system configuration (listing current systems and what needs to be integrated up and downstream), and any manual interventions.</p>
<p>It may be appropriate to provide a proposed technical integration plan for the new solution. Certainly any integration and reporting requirements should be defined in sufficient detail to avoid ambiguity, to enable vendors to have a sufficient understanding of the implementation scope to propose the implementation effort accurately.</p>
<p>In seeking a vendor’s thoughts on these matters it is necessary to secure from it a raft of reciprocal information such as how it intends to piece together an implementation team (size and structure and who will be involved, for example), what it proposes in terms of ongoing support (technical and staff training) and maintenance (with details and sample copies of SLAs and so on). In essence, you need to embrace the whole service of the product in one document.</p>
<p>It may be that treasury knows what it wants but does not know how to achieve it; the level of detail in the RFP can be used to provide vendors with the opportunity to deliver a creative response, mindful that it is not good form for companies to use it as a free consultancy service. It is also worth noting that unless the RFP conveys precisely what is required, the pricing is likely to be inaccurate; resist adding elements merely out of curiosity or as a demonstration of your depth of knowledge (it does happen) as these will frustrate a genuine comparison.</p>
<p>Whilst some aspects of treasury may be commercially sensitive, it should be borne in mind that conveying sufficient detail for a vendor to be able to provide the most appropriate response is beneficial to all parties, both in terms of getting the best solution and in getting the job done in the most efficient manner. It is important to realise too that RFPs that are the product of multiple departments are prone to duplication of questions. Care should be taken to remove any such instances from the final document. Read the whole document before sending it: a final sanity check will ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>When it comes to distributing the RFP, by all means send it to all those vendors that closely meet your requirements, but always bear in mind that the more vendors the RFP is sent to, the more analysis you will have to do when the responses come back. Typically a shortlist of three or four will be called upon to respond (and be aware that some vendors may fail to respond: it is unprofessional but it happens).</p>
<h3 id="making-a-judgement">Making a judgement</h3>
<p>A RFP response should give a clear demonstration of a vendor’s capacity to add value and differentiate itself from the others. Over and above what is sought by treasury, a good RFP response may also provide relevant supplementary answers. In any case, read all submissions carefully and if something is not clear ask the vendor to clarify.</p>
<p>The information you receive will have to be compared on an equal footing. Depending upon factors such as project complexity and the number of vendors approached, a well-crafted set of questions should enable the project team to consolidate answers on a single spreadsheet set up to allow a quick view of scores for each aspect. However, before scoring responses, it is common practice to ‘weight’ each section and component according to the relative value the team places on it. This ensures that the overall score reflects those values, and that the outcome is not unduly influenced by an aspect of lesser importance.</p>
<p>The weighting process must be discussed beforehand. The process is arbitrary and therefore must have direction from the project manager to avoid endless re-working. Resist the temptation to adjust weightings until you get the answer you want as this voids the entire exercise.</p>
<p>The degree to which scoring is broken down within each component will depend upon time available and the relative importance of that component. Deep questioning and subsequent scoring of the minutiae of a certain function will in theory better reflect the view of that function. Whilst this may be appropriate for some aspects, doing this for every component will generate unnecessary extra work. In the end, the decision may come down to which vendor team you feel most in tune with, or even the best price, but a good RFP will provide most of the technical and service information to be able to take such a decision comfortably.</p>

<h3 id="checklist-of-rfp-processes">Checklist of RFP processes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before starting on a major project, secure the support of a senior executive sponsor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appoint a strong project manager. Consider a third party for the role if no suitable internal candidate is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always establish a requirements definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an internal appointment is made, ensure they can remain objective. Consider having them dedicated to the role for the duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factor in all resources likely to be required for the duration of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think carefully about which functions and individuals within the group should be involved in the consultation process. Document any agreements in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish ‘rules of engagement’, allowing vendor-contact only with this liaison person (probably the project manager). Log all interaction. A single point of contact avoids confusion and conflicting information. This rule should be extended to cover the implementation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure you clearly understand and have documented what your main issues are, why you are doing this and what you expect to achieve. Refer to this document often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be flexible regarding your plans and add a contingency allowance (for cost, time etc) for project expansion as awareness of the chosen solution increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not confuse beneficial project additions with unwanted scope creep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t change anything in the project plan without managing and documenting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider issuing a request for information (RFI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When building a RFP keep asking if it conveys precisely and clearly what it is you require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure questions are clear, understandable and have been tested and proven as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not ask unnecessary or unreasonable questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If multiple departments are involved proper coordination and documentation is required at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask open questions where detail is necessary and closed questions where a simple yes or no is sufficient. Remember that open questions are more difficult to compare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay out the RFP clearly, in logical order and with sufficient room for a full response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complex requirements should be broken down into logical, manageable sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is in your interest to provide sufficient information to enable the vendor to give the fullest answer possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not over-burden the supplier with unnecessary background information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the final document before sending it to vendors to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight each question according to your own values and agree upon weightings before sending the RFP to suppliers. Resist the temptation to adjust weightings to get the answer you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear your mind of any bias for or against suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t send it to too many vendors: it makes analysis difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read all responses carefully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for added-value in vendor responses eg raising new but useful points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to distinguish between fact and sales talk.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>A successful treasurer is one who achieves a good balance between investing excess cash and delivering the necessary cash resources to support company liquidity. In this article, we look at how categorising cash into separate portfolios enables consideration of the risk/return profile necessary to meet the company’s liquidity requirements.</em></p>
<p>Getting the most out of cash investments while maintaining company liquidity is challenging at the best of times; and even more so when the markets are volatile. There is no easy way to achieve the right balancing act, but it is prudent to adopt an organised approach to it by ‘tranching’ the cash according to its type. Tranching describes the process of investing cash in line with its characteristics (especially its time horizon) and the risk/return profile the company is seeking.</p>
<h3 id="defining-corporate-cash-buckets">Defining corporate cash buckets</h3>
<p>To achieve this, a corporate must first decide on and define the categories that its cash will be divided into. For many corporates the most beneficial, and logical, way to categorise cash is by time periods. It is therefore common for the buckets to be defined by the short, medium and long-term cash requirements of the business. However, all companies have their own individual needs, so extra layers of complexity can be added. For example, sub categories based around currency and location of cash, can be developed to better reflect the needs of the company.</p>
<p>Despite this, corporates will tend to keep things simple and segment their cash into:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operating cash/working capital (short-term).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reserve cash (medium-term).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategic cash (long-term).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what defines each of these categories.</p>
<h4 id="operating-cash-short-term">Operating cash (short-term)</h4>
<p>Operating cash is the lifeblood of a company, allowing it to meet its day-to-day obligations such as working capital, salary and interest payments. In most cases corporates will plan for this cash out to three months, although some companies may extend this out to a year depending on their circumstances. How this cash is used may be subject to unexpected fluctuations, as the demands of the economic environment put pressure on the daily ebb and flow of the business. As such, treasurers will want this cash to be easily accessible and secure.</p>
<h4 id="reserve-cash-medium-term">Reserve cash (medium-term)</h4>
<p>Reserve cash, otherwise known as core cash, is used to meet the medium-term business needs of a company, typically from a time period of three months out to one year. It is often used for but not limited to: dividend payments, tax obligations and can also be used for planned business expansion such as mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Reserve cash will not need to be as liquid as operating cash, however it would be useful for the treasury to be able to access this in a timely fashion, should market conditions necessitate.</p>
<h4 id="strategic-cash-long-term">Strategic cash (long-term)</h4>
<p>The final core bucket of cash is strategic cash. Unlike operating and reserve cash, this segment has no immediate use for the business within the next year and further out – the exact timeframe needs to be defined by the company. This cash may be used to fund future, as yet unplanned M&amp;A activity, spent on internal development projects, or eventually be returned to shareholders. Strategic cash could also be used in a precautionary capacity, should market conditions take a turn for the worse.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Although forecasts still tend to be less accurate than most treasurers would like them to be, they do (or should) provide a realistic view of future cash resources and therefore provide an early opportunity for identifying potential surplus cash.</blockquote>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="ups-and-downs">Ups and downs</h3>
<p>The graph opposite illustrates the peaks and troughs in a company’s cash position and illustrates two occasions where it needed to dip into its reserve cash in order to meet its day-to-day obligations. Of course, the aim is for this never to happen, however, at times when business performance takes an unexpected downturn or market conditions change this may be needed. Yet a tool is at hand to ensure that the treasury can best plan what cash is needed and when – the cash flow forecast.</p>
<h3 id="looking-into-the-crystal-ball">Looking into the crystal ball</h3>
<p>Cash flow forecasts show a company’s expected net cash positions from its operating, investment and financing activities during a specific period, based on known commitments and receipts, with appropriate adjustments being made (using historical data, trends and/or statistical techniques) to allow for future variables.</p>
<p>These forecasts are the ultimate source of information for determining the amount of cash available, where it is and when it will be required. Although forecasts still tend to be less accurate than most treasurers would like them to be, they do (or should) provide a realistic view of future cash resources and therefore provide an early opportunity for identifying potential surplus cash (as well as deficits) and other essential information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currency denomination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total amount (value) available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planned future location (and currency).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time horizons (ie the length of time cash will be available for investment before it is needed by the business).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the forecasts will help treasury to define how ‘important’ the cash is to the business’s daily operational activities and what the impact would be on the company if the cash to be invested was not readily available to meet day-to-day obligations, eg would trading be severely affected?</p>
<h4 id="figure-1">Figure 1: Cash position of a non-financial corporate over time</h4>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2015-04-tt-12-b2b-figure-01-cash-position-of-a-non-financial-corporate-over-time-967x439.png?la=en&amp;hash=50F1AA9F27F85717536379978A79E0C4" target="_blank"><img alt="Figure 1: Cash position of a non-financial corporate over time" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2015-04-tt-12-b2b-figure-01-cash-position-of-a-non-financial-corporate-over-time-967x439.png?la=en&amp;hash=50F1AA9F27F85717536379978A79E0C4" width="967"/></a></p>
<p>To assist with cash segmentation strategies, cash flow forecasts are also complied in different time horizons. Typically these will be short-term, medium-term and long-term time horizons, matching the corporate cash buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Short-term.</h5>
<p>Short-term forecasts provide the cash detail needed to help manage working capital and to protect day-to-day company liquidity, covering the immediate cash inflows and outflows that affect overnight balances. Daily and even intra-day forecasts ensure that treasury keeps abreast of last minute changes to cash flows. Weekly and monthly forecasts (for up to about three months) provide advance warning of the expected cash positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Medium-term.</h5>
<p>Rolling monthly forecasts for up to 12 months ahead help to predict cash needs and surpluses further into the future. They help to show where the high and low points of cash availability are likely to occur through the course of the year as well as identify when existing investments and debts may be maturing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Long-term.</h5>
<p>Long-term forecasts may cover up to a three or even five-year period. They provide a longer view of potential surplus resources and financing needs to help ensure that a company’s business plans and strategies can be properly funded. They also help to identify future cash that has not yet been ‘earmarked’ for use and is therefore available to invest for a longer time period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, cash flow forecasts provide a good understanding of the peaks and troughs in cash availability across the group. They help to identify the type of cash available to invest, the criticality of that cash and accordingly, the amount of cash that can be allocated to each cash category. By frequently monitoring these forecasts, the cash allocations within each cash category can be suitably adjusted to ensure that their levels remain pertinent for meeting business needs. As each cash category will have different characteristics, they will also have different investment objectives and therefore be invested in different types of instruments. This means that they will be tranched differently.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>As each cash category will have different characteristics, they will also have different investment objectives and therefore be invested in different types of instruments. This means that they will be tranched differently.</blockquote>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="investment-decisions">Investment decisions</h3>
<p>Investment decisions for each cash category should be guided by the degree of priority given to the three main investment objectives. These objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Security.</h5>
<p>Minimising the potential risk to the original sum invested (the principal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity.</h5>
<p>Ensuring timely realisation of the cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Yield.</h5>
<p>Achieving the best possible return on the cash.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of investment instrument used will depend on the risk it exposes to the cash versus the potential return it offers (its risk/return profile). Therefore, for each cash category, the mix of instruments permitted, their limits and any restrictions will need to be balanced with the priorities given to the investment objectives. The aim is to identify and invest in the instrument types which offer the best and most appropriate investment opportunity for the cash.</p>
<p>An instrument offering more security and greater liquidity will usually deliver less return. So, for example, whilst such an instrument may be appropriate for investing operating cash, a treasurer may be prepared to assume more risk for better yield on money available for a longer period. Information relating to investment objectives and instruments should be detailed for each cash category within the investment policy and guidelines. It is important to be clear about how each of the categories must be treated.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="investment-by-category">Investment by category</h3>
<p>Now we will look more closely at the three example cash categories we mentioned earlier and consider how they may be treated from an investment perspective. Individual companies will, of course, have different requirements and will identify and adapt the use of instruments to meet their own business challenges. It is imperative that all investment decisions are fully supported by judicious research and understanding of the counterparties, markets and investment instruments to be used.</p>
<h4 id="operating-cash-short-term">Operating cash (short-term)</h4>
<p>Liquidity and security is the key for any investment instrument involving operating cash, yield is a nice to have but not a must. As such, treasurers will tend to look to invest in overnight accounts, money market funds (MMFs) or other instruments that offer access to cash after a short-time period determined by when the cash is needed. These products typically offer a low, but steady yield. Investments in fixed income instruments are generally avoided when investing operating cash unless there is a highly liquid secondary market or extremely short maturity date.</p>
<p>As treasurers are acutely aware after the financial crisis, in order to limit the counterparty risk, diversification of funds is of great importance.</p>
<h4 id="reserve-cash-medium-term">Reserve cash (medium-term)</h4>
<p>When looking to invest its reserve, or core cash, treasurers can begin to look at some more exciting investment options, including reverse repos and short-term bond funds, as well as high quality corporate debt. All of the investments instruments listed under operating cash can also be used but treasurers can also look to seek more yield whist affording proper protection of the original sum invested in order to meet expected obligations. Since the financial crisis, security has been the primary requirement for this cash, with yield being second. Due to the medium-term nature of this cash, high liquidity is not of paramount importance. It is worth noting however, that this order may change depending on the risk appetite of the business and the market conditions it is operating in.</p>
<h4 id="strategic-cash-long-term">Strategic cash (long-term)</h4>
<p>Finally, the strategic cash bucket is where treasurers have historically become more creative in their investments in the search for improved yield – but, accordingly, this will expose the cash to greater risk. The investment will have to ride greater volatility in the markets with a higher possibility of the cash principal being eroded. It is therefore important to ensure that investments can be maintained for the long term in order to overcome possible short-term turbulence in the markets. As with other cash categories, cash should be diversified across different instruments.</p>
<p>The treasury may invest in similar instruments that its reserve cash is invested in, but that return slightly higher yield. It may use instruments such as floating rate notes, or invest directly in equities – but the gain from these is generally achieved through investing for the very long term.</p>
<h3 id="a-tough-environment">A tough environment</h3>
<p>Whilst the above outlines how segmented cash might be invested in a perfect world, as treasurers are all too aware the current environment is far from ideal. It comes as little surprise to learn then, that, according to data from Bloomberg, European corporations were sitting on cash balances just short of €2 trillion in April 2014. This phenomenon is not restricted to Europe, however. Asian companies too have often been criticised for hoarding their cash and recent data has shown that Japanese corporates for example have around $3 trillion on their balance sheet. Thomson Reuters data also shows that China’s 500 biggest companies have $405 billion stockpiled.</p>
<p>For most companies, a large portion of this cash is being used as a liquidity buffer against external shocks, but many corporates are also struggling with the concept of low or even negative returns, as well as the impact regulatory change in the MMF sector. As such, the treasurer’s job is becoming increasingly difficult. And as market conditions continue to change, so will the parameters of corporate cash management – and the different requirements and priorities for investments. Regular reviews of cash and investment positions, exposures and policies are therefore recommended.</p></div>

<p><em>Centralisation has long been a key objective for corporate treasurers. But advances in technology and an evolving regulatory landscape mean companies today can take their centralisation projects further than ever before. And while centralising a treasury is seldom a smooth or swift undertaking, the prospective efficiency and risk management benefits make the end result worth the effort.</em></p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Centralisation is far from being a new concept in the world of treasury management. Yet it is one that remains a key focus as treasurers of companies operating across multiple locations covet even greater efficiency, transparency and access to real-time information.</p>
<p>Although there is no one-size-fits all model for centralising treasury activities, establishing an in-house bank (IHB) has long been viewed as a fundamental first step. With industry research showing that treasuries across both developed and emerging markets are increasingly looking to centralise their operations, interest in IHB structures has naturally increased. “For many centralised treasury structures, an IHB is a prerequisite,” says Jan Dirk van Beusekom, Executive Director, Client Advisory, BNP Paribas. “Since more companies are now busy centralising their treasury activities, appetite for in-house banks is growing.”</p>
<p>The trend may also be a reflection of the treasury community’s evolving priorities. A survey of corporate treasurers conducted in 2015 by BNP Paribas and The Boston Consulting Group, for instance, found that the top three treasury priorities for that year were managing risks effectively, improving process efficiency and improving cash visibility. Perhaps the IHB is becoming an ever more popular model because of a growing realisation in the treasury community that a centralisation project can be a catalyst for improvement in all three of these areas.</p>
<h3 id="top-priorities">Top priorities</h3>
<p>The international chemical and advanced materials company Solvay, headquartered in Belgium, attests to this fact. Several decades have passed since the company first implemented an IHB structure in the 1980s, and a lot changed during that time. Like many companies that implement an IHB structure, Solvay opted for a staggered approach: centralising as and when technological and regulatory change opened up new opportunities to do so. Each incremental improvement meant better control over those three areas – risk management, process efficiency and cash visibility – that treasurers say they care most about. It is an approach other companies looking to establish centralised treasury models could learn a lot from.</p>
<p>“Back when we first implemented the IHB there was no Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA), no euros and no internet,” Jean-Francois Caillol, Solvay Cash and Forex Manager, notes. “But we wanted to centralise intercompany flows as far as possible. Over the subsequent years we saw the arrival of the internet, the invention of the modern ERP, the birth of the euro and finally SEPA. And because of those developments we were able to realise a number of technical improvements.”</p>
<p>The treasury structure Solvay has in place today is based around an IHB that operates as a centralised treasury unit, maintaining control and oversight of the internal accounts of the individual business units across the countries the company is present in. Each business unit has an internal bank account in the books of the IHB and all payment and collection processing is managed by the IHB via SWIFTNet on either an on-behalf-of basis or, where that is not possible, on an in-the-name-of basis. Transactional exchange risk hedging and internal financing are also centralised through the IHB. For payments, treasury decided it was important to utilise SEPA from the overlay account wherever possible.</p>
<p>Assignment of both payables and receivables to the IHB was crucial since assigning only one would be “like trying to walk on one leg” Caillol opines. To do so would generate an imbalance in external and internal bank accounts and leave the company more exposed to FX risk. “We wanted customers to make their payments to the in-house bank and not to the individual companies; and we want suppliers to receive payments from the in-house bank and not from the individual companies.”</p>
<p>Centralising cash, foreign exchange and inter-company financing together meant Solvay’s exposures could be more easily identified, measured and managed and unnecessary losses reduced. “It’s much easier to monitor counterparty risk,” says Caillol, “when your cash is not spread across different accounts all around the world.” Through having a centralised view on commercial FX exposures by monitoring Accounts Payable (A/P) and Accounts Receivable (A/R) assignments by business units, Solvay’s treasury has also attained greater visibility and control. “If you improve your processes on payments and collections, you will also be able to improve your days payable outstanding (DPO) and days sales outstanding (DSO) and hence improve working capital management,” says BNPP’s van Beusekom.</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming challenges</h3>
<p>Seeing the improved transparency and control centralisation supports at Solvay, there is a growing appetite to establish more centralised treasury structures. But treasurers should be under no illusions: challenges inevitably arise in the transition from basic cash and risk management processes to more sophisticated models. Solvay’s treasury knows this from hard experience.</p>
<p>“Regulation remains one of the biggest obstacles to centralisation,” says Caillol. “Our model works very efficiently in open economies like those of European countries, for example, and the US and Canada. But when it comes to countries like Brazil or South Korea that have currencies that are non-convertible or more tightly regulated, it becomes much more difficult.”</p>
<p>Van Beusekom agrees that it is the specific regulations encountered in some of these more challenging markets that makes centralisation difficult for companies. He advises companies seek to adopt a more flexible approach. That indeed was one of the things that van Beusekom views as most impressive about the approach taken by Solvay. “Not all payments can be on-behalf-of,” he says. “For that reason, being flexible is so important. For some entities you will be able to have payments on-behalf-of (POBO) and in others it will need to be payments in-the-name-of. Treasury would still be centrally organised, but it would mean using the accounts of local entities when that is required. It should be about integrating the flows as much as possible into the centralised model, but accepting the limitations.”</p>
<h4 id="chart-01">Chart 1: Integration of AP and AR – the way it works</h4>
<p><img alt="Chart 1: Integration of AP and AR – the way it works" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2016-09-10-tt-06-ii-chart-01-integration-of-ap-and-ar-the-way-it-works-967x462.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=69501AF24F4C9E29375045A6B5FE12D0" width="967"/>
<p class="source"><em>Source: Solvay</em></p>
<p>Having a flexible, adaptable model is obviously beneficial in the sense that when regulations change in certain markets, it is relatively straightforward for treasury to respond and take advantage. It was this adaptability that allowed Solvay to increase centralisation after the introduction of the euro and SEPA. Caillol believes it will continue to be of benefit as the different regulatory environments Solvay operates in continue to evolve in the years ahead. “While there are restrictions in certain countries, the picture is constantly evolving. Take the FX reforms we’ve seen recently in China, for example. We know when countries open their economies we are ready to implement our system there.”</p>
<p>Systems and processes must also be ready to adapt to changes within the company, as well as changes in regulatory environment. In the case of M&amp;A, for example, Caillol says there is sometimes a need to use transitory services and develop alternative solutions as treasury carves out existing companies and migrates new entities to a compatible ERP. Such flexibility helped minimise disruption after Solvay completed its acquisition of US based materials technology and speciality chemicals company, Cytec Industries, in 2015. “Today we have a model that has not only demonstrated its effectiveness but also its ability to evolve with both internal and external changes.”</p>
<h3 id="a-helping-hand">A helping hand</h3>
<p>Before embarking on a centralisation project of their own, Caillol and van Beusekom would encourage treasurers to consider very carefully what they want to accomplish and what model fits best for their particular company and then bring in the technology and banking expertise to help them reach that goal.</p>
<p>Technology was certainly a critical piece in the puzzle for Solvay. Before the arrival of the modern ERP system, there was a limit to how far the company could take their centralisation initiative. Indeed, the structure the company has in place today would not be possible, Caillol insists, without a very powerful SAP system, SWIFT connectivity and an intranet platform enabling clients to access their statements and perform transactions. “An IT system that is well designed and maintained is an absolute necessity,” he says. “For us it is vital to support the complexity of our volumes.”</p>
<p>Solvay’s story also highlights how successful centralisation rests on true cooperation between banks and their corporate clients. For companies looking to centralise like Solvay, BNP Paribas offers a dedicated implementation project manager who maintains a dialogue with the clients’ cash management team throughout the life of the project. On a more general level, the bank additionally provides educational opportunities for clients to learn about different approaches to centralisation and discuss these with the bank and their peers. Van Beusekom says: “We organise regular workshops and Q&amp;A sessions and other events like our Cash Management University where treasurers can meet and discuss projects and share frameworks with corporates thinking about adopting these types of structures.”</p>
<p>From the perspective of Solvay’s treasury, these services are an invaluable resource for any company endeavouring to centralise.</p></p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>A corporate treasury focused purely on executing transactional activities is a rare thing – if one still exists. The role of treasury has developed into a far broader function and phases such as strategic advisor are now thrown into the mix. But what does this mean and how does selecting the correct treasury structure enable an advisory function? Treasury Today Asia looks at how different treasury models, including hybrid centralisation, have evolved to fulfil the multiplying needs placed on different treasuries.</em></p>
<p>Whilst automation and cost reduction remain among the major aims when it comes to structuring the treasury function, full centralisation doesn’t suit every business, nor is it possible for many. Certainly, emphasis on visibility and control is considered one of the drivers behind intensifying interest in centralisation. But the trend to note from recent years, suggests Craig Davis, Partner, Head of Financial Risk Management, Asia Pacific, KPMG, is the movement away from decentralisation – one which may not reach full centralisation in every case, but a journey that is particular to an individual company’s criteria, and what works best for its operating model.</p>
<p>According to Norbert Braspenning, Clients &amp; Products, Asia Pacific, Managing Director, ING Bank’s wholly owned subsidiary Bank Mendes Gans, this trend can be compared to Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection. “In his scientific theory, the evolutionary process gives rise to diversity at every level. If you project that onto treasury, one of the definite takeaways is that there is more than one way forward.” As companies evolve, “each business will find itself in a unique situation based on its size and scale, geographical footprint, organisational culture, technological sophistication and so on”, and treasury will adapt more or less in line with these developments.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, though, in recent years, centralisation has been the hot topic. KPMG’s Davis identifies three factors which have driven the preference for a move in this direction: “Firstly, from a cash management perspective, being able to pool your liquidity together is going to give you cost and efficiency benefits. In addition, from a risk management perspective, having a holistic view across the organisation is advantageous. A third key point is regarding infrastructure; rather than having multiple instances of TMSs, for instance, being able to build technology in one location and leverage that for increased risk analytics and cash management capabilities drives centralisation.”</p>
<p>It is clearly not a new transition, but one which has been accelerated by the global financial crisis. Efforts to fortify internal controls, mobilise working capital and boost visibility intensified in the turbulence that followed this period. And now, Davis says, the current economic environment is further driving focus on such efficiencies, as well as technological advances making it easier and cheaper to centralise in varying degrees.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-the-right-attention">Drawing the right attention</h3>
<p>As such, treasury models have received much attention in Asia Pacific (APAC). Richard Parkinson, Managing Director of the Treasury Today Group, facilitated a panel at the annual SIBOS conference in Singapore last year, which discussed the growing trend to centralise the treasury function in APAC but acknowledged the multiplicity of choices treasurers have when shaping the structure of their departments. Indeed, operating a centralised structure is not always straightforward and, as every business has individual requirements, it is important to determine (and periodically re-evaluate) the degree to which centralisation is beneficial and practical from a specific company’s perspective.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case in Asia where infrastructure and regulatory frameworks diverge between markets, making achieving an optimal balance between global consistency and local flexibility of utmost importance. In fact, many treasuries form a hybrid between the two.</p>
<p>When deciding whether a company’s treasury model needs adapting, the treasurer’s knowledge of the company’s business drivers, how funds are managed within regions and back to the parent company and desired levels of control, amongst other company-specific priorities, is key. “There are certain criteria that I think everybody needs to consider but depending on the type of industry they are in, some will be more important than others,” says Davis. These priorities can then be matched with relevance to the two distinctions that treasuries find themselves between:</p>
<h5>Decentralised.</h5>
<p>Treasury policy-making, decisions and activities are conducted by individual subsidiaries. Typically, only a small team is retained at group level to provide advice and support. Subsidiaries may have their own local banking arrangements, will organise their own funding and handle cash management (including short-term borrowing and investments) locally but payments to and from the parent company will still occur.</p>
<p>Decentralised structures work well when the subsidiaries are independent and autonomous units with limited complimentary needs. Treasury units’ enhanced local operational knowledge and risk awareness is advantageous – especially when the business needs to adapt to unexpected events. However, they face issues with limited automation (no central processes), and potentially lack the leverage or ability to offset surplus cash positions against borrowings elsewhere, among other potential problems of multiplying, rather than minimising, efforts.</p>
<h5>Fully centralised.</h5>
<p>With a fully centralised structure, a global treasury centre or regional centres (on behalf of subsidiaries across a specific region or across the group) will undertake policy-making decisions and most, if not all, banking and financial activities. These centres may offer 24-hour services to ensure round-the-clock coverage for all subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Centralisation ensures group treasury has standardised operations, greater control across the company with streamlined bank accounts and improved transparency of cash flow. The natural hedge created by the matching of financial positions can also result in better margins. If basic processes of payments and collections are centralised, the cost of those processes decreases: it is a simple economy of scale. At the SIBOS panel facilitated by Treasury Today Asia, Finance Lead at British American Tobacco (BAT), Nicholas Soon, said how the cost savings from their centralisation project in treasury alone are $50m per annum.</p>
<p>Centralisation can, however, lead to a lack of local banking expertise and a loss of responsibility locally may create a lack of interest and build up resistance at that level. Technology developments can also be hampered by many Asian regulations so although full centralisation may be the ultimate goal for most multinational corporations, many companies end up with a partial or hybrid centralisation structure simply because it is too impractical for them to operate in any other way.</p>
<p>Indeed, it certainly isn’t a case of one size fits all. Some responsibilities of the treasury department can benefit more obviously from centralisation – increased visibility of cash flows and information, for example.</p>
<p>But, in some instances, companies must question whether the process involved would be handled better locally – certain commodities hedging or transactions require reporting to central banks, for instance. “Historically, decentralised approaches were used for a number of reasons in terms of regulatory requirements and infrastructure challenges,” Davis says. Whilst the majority of developed countries innovate, mature and advance, some countries remain stuck in the past somewhat and if companies want to operate there, they must follow the rules and deal with the consequences on treasury structure.</p>
<p>In fact, according to Braspenning, “the majority of corporates fall in the middle. There are a few that operate fully decentralised, but there are even less that can do everything centralised”.</p>
<h3 id="the-best-of-both-worlds">The best of both worlds?</h3>
<p>Treasury models, of course, aren’t fixed structures – they are meant to adapt for purpose. As such, over the years, other models taking influence from both ends of the spectrum have emerged. For example: global treasury centres with regional treasury centres and global treasury centres with decentralised treasury activities (<a href="#chart-1">see Chart 1</a>). Both are part of a centralised treasury management function, but are legally structured as a separate group entity or branch.</p>
<h4 id="chart-1">Chart 1: Treasury centre operating models</h4>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2016-09-10-tta-08-tp-chart-01-treasury-centre-operating-models-967x373.png?la=en&amp;hash=C3BD906B1D9C407E549FA7D193D74574" target="_blank"><img alt="Chart 1: Treasury centre operating models" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2016-09-10-tta-08-tp-chart-01-treasury-centre-operating-models-967x373.png?la=en&amp;hash=C3BD906B1D9C407E549FA7D193D74574" width="967"/></a></p>
<p class="source"><em>Source: KPMG</em></p>
<p>Heralded as a ‘best of both worlds’ approach, hybrid centralised models typically involve individual subsidiaries following the treasury policy as outlined by group treasury, but given the responsibility for executing deals themselves via their local banking partners. Since the financial crisis, treasurers have been rethinking their approach to banking and funding and with an increasing number of banks withdrawing from once key markets, relying on just a few banks is no longer seen as a viable option.</p>
<p>This delivers more control while enabling subsidiaries to maintain a degree of autonomy within the front office function. It can also help to increase uniformity in treasury policies and procedures across the group and allows key decisions to be made at a global level with a comprehensive view of cash flow – whilst also retaining local expertise.</p>
<p>What you see with hybrid centralisation, Braspenning says, is that treasury can decide which parts it wants to outsource and what activities it wants to do locally. “For example, managing short-term cash using cash pools, whilst arranging long-term financing through an in-house bank (IHB).” In addition, keeping that local knowledge avoids an inevitable challenge of having all expertise at the centralised level. “Hybrid centralisation has already been around for a long time, but I think to a certain extent it has been rediscovered in Asia Pacific,” says Braspenning.</p>
<p>However, trying to identify specific tasks that will be given to subsidiaries is somewhat difficult, as it will depend on their individual set-up and consequently can vary massively from company to company. Whilst, for example, subsidiaries could be tasked with identifying exposures related to their line of business and requesting head office operations to execute hedges, in other companies the specialised business unit may also execute the hedges. Over time though, Davis says, “treasury has evolved from being purely an execution centre to one that’s driving a lot of decision making throughout the organisation” and it is this decision making treasury can use to drive forward a tailored set-up for the function.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-motivations">What are the motivations?</h3>
<p>Hybrid models can arguably be seen as “stepping stones to centralisation”, says Davis. “Going straight from decentralised to fully centralised can be a significant leap for certain organisations. In some cases, such models are very much that stop gap.” That isn’t to say that it is every organisation’s aim, however, to eventually move to a centralised structure. Some corporates like to keep a certain amount of control in the local businesses, so whilst there might be a group treasury helping them coordinate some activities, a lot of the on-the-ground decision making is still made within the local operation. “This links back to the culture of that particular organisation in terms of not wanting to give up authority within the local businesses,” says Davis.</p>
<p>His colleague, Oliver Hsieh, Director, Advisory, KPMG Singapore, concurs. “I wouldn’t say that a fully centralised treasury centre is the ultimate goal for every treasurer out there. Some companies’ businesses naturally go towards a regional treasury model, especially where they have major pricing centres or major trading areas.”</p>
<p>The tendency to stick to global treasury centres with decentralised treasury activities, Hsieh says, is often seen in Asian conglomerate companies that “like to have their fingers in a lot of different pies” – a result of which is that the group’s businesses have limited connections to one another, so to try and force a centralised or even a regional treasury model onto that company might not necessarily work.</p>
<p>What’s more, “in this day and age, corporates in multinationals or conglomerates can be conscious about having to sell off parts of businesses. To the extent that they would need certain assets to go with that specialised business, having a centralised treasury again may not actually work,” says Davis.</p>
<h3 id="location-push-and-pull-factors">Location push and pull factors</h3>
<p>Whatever may be the motivation, when either a regional treasury centre or specialised business unit is encountered, decisions need to be made regarding location. Again, this choice will largely depend on a company’s individual business model. A KPMG report, titled ‘The Structure, Role and Location of Financial Treasury Centres: A Process of Evolution’, cited the following consideration factors and the corresponding importance, as rated C-suite respondents representing MNCs from 12 industries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Banking factors (13.3%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax attractiveness (12.9%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business environment (9.7%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability of skills and talent (9.4%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government incentives (9.3%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency environment (9.1%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to capital markets (8%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Country credit ratings (7.4%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure and accessibility (7.2%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory and reporting requirements (7.2%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existence of other treasury centres (6.4%).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As Hsieh says: “It typically isn’t one single factor that tips the balance, but a combination of multiple factors in multiple jurisdictions that they are weighing up.” In sectors such as commodity energy trading, for example, tax effectiveness and governance incentives will be extremely important. Whereas, Hsieh continues, in electronics, the availability of talent and efficient infrastructure is likely to sway the balance.</p>
<p>Indeed, treasury centres are normally located in a tax-efficient environment, reducing the bill on transactions and profits associated with the entity. For example, between APAC’s top choice for corporates for establishing a regional treasury centre (Singapore or Hong Kong), Hong Kong has lagged behind Singapore largely because of its poorer tax incentive programme. Recent developments have looked to change this: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has new rules that tax payments on intercompany loans will no longer be larger than profit earned – thus bringing the territory’s incentive package more in line with Singapore’s Finance and Treasury Centre (FTC) award where qualifying corporates receive a concessionary tax rate of 8% on all fee income received from treasury activities and an exemption from withholding tax on interest payments.</p>
<p>But also of importance – and increasingly so – is the location’s possession of a wealth of financial services expertise and talented future employees. According to Braspenning, as the tax landscape continues to change – the OECD’s action plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), for example – it will, in fact, be “far more important to have capable people, in the right place, doing the right things”. This is a factor, he adds, that treasury can influence, as opposed to a changing tax environment.</p>
<h3 id="typified-by-diversity">Typified by diversity</h3>
<p>As has been explored, centralisation can take many forms; individual corporate objectives can be as varied as those pursing them. “Based on the corporate’s DNA, the right (re)balance between centralised and decentralised needs to be found,” says Braspenning. The days of understanding treasury centralisation as a project that has a finite end point are seemingly over. “Rather, the best idea is to see the change as multiple treasury evolutions because everyone will face different kinds of challenges, which need to be address in different ways.”</p></div>

</div></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>It is undeniable that since the global financial crisis the role of the corporate treasury function has grown beyond its original brief to become more closely aligned with the business and operate as a true, value adding strategic partner. It could be argued however, that the evolution of the function has not only been facilitated by market realities, but also due, in part, to the fact, that for many companies the laborious low value, high volume activities such as payments and collections are now completed in a SSC – leaving the treasury free to focus on more strategic matters.</p>
<p>Whilst a successful strategy, there is a quiet revolution occurring in a number of progressive companies which are realising that a SSC can follow the lead taken by the treasury and offer even greater value to the business. For these companies, the SSC is no longer a low cost, process-driven function, but a centre of excellence driving process change from within and, in some cases, fundamentally changing the way the financial supply chain operates.</p>
<p>When carefully considered, the elevated position of the SSC makes sense. The centre has an intimate and holistic understanding of some of the most vital financial functions in the business, accounting for numerous key performance indicators. Its management team has likely developed a vast amount of knowledge around process optimisation and the various technological innovations that can enable this. And, overall, it probably has already proven that it can contribute materially to the commercial success of the enterprise – it is time to recognise this.</p>
<p>The SSC is increasingly a board level conversation, and its leadership team is beginning to form the ‘holy trinity’ of financial strategy with the CFO and treasurer, working together to drive change and offer value to the rest of the organisation. And for those businesses wondering where to start, it may be prudent to look at one of the most tangible and compelling areas where the ‘trinity’ can add value: improving the collections process.</p>
<h3 id="a-centre-of-efficiency">A centre of efficiency</h3>
<p>Cash collection objectives are straightforward: namely to collect payments quickly and cost-effectively, and reconcile these promptly and accurately against outstanding invoices. But, whilst a simple concept, implementation is fraught with difficulties. In particular, the diversity of collection instruments, both within each country and across regions, especially where there is a heavy reliance on cash, cheques and other local documentary instruments. This creates fragmentation and hampers efforts to standardise, accelerate and reduce the cost of collection. It also places an increased burden on the sales team in the field which has to focus its efforts on collections, rather than its core function, selling. As companies look for competitive advantage, the often underestimated burden and associated opportunity costs can be significant.</p>
<p>It is here that the SSC and treasury can begin to work together in order to resolve these issues and seek more efficient, ideally electronic, payment methods, particularly those that improve the predictability of collections, such as direct debits and increasingly mobile wallets where these are supported, with the latter growing at startling rates. Both functions have something to offer to this process: the treasury can evaluate the various markets, and utilise its understanding of the regulatory environment and the various challenges the sales teams are facing; the SSC can use its intimate knowledge and analytics of the collections process to evaluate how the new proposed methods of collection will impact the operation and make a recommendation based on this. In theory, and with close cooperation, the views can be married together and the best solution can be obtained, leveraging digitisation efforts and process re-engineering to drive optimal processes that facilitate reconciliation efforts.</p>
<p>One of India’s leading direct to home (DTH) satellite service providers conducted a project similar to this in order to solve their growing collection challenges. In brief, sales teams were spending too long on collections, and traditional advance payment models limited the ability to set up innovative arrangements with channel partners.</p>
<p>To resolve this, the treasury and SSC worked with Standard Chartered to implement a national ACH (automated clearing house) model with an innovative e-collection platform for same day collections, and supported the roll-out countrywide. This accelerated the collections clearing cycle from two to three days to same-day settlement, and allowed new mandates to take effect within a week, from 21 days under the previous arrangements, with automated confirmation.</p>
<p>In this example of how the treasury and SSC can work with a banking partner to offer greater value to the business, not only was working capital improved, but sales teams needed to spend far less time on collection activities, with far greater control over these processes.</p>
<h3 id="a-centre-of-information">A centre of information</h3>
<p>A further area where a SSC can seek to add greater value to the overall enterprise’s collections process is through working with the treasury to push for, and implement solutions that provide rich and structured payment information. This is crucial because in today’s market environment, corporates of all sizes, and particularly those operating in emerging markets, are conscious of the risk of over-extending credit lines to customers in their sales networks. Most therefore monitor credit lines very tightly, and block new sales until collections have been posted to keep outstanding exposures under credit lines within acceptable levels. If a business does not have the ability to post collections promptly and accurately however, there can be a considerable impact on sales revenues and customer relationships.</p>
<h4 id="chart-1">Chart 1: SSC – stages of maturity</h4>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2016-03-04-tta-05-sf-chart-01-ssc-stages-of-maturity-967x454.png?la=en&amp;hash=EC2C1D425E88D40FD2CF2625B9C6DA45" target="_blank"><img alt="Chart 1: SSC – stages of maturity" height="454" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/treasury-models/2016-03-04-tta-05-sf-chart-01-ssc-stages-of-maturity-967x454.png?la=en&amp;hash=EC2C1D425E88D40FD2CF2625B9C6DA45" width="967"/></a></p>

<p>Incoming payments therefore need to be supported with sufficient structured information to identify the payee and the invoice(s) to which the amount relates. This in turn facilitates sophisticated rule-based solutions for prompt, accurate reconciliation and posting to customer accounts. However, in Asia, obtaining rich, consistent information on incoming flows to facilitate this is challenging because of disparate payment methods and diverse payment formats across clearing systems, currencies and banks. Remittance information is therefore held in different fields within a payment instruction or advice, is of varying length and quality, and there is a risk that this data may be truncated or lost during the exchange of payment information as it passes through different clearing systems and banks.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, a growing number of companies are implementing virtual accounts, where each customer is provided with a unique account number for remitting funds, enabling them to identify individual customers. In these instances the accounts receivable teams that sit within the SSC can perform accurate, automated matching of payments to customers. This ensures that when the solution is tied with an automatic reconciliation solution that extracts files from a customer’s ERP or accounts receivable system, reconciles open invoices with information captured from clearing systems using customised matching rules, before passing the reconciled invoices back to the accounts receivable ledger to update the customer accounts.</p>
<p>In doing this, the SSC has the ability to become the single source of truth within the company and to facilitate a clean line of communication to the credit teams regarding who can and cannot be extended further credit, thus potentially enabling further sales, fostering greater relationships with customers and perhaps giving the business a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this instance, aside from the strategic value that the SSC can add, it is also able to improve on its more traditional metrics as there can be a reduction of external accounts, more efficient, cost-effective processes, enhanced working capital and the ability to access working capital finance programmes for further working capital improvement.</p>
<h3 id="maximising-the-value-of-a-ssc">Maximising the value of a SSC</h3>
<p>By focusing on these two examples, the SSC, working in conjunction with the treasury department can go a long way towards adding value to the business. And today, thanks to the development of innovative technology, digitised optimal processes and solutions, this can be achieved more readily than ever before.</p>
<p>Building a SSC is a long-term strategic decision to support the business and deliver tangible value to the organisation.

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>It is no secret that, for many corporates, Asia represents a tremendous growth opportunity. Yet, the varying stages of development across the region and the complex regulatory landscape also represents a significant challenge for treasurers. Therefore, as European and US multinationals have grown their operations in the region they have often found it tough to manage cash remotely. To address this, many corporates have looked to centralise and establish a treasury centre in Asia in order to have a permanent treasury presence in the market and gain greater visibility and control over their cash flows.</p>
<p>Of course, centralisation doesn’t suit everyone, but if that is the path that the organisation wishes to follow, the next decision to be made is where to locate the treasury centre. Historically, for those operating in Asia, the choice has been between the region’s two key finance centres: Singapore and Hong Kong. The former was typically selected by those companies with a primary focus on South East Asia and the latter for those whose key presence was in North Asia, especially China. Today however, the choice is more complex as both the established and aspiring locations are locked in fierce competition to attract more treasury centres.</p>
<h3 id="key-considerations">Key considerations</h3>
<p>The decision-making process behind where to locate a treasury centre is multi-faceted, and all locations have positive and negative aspects, meaning that in many respects there is no correct answer. But there are some key considerations that must be taken into account when selecting a location. The first – and perhaps most important – is the overall strategic philosophy of the organisation: where are its key markets and where does it want to grow, for example? This initial assessment is likely to remove a number of locations where it wouldn’t make sense for the company to site the treasury centre, leaving a shortlist to be more deeply analysed.</p>
<p>The granular analysis of the shortlist should then focus on all the different factors that will have a significant impact on how the treasury operates and the advantages and disadvantages of basing the treasury centre in a particular location. A study recently conducted by EY asked over 300 corporates about their key considerations when selecting a location to establish a treasury centre.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the regulatory environment (including FX controls) was highlighted as the most important factor. The second consideration highlighted was the cost and availability of talent, followed by the tax environment, political stability and access to capital markets. Other factors that didn’t make the top five, but were still considered important, include the location’s legal system, banking costs and capabilities, operating costs and also the living environment.</p>
<p>So how do the various locations in the region compare?</p>
<h3 id="singapore">Singapore</h3>
<p>As well as being one of the world’s prominent financial centres, Singapore is also the region’s premier treasury centre location. “Its business-friendly environment, deep and well-educated talent pool and best-in-class infrastructure have made it the regional hub for the majority of Western multinationals,” says Victor Penna, Head of Treasury Solutions, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered. “It has therefore made a lot of sense for organisations over the years to base their treasury centres in the city.”</p>
<p>Singapore benefits from a liberal regulatory environment, an excellent sovereign credit rating, a deep and liquid FX market and a legal system based on English common law. The city’s status as a financial centre also allows treasurers access to best-in-class banking services, with most, if not all of the major Western and Asian banks having significant operations in Singapore.</p>
<p>On top of this, Singapore offers corporates a strong incentive package to locate their treasury centres in the city in the shape of its Finance and Treasury Centre (FTC) award. The FTC offers qualifying corporates a concessionary tax rate of 10% on all fee income received from treasury activities and an exemption from withholding tax on interest payments. Further tax benefits can be gained through Singapore’s double tax treaty network, the most developed in Asia, reducing the withholding tax applied when carrying out functions such as intercompany lending and cash pooling.</p>
<p>The city-state is also considered a prime location for finding talent. Its history as a former British colony and its position as a regional hub for many multinationals means that it has developed a deep and well-educated English-speaking pool of talent. This is bolstered by talent from neighbouring countries across Asia, meaning that it is easy to find the language skills required to manage the diverse region. The city is also attractive when looking to bring in talent from overseas: “moving to Singapore is much easier than some other locations in Asia from a family perspective,” says Amit Sharma, Managing Director and Head of eCommerce and Channels, Asia Pacific at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). “Thanks to its strong international schooling system and best-in-class transportation links to the rest of Asia as well as key locations in Europe and the US.”</p>
<p>The overall strength of Singapore as a treasury centre location for global and Asian MNCs (ex China and Hong Kong) is underlined in EY’s study. For all but one of the key considerations for corporates when choosing a treasury centre location, Singapore ranked above its competitors. The only area it fell short was because of its high operating costs which is unsurprising given the city’s status as the world’s most expensive.</p>
<h3 id="hong-kong">Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong offers a similar proposition to Singapore. The territory has a business-friendly environment, and in 2015 was again ranked the ‘world’s freest economy’ – an accolade it has held for over a decade. The territory has a legal system based on English common law and a liberal and well-developed regulatory framework. It has a deep, well-educated, international talent pool and also, similar to Singapore, boasts a best-in-class transportation infrastructure that supplements its position in the geographical centre of Asia.</p>
<p>Its status as Asia’s other key financial centre means that corporates have access to a wide range of banking services, with 157 foreign and local licensed banks operating in the territory. Hong Kong is also the world’s largest offshore RMB centre and a key gateway into the international capital markets, making it a favourable location from which to raise capital.</p>
<p>“One area where Hong Kong has lagged behind Singapore is its tax regime which does not have as many double taxation agreements, nor extends concessions to companies with treasury centre activities,” says Sandip Patil, Managing Director, Asia Liquidity Head at Citi. The imbalance has meant that often the tax payment on intercompany loans are larger than any interest profit earned or acquired – a big consideration when establishing a treasury centre that will be making lots of these transactions. “The 2015/2016 budget has looked to remove this imbalance in taxation and encourage a corporation to operate a treasury centre in Hong Kong, bringing the territory’s incentive package in line with Singapore,” says Patil.</p>
<p>With such a similar environment to Singapore, Hong Kong has proved a popular treasury centre location, outside of mainland China, for Chinese multinationals that are expanding out across the world. As EY’s study highlights, Hong Kong was voted as the top location for seven out of ten key factors when selecting a location for a treasury centre by Chinese and Hong Kong MNCs.</p>
<p>“Companies that set up a treasury centre in Hong Kong, primarily do so because they have a significant presence in China,” says Standard Chartered’s Penna. It has been argued that unlike Singapore, where treasury centres have more of a regional focus, treasury centres in Hong Kong tend to be more China-centric and the market is set up as more of a gateway to China. In this respect, the territory’s biggest advantage may also be its biggest disadvantage when it comes to attracting a wider range of treasury centres that wish to cover the region as a whole.</p>
<p>This has however seen Hong Kong attract treasury centres from multinationals for whom China has become their key revenue driver in Asia. American multinational Johnson Controls is one such company that has moved from Singapore to Hong Kong. “When the company first moved into the region our key areas of growth were Australia and South East Asia,” says Marc Vandiepenbeeck, APAC Corporate Treasurer at Johnson Controls. “It therefore made sense to set up the treasury centre in Singapore.” However, as China began to be of material importance, and business weakened elsewhere, the company reconsidered its location. “Ideally we wanted to move to mainland China, but in 2006 the regulations were such that it wasn’t practical, so we decided to set up in Hong Kong as a gateway to China.”</p>
<h3 id="shanghai">Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shanghai and China more broadly, is now a very different proposition for corporate treasurers than it was in 2006. The rapid pace of deregulation and modernisation has changed the treasury landscape and made Shanghai a realistic contender for multinationals deciding where to establish a treasury centre.</p>
<p>Johnson Controls, for example, has recently announced plans to move its Asian treasury centre from Hong Kong to Shanghai. “The company is establishing a corporate headquarters in China that will have equal authority to the headquarters in the US. And while there are still challenges when it comes to operating a treasury centre in Shanghai, they are no longer significant enough for the function to be left behind in Hong Kong,” says Vandiepenbeeck.</p>
<p>Before analysing the challenges that corporates still face in Shanghai, what have been the positive steps that China has made? Deregulation, boosted by the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, and then rolled out nationwide has been at the heart of the changes. For example, corporates are now able to plug the country into a global cash management structure and move cash in and out of the country without much restriction – a must for any treasury centre.</p>
<p>“China is also taking other important steps,” says BofAML’s Sharma, “for example the authorities have digitised the execution of FX payments. While this may seem a small change, it highlights that the regulatory easing is continuing and China is committed to making it easier for both corporates and banks to operate.” China’s position of 90 in the World Bank’s Doing Business survey, does however highlight that there is still a long way to go before China is as business-friendly as Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Shanghai is set to change further over the coming years as the government aims to establish the city as a global financial centre by 2020. Currently, the banking landscape in China is dominated by the big five state owned banks, but over 412 foreign institutions have operations in the country. Forty one of these are locally incorporated, as a result of the sector opening up further in 2006, allowing these institutions to offer a wider range of products and services to corporate clients in China. This has been an important step, as Vandiepenbeeck explains: “historically in China, the banks have been able to support us domestically but not so much regionally, as the quality of personnel wasn’t there. This has now changed drastically as the big multinational banks have invested significantly in the country and have bankers that can support our operations across Asia Pacific.”</p>
<p>While the talent in the banking sector may now be at a high level in Shanghai, can the same be said for treasury? According to the EY study, the answer is not quite yet, when compared to Hong Kong and Singapore. “This is a key area for Shanghai to focus on,” says BofAML’s Sharma, “the city is growing as a treasury hub but to continue this momentum it needs to build the global talent pool and quickly.” For Sharma, this is a big task because of the ease of a family moving to Singapore and Hong Kong. “These locations have a large global expat community, English is a native language and there is a strong international school system, making them much more attractive locations for families.</p>
<p>Shanghai is also lagging in other areas. For example, it does not offer an incentive programme to match that offered by Singapore and Hong Kong. The infrastructure in Shanghai is also behind that of Singapore and Hong Kong, meaning that travelling in and out of the city can be a challenge. Also, the legal system may not be familiar to corporates outside of China, requiring experts in local legislation to be hired to resolve any legal issues.</p>
<p>So will Shanghai become the primary treasury centre location in Asia in the near future? For Standard Chartered’s Penna, this remains to be seen: “it will depend on how aggressively China continues to liberalise, how quickly Shanghai becomes a global financial centre and also how other regulation and incentives develop. Ultimately, if Shanghai can offer a proposition as good as, or close to, what Hong Kong offers, then those corporates with a critical mass in China may think that it makes sense to move their treasury centre to Shanghai, especially if they have already established their regional headquarters there.”</p>
<h3 id="greater-competition">Greater competition</h3>
<p>While Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai are leading the way in the race to become the region’s top treasury centre location, they are by no means the only ones. “Most countries in the region are analysing the value of positioning themselves as a treasury centre location. This is happening in India, Malaysia, Thailand and even Macau, and I suspect that these efforts will continue,” says Citi’s Patil.</p>
<p>Outside of the ‘big three,’ Malaysia is perhaps the location gaining the most ground, thanks to its Treasury Management Centre (TMC) incentive package that offers corporates a 70% tax exemption for five years on income arising from qualifying treasury services. Malaysia hopes that by offering this package, local corporates will be encouraged to build a treasury centre in Malaysia, and that this, in turn, will grow the talent pool to eventually attract multinationals.</p>
<p>Thailand is offering a similar proposition, although currently there are only a handful of treasury centres in the country. This is primarily because there are plenty of regulatory challenges that limit the functions that can be performed by the centre. For example, capital controls limit cross-border inter-company lending and there is limited liquidity locally in foreign currencies. Trapped cash is another major issue.</p>
<h3 id="the-long-view">The long view</h3>
<p>So can Thailand, Malaysia and other locations in the region truly ever compete with the ‘big three’? Citi’s Patil thinks it is unlikely any time soon: “I don’t think we will see a meaningful new centre in Asia yet because there is such a large gulf when you look at the key parameters between the established centres and the aspiring ones,” he says. “There will of course be some companies domiciled in these countries, or corporates from outside with critical mass in them that will base themselves there because it makes sense for the business. But if the company has operations across the whole region then the propositions are too strong from other locations.”</p>
<p>Despite this, increasing competition can only be a positive for corporates. After all, it is encouraging various countries to make themselves more welcoming to treasury operations, thereby reducing the complexity of running a treasury in the region.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h5 id="victor-penna-head-of-treasury-solutions-transaction-banking-standard-chartered">Victor Penna, Head of Treasury Solutions, Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered:</h5>
<p>There is perhaps, no such thing as a ‘best’ location for treasury centres in Asia as it really depends on each firm’s circumstances. A key consideration for many corporates is the location of their operations – the ideal is to co-locate the treasury with other regional business operations. Other considerations include access to a wide range of banking services, a pool of experienced treasury staff, infrastructure, cost, the legal system, regulations and taxation.</p>
<p>Singapore and Hong Kong remain the two most popular places, with Shanghai in third place. Hong Kong and Singapore tick most of the boxes and they appeal especially to US and European corporates who are looking to set up their regional treasury centres (RTCs) in Asia. Hong Kong in part leverages off its proximity to Mainland China and a business friendly environment. Singapore has strongly marketed itself as a specialist treasury services location for several decades now, and boasts a substantial range of tax treaties and incentives via its Finance and Treasury Centre (FTC) award that is likely to keep it at the top of the pile for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a growing location for treasury centres. It tends to attract international firms with most of their operations in China. Others operate a dual treasury-centre model with one centre in Shanghai covering China and another in Singapore covering the rest of Asia. Some of these ‘China-only’ treasury centres have evolved to cover Greater China or North Asia. Over the next decade the Chinese government is expected to take further steps to make China a more competitive location for regional and global treasury centres (GTCs) in line with the objective of Shanghai becoming a major international financial centre by 2020. Malaysia and Thailand have also introduced incentives to attract treasury centres. Another emerging trend involves Asian corporates setting up their GTCs in their home markets, subject to their government relaxing some of the regulations that would otherwise make this difficult.</p>
<h5 id="gourang-shah-head-of-treasury-advisory-treasury-and-transaction-services-asia-pacific-citi">Gourang Shah, Head of Treasury Advisory, Treasury and Transaction Services, Asia Pacific, Citi:</h5>
<p>The decision of where to set up a treasury centre is usually a tax-driven decision especially if that centre is also going to be a regional cash concentration location, although non-tax factors are also equally important. To facilitate efficient cash pooling and inter-company lending, treasury centres should ideally be located in low-tax jurisdictions, which offer benefits such as reduced or exempted withholding taxes on interest between treasury and other group entities.</p>
<p>Non-tax treasury centre location considerations include proximity to regional business management, financial costs (bank transaction fees, treasury staff salary, office rental), central bank and other regulatory reporting requirements, access to financial markets, degree of currency restrictions, availability of skilled employees, time-zone compatibility with respect to business operations under coverage, quality of physical and IT infrastructure, political stability, sophistication of banking system, and reputation of the location being a financial hub. By adding up weighted scores of the above tax and non-tax criteria, companies can identify the optimal country for treasury centre establishment.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Singapore are the two most popular locations in Asia for treasury centres. Other countries considered by Citi’s corporate clients are Malaysia and Thailand, both of which offer tax incentives with financial and commercial flow benefits.</p>
<h5 id="malaysia">Malaysia</h5>
<p>Companies that establish a RTC in Malaysia will benefit from income tax reduction and withholding tax exemption for five years. A broad double tax treaty network and relatively low cost environment also render Malaysia a treasury centre location of choice. Compared to Singapore and Hong Kong, however, Malaysia’s banking infrastructure is still at a developing phase, and there may be fewer tax and legal professionals with regional expertise.</p>
<h5 id="thailand">Thailand</h5>
<p>In 2010, the Thai government substantially improved incentives under the Regional Operating Headquarters (ROH) scheme. Foreign companies locating their ROH in Thailand can now enjoy a 15-year tax break on foreign-sourced income and tax concession on income earned in Thailand, although withholding tax on interest payment is not waived. However, Thailand shares similar issues with Malaysia on banking infrastructure and availability of tax and legal professionals, and the country also has fewer fluent English speakers than Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Despite the rise in open account trading, letters of credit remain a key tool in the trade finance arena, protecting both the importer and the exporter from counterparty risk. However, letters of credit are complex to prepare and are frequently rejected with documentary discrepancies in the first instance. A solution to this is to outsource the processes relating to letters of credit. In this Business Briefing we review the difficulties associated with letters of credit and discuss the benefits which an outsourcing solution can provide.</p>
<h3 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h3>
<p>Outsourcing is a common concept in business. On the simplest level, outsourcing means asking another company to undertake certain operations rather than carrying them out in-house. Companies may decide to outsource operations for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Economies of scale:</h5>
<p>The outsourcing provider can usually achieve economies of scale by carrying out services for a number of clients and may therefore be able to offer the services more cheaply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Skills:</h5>
<p>Existing staff may lack the skills and knowledge required to carry out the operations effectively. Outsourcing offers an alternative to training or recruitment as a means of filling this gap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Focus:</h5>
<p>Outsourcing non-essential activities may allow companies to focus their attention on more strategic areas of the business.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-can-be-outsourced">What can be outsourced?</h4>
<p>Activities that are outsourced are typically non-core activities. These range from technological solutions, which can be provided by ASPs on a rental basis rather than purchasing and implementing expensive systems in-house, to human resources departments.</p>
<p>In the treasury context, services which can be outsourced include risk management activities, cash management, accounting, netting systems and cash flow forecasting. Interestingly, another area which can be outsourced is the full range of activities relating to letters of credit (also known as documentary credits).</p>
<h3 id="letters-of-credit">Letters of credit</h3>
<p>The letter of credit is a method of payment which has been used in global trade for centuries to protect the interests of both the importer and the exporter. While letters of credit are less common than they used to be, due to the growth of trade on open account terms, letters of credit are still used in around 15% of world trade.</p>
<p>In a letter of credit transaction, the importer asks its bank to issue a letter of credit in favour of the exporter. The letter of credit is issued with a number of documentary conditions which must be met before the exporter can receive payment. Documents which must be presented by the importer vary from transaction to transaction, but typically include bills of lading, commercial invoices, insurance certificates and inspection certificates confirming the quality of the goods.</p>
<p>Once the importer’s bank has confirmed that the submitted documents meet the conditions of the letter of credit, payment is made or guaranteed by the bank of the importer. The importer is then able to collect the goods.</p>
<p>Letters of credit therefore offer both parties in a trade transaction a number of advantages. The importer is not obliged to pay for the goods until the specified conditions have been met, guarding against the delivery of faulty or incorrect goods. Meanwhile, the exporter is guaranteed payment as long as the conditions are met, which safeguards against the risk that the importer will claim the goods but fail to pay. In addition, exporters can use letters of credit to raise finance, while importers can build additional safeguards into the terms of the letter of credit by specifying delivery times and the level of quality required from the goods.</p>
<h3 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h3>
<p>Letters of credit provide clear advantages for the importer and the exporter. However, the process is also associated with significant obstacles.</p>

</figure>
<h4 id="rejected-documentation">Rejected documentation</h4>
<p>A large percentage of the documents submitted – estimated by some to be as high as 70% – fail to meet the required conditions. This may be for a number of reasons, including inconsistencies between documents, errors in the description of goods on the invoice or the late presentation of documents.</p>
<p>Once a letter of credit has been rejected, the process of recovering both payment and goods becomes more complicated. Documents can sometimes be amended to meet the requirements, but in practical terms it may not be possible to do this before the letter of credit has expired. Alternatively the importer may decide to pay despite the discrepancies, sacrificing the certainty that the goods are exactly what have been purchased. Another option is to give up the guarantee of payment by treating the transaction as a documentary collection – a far less attractive option for the exporter.</p>
<p>All of these solutions have disadvantages, meaning that the vast majority of letter of credit transactions are complicated, time consuming and potentially lacking in the security that they are designed to provide. Meanwhile, delays resulting from documentary discrepancies can be expensive as goods may have arrived at the destination port while the discrepancies are resolved, incurring storage fees and potentially becoming redundant in the case of seasonal goods.</p>
<h4 id="country-specific-requirements">Country-specific requirements</h4>
<p>In addition, certain countries have more complicated requirements relating to the administration of documentary credit business. This is particularly the case in Africa and the Middle East. For example, some countries require a consular invoice to be issued, which must be presented to the importing country’s consul for legalisation. In certain cases it is also necessary to provide a certificate of origin notarised by the local chamber of commerce. From the point of view of the corporate, particularly when trading with counterparties in a wide range of countries, complying with the different practices can be time consuming and takes focus away from the company’s core business.</p>
<h3 id="the-outsourcing-option">The outsourcing option</h3>
<p>As an alternative, some companies choose to outsource the processes relating to letters of credit. This is an option which is available to both the importer and exporter. In an outsourcing arrangement, the chosen bank takes over the processing of letters of credit either partially or completely.</p>
<p>The specific tasks which the bank may take over vary depending on the nature of the agreement but can include one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assistance with the preparation of tender conditions relating to payment processes and protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparation of sample letters of credit relevant to the client’s order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking incoming letters of credit for discrepancies in their terms and conditions and ensuring that the terms and conditions match those of the commercial contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertaking correspondence with foreign banks regarding amendments, additions or explanations of the terms and conditions of letters of credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring the expiry dates of letters of credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawing up, correcting and gathering together documents for letters of credit and collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtaining document certifications and legalisations for letters of credit and collections.</p>

<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Thomas Gössling" class="photo" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2007/06/2007-06-tt-12-bb-thomas-gossling-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>

<h5 class="title">Commercial Director</h5>
<img alt="ARI-Armaturen" class="logo org" height="21" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/ari-armaturen-logo-2007-120x21.png" width="120"/>
</div>
<p>ARI-Armaturen is a German engineering company based in Schloß Holte-Stukenbrock, near Bielefeld. The company – which is part of the Brechmann Group – develops and manufactures industrial valves used in building automation, shipbuilding, the chemical industry and other industrial processes. ARI-Armaturen sells its product range of industrial control, safety, check and shut-off valves to customers worldwide, in particular to Europe and Asia, but also to North and South America and Africa. The company employs over 600 people and posts a turnover of €100m.</p>
<p>ARI-Armaturen distributes the majority of its products through a worldwide network of distribution partners. In order to manage customer credit risk, the company typically takes out credit insurance for domestic and international transactions. If credit insurance is not – or only partly – available for a specific country and the deal size is significant, ARI-Armaturen will use documentary credits as a means of payment. This is, for example, the case with exports to Pakistan, India, China, Indonesia, Egypt or Iran.</p>
<p>Previously, the company employed a dedicated specialist to manage all documentary credit transactions. While it was beneficial to maintain this kind of expertise in-house, it also posed a number of problems according to Commercial Director Thomas Gössling:”With regard to the documentary credit business, only one person in-house had the necessary expertise, which presented us with the problem of sickness and holiday cover. Due to our increase in exports and a growing number of documentary credit transactions, we were faced with the question of how to maintain this specialist knowledge. We also needed to ensure that the information was kept up-to-date, considering the large number of different regulations in each country.”</p>
<p>Several financial institutions had matched these risk management concerns by offering documentary credit outsourcing services to the company. As Thomas Gössling explains, ARI-Armaturen considered outsourcing the documentary business for several reasons: “Firstly, we would no longer be dependent on maintaining these resources internally. Secondly, we would free up our sales team so they could sell, rather than spend their time drafting and processing documents, which is very time consuming and not part of our core business. The necessary level of expertise which must be maintained internally can also be provided more effectively by a third-party specialist.”</p>
<p>Gössling discussed documentary credit outsourcing with a number of banks. The company obtained several quotes and trialled the services offered. Eventually, ARI-Armaturen awarded the outsourcing contract to Commerzbank by choosing the bank’s ‘Value for Doc’ offering.</p>
<p>“Commerzbank is our main relationship bank for the international business and the bank has already processed letters of credit for us in the past”, says Gössling. “We were pleased with their service. In addition to the specialist knowledge and the existing good personal relationship, Commerzbank also compared favourably in terms of cost-effectiveness.”</p>
<p>The bank now manages all documentary business processes on behalf of ARI-Armaturen. With hindsight, Thomas Gössling concludes: “The existing cost advantages of outsourcing are difficult to measure, but there are clear benefits in the level of service provision and ultimately customer satisfaction. We are convinced that we have made the right decision. We would do it again and we would also do it again with Commerzbank.”</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, banks have increasingly collaborated with logistics providers to enable them to provide a wider range of trade services. These can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Logistics consulting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transport plans and transport cost calculation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export logistics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of spare parts and returns processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tracking and tracing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freight management and tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warehousing and distribution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies can therefore choose to outsource more than simply the processes relating to letters of credit.</p>
<p>The recent focus on supply chain management has meant that banks and suppliers are increasingly looking at ways of increasing efficiencies within the trade processes by considering these processes on a holistic level. The growing tendency of banks to provide logistical services is one way in which corporates can address efficiency within their financial and physical supply chains simultaneously.</p>
<h4 id="benefits-for-customers">Benefits for customers</h4>
<p>Corporates who outsource their documentary business using these type of value added services may expect to achieve cost savings in several areas. For example, depending on the terms of the agreement, the high staff and overhead costs of processing internally may be replaced with proportional costs relating to the number of transactions carried out. By outsourcing the processes surrounding letters of credit, the company will only need to pay for the exact services used.</p>
<p>Cost savings can also be achieved as a result of the reduced resources needed to manage letters of credit compared to carrying these processes out in-house. As well as cost savings this can enable companies to focus on their core competencies.</p>
<p>A higher level of reliability and efficiency is another benefit which is associated with outsourced letter of credit processes. Services such as checking documentation for discrepancies can ensure that the letter of credit will not be rejected as a result of such discrepancies, reducing the instances where payments are delayed or cancelled. As a result, it is easier to forecast the company’s cash flows relating to these transactions, which optimises the company’s ability to manage interest and liquidity. This can also result in cost savings as discrepancy fees and additional costs relating to the delayed delivery of goods can be avoided.</p>
<p>Outsourcing the processes relating to letters of credit can therefore remove many of the obstacles associated with this trading instrument while allowing corporates to retain the key benefits. In other words, importers can ensure that the goods they are purchasing meet their requirements before payment is made, while exporters are protected from the risk of non-payment.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With up to 70% of letters of credit rejected in the first instance, the delays, complications and costs associated with this trading instrument are significant. As a result, global trade has moved away from letters of credit in recent years, favouring open account terms instead. However, the security associated with letters of credit means that this is still a key payment method in many markets.</p>
<p>Outsourcing the processes associated with letters of credit can provide a solution to many of the drawbacks associated with letters of credit. Meanwhile, the provision of additional value-added services in the area of logistics can provide corporates with a broader type of solution and enable them to address their supply chain efficiencies more comprehensively.</p>
