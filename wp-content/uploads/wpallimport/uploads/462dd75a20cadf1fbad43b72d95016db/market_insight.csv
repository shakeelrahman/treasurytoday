<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Following on from this, it is strange that further ECB rate hikes are being considered. If the European economy enters a recession, inflation will come under downward pressure as demand cools and unemployment will increase. This will curb further increases in wage growth while it will encourage more savings and put extra downward pressure on asset prices. In this case, further rate hikes will only deepen the recession. Of course, this has the advantage that inflation will decline faster, but a very high economic price will have to be paid for this. Certainly with the towering debts in the background.</p>
<p>However, there are more factors involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Various developments suggest that the recession may well be brief and mild. In Europe, for example, fiscal stimulus is being rolled out and interest rates are far lower than inflation, suggesting that monetary policies are still loose. In addition, there is a great deal of pent-up demand as many corona measures have been lifted, and many companies want to cut production abroad due to geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, it looks as though inflation will decline fairly quickly at the end of this year or early next year. First of all, because comparisons will be made with far higher price levels before too long, but also because commodity prices could plummet in a recession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labour markets are tight in many European countries. As a result, there is a risk that unemployment will increase with a lag and that in the meantime additional wage increases will be evident, just as inflation starts to decline. In other words, purchasing power will recover quickly in this case, increasing the risk of a wage-price spiral.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of the above, it is quite possible that the recession will be too short and too mild to sufficiently reverse the inflationary mindset. Hence, a further deceleration via higher interest rates will likely be desirable, even though the European economy will shortly lapse into a recession of its own accord.</p>
<h4 id=""many-uncertain-factors"">Many uncertain factors</h4>
<p>Needless to say, the next question concerns the extent to which interest rates will have to be raised to achieve the desired goal. There are widely differing opinions on this, as the answer depends on all manner of developments that are very volatile:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Late August, Saudi Arabia announced that it wants to cut oil production as oil prices have come under downward pressure – mainly due to fears of an impending recession. If Riyadh follows through with this, oil prices are unlikely to decline significantly. In this case, inflation will decline less quickly and the recession will deepen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food supplies are highly dependent on the weather and on the amount of Ukrainian food shipments allowed by Russia. Both situations do not look particularly positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long will pent-up demand persist, considering that many corona measures have been lifted? And, speaking of corona, many medical experts expect a new corona wave by the autumn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wage development is another uncertain factor. The risk of a wage-price spiral exists, but if a recession starts/has already started and the labour market loosens, wage increases may well turn out to be far lower than currently assumed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Partly due to the aforementioned uncertainties, the Fed and ECB have abandoned forward guidance. Simultaneously, these uncertainties have clouded the outlook for both short-term and long-term interest rates.</p>
<h4 id=""the-longer-term-outlook-for-interest-rates"">The longer-term outlook for interest rates</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, we can make a few general remarks about the level of interest rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The pattern expected by the markets is basically very plausible: interest rates will initially be raised further, until the economy weakens to the point where inflation and wage increases come under distinct downward pressure. By then, the monetary reins can gradually be relaxed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We fear that the recession will have to be fairly deep and, above all, fairly long to keep a lid on wage growth and inflation. Central banks are unlikely to allow a recession to be deep due to the risk of a credit crisis given the very high debt levels. We therefore believe that they will open the money tap and lower their rates too soon. They prefer higher inflation to the risk of a credit crunch. Hence, inflation is unlikely to be depressed below 2%. It is more likely to keep hovering at 3%-4%, after which it will gradually rise again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest rates are currently very low compared to nominal economic growth. This is understandable because real growth is very low, if not negative, because of exceedingly high inflation. Combined with the aforementioned positive factors for growth and the preference of central banks to avoid a deep recession, this could mean that the recession could be mild – as mentioned before – and that the labour market will not loosen much. In this case, central banks will have to raise interest rates more than the markets price in in the coming years to prevent a gradual rise in inflation translating into a wage-price spiral.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we combine these points, we expect the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Over the next two quarters, we expect the Fed and the ECB to continue raising rates at a rapid pace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the ensuing course of next year, we expect central banks to stop hiking rates and possibly cut rates in case the risk of a deep recession and credit crisis becomes too big.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the even longer-term, this could lead to far higher interest rates than currently assumed, as by that time, interest rates will likely rise more due to excessively high and rising inflation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>America has been on the central bank’s drip for years. This has kept the economy going, and in particular the asset markets: shares, property, cryptos, etc soared to exceedingly high levels. The economy was manipulated in such a way that Wall Street and Main Street ended up increasingly detached from each other. As Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar phrased it: “Since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, policymakers from both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, have been able to shift the tough process of what we might call guns and butter decisions.”</p>
<p>For the Fed – with its dual mandate of keeping inflation in check and maintaining employment levels – it was relatively easy to keep the party going due to decades of structural downward forces on inflation. However, supply side problems – caused by corona and subsequently by the Ukraine war – threw a spanner in the works; it was no longer possible to have it both ways: holding inflation low and, at the same time, being able to keep pumping dollars into the economy.</p>
<p>Many experts have long been warning about the risks of the imbalance between the real and the financial economy with, among other factors, sky-high stock valuations, lagging productivity, enormous debt piles, skewed rises in income and relatively low growth. Additional effects included work being far less profitable than investment, and companies sometimes making more money playing asset manager than manufacturing products or providing services that actually form the core of the business. In 2017, the Wall Street Journal was already joking that Harvard is a hedge fund that happens to have a university.</p>
<p>This model has entered the danger zone because inflation has risen rapidly. The Fed will have to turn the music down, limit alcohol sales and remove the garlands because the party has come to an end. Central banks – and not just the Fed – have long almost begged policymakers to jump through the window of opportunity for structural reforms afforded by monetary policy in order to make economies more resilient and productive, but these pleas have generally fallen on deaf ears. With inflation rampant, there is little that the Fed can do to keep the US economy running (in a sustainable manner); it is up to policymakers to rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s top priority is taming inflation. Exploding petrol prices in particular have been a thorn in the side of the White House. Record prices have been on the front pages all the time and have increased the already high likelihood of the Democrats being crushed in the midterm elections in November. Unfortunately for Biden and his party, there are few adequate tools available to rein in prices at the pump without unpleasant side effects. For example, waiving the excise duty on petrol and diesel makes for a nice PR moment, but such a measure offers temporary relief at best – if at all – and it entails drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A reduction in the price will boost demand for a product that is already very scarce.</p></li>
<li>
<p>A reduction in excise duty is a very generic tool in the sense that it is the biggest fuel consumers who benefit the most. These are usually people who are generally already well off and do not necessarily need the reductions.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The excise duties on fuel are used to fill an infrastructure fund. American roads are definitely not the best, so they could use every extra dollar for improvement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other measures to lower fuel prices or to prevent further increases are also not ideal. For example, a form of export controls would further exacerbate already existing fears of a new era of protectionism. If it were to trigger a chain reaction, it could prove to be counterproductive.</p>
<p>The administration has also been considering other options to alleviate financial burdens on households. For example, by lowering tariffs on Chinese imports. However, even economists within the administration believe it might only shave a quarter of a percentage point off inflation. Moreover, such a decision would come at a sensitive time, with escalating tensions between the US and China in several important areas.</p>
<p>Biden has limited scope to pass major measures to boost the economy and/or curb inflation. His Build Back Better plans have largely floundered, and little can be done for the housing market in the period ahead. The political clout is likely to diminish further following the midterms in November. Everything points to defeat for the Democrats, which will severely restrict Biden’s scope for manoeuvring during the second part of his term.</p>
<p>In addition, Trump is still considering stepping back into the ring in 2024. His first round in the political arena did not result in a self-inflicted knockout for America but as Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said during the Capitol storming hearings: “The system held, but barely.”</p>
<p>The most striking aspect so far, is that very few Republicans openly abandon Trump (and those who do have often become pariahs within their own party). This is not even that surprising, as a very large proportion of Republican voters still believe Biden stole the election. Moreover, the Trumpists are doing quite well so far in the run-up to the midterms.</p>
<p>All this points to an uncertain political climate in the coming years, in which economic reforms are likely to be very slow in getting off the ground, and in which American democracy will come under even more pressure. Already, the US has been a flawed democracy for more than half a decade on the Democracy Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Last year, the US achieved the lowest score since the first publication in 2006.</p>
<p>The above led us to the following expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The previously quoted Foroohar recently said: “The Fed can’t do what policymakers can do, it can’t change the story on Main Street. It can’t build a new factory. It can’t re-skill all of us to do better jobs that are higher up the food chain.” However, policymakers also fail here. This points to persistent low growth, if not a recession.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The likelihood of a fiscal stimulus package seems low. First of all, there is broad consensus that the last major package has contributed to the current excessively high inflation. Secondly, Republicans will not allow Biden a victory in the run-up to the midterms. And thirdly, debts are soaring, and it will prove increasingly hard to sustain them as interest rates rise to higher levels.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The strong dollar will now be regarded mainly as something positive, as it depresses inflation because imports are cheaper. This is why we do not expect any attempts to devalue the dollar. But keep in mind, this inflation-depressing impact of the strong dollar is relatively low, as imports expressed as a percentage of US GDP only amount to 13%.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Two-thirds of Americans own their own home and the percentage of Americans owning shares and other assets has increased tremendously. The Fed, and especially politicians, will be very wary of pulling the tablecloth from under the crockery of this vast number of voters. This is why we certainly do not rule out that the central bank, the White House and Congress will still pull out all the stops if the stock and/or housing markets decline considerably (further). However, this will only make the foundations of the US economy more brittle, and one day things will have to get back into balance. The decoupling of the real economy and financial markets will undergo a correction at some point. To quote Faroohar one last time: “Once Main Street starts to meet Wall Street, you’re going to get that asset price correction. It’s going to be painful.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Financial markets are faced with many uncertainties because of the Ukraine war, geopolitical tensions, higher inflation and deteriorating growth prospects. Here are a few possible scenarios.</em></p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not gone to plan and the country is also labouring under unprecedented economic sanctions. Western governments continue to supply the Ukrainian army with weapons, making things progressively difficult for the Russian army – add to that the fact that the Ukrainians have far more motivation to fight. Hence Russia will only be able to seize a limited part of Ukraine. At the same time, the Ukrainian army will ultimately prove too small to defeat the Russian army.</p>
<p>We draw two conclusions from this:</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine is likely to become a protracted conflict – perhaps occasionally interrupted by a temporary ceasefire – with Moscow attacks targeting civilian casualties as has very often happened in Russia’s recent wars.</p>
<p>The West will lend increasing support to Ukraine, while Russian propaganda against the West will intensify accordingly. This could lead to Moscow taking an increasingly aggressive military stance against the West with the view that the more the West is provoked in this way, the better. Indeed, any military action by the West will be framed as an attack on Russia. Moscow will increasingly need this, because developments in the Ukraine war remain disappointing for Russia so far.</p>

<h4 id=""expensive-bloc-formation"">Expensive bloc formation</h4>
<p>It remains to be seen what economic consequences this will have:</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine will yield too few victories for the Russian rulers meaning that the democratic West will therefore be increasingly portrayed as a major enemy. Consequently, defence spending in the West will have to be ramped up considerably for many years to come.</p>
<p>It would be irresponsible if the West remained highly dependent on imports of Russian commodities. Alternative sources will have to be tapped for this. This will also cost vast amounts of money.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that China will head in the same direction as Russia, which could reverse the economic intertwining between China and the West to a certain extent as more Western companies will opt to bring production closer to home – rather than manufacture in China. The result is that the world will be increasingly divided into two blocs – one around the US and one around China, with limited trade between the two blocs. In this case, the West will lose many of its inexpensive production facilities, resulting in more expensive imports and products.</p>
<p>The fight against climate change is another major factor. Governments need to play a key role, costing large amounts of money.</p>
<p>In summary, for the time being, we expect a climate of massive violence stemming from the war, increasingly far-reaching sanctions from the West and persistently high commodity prices (or at least commodity prices that will be considerably higher than they would otherwise have been – they could fall back in the event of declining economic growth). At the same time, we expect persistently high public deficits.</p>
<h4 id=""a-shift-in-monetary-policy"">A shift in monetary policy</h4>
<p>This brings us to the next point. As long as inflation stayed low, central banks were able to buy vast amounts of bonds with surplus money created for this purpose. However, inflation has since risen to high levels, which is why this can no longer be done without losing the confidence of bond investors. Central banks will therefore have to terminate this policy.</p>
<p>This policy has been pursued for many years, and this has resulted in enormous amounts of surplus money. This money has stayed with the banks or assets have been bought with it (shares, bonds, property to name a few). This money could still end up in the real economy, certainly if inflation and public deficits stay high. In order to retain the confidence of the bond market, it will be necessary to remove a large proportion of this surplus money from the system – by having the central bank sell the previously purchased bonds and/or by not replacing expiring bonds with new ones.</p>
<p>In short, the supply/demand ratio for bonds and money creation by central banks will change drastically. Rather than buying bonds, central banks will sell them and rather than creating money, they will extract money from the system. This will result in additional upward pressure on interest rates – especially on long-term interest rates if public deficits stay high.</p>
<h4 id=""a-reservoir-of-negative-forces"">A reservoir of negative forces</h4>
<p>Recent US economic data has been fairly strong. This is probably due to large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus schemes that were implemented in response to the corona crisis. However, forces that have a negative impact on economic growth are becoming stronger (incidentally, Europe has had weaker data for some time):</p>
<p>Elsewhere expect a loss of consumer purchasing power and a decline in confidence in the future due to the Ukraine war and high inflation.</p>
<p>The Fed has to hit the monetary brakes. The American political situation is increasingly moving towards a fiscal policy where deficits will not be raised any time soon. This will therefore not support economic growth to any great extent. Most inventories are back to normal, and more stockpiling is unlikely to significantly boost economic growth.</p>

<p>Consumers are unlikely to borrow more in the current uncertain situation. We see more and more stagnation in global trade due to ever-increasing sanctions against Russia and mounting problems for many emerging markets. We fear that all this will culminate in US economic growth falling back to around 1% before long, while economic growth in Europe will be on the brink of recession. In this light, we expect the following:</p>
<p>Long-term interest rates are likely to consolidate before too long (we expect this to be a temporary decline in the context of a long-term uptrend in interest rates). We will see a shift in the expectation that central banks will quickly raise their rates and switch from buying bonds to selling bonds. This will still happen, but to a lesser extent and more gradually than is generally expected at this point. Commodity prices will consolidate, and they could even decline after a while. Share prices will come under more downward pressure.</p>
<p>We still expect central banks to intervene as soon as the economy threatens to lapse into a recession. Once inflation clearly falls back as a result of this, central banks will hit the monetary gas again. Public deficits might also be raised in this case hitting the fight against inflation.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It is generally assumed that globalisation leads to more international cooperation and stability. This was also the assumption – certainly vis-à-vis the outside world – that underpinned the foreign agenda of leaders such as Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, who propagated free trade and open markets as the road to peace and prosperity. Although this causal relationship is nowhere near as strong as it seems and as many politicians want to suggest, globalisation is certainly able to contribute to a better international political climate in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Great powers generally opt for a different approach depending on whether they operate in a globalised or in a deglobalised world. Even when globalisation is rampant, great powers will not shun rivalry. However, they will be more inclined to use soft power instruments and they will be less likely to adopt a tough approach. If states are embedded in a world characterised by deglobalisation, there will be fewer brakes on their actions and they are more likely to escalate affairs via hard power – leading to war in extreme cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the liberal US-led world order, China and Russia regularly chose to conform to this order in the 1990s and beyond – in the sense that they implemented economic reforms and made many political concessions in order to reap the benefits from being embedded in the global economy. For example, in 1994 Russia agreed to the Budapest Memorandum (which was basically intended to prevent Russian interference in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine) and Moscow reluctantly agreed to NATO expansion in Eastern Europe. China increasingly opened up its economy at the time and even became a member of the WTO, in spite of its conflicts with the West that might have knocked China off its globalisation course. Importantly, it was not just globalisation that made China and Russia back off so as to be able to profit economically. Indeed, the US, as the biggest advocate of that globalised, liberal world order, seemed virtually untouchable. Others therefore had little choice but to partly dance to the tune of Washington in order to participate in this world order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any event, the most plausible conclusion is that globalisation largely resulted from geopolitical stability in the post-Cold War era. Globalisation seems to require (more) cooperation between countries, whereby globalisation may subsequently solidify this cooperation and trigger some sort of positive spiral that leads to more prosperity and stability. But this is certainly not a law set in stone. Just as globalisation is not the cause of improved relations between great powers, so too is deglobalisation not the driver of deteriorating geopolitical relations.</p>
<p>As Professor of International Relations Norrin M Ripsman wrote in International Affairs: “The liberal economic order…appears to be a casualty, rather than a catalyst, of broader political and geostrategic changes such as waning US hegemony, nationalist demands for protection and the emergence of populist leaders less committed to the liberal agenda.”</p>
<p>If deglobalisation mainly results from a deteriorating geopolitical climate – rather than triggering such a climate – then this does not bode well for global trade, international capital flows and other forms of globalisation.</p>
<p>At any rate, there have been consistent attempts in recent decades to downplay the importance of geopolitics and hard power. Violence was thought to have increasingly less impact as a means of power, because the world was said to be/is dominated by capital flows, trade and the internet, among other factors. Just before the Russian invasion, we heard a renowned foreign affairs commentator claim that “war with conventional weapons is hopelessly old-fashioned.” Obviously, this was/is naive.</p>
<p>The world has known four regimes in the last century, each of which has killed over ten million people: the Soviet Union from 1917-1987 (62 million), the Communist Party of China from 1949-1987 (35 million), the Nazis (21 million) and the Chinese nationalists between 1928 and 1949 (ten million). After the Second World War, 1.5-2 million Germans, among others, were murdered in and around Poland, and there were the atrocities in Rwanda and Cambodia, among other places. In short, in the words of Dutch writer Arnon Grunberg: “Excessive violence has been a constant in human history. The idea that we have reached the pinnacle of the civilisation process and left the aggressive impulse behind us has always proved haughty.”</p>
<p>Humankind has fairly regularly fought large-scale wars since its origin and will continue to do so in all likelihood. Certainly as long as the world remains divided between democratic and autocratic political systems.</p>
<p>These autocracies persist for a long time and, according to some analysts, are even prevailing. In light of Russia’s current actions, an essay by Anne Applebaum published several months ago in The Atlantic is particularly topical. It is certainly possible to critique the article, but Applebaum makes many striking observations that we should keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Autocracies are not run by a single bad guy, but by networks of kleptocratic financial structures, security services (military, police, militias and surveillance) and professional propaganda channels. These authoritarian networks are often linked to similar networks in other dictatorships, but are also – actively and passively – supported by numerous players in the democratic world (lawyers, trust offices, banks, etcetera).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These autocratic networks do not operate as a bloc or alliance (as, for example, during the Cold War or during the Second World War), but as a loose association based on deals rather than ideals; Applebaum speaks of Autocracy Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an autocrat, you do not usually have to resort to mass incarceration, abuse and/or murdering of opponents. It will suffice to pick a few prominent figures and crack down on them. The rest will largely keep quiet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lessons of 1989 and the Arab Spring were not lost on autocrats: democratic revolutions can be extremely contagious. This is why Putin was so shocked by the revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan about a decade and a half ago, and why he brutally crushed protests in his own country in the ensuing years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putin – as well as other authoritarian leaders, such as Lukashenko and Assad – is convinced that a regime change in his country will irrevocably lead to his imprisonment, exile or death. This means that there are barely any limits on what Putin and associates are willing to do to stay in power.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ukraine war will accelerate and deepen the trend of deglobalisation and bloc formation, which we have often touched upon in several of our reports. The corona pandemic had already made countries very aware of their reliance on international supply lines, and the current geopolitical instability is compounding this to a considerable extent. To an increasing extent, companies will move production closer to home, increasingly locating production sites and supply companies in countries with more stable political structures and choosing security of supply over the cheapest options. More broadly, it is quite likely that we will see more and more bloc formation with America as the centre of one bloc and China as leader of the other bloc. This will exert structural upward pressure on inflation, as production costs will rise.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Low growth and excessively low inflation were particular problems for central banks following the outbreak of the 2008 debt crisis. The debt crisis was solved by vast amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus and hence even more debt accumulation. However, the combination of low growth and very low inflation makes it difficult to sustain the high debt burden – certainly when low inflation shifts to deflation. The combination of low growth, deflation and massive debt is disastrous for an economy. In order to steer clear of this, central banks sought to create a buffer of high inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation has now risen considerably compared to recent years. In addition, economic growth has been fairly high of late – both in Europe and the US. A positive growth rate is required as the high debt/GDP ratios mean a recession could easily trigger a credit crunch.</p>
<p>It is striking that newspaper articles generally only mention rate hikes as a means to combat inflation. However, it is economic weakening that depresses inflation – rather than higher interest rates. In other words, it is about raising (real) interest rates until economic growth falls back considerably. However, central banks are currently wary of hitting the monetary brakes too hard due to the risk of another credit crunch.</p>
<p>But what if interest rates are not raised, or only to a limited extent? Under normal circumstances, long-term interest rates are approximately at the level of nominal economic growth. There is no doubt that the soaring debt levels ensure that the economy is slowed down at a lower rate of interest than before. US growth, for example, is currently around 4%, while inflation is at around 6%. Normally, long-term interest rates would be around 10% in this case. At this point, however, ten-year interest rates are around 1.5%. This is an ultra-low (negative) level of real interest rates – to the extent where it is bound to stimulate the economy considerably, in spite of the soaring debts. It is therefore quite likely that growth will stay high, and that inflation will rise to higher levels. This may cause bond yields to rise ever more rapidly over time, which is unsustainable in combination with the aforementioned debt piles.</p>
<p>Changes in (real) interest rates affect economic growth with a delay of two to three quarters, while inflation is impacted after four to five quarters. This is very unfavourable in the current situation, as many economists expect inflation to decline in the period ahead. The upward inflationary pressure is largely due to corona and corona measures. The corona crisis has disrupted all manner of supply routes and created bottlenecks in production and in the labour market. However, the expectation is that the spread of corona will be curbed fairly effectively in the coming year, as a result of which the forces that are currently driving inflation will diminish in strength if not disappear. Even if this expectation comes true, however, it may well be that wage increases have ended up at far higher levels before then. This could easily trigger a wage-price spiral in a climate with ultra-loose monetary policies and exceedingly high public deficits. This will result in rising rather than declining inflation. If such a wage-price spiral is regarded as a likely risk, interest rates should be raised as soon as possible. Raising interest rates at this point in time entails the risk that the current very high inflation rate might shift to deflation after four to six quarters.</p>

<h4 id=""a-warning-signal-from-the-markets"">A warning signal from the markets</h4>
<p>Central banks will therefore have to manoeuvre very carefully. If they keep interest rates too low, growth and inflation will stay high, with a wage-price spiral becoming far more likely. If, on the other hand, they raise interest rates too much, this could trigger another credit crunch after 12 to 18 months, from which it would be even more difficult to escape compared to the 2008-2009 period – as debts have since risen to far higher levels, and there is far less scope for monetary and fiscal stimulus at this point.</p>
<p>There is another complication. The US has the highest inflation risk at this point. This is clearly less the case in Japan and Europe (for the time being). This means that the Fed will have to be the first central bank to raise its rates – in a climate in which the ECB and the Bank of Japan are keeping their interest rates very low and are still creating vast amounts of surplus money. In this case, a US rate hike would attract a great deal of overseas capital, keeping asset prices high and long-term interest rates low. This means that US interest rates would have to rise considerably in order to prevent the inflow of foreign capital from counteracting the domestic economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Looking at various market signals in mid-December, investors do not seem overly concerned about a further rise in inflation. Gold prices are trading sideways, inflation expectations derived from the TIPS market have declined lately while investors are pricing in a mere two percentage points rate hike in the incoming two years. We draw the following conclusions from these market movements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The markets believe that inflation will fall back considerably – even before a wage-price spiral is able to gain momentum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The markets believe that a modest rate hike of roughly two percentage points will be enough to keep inflation low. Hence, short-term interest rates have risen of late, while long-term interest rates have declined.</p>

</ul>
<p>We could also regard the above as a major warning for the Fed: the Fed should definitely not hit the monetary brakes hard, as this would be overdoing it, making a new credit crunch far more likely. What should the Fed do with this warning? What if the markets underestimate the amount of foreign capital flowing into the US in the event of higher interest rates? Or what if the Omicron variant is so dangerous that, for the time being, the supply side of the economy will continue to be hit more than the demand side?</p>
<h4 id=""a-complex-roadmap"">A complex roadmap</h4>
<p>Central banks have the challenge of mapping out policies in this uncertain situation. They will postpone the decision to increase interest rates as far as possible. However, this does not mean that they will mark time. For example, the major central banks are scaling back their bond purchases or will do this soon. This policy is far less aggressive compared to rate hikes.</p>
<p>At any rate, central banks are convinced that, in the current circumstances, deflation is disastrous for the economy. This cannot be said of inflation, especially if it does not permanently exceed 5%. It goes without saying that, when mapping out monetary policies, central banks would rather risk excessively high inflation than accept deflation.</p>
<p>This has important consequences for the financial markets. If, for the time being, central banks – and the Fed in particular – stayed behind the curve with regard to inflation, monetary policies would not be really tight. This would be favourable for share prices and gold prices. In addition, short-term interest rates would not rise considerably and real interest rates would stay very negative, while long-term interest rates would come under upward pressure. If, on the other hand, central banks were to crack down on higher inflation, exactly the opposite movements would likely be evident.</p>


",It is clear by now that inflation in Europe and the US has risen longer and further than originally expected. The major question is therefore how the central banks should respond to this. But first a few facts.,https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/2022-01-02-tt-11-mv__when-going-always-look-down-1115122199__1920x1080.jpg,2022-01-01,Market Insight,False

<p>The economic outlook holds real reasons to be optimistic. Economies are recovering from the pandemic and inflation and rising interest rates are a sign of economic growth and the return to more normal economic conditions.</p>
<p>Inflation is likely to spike further, but it is also likely to be transient, particularly since one of the main contributors to current inflation levels is high energy prices. They account for between 1.5% – 2% of the inflation rise but are forecast to fall back, says Stewart Robertson, Senior Economist for UK and Europe at Aviva Investors. Although inflation brings challenges, it is also indicative of our journey back to more normal economic conditions.</p>
<p>Supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation and are front of mind for many corporate treasury teams. But pressures in the supply chain should ease as supply begins to catch up with demand. Freight rates already look like they have peaked, and the global chip shortage is starting to ease. “It is a good news story and governments are right to think about withdrawing the policy stimulus,” says Robertson.</p>
<p>A rise in interest rates makes sense given the stronger economic outlook. “If we are optimistic, why do we need emergency policy settings anymore?” he says. Moreover, markets are anticipating policy change, indicative in the yield curve moving to reflect interest rate rises ahead and the sterling curve now pricing in 1% for base rates next year.</p>
<p>The recent sell off in the bond market is also reflective of a growing awareness that rates are going to rise. One of the reasons equity markets have not sold off is – in keeping with a more optimistic view – economic growth ahead. Expect corporate bonds with weaker balance sheets to suffer most and “old world” corporate bonds in sectors like tobacco or oil to underperform, says Richard Hallett, Head of Liquidity Portfolio Management at Aviva.</p>
<p>Rather than viewing the prospect of monetary tightening with concern, corporate treasury teams should see higher interest rates as a reflection of things getting better. Although policy rates will climb over the next few years, they will do so in an orderly fashion and are unlikely to be as high as they have been in the past. “We need to get used to a slow journey to tighter monetary policy,” says Stewart.</p>
<h3 id=""liquidity"">Liquidity</h3>
<p>The positive macro backdrop suggests treasury teams might finally be able to tap better returns on their cash holdings. Corporates are beginning to take advantage of more return seeking strategies and taking on a little more risk; tying up cash for longer and taking some credit risk gets better returns than six months ago, notices Hallett. He also notes a spike in demand for segregated mandates as companies with large amounts of cash on hand seek better returns than a traditional liquidity fund via a bespoke mandate.</p>
<p>Treasury teams can tap different strategies to position their cash portfolios for the rise in base rates. For example, corporates can reduce duration strategies and buy shorter dated products or floating rate products, balanced perhaps by fixed rates in the longer term. “Treasury teams are finally getting paid something for their investment,” says Hallett.</p>
<p>Going forward he advises treasury to focus on new restrictions in MMFs bringing both benefits and challenges. ESG integration in short term liquidity funds will also become more of a priority. “We are going to see more liquidity funds have to demonstrate they have green policies and are embracing the ESG ethos,” he concludes.</p>

<p><em>Many major central banks changed their targets not long ago. To make sure central banks don’t tighten monetary policy too early, monetary policy will be tightened only when actual inflation will exceed the target of 2% for some time. In addition, the Fed wants to stimulate growth to the extent where the labour market tightens and wage increases end up at distinctly higher levels. Hopefully this will reduce inequality.</em></p>
<p>Globalisation has created a massive divide in the West. Those who are directly or indirectly affected by competition from low-wage countries – most notably China and the rest of Asia – have experienced a stagnation in real wage growth for many years. The introduction of new technology generally has the same effect.</p>
<p>By contrast, those who facilitate globalisation, or those who are not faced with competition from low-wage countries, have enjoyed significant gains in real disposable income. In addition, this group generally owns shares and/or property, and, thanks to a very loose monetary policy, prices of these assets have been going up for many years.</p>
<p>This has resulted in a growing divide. Many central banks in the West regard this as a very precarious situation. Indeed, people who are well off mainly vote for the centrist parties, while those who lag behind generally vote for extreme and radical parties on the left and right side of the political spectrum. This forces the moderate parties to shift in this direction, as otherwise they would lose too many votes.</p>
<p>Research shows that higher wage growth mainly benefits employees whose real disposable income has been stagnating for a long period of time and this suggests higher wage growth is one of the most attractive strategies to reduce inequalities. This is why central banks want wage increases and inflation to be at excessively high levels, before they hit the monetary brakes in earnest. Until then, the economy should continue to receive stimulus.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Refinitiv Datastream/ECR Research</em></p>
<h4 id=""message-from-the-markets"">Message from the markets</h4>
<p>The question is whether central banks have the courage to crack down on excessively high inflation. This question is particularly important at the present time, as both inflation and wage increases are under upward pressure, while monetary conditions are still more or less the same as during the low point of the corona crisis. Monetary policy may therefore well be too loose for the current circumstances, as a result of which financial markets may lose confidence that central banks will prevent inflation from spiralling out of control, resulting in rapidly rising interest rates and declining asset prices.</p>
<p>It is therefore quite likely that central banks will not be able to delay tapering and/or rate hikes for much longer. Tapering means that they will reduce their massive bond purchases. And then just enough to prevent inflation (expectations) from rising too rapidly, while ensuring that the economy does not fall into the abyss.</p>
<p>Long-term interest rates have not risen significantly. This also shows that the markets do not expect inflation to rise substantially. It is more likely to fall back according to the markets, otherwise the average inflation expectation for the next ten years would not be far lower than the current inflation rate. The markets therefore believe that the spread of corona will gradually be curbed more effectively, as a result of which many bottlenecks will disappear and inflation will fall back. However, we have a slightly different view.</p>
<h4 id=""the-past-is-no-guarantee-for-the-future"">The past is no guarantee for the future</h4>
<p>Economists have too often extrapolated the past too much into the future. In the early 1980s, for example, they did not see the transition from higher to lower inflation coming and almost nobody anticipated the 2008 credit crunch.</p>
<p>We strongly assume that we are witnessing another important turning point. Certainly, after the credit crunch broke out in 2008, the great risk was deflation rather than inflation. This is why, since then, central banks have made considerable efforts to stave off deflation and achieve higher inflation. They have pulled out all the stops for this, however, inflation stayed well below 2% until recently.</p>
<p>Corona has driven inflation well above this level, but it is generally argued that the old situation will return as soon as the pandemic is under control.</p>
<h4 id=""a-great-deal-has-changed"">A great deal has changed</h4>
<p>We do not share this view because the situation has changed dramatically.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Under the current central bank policy, wage increases and inflation will have to have reached excessively high levels before central banks take proper action. However, it is generally the case that inflation tends to keep rising once it is in an uptrend. As changes in monetary policy only have an impact after four to eight quarters, this means that the monetary brakes will ultimately have to be hit fairly hard. Asset prices will immediately plummet in this case, which entails the risk of another credit crunch. It is therefore doubtful whether central banks will dare to crack down on rising inflation. All the more so because rising inflation has its advantages. It will alleviate the debt burden and produce higher nominal interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time of globalisation is over. A growing number of political parties in the West want to protect themselves against foreign competition – via import restrictions, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The major problem following the credit crunch was that debts had risen to excessively high levels – to the extent where most parties did not want to step up borrowing, and many banks were reluctant to supply credit. Hence, more money was created than the economy was able to absorb, which subsequently flowed to the asset markets, driving up prices there. This should ultimately lead to more credit supply and therefore to higher growth (and inflation). However, more and more surplus money was required to boost asset prices to even higher levels, and ever higher asset prices were required to maintain credit supply. This is why inflation never really went up.The situation is different now because public deficits have increased dramatically and are financed with surplus money created by central banks. The surplus money no longer sits in the banks waiting to be supplied as credit, but it ends up directly with consumers and companies via the government. As a result, central banks are far better equipped to stimulate the economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needless to say, corona has led to abnormal amounts of government expenditure and therefore to exceedingly high deficits. This will gradually be scaled back. However, it will not be scaled back to any great extent because politicians do not feel enough pressure as long as central banks are willing to finance the deficits and keep borrowing costs extremely low.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""it-is-a-tough-way-back"">It is a tough way back</h4>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that central banks will have their way this time, and that wage increases and inflation will indeed end up at higher levels. The timing depends on developments in terms of corona (and the flu), but central banks will ultimately achieve their goal.</p>
<p>However, once central banks have gone down this road, the way back will be fraught with difficulty. Of course, a central bank can always combat excessively high inflation by raising its rates far enough. However, if this entails a collapse in asset prices, the cure will be worse than the disease. In practice, central banks will choose to let inflation rise further. This is why we expect long-term rates to rise further in the coming years.</p>

<p><em>Real interest rates were fairly negative before the summer and have since declined further as a result of persistent high inflation and a decline in nominal (long-term) interest rates. Negative real interest rates are generally a positive for financial markets and economic growth, as they make it appealing to borrow and use the money for investment. In addition, debts will weigh less in real terms. This has a positive impact on assets such as equities and property, and it exerts downward pressure on credit spreads.</em></p>
<p>However, real interest rates should not decline too rapidly, as this could be interpreted as a sign that economic growth will fall back considerably.</p>
<p>It is not immediately clear whether the markets interpret negative and declining real interest rates as being positive or negative. On the one hand, equity and house prices have stayed under upward pressure, and credit spreads have faced downward pressure. This indicates investor optimism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the decline in real interest rates had coincided with falling commodity prices, a flattening yield curve and a decline in nominal long-term interest rates. These are all signs of declining growth.</p>
<p>Low real interest rates could have several possible causes. This makes it difficult to interpret what they are telling us.</p>
<p>First of all, bond investors may anticipate a considerable decline in economic growth and inflation due to the surge in corona cases and the expectation that the impact of fiscal policy on economic growth will shift from a strong stimulus in recent quarters to a considerable decline over the next few quarters.</p>
<p>The Delta variant has been spreading rapidly, while many people have not yet been vaccinated. Moreover, fully vaccinated people can also transmit the virus and the vaccines offer far less protection after about six months. Booster vaccines will probably offer (sufficient) additional protection. However, it will take a while before everyone has received this booster. In the meantime, concerns about the pandemic could slow down economic growth and many economic data could prove weaker than anticipated.</p>
<p>At the same time, several structural negatives for growth – ageing populations and soaring debts – have strengthened. Finally, inflation has been rising faster than wages in many countries, which affects purchasing power (and consumer confidence).</p>
<p>The above facilitates a scenario in which the economy has been experiencing a boom due to vaccinations and large-scale fiscal stimulus, but that a bust is in the cards. Concerns about deflation could resurface by then, prompting central banks to (further) ease monetary policy.</p>
<p>The decline in real interest rates over the summer could also be due to temporary factors that don’t reflect underlying economic strength:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In spite of high inflation, the Bank of Japan and the ECB have announced that they will not raise their rates in the coming years. The Fed is considering pursuing a less loose monetary policy, but it will remain very accommodative for the time being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the summer, the US government has withdrawn and spent vast amounts of money from its Fed account. This has resulted in a considerable amount of additional liquidity in the economy, on top of the money that the Fed pumps into the economy every month. This has exerted even more downward pressure on interest rates. The government will continue to withdraw money from its Fed account until Congress raises the debt ceiling. This could increase downward pressure on interest rates and reinforce upward pressure on asset prices. However, once the debt ceiling is raised (this is expected by November at the latest), analysts believe that the government will raise the amount in this account by issuing debt securities, thereby removing net liquidity from the market, which will exert upward pressure on interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real interest rates have also been depressed by problems and disruptions on the supply side of the economy. The labour market has been disrupted by the corona crisis, as a result of which many companies are struggling to recruit sufficient staff. This has also disrupted supply chains, resulting in a shortage of computer chips, while (sea) transport takes longer and is far more costly. This has exerted more upward pressure on prices. At the same time, economic growth is depressed, as companies cannot produce as much as they want. However, it is assumed that many of these problems will gradually disappear. This will give economic growth a boost and will depress inflation. Base effects also play a role in the latter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that the decline in long-term nominal and real interest rates has been mainly due to the temporary factors. Growth is unlikely to decline to the extent where concerns about deflation resurface and where monetary policy ends up even looser than now.</p>
<p>Growth is likely to fall back, but this will largely be due to mounting concerns about the corona variants, less fiscal economic stimulus and problems on the supply side.</p>
<p>However, more concerns about covid variants will also result in a higher vaccination coverage. There will still be major problems on the supply side, but they will gradually decrease. If more people are vaccinated, more people will return to the labour market. In addition, we believe that companies will have partly solved the supply chain problems in a few months from now.</p>
<p>In the coming quarters, economic growth will be slowed down by fiscal policy. On the other hand, job growth will increase, and consumers will still have considerable savings and healthy balance sheets will give them more scope to borrow. In other words, (consumption) growth could persist, even in the absence of looser fiscal policies. In addition, we believe that companies will step up investment activity to catch up on investments that were shelved last year, and to reduce dependence on long supply chains and scarce staff.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we anticipate persistent downward pressure on economic growth in the months ahead, but growth is set to pick up in the ensuing period. We anticipate a similar scenario for inflation. Inflation will initially come under more downward pressure due to decreasing base effects and the gradual disappearance of problems on the supply side in a few months from now. However, inflation will subsequently end up at levels higher than before the corona crisis, as an ever larger proportion of surplus money created by central banks will flow to the real economy. This is due to, on balance, persistent high public deficits. Another reason is that households will spend more of their savings.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we have the following expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nominal interest rates will not rise significantly in the short term, but they will rise in subsequent quarters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expectations of a less loose Fed policy will fade in the coming months, after which they will increase; by that time, we also anticipate more speculation on Fed rate hikes as a result of relatively high inflation (expectations) by that time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real interest rates are unlikely to decline to far lower levels in the months ahead and they are likely to rise in the ensuing period.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Following decades of downward pressure on inflation (due to ageing populations, productivity growth and globalisation), central banks have had to step up monetary stimulus to an ever-greater extent. Growth has become increasingly dependent on high asset prices, while the latter have become increasingly reliant on low interest rates and money creation by central banks. This means that a considerable decline in asset prices would substantially slow down growth, raise concerns about high debt and increase deflation risks. This is why the priority of central banks is to keep asset prices high.</em></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Another priority of the Fed is to guarantee the stability of the financial system. This is increasingly under threat due to exceedingly high valuations of many assets, speculative behaviour in cryptocurrency markets, so-called meme stocks and SPACs and a considerable increase in the use of leverage. These developments historically point to market bubbles. This is particularly risky now, as authorities have few remaining resources to stimulate the economy. Also, other drawbacks – like increased inequality – of ultra-loose monetary policies are becoming more evident.</p>
<p>For now, central banks opt to accept the risks of market bubbles and mainly focus on achieving higher inflation. It remains to be seen what will happen if they succeed and consumer price inflation (expectations) start(s) rising. We believe that the latter will happen in the longer-term, as result of deglobalisation, more credit supply to households and companies, persistent high public deficits and continuing ultra-loose monetary policies.</p>
<p>In this scenario, central banks cannot keep up their ultra-loose monetary policies, as inflation (expectations) would rise to even higher levels, and long-term interest rates would ultimately rise rapidly, which could trigger market chaos.</p>
<p>The most favourable scenario for financial markets is one in which inflation stays low. This would allow central banks to keep boosting asset prices. However, increasing inequality and market bubbles would become even more problematic. These drawbacks do not necessarily have to occur (or they would be minor) if productivity growth is accelerated.</p>
<p>The most unfavourable scenario is one in which inflation (expectations) and long-term interest rates rise, while growth stagnates at the same time.</p>
<p>This is why it is currently crucial for the financial markets to know whether and how fast inflation will rise, and how central banks will react to this.</p>
<p>But it will be difficult to get a good sense of the underlying economic strength and inflationary pressures. Data over the past and coming months have been and will be strongly influenced by base effects and start-up problems as many economies are being reopened. As for the longer-term, we can say the following about economic growth, inflation and productivity growth.</p>
<h4 id=""growth"">Growth</h4>
<p>Many economists think most economies will recover quickly from the corona crisis, partly because governments and central banks have implemented massive economic stimulus. It is therefore quite likely that consumers will largely go back to normal before long. In addition, economic growth in the quarters ahead is set to benefit considerably from consumer dissavings and increased corporate investment. Companies will want to invest more because demand is likely to pick up, because they will catch up on investment plans that were paused in the last year, and to reinforce supply chains. Government support and public deficits will decline considerably in this case, which is negative for growth. However, this will be offset by higher job growth. After 2022, economic growth will end up at far lower levels due to fading catch-up demand and fewer catch-up investments, as a result of which growth will tend towards potential.</p>
<p>At this point, potential growth is under downward pressure in many countries due to ageing populations and less immigration. The level of potential growth will ultimately depend on productivity growth.</p>
<h4 id=""productivity"">Productivity</h4>
<p>US productivity has been rising for a number of years, and there are a number of developments that point to more upward pressure on productivity growth, not just in the US, but elsewhere too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Companies are investing more in technology and intellectual property; these are elements that experts say are necessary to boost productivity in the service sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technological changes have accelerated in recent years. The corona crisis could be the shock that drives large-scale adoption of technological breakthroughs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companies should anticipate higher wage costs and lower availability of personnel due to ageing populations, the commitment of governments to increase employee wages in real terms and the risk of deglobalisation. This increases pressure to invest more in labour-saving measures and/or to boost efficiency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, another potential scenario is one in which productivity growth does not end up at structurally higher levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deglobalisation comes down to less foreign competition, which removes the pressure to step up efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governments want to make up an ever-larger part of the economy. There is a risk that they use the additional expenditure for elements that do not or barely increase productivity (but which are socially desirable, for example). Another risk is that the government raises corporate taxes, as a result of which companies want to, or have to, reduce the amount they spend on investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of zombie companies has increased. This impedes the process of creative destruction which ensures that more efficient companies remain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many people with low-paid jobs have been laid off in the corona crisis. This has boosted productivity. Productivity growth will slow down as the economy is being unlocked and many low-wage jobs are reinstated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On balance, the most likely scenario is one in which US productivity growth temporarily declines, after which it will pick up. However, it is unlikely to return to current levels. Productivity in Europe could increase somewhat, but Europe will lag behind the US. This is because Europe has many zombie companies and its economy is generally less dynamic than the US economy.</p>
<h4 id=""inflation"">Inflation</h4>
<p>Inflation is evident now, but this mainly concerns asset inflation. Structurally higher inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) requires more surplus money to flow to the real economy, as opposed to it staying in the financial sector. This is likely to happen in the coming years:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Far more emphasis on the pursuit of loose fiscal policies in order to boost economic growth. Combined with more credit supply to households and companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A process of deglobalisation and increased protectionism, which will reduce deflationary pressures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historically very high valuations for equities and bonds, which will make it increasingly difficult for asset prices to rise. In addition, they will become more vulnerable to negative surprises. As a result of which asset markets will attract less money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflation also has a major psychological component. The current sentiment among investors is that (almost) all assets are better than holding cash. This is why (almost) all asset prices are rising or have risen considerably. This sentiment seems to gradually spill over to consumers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We still expect inflation to decline in the shorter term, mainly due to fewer major base effects and the gradual disappearance of bottlenecks. However, in the ensuing period, upward pressure on consumer price inflation is likely to prevail, and the psychological component will become more important. We believe inflation will rise gradually, because productivity growth will increase slightly at the same time, which will resolve bottlenecks and, in turn, will boost supply.</p>
<p>Central banks will then increasingly face a dilemma. On the one hand, they are under pressure to slow down inflation, while, on the other hand, they are concerned that a tighter monetary policy will have too much negative impact on asset prices and economic growth.</p>



","Following decades of downward pressure on inflation (due to ageing populations, productivity growth and globalisation), central banks have had to step up monetary stimulus to an ever-greater extent. Growth has become increasingly dependent on high asset prices, while the latter have become increasingly reliant on low interest rates and money creation by central banks.

<p>When focusing on subsequent developments in terms of long-term interest rates, it is important to distinguish between the US and the rest of the world. This is because US vaccination programmes are running far more smoothly, and the US is implementing by far the most fiscal stimulus. This is bound to culminate in more economic growth and more upward pressure on inflation compared to other economies in the world (perhaps with the exception of the UK). So, if long-term interest rates rise further, this will initially be evident in the US. Nevertheless, many other countries – especially those in Europe – are increasingly moving towards more fiscal stimulus, and they will probably soon begin to catch up with their vaccinations.</p>
<p>Strikingly, US policy makers are placing far more emphasis on the high unemployment rate and the considerable overcapacity at this point. Both factors are the main reasons why higher structural inflation is generally not anticipated for the time being. However, it is very difficult to measure the level of unemployment and capacity utilisation. So far, many theatres, restaurants, bars, and so on, have been kept afloat with government support and are therefore included on the supply side. However, this government support will largely disappear once the lockdowns are lifted. In this case, a significant number of companies in vulnerable sectors will disappear after all. The supply of goods and services will decline in this case, while the demand side will remain stable due to fiscal stimulus and the spending of accumulated savings. In addition, commodity prices are likely to stay under upward pressure once the global economy picks up. It is also striking that more and more companies are unable to recruit well-qualified staff at this point. This is evident in a climate in which there is a surplus of money and credit supply is gaining momentum.</p>
<p>In view of the above, we believe that events in the US will go beyond just a temporary rise in inflation. This will subsequently also apply to the rest of the world.</p>

<h4 id=""too-little-too-late"">Too little, too late?</h4>
<p>However, we wish to go one step further. At any rate, the Fed has stated that it only wants to take proper action once wage increases and inflation have risen to distinctly higher levels. The latter depends on developments in terms of unemployment and capacity utilisation. If we look at the relevant forecasts – which are too conservative in our view – the general expectation is that there will be full employment and capacity utilisation by late 2022/early 2023. From that point onwards, wage increases and inflation will be under upward pressure.</p>
<p>However, changes in monetary policy will only have an impact on inflation with a delay of roughly four quarters. If the Fed, in turn, says that it only wants to take action if inflation shoots up to above 2.5% – measured by the CPI – this means that an inflation rate of 3% or higher will have to be anticipated for a long time to come. It subsequently remains to be seen whether the Fed will really reduce inflation. Importantly, the US is also faced with a massive debt pile.</p>
<p>In addition, economic growth will have to go back to potential growth once the point of full employment and capacity utilisation has been reached. This serves to prevent all manner of major imbalances. Potential growth is the sum of productivity growth and the increase in the workforce. Potential growth will continue to hover close to 2% for the time being, in spite of recent positive reports about higher productivity growth over the next couple of years. Therefore, if the Fed is going to counter inflation, we will have a prolonged period during which growth ends up below 2%, debts end up at ever higher levels and real interest rates rise. This combination could soon cause the debt mountain to become unstable and therefore trigger a new credit crunch. It would barely be possible to absorb the impact of this crisis, as the scope for monetary and fiscal stimulus would still be limited in this case.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>More than a year later, two more riders have joined Guterres’ foursome: the corona pandemic and massive economic headwinds. The six riders are galloping together at a very rapid pace, sometimes one restraining the other – an example being the pandemic triggering the collapse of economic activity, with greenhouse gas emissions declining correspondingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the riders stir each other up in most cases. Geopolitical tensions and mistrust reinforce one another. In addition, modern technology provides international players with tools to thwart others, and it makes countries feel more vulnerable.</p>
<p>The corona crisis is having a massive economic impact, with a decline in activity that is unprecedented in peacetime. The immediate economic pain is still relatively limited in many places because governments have stepped in en masse to boost employee incomes (especially in the US) and keep companies afloat (especially in Europe). At the moment of writing, governments worldwide have allocated US$14,000bn to cope with the pandemic and economic fallout. This amount for support measures will increase to far higher levels this year. This also means that public debt will rise rapidly in two ways: on the one hand, the government will borrow far more to be able to pay for all the support measures, while revenues will decline at the same time because fewer taxes are received as a result of lagging economic growth. This therefore also means that debt/GDP ratios will rise rapidly.</p>
<p>In the opinion of most economists, these rapidly increasing and soaring debts – incidentally, debts of private individuals and companies have also risen considerably in recent years – do not necessarily need to be a problem. This is due to the fact that interest rates are very low, and because it is assumed that the support measures will keep the earning capacity of countries at current levels.</p>
<p>Some analysts even believe that we are on the eve of a second Roaring Twenties. Following the First World War and the Spanish Flu pandemic, the world – and the West in particular – experienced an enormous growth spurt due to postponed expenditure, reconstruction and the large-scale roll-out of electricity and the internal combustion engine, for example. It would not be odd to anticipate this again: savings in many countries have risen rapidly, people will want to go on holiday and visit restaurants en masse – for instance – when the worst of the pandemic is over. Also, the amazingly fast development of vaccines with often entirely new methods are proof that all the negativity about the lack of technological breakthroughs was and is perhaps a little premature.</p>
<p>This optimism is offset by the fact that aspects that shaped the economic boom of the 1920s (and booms in later decades) are far less relevant to Western countries now: a century ago, the size of the workforce increased very rapidly, and huge strides forward were taken in terms of education for the masses. At this point, the increase in the workforce is stagnating (or even declining) in many industrialised countries, and a large part of the population is already (highly) educated – to the extent where more giant leaps in this area are unlikely.</p>
<p>It therefore seems realistic perhaps not to expect a Roaring Twenties after the corona crisis, but maybe a Modestly Swinging Twenties. In addition, the springboard that has been created and which will be in place for a modest boom – large-scale monetary and fiscal stimulus – will, at the same time, be a potential pitfall if the accelerator is fully depressed now, without pondering the question of how to responsibly find an exit in the future for the splashing out of money which is deemed necessary at this point.</p>
<p>Economic orthodoxy has shifted out of the picture, and the Chicago and Austrian school of economics – with figureheads such as Friedman and Hayek – has been muted in favour of economists who are dismissing traditional, responsible budgetary policies.</p>
<p>So the current and coming fiscal and monetary support measures are embedded with lots of risks and they could even result in economic headwinds turning into a storm if interest rates start rising. Economic pain will then remain one of the aforementioned Six Riders together with abuse of modern technology, mistrust, climate change, the pandemic, and geopolitical animosity.</p>
<p>That latter issue is one of the biggest long-term risks to the global risks; to be more precise: the growing divide in the world between two camps, one led by the US and the other led by China.</p>
<p>The corona crisis has accelerated the process in which China could enter the fray as a serious challenger to the US. Up to now, China has weathered the corona crisis far better than the vast majority of Western economies. As a result, China is likely to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy even faster than previously believed.</p>
<p>What is more, Beijing is trying to reinforce its position on the geopolitical chessboard via corona diplomacy – ie supplying Chinese vaccines to countries that are friendly to Beijing. And this position had already been strengthened in recent years by the reliance of many countries – including Western ones – on Chinese tech companies. The last year in particular has seen far more opposition to this in the West.</p>
<p>America is fairly clear about its stance towards China: the new Foreign Minister Antony Blinken has already mentioned that he will largely maintain the predominantly hard line of the previous government towards Beijing. For the time being, the import tariffs introduced by Trump will not be reversed. A very critical attitude towards human rights has been added to this policy.</p>
<p>Europe, on the other hand, does not seem to be making a clear choice. On the one hand, European capitals largely voice the same sentiments as Washington where China is concerned but, at the same time, Europe recently concluded an investment agreement with Beijing, where China was let off lightly on many sensitive issues. Europe seems to want to steer a course in which it prefers to stay close friends with America, without offending China too much. This policy does not seem to be sustainable in the longer term.</p>
<p>Nobody can fail to notice that more and more countries are becoming unnerved by China. China has grown more assertive on the world stage, especially since Xi Jinping took the lead. The US is no longer all-dominant, there is a new pretender to the throne. And the past shows that these are risky periods; times in which a ruling and rising power are facing each other.</p>
<p>The interplay of the Six Riders infuses the system with a great deal of political uncertainty. Biden’s presidency and large-scale fiscal stimulus programmes provide some stability. However, the world remains in a state of significant political risks that reinforce each other and slow down the economic revival which we anticipate in the second half of this year: the struggle between America and China for global dominance, tensions in and with other major countries (eg the protests in Russia), mistrust of the tech giants, growing dissatisfaction within societies (eg the violent protests in the Netherlands and the storming of the Capitol in the US) and the corona pandemic which will still wreak havoc for some time to come.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Treasury Today Group pride ourselves on our editorial voice and objective insight. We would rather take time to digest events, assess their relevance and look ahead to the ramifications for you, our community. What we seek to do within this article, therefore, is to offer insight into the most topical pieces of 2020 and what the learning points for practitioners can be as we launch into the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Anybody who made predictions at the start of 2020 with any confidence would have spent the majority of the remainder of the year feeling most bewildered indeed. Aside from the events of 2020, much of the last decade has taught us that our ability to predict global events from the political to the financial has been greatly reduced. Black swan events have moved to become the norm in a time where the only certainty is a lack of certainty.</p>
<p>What we can master therefore is resilience and resolve and focus on our purpose and mission within our professions. Many things fall out of our control but a commitment to quality and to progress can remain unshaken.</p>
<h3 id=""so-what-do-we-know-of-2020-for-corporate-treasurers"">So – what do we know of 2020 for corporate treasurers?</h3>
<p>The global pandemic began at the end of 2019, already spelling trouble for our community across Asia-Pacific. Whilst the world largely assumed that the impact would be limited to China and its SARs, Hong Kong and Taiwan, within the corporate community the previous events around the SARS outbreak in Asia left the APAC community aware of the challenges and trials that a pandemic brings. The year saw the spread of the pandemic across the world as headlines in the US shifted from the Democratic nomination to gaining control of a rapidly accelerating virus.</p>
<p>We want to look at some of the key areas which affected corporate treasurers in 2020 and use these thematics to summarise the year for our industry and keep progress and collaboration on the agenda in 2021. Some of the CSR related topics that were front of mind as we entered 2020 have been affected by the events of last year and there were fears that issues such as sustainability and inclusion agendas would slip down the priority list amidst very sobering concerns around balancing budget sheets and cashflow forecasting.</p>
<h3 id=""sustainability"">Sustainability</h3>
<p>As companies across the world repositioned their priorities amidst the business challenges posed by the pandemic, there were concerns that sustainability was not the priority that it needs to be in order for the various commitments that the UN and other organisations require of the world’s largest corporations.</p>
<p>Treasury Today Group’s Global Sustainability Study was launched in 2020 as we are firmly committed to documenting our industry’s path to a more sustainable future. Our work around female representation with our annual Women in Treasury Global Study has shown the power of data in fuelling our conversations and we wanted to bring this information to our conversations around sustainability.</p>
<p>The data set from our inaugural study was eye opening but also went some way to showcasing the need for education and engagement with the topic of sustainability amongst our corporate readership. There are varying levels of comprehension and within treasury it remained unclear for many of our community what their precise role should be within treasury and what tools they could implement to promote a sustainability agenda within treasury itself.</p>
<p>We hosted digital roundtables around sustainability with a number of leading voices in the field. Highlights from these conversations can provide some measure of clarity as we focus on 2021. We will also be rolling out our 2021 Global Sustainability Study and mapping the evolution of the issues.</p>
<p>Within our universe the study exposed a number of individuals from a wide range of different corporations who have adopted activities which are making a difference. Through their engagement with their stakeholders – banks, vendors and internal teams – they are amplifying the conversation and encouraging their network to pay attention. However, for many of their peers, regardless of whether their organisation may support a sustainability initiative, there are still frustrations around finding the time to incorporate more sustainability focused activities within their day to day duties and around the lack of conversation and awareness building that their partners have engaged them upon. 2020’s study showed us that the appetite to learn and to adapt is there amongst our community and that if we collectively continue with these conversations fruits will be borne.</p>
<p>Areas for consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Broader CSR policy – this affects every individual in an organisation and every decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green bonds and green financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supply chain finance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industry collaboration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""diversity-equity-and-inclusion"">Diversity, equity and inclusion</h3>
<p>Launched in March 2020 and closing in August, the annual Women in Treasury Global Study supported by State Street Global Advisors, couldnt have been timed to have been more disrupted by the pandemic. The commitment of our community to this topic amidst the most challenging professional year many of us have ever experienced was not lost on us and we are so grateful to the support of all genders who gave their time, energy and experiences to the Women in Treasury initiative in 2020.</p>
<p>The impact of the pandemic in both literal and figurative ways is not equally distributed across populations. The most vulnerable amongst us have felt and are still feeling the heaviest burden of the pandemic and women have been more impacted.</p>
<p>There are grave concerns raised by studies released by the World Health Organisation and the UN amongst others of the disproportionate impact of the pandemic upon women and fears as to the long-term impact on some of the key areas for female progress which have been at the centre of equality campaigns for the last decade. Whilst it may take us some time to see what the real impact of the pandemic has been upon women, and particularly women with intersectional identity, the knowledge of this additional challenge can permit us a renewed focus and increased vigour around our work on inclusion.</p>
<p>Racial equity was also massively impacted by the events of 2020, as black communities across the US and much of the Western world faced the most risk from the pandemic at the same time as broader inequalities were highlighted around the George Floyd murder in May 2020. This shone a light on a huge systemic problem in the US and across much of the world. The events of last summer have positioned racial equity and equality in a way none of us could have predicted, as most large corporations and financial institutions responded with pledges and promises to tackle systemic problems within the whole professional ecosystem that we exist in.</p>
<p>For our corporate community what this meant was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Listen and learn – we should be constantly and consistently reaching out to colleagues and co-workers to understand and hear their individual issues and priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advocacy and engagement – get involved in Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), get involved in advocacy for groups within your organisation. Have a voice and make a difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data and progress – we need better data on systemic issues in organisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency and accountability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""wellbeing"">Wellbeing</h3>
<p>2020 was a trial and tribulation for everyone’s physical and mental wellbeing. Remote working and managing working from home whilst many juggled children that needed home schooling or battled the loneliness that came from a lack of physical interaction with friends, co-workers, family and loved ones. People coped with grief and illness all without the usual professional and personal interactions and relationships which humans so desperately need in order to thrive.</p>
<p>What emerged from our conversations with our partners and readers during 2020 around the subject of personal and employee wellbeing were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The power of vulnerability: being open with our co-workers and professional contacts was the mantra of 2020. It is no longer shameful to admit that we are struggling as our personal and professional stressors overlapped in location and time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honesty, flexibility and adaptability: there is no right way to manage your wellbeing, being flexible and changing things when something isn’t working is critical in all aspects of our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance, balance, balance: making time for yourself, stepping back and saying no. All of these are a must in an era of multiple burn out points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""leading-and-managing-teams-remotely-during-a-crisis"">Leading and managing teams (remotely during a crisis)</h3>
<p>Much of the work that we conducted in 2020 with roundtables and discussion groups focused at least in part on the very particular challenges to leadership that the year created. Keeping teams engaged and galvanised and moving everyone to working from home for an uncertain and potentially endless amount of time was a source of great challenge for the majority of our community.</p>
<p>The advent of technology as the oil behind the wheels of remote working saw great changes to how we work. There were also some constants as the human side of teamwork was felt in its absence. Many of our audience shared their insights on using Zoom to connect their employees through games or classes, with walks in the park being conducted during more sociable calls, all designed to replicate the bonding and problem solving nature of the tea-break and water cooler moments that the office provides.</p>
<p>The unifiers were there for all the leaders that we engaged with and the lessons were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stay connected personally as well as professionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give people space to share how they are really feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust those who work for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be vulnerable and share your own experiences and challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay learning with reverse mentoring, actively reaching out to junior staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the opportunity to find your own mentors and attend seminars and leadership events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop skillsets outside of the ordinary – you never know what they may show you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""awards"">Awards</h3>
<p>The 2020 Adam Smith Awards and Adam Smith Awards Asia moved to digital delivery across the board. Our usual luncheon events were replaced with a livestream announcement which took place in June for the Adam Smith Awards and in October for the Adam Smith Awards Asia.</p>
<p>The pandemic and its impact on the working priorities of treasurers was evident throughout all the nominations but we felt deserved special recognition with our new category, Best Crisis Management Solution. Alongside our case studies and Yearbook as normal we are telling the stories of our 2020 award winners in our podcast series which began last year and will roll out throughout the first half of 2021, showcasing the resilience, resolve, collaboration and determination to achieve best practice that typified our community in the last year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teamwork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future focus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""community"">Community</h3>
<p>Starting in March 2020 we launched our COVID-19 Community which focused on leading voices from our industry and beyond sharing their pain points and lessons learnt as we all worked tirelessly to stay connected and communicative amidst challenges of working from home and managing teams at a distance.</p>
<p>This project evolved to later be named Community Voices, as our practitioners shared more than just their advice on surviving the pandemic and our coverage of the impact of COVID moved from reporting on the pandemic to reporting on the day to day dealings of corporate finance leaders across the world.</p>
<p>The project was jointly conceived with the Association of Corporate Treasurers in Singapore (ACTS), long-term partners and collaborators of Treasury Today Group’s and the strongest community resource that exists for the APAC community. The articles were created in response to our conversations with the ACTS and with corporates across the world as our role evolved and we sought to understand the challenges that you were facing and ensure we could share best practice and tips on any and all of the day to day issues arising.</p>
<p>Amongst the phenomenal voices who shared their insights and experiences with us were Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. Feeding America is the largest hunger relief organisation in the US and through its network of 200 foodbanks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programmes it provides meals to over 46 million people a year. It also champions food waste prevention programmes and aims to improve food security through education and advocacy. Claire comes from our corporate community and has made the graceful leap from working for corporations to leading a fundamentally important organisation like Feeding America. Before starting at Feeding America, Claire held positions at Walmart leading up to her last role as Executive VP of Finance and Treasurer. In between featuring on Trevor Noah’s show and being listed in TIME 100 most influential people of 2020, Claire shared her thoughts with our global readership on her journey, the impact of the pandemic on Feeding America and her advice on best practice in leadership.</p>
<h3 id=""moving-forward-together"">Moving forward: together</h3>
<p>So that’s what we saw and hopefully what we have learnt together. At the Treasury Today Group we realised the unique position we occupy with a platform that brings together the various powers in our industry. We have a renewed focus to bring you spaces to collaborate and communicate, whether that be physically or virtually. We have a responsibility to listen to your challenges and take the time to come back to you with solutions and connections, using data and dialogue to promote best practice in corporate finance.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Finally, many experts see the dollar weakening in 2021. First of all, against the Asian currencies, but generally also against the currencies of the industrialised countries. Experience shows that something else usually happens in the event of major consensus expectations.</p>
<p>Positivism with regard to shares is mainly determined by two factors. First of all, by the expectation that the economy will pick up considerably once large-scale vaccinations take place, and secondly by the prospect that the central banks will open the money tap even wider as soon as something goes pear-shaped. This gives buyers the firm belief that they can never lose much. This is without even considering the additional fiscal stimulus that is in the offing.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is also evident for credit spreads. At this point, there is barely any difference in interest rates on low-risk and high-risk bonds, not only because central banks are also buying far riskier bonds, but also because the risks are not considered to be high.</p>
<p>It is not the case that the markets always do something different to what is expected in the event of broad consensus. But this does often happen. This is why we will discuss how the consensus could be off the mark this time.</p>
<h3 id=""the-corona-crisis-and-inflation"">The corona crisis and inflation</h3>
<p>Historically, economists generally tend to extrapolate the past to the future. As a result, they often failed to foresee major changes. This could play a role again this time – but it is nowhere near certain. That is, central banks have had great difficulty avoiding deflation in the last decade, and this is why most economists believe this is unlikely to change for the time being. Certainly, now the scenario has been compounded by the corona crisis, which has triggered a significant decline in economic activity and inflation. The soaring debts will probably also ensure moderate economic growth for a long time to come, which is another reason not be concerned about inflation. In this climate, central banks can afford to pursue a very loose monetary policy for years to come without creating too much inflation. This accounts for the optimism about the performance of shares and credit spreads over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>We have our reservations about this line of reasoning. A remarkable aspect of the corona crisis is that it has blasted a hole in the demand side of the economy as well as in the supply side. A great many companies in all manner of sectors are basically bankrupt. This mainly includes restaurants, cinemas, theatres, concert organisers, artists and so on. Strangely enough, however, the number of bankruptcies in the US and Europe is currently lower than before the corona crisis. This is the result of the massive support packages which have been introduced by governments. However, nowhere near all of the support has been provided as a gift. A considerable proportion has been offered in the form of loans. Add to this the shock that many entrepreneurs have had to sustain, and it is quite likely that many companies will not expand/invest for the time being; even though they have shrunk considerably in order to cope with the corona crisis.</p>
<p>The demand side of the economy has also declined greatly. However, the financial position of most people has not deteriorated significantly. It is true that the unemployment rate has risen substantially, but the government has injected more money into the economy compared to the decline in incomes. However, consumers have saved up a far bigger proportion of the additional funds – partly to accumulate a buffer in these financially uncertain times, but also because they cannot spend money on eating out, going to the cinema and so on.</p>
<h3 id=""the-positive-story"">The positive story</h3>
<p>However, this scenario could be turned upside down once a considerable proportion of the population has been vaccinated. We assume that the majority of healthcare workers, elderly and vulnerable people will have been vaccinated by the summer.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Refinitiv Datastream/ECR Research</em></p>
<p>This is why corona will lose its grip fairly quickly on the economy from the summer onwards (the demand side is likely to benefit more than the supply side).</p>
<p>In addition, central banks as well as governments do not want to take any risks. This is why massive fiscal stimulus programmes will be kept up for the time.</p>
<p>This positive picture will also be reflected in commodity prices. These have risen considerably due to an improving global economy and the expectation that the recovery will persist next year. All the more so because the Chinese economy is doing well again.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is therefore that it is quite likely the demand side of the economy will increase more than the supply side in the years ahead. This may well create higher inflation than generally anticipated at this point.</p>
<h3 id=""back-to-the-seventies"">Back to the seventies?</h3>
<p>If inflation in the West indeed rises sooner and more than expected, none of today’s positive predictions are on the mark. In this scenario, rising inflation expectations will lead to higher long-term interest rates than are currently priced. This will have a significant impact on the price-earnings ratios of shares, risk premiums and exchange rates. In this case, real interest rates could also rise.</p>
<p>In other words, this would come down to a return to the situation that was evident in the 1970s. At the time, the authorities were generally reluctant to crack down on inflation, as this would trigger a recession. Nowadays, the authorities are wary of countering inflation for fear of a collapse of the debt pile. However, it is generally argued that the central banks could still find a solution by setting caps for long-term interest rates. Once interest rates threaten to exceed these caps, the central bank will buy massive amounts of bonds – until interest rates fall back again (this is yield curve control).</p>
<p>As long as deflation is a major risk, this is certainly a viable option. However, it would only add fuel to the fire in the event of distinctly increasing inflation expectations, which would then rise even more rapidly. This would result in a massive supply of bonds at some point – to the extent where chaos erupts. This policy can therefore not be kept up for long.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it still cannot be ruled out that, next year, inflation and long-term interest rates will rise more than currently anticipated. This would have immediate negative consequences for shares, credit spreads and possibly also for gold for a while – especially in view of the major debt burden.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>A handful of major long-term trends have reached a tipping point: economic policy and globalisation; inflation; demographics; productivity; global power relations.</p>
<h4 id=""economic-policy-and-globalisation"">Economic policy and globalisation</h4>
<p>Globalisation took off following the fall of the Berlin Wall, China’s admission to the WTO, the rise of container transport and the lowering of import tariffs. These changes allowed western businesses to produce cheaply in Asia and Eastern Europe, and competition in western labour markets increased, keeping wage increases at low levels.</p>
<p>It did not lead to lower consumption. On the contrary, downward pressure on inflation has enabled central banks to lower interest rates and encourage consumers and governments to step up borrowing and consumption. This was a golden period for corporate earnings. Profits rose considerably because wage costs went up less rapidly than productivity growth, and interest charges declined.</p>
<p>Monetary policy became the policy of choice to boost growth in times of negative shocks or low growth. The challenge today is that central banks have already cut nominal interest rates to 0% (or lower), making further cuts increasingly detrimental to economies. Central banks could step up quantitative easing. Based on recent years however, it is doubtful whether this alone will be enough to boost economic growth to any great extent.</p>
<p>As a result, the focus has shifted to fiscal stimulus when it comes to boosting growth. It has a number of consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Governments generally respond more slowly than central banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central banks have a stable inflation target of roughly 2% and – in the case of the Fed – maximum employment. They fine-tuned monetary policy to meet this target, irrespective of who benefits the most. Although different governments have different and changing objectives, they typically aim to increase employees’ wages and benefits, even at the expense of earnings. If their competitive position deteriorates too much because of rising wages, governments can step up protectionism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiscal policy may change after each election, which increases uncertainty surrounding long-term investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all countries are as efficient. It means more variation between countries in terms of the extent and duration of fiscal stimulus. This will trigger more variation in growth expectations, and more fluctuations in the currency and stock markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growing importance of fiscal policy is particularly challenging for the Eurozone. Without fiscal union, fiscal dominance will lead to greater divergences between the euro countries and ultimately to more tensions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, the role of monetary policy will change into a facilitating role. This means that real interest rates will have to be kept negative and interventions will be required if nominal long-term interest rates rise too sharply. This could be in the form of stepping up bond-buying programmes or announcing yield curve control policies.</p>
<h4 id=""inflation"">Inflation</h4>
<p>Inflation has declined on balance since the 1980s. Increasing monetary stimulus has mainly prevented deflation, and failed to trigger higher inflation for different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A decline in the velocity of circulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International competition sparked by globalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monetary stimulus funds largely flowed to property and stock markets. Prices of these assets rose rapidly, so did related debts. As a result, a more limited proportion of the monetary stimulus flowed to the real economy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The shift from monetary to fiscal dominance will change this. For governments, the advantages of boosting wages and benefits far outweigh higher asset prices. In addition, governments will be reluctant to allow fiscal policy to lead to a deteriorating competitive position via higher wages. If this happens, the stimulus largely leaks abroad via higher imports. Consequently, the transition to fiscal dominance will ultimately lead to deglobalisation, more protectionism and less competition in the labour market. We also expect central banks and governments to work together to stimulate the economy via higher investment activity. Here, governments guarantee (part of) the loans to businesses, while central banks ensure that there is enough money to supply credit at low interest rates.</p>
<p>Fiscal dominance and associated political uncertainty could also make it far more difficult for businesses to plan adequately. This could lead to more supply bottlenecks. We also assume that low commodity prices have led to too little investment in new production capacity, putting commodity prices under upward pressure. This, combined with higher wage costs, will create more upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<h4 id=""demographics"">Demographics</h4>
<p>In the coming years, many baby boomers will retire. This means the number of workers compared to the number of non-workers will decline. A contraction of the workforce means that – ceteris paribus – potential growth will be lower. This could lead to more downward pressure on inflation and an even greater urge to step up fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p>Moreover, an ageing population leads to a gradual de-saving process. Over time, this could put downward pressure on asset prices and upward pressure on long-term interest rates.</p>
<h4 id=""productivity"">Productivity</h4>
<p>Higher productivity would be able to help sustain growth amid high debt, ageing populations and deglobalisation. Alas, productivity growth has not been very encouraging in recent years and longer-term growth expectations are lower than the growth achieved in recent years. This will probably require far higher public deficits.</p>
<p>However, some developments could boost productivity growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is considerable progress in the field of robotisation, automated driving and artificial intelligence which will lead to massive productivity growth in the event of large-scale adoption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Central banks will keep capital costs low, which makes investment in productivity-boosting elements appealing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The rivalry between China and the US could lead to economic blocks that reduce economies of scale, but it could also lead to a technology war with more innovations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it is difficult to have clear expectations in terms of future productivity growth.</p>
<h4 id=""global-power-relations"">Global power relations</h4>
<p>For the past decades, the US has been the undisputed world leader, promoting free world trade and the importance of multinational institutions. However, China is increasingly challenging the US on the global stage. According to many political analysts, the question is not whether but when China will assume the leading position in the world. In the past, a change in world leadership almost never happened without conflict. A direct armed conflict between the US and China does not seem likely to us, but it would make an economic or technological war more possible. This will speed up the process of deglobalisation and could affect companies doing business both in China and the US.</p>

<p>It is these trends that we believe could lead to a different economic and investment climate in the decades ahead. Rising inflation and persistent high public deficits are negative for government bonds. We expect government bond prices in the US and Europe to decline over the next couple of years to decades.</p>
<p>Lower economic growth, where a greater proportion of the economy goes to wages and less goes to earnings, is negative for equities in the longer-term; we expect a prolonged bear market in real terms. This is also in line with the very high valuations for equities at the time of writing, which, from a historical perspective, suggests very low return expectations for the next ten years.</p>
<p>Assets that benefit from increased government expenditure and investment and provide protection against increased political uncertainty and inflation have the best prospects: commodities, gold, inflation-linked bonds, and property. In addition, dollar assets have a relatively large share in global stock and bond indices at this point. The chances are that this will increasingly shift towards a larger share of yuan assets and that the relative performance of yuan bonds and stocks will outperform these dollar assets.</p>
<p>Finally, Europe will face major challenges. If the EMU fails to become a fiscal union, a period of fiscal dominance will lead to greater economic differences and rising tensions. It will be increasingly difficult for the ECB to ease these tensions via a looser monetary policy, especially in times of rising inflation. In this scenario, the collapse of the Eurozone will only be a matter of time, resulting in considerable underperformance of many European assets.</p>

<p><em>Coronavirus has hurried Western economies towards a situation of ‘inflate or die’. However, it is very difficult to get inflation off the ground. High debt, international competition, the introduction of modern technology and the tendency to save more are factors that slow down economic growth and inflation.

<p>In any case, central banks will have to keep (real) interest rates very low and they will have to continue to create vast amounts of excess money in order to boost asset prices as far as possible. In addition, governments should ensure that borrowing activity is stepped up. They should borrow more themselves or issue guarantees that enable the private sector to borrow more.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the credit crunch, central banks in the West never managed to boost demand – read: debt – to the extent where inflation ended up at distinctly higher levels. Banks are dripping with money, but relatively little of it is used to step up credit supply. Debts are simply too high and growth prospects are too low – certainly considering the outbreak of COVID-19 – for companies and consumers to step up borrowings to finance investments and consumption. However, it is also not an option for policy makers to leave the situation as it is. This would lead to deflation and therefore an economic crisis. The only remaining option is to allow the government to borrow far more, financed by the central bank. This indirectly comes down to helicopter money. In other words, the government doles out money to the masses. This policy can be kept up until inflation rises too much. However, two factors need to be considered here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In theory, it is possible that households that receive money from the government save this money rather than spend it. This is currently evident as, following the outbreak of the coronavirus, many private individuals and companies concluded that they had far too few reserves to absorb setbacks. This makes them save more now, also because a second wave is quite likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public deficits and debts cannot be raised indefinitely. At some point, the debts and deficits will reach levels where no-one believes that the old debts will ever be repaid by the government. This, in turn, triggers chaos in the financial system. This should therefore be avoided.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is an issue in the current situation due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Public finances are bound to deteriorate substantially in the future due to ageing populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corona crisis has forced the government to intervene in unprecedented ways in order to prevent an economic disaster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, consumer savings are still high, and this forces the government to take additional measures to boost the demand side of the economy sufficiently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, these problems will become more acute if the assumption is that the corona crisis will last even longer. This is why high hopes have been placed on a vaccine. However, we are somewhat cautious here, as experts tell us that they would be happy if the vaccine turned out to be 50%-70% effective. In addition, about a third of the Western population has indicated holding off on a vaccine for the time being. The relevant individuals are concerned about unwanted side effects of the vaccine. This means that we are likely to face many problems with the coronavirus in the years to come – to the extent where they push down economic growth – albeit to a lesser extent than this year. This means that, for the time being, the private sector is unlikely to focus on dissaving to any great extent.</p>

<p>In line with this, we believe that, for the time being, the private sector will reduce debt as far as possible, rather than the other way around. It would therefore not surprise us if public deficits have to stay at very high levels for a long time. This will probably be at the expense of ongoing confidence in public finances. This is why we see more and more Western governments turning to a last resort: a policy where the government guarantees debts run up by companies and individuals. This will suddenly make it attractive/possible for the private sector to borrow more money. At the same time, this will not increase the public deficit, as guarantees are not included in it. This would only happen if the government had to pay out in connection with a guarantee.</p>
<h4 id=""outlook-interest-rates"">Outlook interest rates</h4>
<p>At this point, the Fed seems to indicate, using forward guidance, that it will keep interest rates low for a long time. It will also continue to support the economy by buying up bonds, via massive money creation. The central bank will only switch to negative interest rates and/or yield curve control (a policy aiming to place a ceiling on government bond yields) in emergencies. Fed policy will continue to be geared towards boosting inflation, and this is why long-term interest rates will gradually come under more upward pressure. The same developments will be evident in Europe, but to a lesser extent.</p>

<p>However, it remains to be seen what long-term interest rates will do if economic growth slows down again before too long due to the flare-up of the coronavirus. In this case, long-term interest rates could decline slightly for a while. Incidentally, we believe that both Europe and the US will leave short-term interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>In the longer-term, we expect the authorities will increasingly pursue an inflationary policy to alleviate the debt burden. This mainly applies to the US, and this is why we believe that the dollar will become a structurally weak currency in the long run (massive deficits in public finances and current account deficits, so-called twin deficits). This will also drive prices of shares and gold to far higher levels.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>The US may like to present itself as a shining example to countries worldwide, but the political system has often resulted in elections that did not proceed smoothly – to put it mildly. In the 1800 presidential elections, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson had to take on incumbent president and Federalist John Adams. Jefferson chose Aaron Burr as his vice president candidate as Burr enjoyed great popularity.</p>
<p>At the time, the person who received the most electoral votes in the electoral college became president, while number two became vice president. Jefferson and Burr gained 73 votes each. This forced the House of Representatives – where Federalists held sway – to vote who would become president. Thirty five rounds of voting were required before Jefferson emerged as the winner – partly due to an intensive lobby from Alexander Hamilton, who loathed Jefferson, but found Burr completely unsuitable as president; he said about Burr that he “loves nothing but himself—thinks of nothing but his own aggrandisement”. A few years later, Burr – still VP at the time – would shoot Hamilton in a duel. Yet the US proved strong enough as a unit to endure these western-like scenes.</p>
<p>Sixty years later, elections would contribute greatly to splitting the country. Abraham Lincoln was very unpopular in the South, to the extent where the Democrats in the South split off from the party and produced their own presidential candidate. Lincoln ultimately won only 40% of the popular vote, but still became president through the electoral college. This led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other states not long afterwards. This resulted in the Civil War. But America survived even this.</p>
<p>Will we shortly be able to add the 2020 elections to the list of illustrious elections that are still mentioned generations later, but which did not break America? All the stories about Trump having to be removed from the White House by the military if he loses seem unlikely to us.</p>
<p>In any event, Trump had imagined a very different run-up to his possible re-election. He believed that he could boost his campaign with historically low unemployment, sky-high stock markets and an economy that continues calmly and stoically. This was until the corona pandemic threw a spanner into the works.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s approach to the corona crisis has been anything but well received by the American people and the streets have been flooded with protests for fairer opportunities for black people and police reforms. Although the country is unanimous in some respects when it comes to racism and police brutality, we should not overestimate this solidarity. For example, in June there was a gap of 60 percentage points between Republicans and Democrats in the view that systematic racism in police actions is a bigger problem than vandalism and violence in protests.</p>
<p>Trump now tries to project himself as a Richard Nixon, focused on law and order. The riots and demonstrations following Luther King’s assassination in 1968 drove some of the voters into Nixon’s arms; the Republican candidate campaigned with a law and order approach. Another example is the major riots in Los Angeles in 1992; they initially led to more sympathy for progressive views in the polls. A year later, however, LA residents elected a Republican mayor for the first time in 36 years.</p>
<p>Indeed, we should be careful with predictions because of these examples, but the comparison with Nixon falls short in many respects, for example because Nixon was the challenger and Trump is the sitting president. All the misery is unfolding under his administration now, whereas Nixon could blame eight years of Democratic mismanagement. Nixon presented himself as the man who would bring peace and stability; Trump is an instigator of unrest and instability.</p>
<p>In addition, Nixon had it easier, as the electorate was far less ethnically diverse than it is now. In 1968, 90% of voters were white; this year the figure is probably around 66%.</p>
<p>In addition, the 1968 Democratic candidate, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, was thwarted by his own Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson who, for a variety of reasons, seemed to hope that Nixon would win instead of the candidate from his own party.</p>
<p>All in all, the BLM issue creates problems for Trump rather than increasing his electoral opportunities. In addition, Trump has made a poor impression on the majority of voters in the corona crisis, a weak economy does not help a sitting president’s chances, and his approval ratings have bottomed out now. We also see spectacular turnarounds in the betting markets: by the end of May, they still believed Trump clearly had the best odds of spending another four years in the White House; at the start of July, Biden – with 61% – is believed to have the best chances against Trump – 39%.</p>
<p>Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is leading in the polls in more than a handful of those states that are likely to make a difference in November. Combined with the increasing likelihood that the Democrats will also secure the Senate in addition to the House, it is therefore quite possible that the Democrats will dominate the three houses next year (PredictIt put the chance at about 60% at the start of July).</p>
<p>Major asset managers worldwide see a triple Democratic victory as one of the top three risks to the markets. The two bigger risks are, in their view, a second major corona wave in the autumn and persistently high unemployment. Of course, these three risks are interrelated.</p>
<p>If the Democrats end up fully in charge in Washington (apart from the Supreme Court that errs on the conservative side), the markets will indeed initially react negatively, which includes the prospect of higher taxes, an increased focus on the breaking up of companies, expensive social programmes, more regulation and so on. More specifically, the tax cuts for companies in 2017 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) will be at risk in this case, for example.</p>
<p>However, the ‘damage’ to the markets and the economy may turn out to be less than expected in the event of a Blue Wave: the left wing of the Democrats has lost power and not a single Tea Party-like movement is so strong that it can pull the party very far to the left. In addition, Biden has endorsed a neoliberal policy for decades and, as president, he will not suddenly adopt an overly progressive approach. In addition, it may well be favourable for the US economy in the longer-term if the pendulum swings slightly to the left, as inequality and the share of earnings in the economy have taken on forms that require correction to restore the balance.</p>
<p>We would therefore not be surprised if an initially negative reaction to a Biden victory from the stock markets were soon tempered. If the Senate stays in the hands of the GOP, the stock markets are certainly likely to quickly swallow their disappointment. Historically, stock markets have fared better under a divided Washington than under a Washington where one of the parties dominates the White House, Senate and House.</p>
<p>Importantly, even if America is taking severe knocks now, investors and analysts should be careful not to write off the US. It is written everywhere that the political chaos and divisions in the US are unique and very severe, but storms and social divide have been basically commonplace in US history and America has always dealt with it.</p>
<p>For now, the combination of political and social division and poor management of the corona crisis makes the US seem fragile, and we can well imagine reluctance among investors. Also, because US equities have offered outperformance for years. This outperformance is insufficiently supported by real, underlying economic developments. The markets are therefore likely to mark time, but do not make the mistake of thinking that America will freeze in its tracks.</p>

<p>At first sight, a collapse in demand due to the corona-crisis is deflationary. However, supply is constrained at the same time. It’s therefore difficult to tell whether the lockdowns are conducive to deflation or to inflation. Most importantly, however, the economy is contracting sharply while debt is rising fast. As a result, total debt/GDP ratios will rise to even higher levels. This entails the risk that the financially weakest companies and countries will be unable to honour their debt obligations in full, leading to losses and financial problems elsewhere. In other words, the risk of a domino effect on bankruptcy figures is increasing. In this case, a negative deflationary spiral will threaten, as was often the case in previous crises, for example in the 1930s. During this crisis, deflation coincided with a massive economic decline, very high unemployment, a collapse in share prices and ultimately very dire social consequences.</p>
<h4 id=""paid-for-and-free-lunches"">Paid for and free lunches</h4>
<p>However, there are two major differences between then and now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keynes’s theories only became commonplace well into the 1930s. He suggested that the government could absorb a large part of the impact by raising its deficits to a considerable extent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gold Standard applied at the beginning of the Great Depression, which made it very difficult for central banks to intervene on a large scale.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is different in the current situation. Governments know that they have to significantly raise their deficits in a crisis, while central banks can create money at will and can cut their rates as they please. However, Milton Friedman has shown that there is no such thing as a free lunch. If the above is done to excess, inflation will ensue and entirely different problems will arise. This is particularly the case if the central bank funds soaring public deficits by creating far more money.</p>
<p>However, there is no direct relationship between money creation and inflation: a great deal of money can be created without rising inflation – or it could be that inflation rises at a far later stage. This is because inflation is not only influenced by the amount of surplus money, but also by the velocity of money. If company A borrows money from the bank, it uses it for a purpose. It could build a new factory, for example. Companies and people who do the construction work are paid for this by company A. Most of this money ends up in the banking system, so that a loan can be issued with the same money, and so on. The speed at which this happens is called the turnover rate – or velocity – of money.</p>
<p>Friedman assumed that the turnover rate of money would remain fairly constant over time. In this scenario, there is indeed a fairly close relationship between the amount of money that has been created and inflation. However, this was not the case following the credit crisis in 2008 – because the credit crisis made lending more difficult, which caused the turnover rate to decline considerably and kept a lid on inflation.</p>
<p>This does not mean that Friedman’s theory is completely off the mark. The combination of considerable money creation and a decline in the turnover rate guarantees that interest rates decline considerably and that far more money is created than the real economy is able to absorb. This ensures that the additional money largely flows to the asset markets (bonds, shares, property, etc). This is why asset prices are pushed up to ever higher levels. Ultimately, asset inflation will arise rather than consumer price inflation. It will not stop here: higher asset prices improve the balance sheets of companies and households, which will lead to an increase in credit supply in the long run, as a result of which the turnover rate will increase. If the central bank does not quickly remove the surplus money from the economic system, asset inflation will turn into consumer price inflation in this phase. The effect is therefore that the surplus money initially boosts asset prices and subsequently credit supply. There are economic situations in which this does not work. Japan is a case in point (over the last three decades).</p>
<h4 id="""">Extra liquidity created by the Fed did not lead to higher inflation due to a declining money velocity</h4>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Refinitiv Datastream/ECR Research</em></p>
<h4 id=""helicopter-money"">Helicopter money</h4>
<p>In most cases, however, there is a way to rapidly increase the turnover rate in a crisis. This can be done by allowing the government to raise its deficits rapidly. At the same time, money creation should be stepped up considerably – preferably by having government bonds bought directly by the central bank and having them financed with money created by the central bank. This should be done to a far greater extent compared to actions taken following the credit crisis. This basically comes down to helicopter money. This means that ‘free’ money is distributed to the population. People will soon start spending this money, which will improve the economy and – after some time – credit supply will receive a boost. This is far more the case now.</p>
<p>As long as the lockdown persists, people will not spend much, and this will probably continue for some time. However, if the combination of a large public deficit and a great deal of money creation persists, the economy will gradually be boosted, especially if lockdowns are gradually removed. When this happens, the central bank could, in theory, remove money from the economic system and the government could reduce its deficits. In this case, inflation stays under control.</p>
<p>However, in practise this won’t happen any time soon. This is because the economy will still fall back, deflation will occur, and a negative deflationary spiral will be evident before long in this scenario. A far more appealing alternative – which has generally been opted for throughout history – is therefore to keep money flowing and to allow inflation to rise. This has the great advantage that nominal – rather than real – incomes of companies and individuals rise more rapidly, which makes it increasingly easy to meet interest and repayment obligations on old loans. The disadvantage is that inflation causes all sorts of misallocation of capital, as a result of which productivity declines to ever lower levels. Interest rates will rise in tandem with inflation. The former is a longer-term problem, while the latter can be delayed by the central bank for some time.</p>
<h4 id=""end-of-an-era"">End of an era</h4>
<p>We believe that it will take several years for the economies to really overcome the current coronavirus shock. The deflationary pressure will certainly be high at the beginning of this period. However, an inflationary policy will basically be pursued. This will gradually come to the surface, and we believe that it will increasingly shape inflation expectations and long-term interest rates in the decade ahead. This will create a fundamentally different climate for companies and investors compared to the one to which they have become accustomed over the last 30 years.</p>

<p>However, investors in the US and Europe don’t seem to be concerned at the time of writing. US shares have been performing significantly better than European shares. Furthermore, EUR/USD reflects higher investor confidence in the US economy versus the European economy. Do political developments suggest persistent higher confidence in the US financial markets this year?</p>
<p>Europe is faced with the following obstacles to a substantial improvement in economic growth.</p>
<p>Germany – which is widely regarded as the continent’s leader – is struggling with internal political problems, as Chancellor Angela Merkel’s intended successor stepped aside following a series of setbacks. The last straw was Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s (AKK) role in the uproar surrounding the election of Thuringia’s state premier, where the regional branch of Merkel’s and AKK’s CDU, together with the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), helped a liberal politician win the vote. This sent shockwaves across Germany, as it was considered to legitimise and endorse collaboration with the AfD – which is regarded as extreme right. AKK seemed to have lost control once again, with Merkel being forced to put things right. Elections are not scheduled until the autumn of 2021, but speculation on a premature end to Merkel’s final term is rife now. Political instability in Germany will make it more difficult to steer a clear and dynamic European course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, French President Macron tries to seize his chance to leave his mark on Europe. Macron is seeking to position France as Europe’s geopolitical leader, and he wants to keep involving Britain – probably because Britain and France are the only European nuclear powers and the only countries that are able to flex military muscle. In addition, by keeping the UK closely involved in European matters, Macron wants to ensure that Germany does not run the show alone.</p>
<p>Macron basically only tries to achieve what his predecessors wanted to achieve: using Europe as a vehicle to boost France’s international position. France does not primarily regard itself as a player that strengthens Europe; it regards Europe as an entity that supports its global ambitions.</p>
<p>New European power structures will crystallise in the coming years, as Britain has turned away from Europe, the giant economic gap between France and Germany continues to widen, and Germany will slowly but surely play the political cards where it was previously reluctant to do so in view of its history. In addition, the Eastern countries – led by Poland – are increasingly making their voices heard.</p>
<p>Europe may not be rudderless, but it lacks a clear course. On the upside, Europe was (fairly) united in the Brexit negotiations, policy in respect of Russia has, surprisingly enough, proved fairly consistent and coherent in recent years, and Brussels continues to conclude free trade agreements. On the other hand, Europe is at risk of gradually being driven apart by China and Russia, support for NATO is plummeting and European refugee/migration policy is embarrassing.</p>
<p>The latter could cause European tensions to flare up this year. Western Africa is faced with a growing number of extremist attacks, violence is flaring up and national governments seem unable to curb it and, in some cases, make it worse. Furthermore, the civil war in Libya and the escalation in Syria between Turkey and troops of Syrian dictator Assad (supported by Russia) create an increasing risk of massive refugee flows to Europe.</p>
<p>In addition to the issues mentioned earlier, Europe – as the world’s largest trading bloc with a fairly open economy – is still very vulnerable to protectionist trends and a further spread of the new coronavirus (officially referred to as COVID-19). The combined damage of an escalating trade war and the impact of the coronavirus may push Europe over the edge into a recession – also because recent economic data hasn’t been very upbeat.</p>
<p>Policymakers and the ECB will have to absorb the impact if Europe is unexpectedly hit hard. However, they lack the resources to absorb such shocks, partly because the ECB’s interest rates are at negative levels, and total debt positions in Europe are exceedingly high. In addition, many policymakers are wary of raising deficits. If a crisis situation arises, financial markets are likely to doubt, once again, whether the monetary union will be able to survive.</p>
<p>However, we suspect that Trump will put his animosity towards Europe on hold, as he does not want to break the economic momentum he has achieved in the run-up to the November elections. Incidentally, this momentum is fairly relative. US growth has fallen back to just above 2% – while Trump promised a growth rate of 3% or higher – and many Americans have only enjoyed little improvement in their situation in recent years. Yet 59% of Americans say that they are in better economic shape than a year ago and three-quarters believe that their situation will have improved in a year from now.</p>
<p>We believe a second term for Trump is the most likely scenario at this point. The stock markets will receive an additional boost as Trump’s chances increase. It is only in the longer term that the markets will be preoccupied with the structural damage that Trump is inflicting on the US economy – by inflating budget deficits to far higher levels, by undermining productivity – due to limited focus on, and funds for, training and education – and by continuing to erode international economic organisations and cooperation. In the shorter term, investors will mainly relish the prospect of more tax cuts, further deregulation and the further unleashing of so-called animal spirits in the US economy.</p>
<p>All this means that, from a political perspective, this year will see investors leaning more towards the US than towards Europe – even though US shares and the dollar seem to be overvalued. Europe is faced with too much political uncertainty and it makes too little progress. If Europe wants to be able to compete against giant companies in the US and China, it should not fight internally about a few billion euros more or less for the European budget.</p>
<p>In addition, we believe the immediate external threats for Europe are greater and more urgent than those for the US. We have discussed the pressure on European borders from North Africa and the Middle East. Moreover, Europe is more vulnerable to a decline in global trade than the US. Finally, whichever way you look at it, the EU has been weakened considerably – militarily, politically and economically – by the departure of Britain. The EU has lost the second largest economy and one eighth of its population. One could argue that the EU is able to move ahead now because the obstructionist UK will no longer be able to block policies, but this remains to be seen.</p>
<p>From a political point of view, European shares are therefore less likely to outperform US shares this year. In addition, the euro is unlikely to have a great deal of upside potential against the dollar. However, our technical analysts suspect that European shares could perform slightly better than US shares, based on the current unprecedented outperformance of US shares versus European shares.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the US will certainly be affected by Trump’s actions. Investor confidence is bound to be damaged by Trump’s policy of blocking competition, inflating deficits, alienating allies, undermining the Fed’s independence and neglecting education, and so on. The dollar is likely to become a very weak currency by that time.</p>

<h4 id=""the-us-quietly-moves-ahead"">The US quietly moves ahead</h4>
<p>The US economy will continue to grow by roughly 2%. That is, growth has been below this level in recent quarters, but it is expected to receive a slight boost from the monetary stimulus measures in 2019 – not just in the US but worldwide – stockpiling and not too many setbacks in (global) trade.</p>
<p>After 11 years of growth, there is not much reason to anticipate considerably more. However, a recession is also unlikely. Most recessions occur because central banks apply forceful monetary deceleration, but this prospect is non-existent at this point. Indeed, inflation will remain very low because the forecast is persistent low growth.</p>
<p>However, there is a political risk. Elizabeth Warren could become the next US president. Many of her policies are harmful to (present-day) business. However, the markets are not overly concerned about this. Indeed, the US will not choose a(n) (ultra) left-wing president any time soon. Should this happen, many of Warren’s plans will be watered down considerably by Congress.</p>
<p>Most analysts anticipate that, in view of the above, US economic growth will be at around 2% for the time being, inflation and interest rates will stay at low levels, and the Fed will continue to pursue a loose monetary policy. This is favourable for share prices and negative for the dollar.</p>
<h4 id=""europe-is-vulnerable"">Europe is vulnerable</h4>
<p>Growth forecasts for Europe do not far exceed 1%. Although the trade war will not escalate, it will continue to have a negative impact on global trade. The European economy is very sensitive to this. Furthermore, Brexit stays a fairly uncertain factor. Prolonged uncertainty surrounding Brexit is negative for economic growth of Europe as a whole. However, the biggest problem lies with the banks. European banks generally have a shortage of equity capital and do not earn much from credit supply with the current interest rates. This restricts credit supply considerably, especially because roughly 80% of credit supply in Europe is operated by the banks (while roughly 80% of US credit supply is operated by the capital market).</p>
<p>The current excessively low inflation rate will decline rather than rise, due to the combination of 1% growth (just below potential) and the still available reserve capacity. This is why the European Central Bank (ECB) is pulling out all the stops, purchasing €20bn a month in bonds and creating surplus money. Using forward guidance, the central bank also indicates that it will not raise its short-term interest rates for the time being. The problem is that the ECB has been pursuing a very loose monetary policy for some time, but so far this has not pushed up growth and inflation to any significant extent.</p>
<p>This renders the situation in Europe fairly vulnerable, as the slightest shock could trigger a recession and deflation. This could rapidly turn into a self-sustaining negative deflationary spiral in view of the high debt levels.</p>
<p>Finally, it also plays a role in the background that the European population is going to age fairly quickly – more so than in the US – which means that more and more non-working people will have to be sustained by working people. This is certainly not conducive to growth.</p>
<h4 id=""japan-and-china-are-also-unlikely-to-take-the-lead"">Japan and China are also unlikely to take the lead</h4>
<p>The situation in Japan can be compared to that in Europe, but it is more acute. Growth and inflation expectations are slightly lower than those for Europe. The same applies to inflation. Japan is therefore very vulnerable to a negative shock. This is a particular cause for concern, as Japan is basically powerless in terms of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Public deficits and debts have soared to exceedingly high levels, while the central bank has lowered its rates to the greatest possible extent – even lower interest rates will limit credit supply – and is purchasing bonds and shares on a large scale. It is therefore a miracle that this combination has not yet led to far higher inflation and/or a currency crisis. However, a further deterioration in public finances and/or an even looser monetary policy could bring this about.</p>
<p>Everything is tightly controlled from above in China. The expectation is that Beijing wants to and is able to prevent a considerable slowdown in growth. Nevertheless, the Chinese economy is suffering a great deal from the trade war. In addition, China is unable to apply fiscal and monetary stimulus on a large scale without raising debt to excessively high levels. This is why Chinese economic growth is generally expected to be slightly below 6% next year.</p>
<h4 id=""a-recession-is-unlikely-but-the-scenario-is-not-exactly-favourable"">A recession is unlikely, but the scenario is not exactly favourable</h4>
<p>This situation has two important consequences for the rest of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing overcapacity is evident worldwide in more and more parts of the economy – due to low growth in the industrialised countries, stagnating global trade as a result of the trade war and the slowdown in Chinese growth. This, in turn, exerts downward pressure on wage increases and inflation almost everywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low growth and the trade war are depressing the rate of the Chinese yuan. This also reduces the exchange rates of the relevant currencies in most Asian and other emerging markets. This is basically favourable for their competitiveness, but it does not lead to far more exports as growth is very low everywhere. However, it causes the high dollar debts – which exist in most emerging markets – to increasingly bear down on the relevant economies. This therefore prevents the relevant markets from providing their economies with more monetary stimulus. Many emerging markets therefore hope that the Fed’s loose monetary policy will soon lead to a lower dollar exchange rate. However, this is a slow process because a very loose monetary policy is being pursued everywhere, and US interest rates are still positive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the general expectation is that the global economy will avoid a recession in 2020, although growth and inflation will stay at low levels. It is therefore also likely that central banks will continue to pursue a very loose monetary policy. The central banks themselves indicate that this might not be enough to prevent the economy from sliding down after all, and they are therefore increasingly calling on the fiscal authorities to come to the rescue. However, policymakers find it very difficult to accommodate this request, as long as the economies continue to grow.</p>
<p>For many years, they have announced that public deficits should be reduced rather than the other way around. This cannot simply be turned upside down now – without a crisis. In view of the above, it is not surprising that interest rates are at very low levels everywhere and will, on balance, likely remain low in 2020 (but we expect a great deal more volatility in the currency markets).</p>

<p><em>Investors would be forgiven for thinking they are having a rough time right now. In a late cycle economic environment that has ‘change’ and ‘unpredictability’ as its central themes, growth is slowing, trade tensions persist and interest rates remain low.</em></p>
<p>Against this unsettled backdrop, J.P. Morgan Liquidity Investment PeerView<sup>SM</sup> survey takes the pulse and temperature of those at the sharp end of economic activity: the treasurers, CIOs and other cash decision makers from across the spectrum of business sectors and geographies. The survey highlights key trends and allows businesses to compare their cash investment practices with their peers, enabling cash investors to better understand where they are positioned on the continuum of success.</p>
<h4 id=""investment-focus"">Investment focus</h4>
<p>Despite the recent complete regulatory overhaul in the key markets, a notable finding of this year’s survey is that <strong>demand for money market funds (MMFs) is still strong</strong>. Even as the market outlook evolves, stable/constant/low volatility net asset value (NAV) MMFs are still the most widely permitted investment (in 92% of investment policies).Most survey respondents (75%) say they are planning to maintain their holdings of stable NAV MMFs, based on the market outlook for the coming year.</p>
<p>Overall, firms in the Americas are likely to have a significantly broader <strong>scope of investments</strong> versus their European and Asia Pacific (APAC) peers. Permitted instruments include MMFs, commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper, traditional repurchase agreements, corporate debt securities, variable-rate demand notes, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal notes.</p>
<p>Permitted investments have the potential to evolve fairly rapidly, with almost half of respondents globally <strong>reviewing their investment policy at least once a year</strong>. Some 62% of APAC respondents review their investment policy more frequently, far higher than in the US (39%) and Europe (48%).</p>
<p><strong>APAC firms are significantly more likely to make changes</strong> to their investment policy by adding or removing instruments compared with companies elsewhere. Stable and floating MMFs top the list of instruments APAC investors expect to add (21%); non-rated MMFs top the list of instruments they expect to remove (14%).</p>
<p>When it comes to <strong>mitigating the impact of negative interest rates</strong> on euro- and/or sterling-denominated investments, term deposits continue to be the most popular investment solution (62%), followed by ultra-short duration bond funds (23%). Willingness to take on more credit risk is limited, with 68% of euro- and sterling-denominated investors saying they have not changed their policies in this area.</p>
<p>Looking at cash flow forecasting, just under half (44%) of firms are able to <strong>accurately forecast their cash flows</strong> out quarterly or longer. Some 59% of companies in the Americas have this capability, compared with only 36% in APAC.</p>
<h4 id=""other-trends"">Other trends</h4>
<p><strong>Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments are gaining ground</strong>, with 19% of respondents globally now using ESG criteria to screen their investments, and 25% planning to start doing so within the next two years. Corporate social responsibility topped the list of reasons for factoring in ESG, followed by a need to meet stakeholder expectations. Regulatory pressure had a much smaller effect, except in APAC.</p>
<p>With the need to optimise processes, ensure wider visibility and remove potentially damaging siloes of data, <strong>treasury management systems (TMSs)</strong> are now used by 61% of respondents.  Core financial processes still account for the lion’s share of use, notably cash management and treasury accounting (98%), investments and debt management (67%) and FX and interest rate risk management (50%).</p>
<p>APAC investors are more likely to use systems developed in-house (43%), whereas only 12% in the US and 11% in EMEA do so. This may suggest that either the systems market in APAC is under-penetrated, or that businesses are more prepared to invest in in-house talent.</p>
<p>Finally, in this turbulent year, it is no surprise that cash decision makers are concerned about <strong>political risk</strong>, with 67% of respondents highlighting it as their top investment challenge. One-fifth of APAC investors consider rising credit risk and default risk in China to be major investment challenges, far more than their counterparts in EMEA and the US. The landscape for cash investors is evolving as rapidly as it has ever done, making it essential to keep up to date with trends and best practices across the industry.</p>

<p>For anyone working in corporate treasury, the past 20 years have been something of a rollercoaster ride. From the introduction of the euro and the financial crisis of 2007/8, to the implications of Brexit and the ongoing tensions between the US and China, treasurers have continually had to adapt, learn and grow. They have also had to utilise skills today that they never thought they’d need 20 years ago.</p>
<h4 id=""from-euro-boom"">From euro boom…</h4>
<p>The creation of a true single internal market for goods, services, labour and capital was at the heart of the European Union (EU) project moving into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The most high-profile result was the introduction of the euro between 1999 and 2002. Before the euro’s introduction, making and receiving domestic payments was the preserve of local clearing systems, regulated by national and central banks and the governments in each member state.</p>
<p>The European Commission (EC) was keen to make payments across the single currency zone cost as cheap and easy as domestic payments, so the concept of a single euro payments area (SEPA) was born. However, in order to realise its dream, the EC first needed a pan-European automated clearing house.</p>
<p>Step forward STEP2. At the turn of the century, approximately 40 different payment systems were used within the Eurozone, only a few of which were capable of processing cross-border payments. The development of STEP2 in 2004 by the Euro Banking Association was seen as the first truly pan-European payment system for mass payments and an important first step in realising SEPA.</p>
<p>Other milestones in the establishment of SEPA included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The launch of the SEPA Credit Transfer Scheme in January 2008.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The introduction of SEPA Direct Debit Schemes in November 2009.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, according to figures from the European Central Bank (ECB), the number of credit transfers within the euro area increased by 4.7% in 2018 to 21 billion.</p>
<h4 id=""to-global-bust"">…to global bust</h4>
<p>Yet while SEPA was being developed, dark clouds were starting to roll in.</p>
<p>In 2007, a crisis in the sub-prime mortgage market in the US meant these clouds quickly escalated into a thunderstorm. The problems in the US rapidly developed into an international banking crisis, starting with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on 15<sup>th</sup> September 2008. Major bail-outs were called for across the world, and the global economy plummeted. The crisis also triggered numerous regulatory changes that have affected treasurers both directly and indirectly, including Basel III and money market fund reform in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Prior to the financial crisis, the idea that banks should be seen as a source of counterparty risk was almost unthinkable – or at least a much lesser concern than supplier risk. Post-crisis however, treasurers learnt that counterparties could fail with very little warning. As a result, the focus on counterparty risk within corporate treasury departments increased substantially.</p>
<p>The crisis also had implications for credit ratings. In the early 2000s, most corporate treasurers considered credit ratings alone to be adequate for the purpose of measuring the level of their counterparty exposures. But this changed irrevocably with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which at the time had a rating that placed it safely within the accepted ‘investment grade’ band.</p>
<p>“Lehman’s was still rated ‘A’ when it collapsed, which gave treasurers an opportunity to reassess their reliance on rating agencies,” says David Blair, Managing Director at Acarate Consulting.</p>
<p>Yet while most treasurers today still view credit ratings as an important measure of counterparty risk, they are using a wider range of sources to monitor the major forms of counterparty exposure. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information platforms such as Bloomberg and Reuters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private/public financial data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industry and peer insights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the high focus on credit and counterparty risk has subsided somewhat since 2007/8, it still remains one of the most important concerns for corporate treasurers. Back then, a significant deterioration of credit happened worldwide. As a result, government support assumptions for large banks have been scaled back significantly in most developed countries. Yet despite this, banks have continued to grow even larger, more complex and more interconnected.</p>
<p>Visibility over counterparty risk is essential when it comes to managing and mitigating that risk effectively. This includes not only managing the risk on bank deposits and cash balances, but also understanding how market events may affect outstanding derivatives.</p>
<h4 id=""from-technology-solutions"">From technology solutions…</h4>
<p>Despite the inherent risks in today’s treasury landscape, at the turn of the century the technology many corporate treasuries used simply wasn’t up to scratch. It was often neglected, with IT departments frequently controlling the technology budget and choices – rather than treasury having its say. For many companies, the only treasury technology used was the humble spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Yet soon after the financial crisis shook the world, senior management started to demand timelier and more accurate financial information – meaning treasury started to have a louder voice than ever before when it came to the technology agenda.</p>
<p>“Although Excel spreadsheets still underpin most corporate functions today, we have seen evolving technologies shift the focus away from spreadsheets and into more robust data warehouses,” says Ken Bugayong, Treasury Manager at Expedia Group. Information – and the activities it supports, such as improved cash visibility, accurate forecasting and effective risk assessment – is now even more crucial in an age when the pressure to deliver is greater than ever.</p>
<p>Michael Juen, Chief Customer Officer of treasury management software provider Bellin, believes that treasurers of today are key stakeholders and strategists with greater clout and influence. “With a modern, integrated, one-platform TMS, gone are the days of redundant data entry,” he says. “Instead of a lack of transparency – which didn’t just lead to an incomplete picture on which to base your decision-making, but also represented a huge security risk – treasurers are now much more in control.”</p>
<h4 id=""to-a-relationship-evolution"">…to a relationship evolution</h4>
<p>Whether you see them as valuable commercial partners, or as a necessary evil, banks are a major part of just about every enterprise. Given the role they play in the life of a corporate treasury operation, the relationship between banker and treasurer should almost certainly be more than just one of convenience.</p>
<p>Back in the early 2000s, treasurers often saw themselves as driving the relationship with their banking partners, organising formal review meetings and having regular informal conversations, for example. This all changed after the financial crisis, with treasurers placing a greater emphasis on seeking guidance from their banks.</p>
<p>“Treasury teams (of today) are looking to understand best practice and whether the approach they are taking to managing their investments reflects the ‘best in class’ ideas,” says Jim Fuell, Managing Director, Head of Global Liquidity Sales International at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “Treasury teams continue to seek our guidance when it comes to the most appropriate levers, be it liquidity, credit, or duration for generating incremental return.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Pryor, Head of FX Sales at Investec, agrees that the depth of service has moved on. “Twenty years ago, you’d be happy just to be able to speak to someone,” he says. “Today treasurers do expect a personal service, tailored research and proactivity. Every bank should understand the companies they’re doing business with.”</p>
<p>There have certainly been some big changes over the past two decades. The breadth of products available has increased significantly, with more hedging products, more market counterparts and more choice on where to do business.</p>
<p>As Fuell observes, “Product pushers are a dying breed, so treasury teams will continue to look for partners who understand global short-term markets and who can bring their knowledge, global reach and expertise to bear in managing their investments.”</p>
<h4 id=""emerging-promise"">Emerging promise</h4>
<p>The choice of where to do business has also grown considerably in the last two decades.</p>
<p>Back in the early 2000s, the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China) were the talk of the town. Heralded as hot investment opportunities, they were seen as the future of globalisation, designed to challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>The meteoric rise of China has been particularly noticeable over the past two decades. Some 40 years ago, China’s economy was roughly the same size as that of the Netherlands – now it is the second-largest economy on the planet, behind the US. Economically and politically, China enmeshed itself in the global community it had once eschewed by joining the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001 and relaxing the renminbi’s strict peg to the dollar four years later.</p>
<p>When the financial crisis struck and commodity prices collapsed, it hit Brazil and Russia hard. China and India, however, immersed in countless global supply chains, proved to be much more resilient. Following the crisis, China unveiled a huge stimulus package that kept its economy afloat. China’s currency is now an integral part of the basket of currencies that make up the IMF’s special drawing rights (SDRs). Nevertheless, growth in both China and India has slowed in recent years: China, for example, has seen GDP growth slow from 9.5% in 2011 to 6.6% in 2018.</p>
<p>While the focus on BRIC economies has died down somewhat, emerging markets remain a force to be reckoned with. Moving forward, economists point to Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam as countries with the most exciting futures – simply because they are growing rapidly, are open to trade and dependent on exports.</p>
<p>Trade with the Far East will certainly continue to be a theme moving forwards, as the ongoing trade war between China and the US sees no sign of abating. With a presidential election around the corner, treasurers will be looking both east and west for some time to come.</p>
<h4 id=""business-as-usual"">Business as usual?</h4>
<p>It’s clear that two decades of economic uncertainty has made the role of today’s treasurer a much more challenging and complex one – and this won’t change anytime soon. Navigating the investment landscape is one area that has brought new challenges following the arrival of low interest rates in the wake of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>“Today’s low yield environment has forced many asset managers into more illiquid or higher risk securities in order to provide expected returns to clients; something that the regulators are becoming increasingly concerned about,” comments Neil Hutchison, Executive Director, Lead Portfolio Manager for Managed Reserves Portfolios in Europe at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p>
<p>“This year we have had a number of negative headlines, including the gating of a high-profile equity fund and questions raised around other fixed income structures,” he adds. “In this environment, cash solutions that maintain enhanced market liquidity definitely are of increasing importance, not just for corporate treasurers but also longer-term investors.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-road-to-2040"">The road to 2040</h4>
<p>While it’s difficult to predict how interest rates will evolve in the coming years, today’s savvy treasurers know that their role will continue to change on many different levels. After all, there is no escaping the fact that 20 years from now, the world will be a much more digital one. Banks and fintechs will have to be much more proactive in raising awareness and meeting the issues faced by their clients, partly by offering solutions and alternatives. Treasurers will have to adapt their operations as a result.</p>
<h4 id=""so-what-will-treasury-look-like-in-2040"">So what will treasury look like in 2040?</h4>
<p>For some, the idea that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will take over the treasury function is far-fetched. Proponents of this view believe the clue is in the name – ‘artificial’ intelligence, rather than real intelligence based on real knowledge, real experience and real judgements made in real time.</p>
<p>For others, however, it would be wrong to sit back and believe that the treasury of 2040 won’t have changed much. To take just one example, there is no escaping the fact that the rise of real-time payments (RTP) across the globe is inevitable. Whilst the UK, the Nordic countries and India have already embraced RTP, others have yet to do so.</p>
<h4 id=""but-this-will-undoubtedly-change"">But this will undoubtedly change</h4>
<p>Pulat Yunusmetov, Regional Treasury Manager at Danone, shares this view. “There is a lot of fear in treasury that jobs will be affected,” he says. “However, I believe that the impact will be a positive one, as we will really have more time, and the tools, to evolve into strategic partners and work on new products and services proactively to help our businesses to grow. By using the external products and knowledge of internal operations, Treasury should be able to advise on new ways that it can help to bring in extra sales, or extra savings to the company.”</p>
<p>It seems that treasury mustn’t be afraid of the oncoming technology revolution. Rather than completely tearing up the existing systems landscape, consolidation will be key. A digital transformation is coming, but it will be a slow, gradual process. It will be a voyage of discovery – a journey that treasury is already well-versed in.</p>
<p>Today’s treasury has proven itself to be incredibly resilient through weathering economic and political storms – but it will only be through treasury’s ability to adapt to new technology, and bringing its own expertise to bear on it, that will see a brighter future. After all, no one can predict what the next 20 years has in store for treasury.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Recruiting today’s treasurers</h2>
<p>The past 20 years has seen recruitment in the treasury industry change significantly. The rise of globalisation, the onslaught of new technologies and the pressure of regulations and compliance have all played a significant part in this transformation.</p>
<p>According to Laura White, Operations Director at The Treasury Recruitment Company, compared to the early 2000s, treasury has become much more recognised and valued. As a result, businesses have started to invest more heavily in the growth and development of their teams. “Nowadays, there is a huge demand for candidates with strong project management and systems experience, driven by the desire for employers to build teams that can manage multi-dimensional tasks,” she says.</p>
<p>“The real positive here is that whatever your treasury expertise, the opportunities for advancement and progression are far greater than ever before. For the first time in over a decade, there are more jobs available than there are candidates looking for new roles.”</p>
<p>As the pace of change in the industry shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon, skills such as relationship building and communication, strategic thinking and openness to change have become increasingly important.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The international system largely designed by Washington following the Second World War is generally referred to as the ‘international rules-based order’. This sounds very vague, since everywhere there is order there are certain rules. However, what analysts mean by this is that states have jointly – with a great deal of American influence – created a system in recent decades to shape international political, diplomatic, financial, economic and military relations. A system partially based on the free market – to a greater or lesser extent depending on the area – in which a certain consensus has come to dominate the basic rules (although, needless to say, a considerable amount of hypocrisy and opportunism is evident on a regular basis), in which organisations such as the UN and the WTO were developed, and in which the US assumed a leading role as the world’s policeman and supplier of the global reserve currency.</p>
<p>Due to this foundation underlying the global economy, market thinking steadily expanded, capital flashed across the world, global trade ran at full speed and growth steadily continued. It looked like the triumph of globalisation and the definitive victory of capitalist (social) democracy.</p>
<p>However, factors such as 9/11 and China’s individual interpretation of a market economy, for example, made it clear that not everyone was willing to conform to an American/Western model. The financial and economic crisis of 2008 and the painful aftermath subsequently resulted in more and more reservations about Western liberal democracy as a desirable political-economic model, not only on the part of China and Russia, for instance, but also among voters in Western democracies.</p>
<p>As an example, Trump won the election because many Americans were completely fed up with the political establishment and Trump promised to ‘drain the swamp’. Little has come of this so far. Instead, the existing swamp seems to have become even muddier.</p>
<p>The leader of the West is faltering at the very time when the Western political and economic model is sorely in need of support. Of course, America still has virtually immeasurable military and economic power, but legitimacy and authority are required to use this power as effectively and efficiently as possible. Trump &amp; Co have caused serious damage to America’s legitimacy and authority as world leader with inconsistent, confused, short-sighted and sometimes entirely irrational actions that often seem to have no purpose other than to boost the ego and settle personal accounts – as opposed to serving the nation’s interests.</p>
<p>Under the post-1945 Pax Americana, American political authority and legitimacy generally coincided with the economic and military (super)power of the US. Many countries accepted the leadership role of the US, not because they were forced to do so by Washington, but also because, in their view, America rightly claimed this role and was willing to let others share in the proceeds of the US-led system. Other countries were less willing, but simply could not ignore the dominance of Washington.</p>
<p>The former group of countries increasingly wonders whether America is still entitled to and can be trusted with this position on the throne. The latter group eagerly uses the weakening power of the US to its advantage. This is actually easier because China, for example, is already the largest economy in the world according to some criteria and also because new ways of waging war work out to the advantage of the challengers and underdogs (for example, Russia has taken over Crimea and parts of the Ukraine using hybrid warfare).</p>
<p>These developments, including the enormous economic and military advances that China in particular has achieved over the past few decades, mean that the trade war between Washington and Beijing is far more than just an argument about access to each other’s markets. The trade war is part of the race for global political, economic, technological, financial and military leadership this century. This battle has only just begun. A partial trade agreement will therefore certainly not bring lasting peace between the two giants.</p>
<p>This is also because international institutions that might have been able to keep things under control are becoming increasingly paralysed. The UN is struggling with massive deficits because many members fail to pay their ‘contribution’. The US has by far the largest outstanding bill. Trump has made it clear several times that he does not care much about the UN. The UN secretary general has sounded the alarm, stating he will no longer be able to pay all the salaries by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The White House also has little sympathy for NATO, WTO and other international partnerships. Because of a US veto the WTO is also at risk of becoming paralysed at the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to weakening international organisations that were previously considered to support US power on balance, Trump has also torpedoed a number of international trade, security and other treaties.</p>
<p>Previous governments went to great lengths to weave a web of overwhelming political, economic and military power which was reinforced by alliances, partnerships, treaties and international organisations. This web is now slowly but surely being pulled apart by the US and other players who eagerly capitalise on areas where the US trips up.</p>
<p>In the area of free trade, for example, it looks as though the whole world is engaged in a trade war. However, many countries are quietly continuing to conclude trade agreements while sidestepping the US. The American weakening is also reflected in countries increasingly hedging their bets on Washington by getting into the good graces of China and/or Russia. For example, NATO member Turkey has decided to buy missile systems from Russia, defying the US. The same phenomenon is evident in Asia where hitherto loyal US partners increasingly tend to balance their relations with the US and China. A case in point was the Filipino president explicitly announcing a pivotal move from the US to China.</p>
<p>And even in Europe, countries are wondering how much loyalty they should bestow upon the transatlantic alliance and to what extent they should accept Chinese capital and influence. For instance, the US is putting considerable pressure on European governments to keep Huawei out when it comes to the ICT projects of governments. This pressure is certainly not always successful.</p>
<p>Even in the US, there are countless examples of behaviour being adjusted so as not to offend China. Marriott, Apple, the NBA and many more kowtowed to China; an authoritarian regime located thousands of miles away increasingly exerts censorship on the US.</p>
<p>These examples show the extent to which the position of the US in the world is weakening. This will be reinforced now that Washington has impeachment fever. Trump has opted for a battle plan that comes down to an attack on the constitutional state by refusing to cooperate in investigations by Congress, keeping witnesses away and basically claiming that the President is all-powerful, can do as he pleases and is above the law. A constitutional crisis looms. All this while the elections are fast approaching.</p>
<p>In other words, Washington will be far more preoccupied with domestic problems in the period ahead – and far less with coming up with robust and coherent foreign and economic policies that also take into account the interests of allies.</p>
<p>All in all, the outlook for the US economy is fairly poor from a political point of view. This occurs in a climate in which the US has largely supported the global economy in recent years. Other major economies are faltering discernibly and a further weakening of the US economy will only accelerate this slowdown. In short, growth prospects for the global economy are not getting any better due to domestic US political developments and the international policies of Washington.</p>

<p><em>For many years, the West has been trying to compensate for the decline in its competitiveness by pursuing ever more macroeconomic stimulus. In the US, Trump is trying to encourage the Fed to lower interest rates considerably faster (partly to absorb the impact of the trade war), while Boris Johnson plans to implement robust fiscal stimulus in the UK, in order to absorb the impact of Brexit. This is why it is currently crucial to assess whether even more stimulus will indeed provide the required compensation. There are a number of reasons to be sceptical.</em></p>
<p>First, more and more economists are concluding that further stimulus leads to less and less additional economic growth. They point out, for example, that the tax cuts implemented in the US at the end of 2017 have boosted profits and share buybacks considerably but this has not led to far higher wage increases or higher economic growth. In 2018, growth was around 3%, but it has since fallen back to approximately 2%.</p>
<p>Second, EMU interest rates have been reduced to -0.4%, and a growing number of bonds are yielding negative interest rates. In spite of this very loose monetary policy, Europe has closely approached a recession and deflation.</p>
<p>Third, debt/GDP ratios have almost reached record levels virtually everywhere in the world. It is essential that asset prices stay high if stimulus is to boost the economy. (This concerns prices of shares, bonds, and property, et cetera.) Failing this, the value of assets will be too low in relation to the debts, as a result of which the debt mountain will collapse.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the central banks are able to control this via monetary policy. If asset prices threaten to decline too much, the central bank will be able to turn on the money tap and boost asset prices. However, share prices in Europe and Japan have failed to reach former highs for a long period of time, despite the fact that an ultra-loose monetary policy has been pursued in these territories. It therefore appears that a very loose monetary policy can be overshadowed by poor underlying fundamentals. The question is whether this will happen now as a result of the trade war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are many doubts about the potential of further monetary easing, as outside the US and China, the scope for further monetary stimulus is very limited. This makes the situation very risky for investors, as it will be much harder for central banks to absorb the impact of any negative shocks; if one or more shocks lead to a rapid increase in credit spreads and leveraged companies experience difficulties to refinance, default rates will go up as a result. A loose monetary policy will barely have any impact here.</p>

<h4 id=""the-dollar-squeeze"">The dollar squeeze</h4>
<p>In addition to the previous points that cast doubt as to whether a looser monetary policy will boost asset prices to far higher levels, there is a risk of a dollar squeeze. The dollar is subject to a number of downward forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is generally argued that the dollar will weaken once the Fed lowers its rates. Interest rates either cannot or have barely any room to decline further in many other countries, as a result of which the interest rate differential shrinks, which is negative for the dollar exchange rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More and more countries mistrust Washington, in the sense that they are concerned that the US will block their dollar assets if they do something that displeases the US. This is why they reduce their dollar reserves. This, in turn, increases the supply of dollars on the foreign exchange market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US could intervene in the foreign exchange market to push down the dollar. Concerns about this alone limit the demand for dollars somewhat. However, we do not want to attach too much weight to this argument, as the government can only sell dollars to a limited extent. The Fed is able to sell far more dollars, but is unlikely to decide to sell dollars any time soon because history shows that interventions will only work if the fundamentals change in tandem and other central banks intervene as well. Both factors are not at issue (at this point).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""upward-forces"">Upward forces</h4>
<p>We believe that these downward forces are eclipsed by upward forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is not the case that other countries do not effect rate cuts or only effect limited rate cuts because their economies are doing well. Their economies generally perform considerably worse than the US economy. However, these countries can no longer counter this effectively because interest rates cannot be reduced any further in practical terms. In a scenario where the US has this scope, the US economy will perform increasingly better than the rest. This means that the highest returns can be achieved in the US. This largely compensates for a shrinking interest rate differential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China has lowered the yuan as a result of the import tariffs. In addition, production chains are at risk. For many emerging markets, this comes down to a deterioration of their competitive position and therefore downward pressure on their currencies. However, said markets cannot allow their currencies to decline extensively because they generally have massive dollar debts. The more their currencies decline against the dollar, the more the dollar debts will bear down on their economies. This is why they generally have no option but to keep their interest rates relatively high. It also means that they can barely compensate for the negative impact of the trade war on their economies. This is currently clearly reflected in stagnating global trade. The emerging markets and Europe rely more on this than the US. This makes it even more appealing to hold dollars, and so on. Once this becomes evident and the dollar exchange rate goes up rather than down, more and more parties outside the US with dollar loans will be inclined to repay their loans ahead of schedule. This, in turn, creates even more demand for dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This brings us to what is perhaps the most important issue: where should investors with a great deal of money consider putting their funds at present? Ultra-low interest rates have made bonds unappealing in many countries, whilst the trade war makes it riskier to invest in shares. The US is the only place where a considerable return can still be achieved. If the dollar also has a good chance of rising, then this is the safest investment at present.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Refinitiv Datastream/ECR Research</em></p>
<p>In conclusion, we foresee financial market volatility continuing in the stock and bond markets, with rising credit spreads as one of the likely outcomes. Additionally, we believe that the dollar will stay a strong currency for the time being and that it will rise against many currencies, possibly resulting in a dollar squeeze. This is unlikely to be changed significantly by a looser monetary policy inside and outside the US.</p>

<p><em>President Trump’s protectionist tendencies and fondness for tariff wars are creating great uncertainties for global markets and corporates. With a number of major battles looming between the White House and Democrats, matters could become even more fraught.</em></p>
<p>Concerns over the US economy are mounting, that much is clear. The main investment banks now think that there is a substantially higher chance of a US recession late this year or early next year.</p>
<p>And with various political issues on the runway for the coming month, it could turn out to be a hot summer in Washington. How the White House handles them could either cheer up the markets or plunge them into deeper gloom. One of them concerns the long running squabbling over a badly-needed act that is meant to boost the US infrastructure.</p>
<p>Also, the debt ceiling needs to be raised again in the autumn or will need to be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, Trump remains resolutely on the tariff warpath so there could well be more market moving events related to that.</p>
<h4 id=""drilling-down-into-the-potholes"">Drilling down into the potholes</h4>
<p>One of Trump’s election promises was to improve roads, ports, airports, and so on. But he has suddenly linked his preparedness to bolster infrastructure to the willingness of the Democrats to stop the investigations into his conduct. He says he is only prepared to be “constructive and cooperative” if they desist.</p>
<p>Congress and the White House also need to come to an agreement on a new (temporary) budget over the coming months. If they do not do so, the doors of US federal buildings and national parks will again be shut, as happened early this year for 35 days.</p>
<p>Since the Republican-dominated Congress enacted the Budget Control Act 2011, which was signed into law by Democratic president Obama to end the Debt Ceiling Crisis, negotiations on federal spending have also turned into an exercise to prevent enormous automatic ‘conjoined’ cutbacks on defence spending as well as non-defence discretionary federal spending.</p>
<p>The idea was to force the two parties to meet each other half way; the Republicans will throw a fit if defence spending is cut substantially, whereas the Democrats will be apoplectic if other public spending goes down the drain. That is to say, the Act is not really intended to be executed but merely to serve as a ‘ploy’ to encourage both parties to come up with well-balanced measures that counteract a mushrooming budget deficit and national debt.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the so-called sequestration did come into force in 2013. Consequently, spending on domestic programmes has been substantially reduced over the 2012-2015 period. Ever since, Congress has managed to raise the automatically imposed spending ceilings and to alleviate the sequester pain. And it has to act again in early October. And as we have seen in the past, the prospect of ill-considered cuts is no guarantee that politicians will go all-out to avoid them.</p>
<p>If the negotiations fail, the Pentagon’s budget will be cut by US$71bn from early 2020 onward. Simultaneously, social and similar spending will be reduced by US$55bn. The White House and Congress have already indicated they would prefer to negotiate a deal that is valid for two years so as to avoid going through the same rigmarole during the 2020 election campaign.</p>
<p>We have the impression that an agreement will be reached on time. However, it is worth remembering most analysts had not expected the shutdown at the start of this year to become a reality, either.</p>
<h4 id=""through-the-debt-ceiling"">Through the debt ceiling</h4>
<p>Roughly at the same time as the budget expires, the US will reach its legal borrowing limit. The debt ceiling was reinstated earlier this year – having been suspended for 12 months – and was tapped again straight away. Thanks to various special measures, the Treasury Department can still pay its bills, but it will run out of money in October/November.</p>
<p>So, unless the ceiling is raised, America might have to default on its public debt. We think there is a low chance that this will happen in reality although the debates on the debt ceiling and budget have merged from time to time. The discussions around the debt ceiling should, however, be taken very seriously.</p>
<h4 id=""trade-war-hots-up"">Trade war hots up</h4>
<p>There is a very real chance that the global trade tension will continue to mount. The world scratched its head again as Trump threw together import tariffs and immigration in order to ratchet up the pressure on Mexico to put a stop to illegal immigration across its borders.</p>
<p>Things appeared to be heading in the right direction for a while, as Washington decided to postpone for six months the introduction of import duties on cars from the EU and Japan while it cancelled tariffs on Canadian and Mexican aluminium and steel.</p>
<p>Next thing we knew – in early May – Trump again went all-out with tariff increases on Chinese products, the threat to expand levies to all Chinese imports, and a boycott of Huawei as he also put pressure on other countries to ban Huawei.</p>
<p>Congress has tried to rein in Trump earlier via a Resolution of Disapproval after he declared an emergency at the US-Mexican border. However, he vetoed the resolution and the Democrats did not manage to muster enough Republican votes to overturn the veto.</p>
<h4 id=""inflated-ego-or-justified-self-confidence"">Inflated ego or justified self-confidence?</h4>
<p>Trump’s policies are making more and more Republican politicians uneasy but a true tipping point is nowhere in sight. The ranks have remained closed and Trump clearly feels he has the upper hand vis-á-vis Mexico (and Canada). Trump also believes he can trump China. Based on the data he has a point. Twenty-five percent of Chinese exports go to the US whereas 8% of US exports end up in China. Plus, less than 1% of the US economy is linked to exports to China while 5% of the Chinese economy depends on sales to the Americans.</p>
<p>This does not take into account that international production chains are intertwined so much that the US is connected with China in far more ways. The Chinese are sitting on a gigantic mountain of US treasuries, which they could deploy as a weapon. Add to this that Trump is more beholden to his voters in the first instance – as he is operating within a democratic system and faces an election in 2020 – compared to Xi Jinping in China. On top of this, Xi acts as a strongman who can ill afford to lose face while it is easier for China to underpin its economy with monetary and fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p>The trade war is part of a power game between the US and China that could go on for years, with a real risk of the world again being divided into two blocks. To sum, global trade tensions will likely continue for a long time to come.</p>
<h4 id=""new-era"">New era</h4>
<p>President Trump often appears to view the stock market as a success benchmark, yet he is now focusing on immigration and trade and is combining them regardless of the fact that markets have been protesting.</p>
<p>Some experts are saying that Trump heralds a new era as they refer to the past two centuries. Global exports increased fiftyfold in real terms between 1815 and 1913. Everything changed, however, in the aftermath of the First World War and during the Great Depression. Americans came up with the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Act; the British no longer did everything to promote free trade; and Germany set up the Reichsmark Block. We are seeing similar fragmentation now with a paralysed WTO, Trump’s aversion to multilateral agreements, and China’s eternal preference for bilateral negotiations. These developments create more uncertainty for businesses as enterprises lose their appetite for investment.</p>
<p>All of this implies that significant political risks are attached to the US and they could have a strong impact on the rest of the global economy. A government shutdown looms after the summer; not long afterwards politicians will have to take action to stop America from officially becoming a defaulter. Meanwhile, trade and geopolitical tensions are mounting while Trump is convinced that he can score at the upcoming elections with hard-line standpoints on immigration and trade. We do not think an infrastructural package will bring substantial relief.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2 id=""financial-institutions-different-needs-same-goals"">Financial institutions: different needs, same goals</h2>
<br/>
<p>The financial institutions (FI) sector, formed of banks and non-banks, is characterised by an extensive subset of sectors, including banks, insurers, asset managers, aircraft leasing companies, card schemes, central counterparties and governmental agencies.</p>
<p>Whilst it may appear difficult to pinpoint a consistent need across this broad sectoral remit, it does in fact harbour many shared elements, says Chris Jameson, head of Financial Institutions Sales, GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are common challenges and opportunities across the FI space – and technology can be the unifying factor. Principal amongst opportunities, he notes, is the real-time sharing of rich data. Where speed and efficiency may not always have been part of FI payment flows, technology can deliver impressive results for bank and non-bank FIs alike.</p>
<h4 id=""keeping-it-real-time"">Keeping it real-time</h4>
<p>With around 28 countries having implemented the necessary infrastructure, real-time payments are becoming the de facto norm. For FI players seeking greater process efficiencies, Jameson believes that connectivity into these mechanisms is essential. And with SWIFT gpi uptake gathering momentum, the richness of data shared in the bank space is taking a major step forward too, as participants begin leveraging a real-time, end-to-end view of payment status.</p>
<p>Another opportunity for FIs is around KYC streamlining. In banking, KYC has long been a challenge from a regulatory compliance, legal and technical perspective. However, notes Jameson, the results of The Wolfsberg Correspondent Banking Due Diligence Questionnaire (a 2018 revision of its 2004 Anti Money Laundering Questionnaire for Correspondent Banks) demonstrates how the sector is cooperating to achieve KYC process standardisation and simplification.</p>
<p>This collaborative stance is strongly supported by technology, with a number of central KYC repositories facilitating inter-usability of KYC records across the sector. Again, SWIFT, which has the broadest reach of all providers, is becoming the leading service provider.</p>
<p>With this clear willingness to cooperate and standardise, the next step is to digitise KYC documentation, says Jameson. E-signatures and document exchange via web portals is something that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is already offering clients in the US, he explains. “There are still challenges around the legal acceptance of digital signatures in some jurisdictions but extending their use across the banking landscape is an important part of simplifying and enhancing the KYC process.”</p>
<p>One of the main threats in a digitised FI world – and indeed most others – is that of cybercrime. Jameson cites SWIFT’s Customer Security Programme (CSP) as a significant step forwards in the reinforcement of global banking system security. By strengthening the links in that system, and helping the weakest links to protect against incursion, it reinforces the message that the sector is working as one in the face of pernicious cybercriminals.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-to-the-fore"">Treasury to the fore</h4>
<p>At the highest level, the FI sector is making bold strides towards efficiency. The role of the treasurer in facilitating positive change is extensive, says Jameson. At this level, the treasurer often acts as the crucial interface between operational teams, business unit owners and client relationships. But in the last decade, the scope and responsibility of treasury has grown even more in importance, he notes. “It has become an area for significant efficiency gains, cost reduction and innovation.”</p>
<p>This evolution has seen the need for treasury to be at the forefront of available technology, including the emergence of innovations from the fintech community and banking sector, increasingly in partnership. Being at the cutting edge is potentially a means of enabling success, not just for treasury but for their business as a whole, notes Jameson. “Efficiencies delivered by the right tools can have a positive knock-on effect, right across the business lines that treasury is supporting.”</p>
<h4 id=""virtual-success"">Virtual success</h4>
<p>Success stories are often found where a well-resourced treasury has secured senior executive buy-in for efficiency-focused projects. Where industrial sectors have made huge leaps forward in this respect, a transaction-heavy sector such as insurance is only now beginning to leverage technology towards this end, notes Jameson.</p>
<p>In this setting, a solution such as virtual cards uses traditional card payment rails but diverts those payments through an alternate channel to gain advantage. The structure enables companies to extend payments terms, as before, but then improve business processes and exert tighter control over their payments. Indeed, it is the richness of data now made available that affords them far greater transactional transparency and understanding, explains Jameson.</p>
<p>A case in point is Amazon Business which is partnering with Mastercard and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to enable procurement teams to acquire invoice-level data about their purchases through the bank’s online portal. In this context, treasury will often be the bridge to the bank, further heightening the importance of the role.</p>
<p>Continuing the virtual theme, Bank of America Merrill Lynch virtual accounts have been facilitating improved collections and reconciliations for longer than most providers. “We have a strong understanding of how to structure and generate benefit from virtual accounts,” says Jameson.</p>
<p>Virtual accounts are beginning to progress from manufacturing into the non-bank FI space. Here, the ability to match receivables based on a unique virtual account number that each client is given “makes the reconciliation process so much more efficient”.</p>
<p>In a non-FI context, virtual accounts are often deployed in an in-house bank armed with a ‘payment of behalf of’ structure. However, Jameson notes, in the FI space, for major consumer-based players such as insurers, it is likely to be reconciliations of receipts where the virtual format “really comes into its own”.</p>
<h4 id=""cutting-edge"">Cutting edge</h4>
<p>Whilst many non-bank FIs may not have had the time nor capacity to focus on innovative solutions, Jameson notes that as their core systems – ERPs or TMSs – are upgraded, the technological platform from which they can build out new efficiencies emerges. It is then the role of the relationship bank to understand the challenges of the client, introducing innovation where it is an appropriate means of solving each pain point.</p>
<p>There is a persistent conversation around AI, robotics and blockchain in the FI context. Blockchain is still some way off, he believes, but AI is “very real”. There is an opportunity here for banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch to use AI as a way of simplifying and improving its back office functions, with robotics already in place to support some of that activity.</p>
<p>As the technology extends to client-facing solutions, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in partnership with a fintech, has created intelligent receivables (IR). This uses AI, machine learning and optical character recognition to match incoming payments with disparate remittance data.</p>
<p>IR identifies payers, associating their payments with remittances that are received separately. It then scans the remittance email inbox for information, enabling it to match payments to open receivables using the enriched remittance data. IR can read free-formatted emails, attachments and even access web portals using its Web Crawler feature. Payments that are matched are posted to the ERP on a straight through basis; those that can’t are shifted to an exception portal to be manually matched.</p>
<p>When an operative manually matches the payments and remittance information in the exception portal, the solution uses machine learning to analyse and follow the steps taken. Next time a payment is made, it will replicate those corrective steps, attempting to post it straight through, ultimately removing most of the manual reconciliations work.</p>
<h4 id=""journey-ahead"">Journey ahead</h4>
<p>Clearly not all treasuries are using these innovative solutions but many are in a position to learn from the early adopters across the sectors. In the FI space, insurers are making encouraging noises in this respect; there may be a longer journey ahead than perhaps those in the consumer, retail and healthcare industries but, as Jameson has said, the banks have a responsibility to bring every client up to speed.</p>
<p>The banks themselves are constantly working on platform upgrades. Some have embraced the opportunity to partner with the fintech community (Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s IR is a prime example). Arguably, the discovery of “viable and relevant” innovations via this route is necessary to meet the rapidly evolving needs of business. “We can then offer guidance to our FI clients on what we are doing, sharing the innovation process and exploring the build-versus-buy or partner pathways,” says Jameson.</p>
<p>Every innovative project requires a strong set of drivers. Where efficiency is targeted, cost savings are often at the helm. In a sector such as transaction banking or insurance, the essence of success is partly defined by volumes processed. Improving processes supporting the volumes can deliver significant benefits. But using the right tools can deliver enhanced visibility too, empowering more timely decisions.</p>
<p>“In a world where market events can rapidly force industry change, access to real-time information and payment capabilities is giving treasurers the opportunity to be more agile on behalf of the lines of business they are supporting. Bank of America Merrill Lynch refers to this as Intelligent Treasury which is Powered by People, Driven by Technology,” says Jameson.</p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch undertakes to help and support such clients, raising awareness of what it sees across the sectors, and discussing what it has achieved itself and with its partners. “In this sector, there is considerable difference between the requirements of a bank, an insurance company and an aircraft leasing firm, but all are looking for efficiency. As advocates for our clients, we are there to support their broader enterprise-wide goals.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2 id=""consumer-and-retail-ensuring-the-customer-is-always-right"">Consumer and retail: ensuring the customer is always right</h2>
<br/>
<p>Consumer and retail (C&amp;R) is in the midst of a rapidly changing environment. For Jay Norris, Global Transaction Services C&amp;R Corporate Sales Executive, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, this transformational period should be embraced by both corporate and bank stakeholders alike.</p>
<p>With a blend of common and specific impact points across C&amp;R, where multiple sub-sectors are operating, the needs of all stakeholders harbour complexity and, given the speed of change across the board, urgency.</p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch, with its own vast direct retail experience, has first-hand experience of meeting the wants and needs of clients in this sector. On the premise that ‘the customer is always right’, delivering the most appropriate platforms and experience is essential to retain the competitive edge.</p>
<p>In the banking sector that serves both retail customers and corporates operating in the C&amp;R sector, this necessarily translates into major platform migrations and integration work, notes Norris. It is an imperative equally true for many corporates in the C&amp;R space.</p>
<p>The reason in both cases is simple. A typically disparate combination of core systems (ERPs and, for corporates, TMSs) often lacks useful connectivity. This lack can present a serious challenge to achieving visibility over data, and subsequently, the flexibility and optimal performance that this facilitates.</p>
<p>The issue is only amplified by the need for a rapid response created by the current pressured trading environment. The ability to facilitate true visibility in cash forecasting, in particular, is inhibited by disparate platforms. Leveraging data, market intelligence and innovative technology has become an essential part of securing visibility, process fluidity and agility, especially given the limited resources typically available to treasury, says Norris.</p>
<h4 id=""digital-drivers"">Digital drivers</h4>
<p>But there is a strong external pressure on C&amp;R sector treasuries to become more agile too. This is being driven by major changes in customer buying behaviour. Preferences are shifting in terms of the nature of preferred goods and services (with health and experience-based products, for example, on a steep upward curve). Digital touchpoints are also becoming the norm in most markets, with the prevalence of mobile devices and reliable infrastructure enabling e-commerce to flourish.</p>
<p>Indeed, the C&amp;R sector has become a story characterised by digitisation. And just as financial institutions have had to repurpose, and in some cases reinvent, their organisational structures to meet these new demands, so traditional C&amp;R players are also being drawn towards the advantages of digitisation. “In this rapidly evolving environment, there are new and disruptive entrants in the markets; existing players are seeing these as both a threat and an opportunity,” says Norris.</p>
<p>He sees the perceptive traditional retailers analysing their marketplaces and expanding into e-commerce to combat the major online retailers. To be able to do this with sufficient speed, some traditional players have made strategic acquisitions, enabling them to build out their response to how customers want to shop now, and how and when they wish their purchases to be delivered.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-to-the-rescue"">Treasury to the rescue</h4>
<p>If within the C&amp;R sector, technology is both driver and enabler, its treasury functions are perfectly poised to make sense of these changes, says Norris. At the root of this is a fundamental change in approach to technology.</p>
<p>In many cases, the retail experience that has been made easier through online and mobile is beginning to influence how shoppers’ expectations are being translated into their roles as employees. There is an increasing desire to be able to use devices in a professional setting that offer the same level of user experience that is often found in the domestic context: simplicity, clarity and fluidity.</p>
<p>This, he feels, is bringing treasurers and banking partners together in the quest to deliver that experience. In doing so, the advantages of optimisation through digitisation are beginning to infiltrate and reshape a host of corporate processes and channels, from payments and collections, to forecasting and risk management – and many points in between.</p>
<p>As partners in delivering the response to this changing environment, treasurers have earned a seat at the table – and a broader set of responsibilities – notes Norris. “They are now looking at how to support the growth of the company, not just deliver a solid back office function.” Treasury is now so much more of a collaborative function with a common aim. Indeed, working with marketing teams and suppliers, treasurers are helping to analyse data and model customer behaviours with the aim of forming a targeted growth strategy.</p>
<p>Given that C&amp;R customers have increasingly demanding expectations, any technological response will have to address their needs at an ever more localised level; for a far-reaching international business this can be challenging, says Norris. Solutions must also be future-proofed as far as possible, placing the emphasis on engaging with the right technology from the outset.</p>
<p>In this setting, he sees forward-looking treasurers in C&amp;R “taking the lead in their organisations and helping other functions to realise their goals through appropriate solutions”. With treasury being tasked to do ‘more with less’ – continuing to manage the fundamentals whilst keeping up with rapid change – it requires acceptance and understanding of new digital models.</p>
<p>The successful treasurer, in an equally successful organisation, will therefore have to be proactive in their approach. Undertaking research and pushing their banks and other partners to provide answers, and developing a consultative relationship, should now be par for the course. “The more informed the treasurer,” notes Norris, “the more able they are to push their providers into developing their solutions in the ways that suit their business needs.”</p>
<h4 id=""sector-solutions"">Sector solutions</h4>
<p>In the C&amp;R sector, the kind of products that Bank of America Merrill Lynch delivers have a strong focus on trade and supply chain finance (SCF), says Norris. “What’s really important for this sector is to ensure there is no disruption in the supply chain; the right product in the right place at the right time is critical.”</p>
<p>The current geopolitical environment featuring, for example, the trade relations between the US and China, and Brexit uncertainties, unsettles supply chain optimisation. Foresight and planning aid the ability to be proactive but businesses also need to be able to respond rapidly to challenges or opportunities as they arise.</p>
<p>With Bank of America Merrill Lynch continuing to develop its SCF programme, it has invested in the ‘distribute’ model, enabling sponsor and investment bank partners to widen the opportunity for clients to benefit from this form of funding. By leveraging the availability of capital outside of the traditional bank market, its distribution model of supply chain finance means businesses that otherwise might not have access to funding – particularly SMEs – now have that available to them.</p>
<p>SCF is seeing something of a resurgence in the current environment, notes Norris. With around 60% of Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s major C&amp;R clients having adopted some form of SCF programme, and many of the remainder in discussion, it has clearly benefitted from heighted market awareness.</p>
<p>SCF traditionally enables major buyers to improve their working capital metrics by extending DPO, yet still enhance relationships with smaller suppliers by providing them with earlier payment and lower cost of funds based on that buyer’s stronger credit rating.</p>
<p>There is a technology play here too, says Norris. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is enhancing it SCF offering by leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and artificial intelligence (AI). This, he explains, helps clients reduce operational risk by enabling far greater visibility and deeper analytics around their trade-related data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a notable early adopter of blockchain and digitisation in this space too, facilitating Smart Document exchange to expedite the flow of goods.</p>
<p>The bank is also currently engaging with the concept of using supply chain financing to support inventory management, working with a large C&amp;R client to investigate new ways of tracking inventory, controlling stock and streamlining relevant data. Furthermore, its export and agency finance unit is exploring ways of leveraging its work with the world’s export credit agencies, aiming to give clients more opportunities to expand into new (and perhaps higher risk) markets, or perhaps provide bespoke short-term trade finance to mitigate exporter-client risk.</p>
<h4 id=""shaping-the-future"">Shaping the future</h4>
<p>These new tools could benefit many businesses in the C&amp;R space, but some are still on the lower end of the adoption curve, notes Norris. The challenges of harnessing such technologies must be overcome before meaningful progress is made, he comments. “With multiple factors impacting development, it’s going to take a holistic strategy to bring it all together.”</p>
<p>Clearly not all current C&amp;R players will be able to adjust to changing market conditions and the demands of the consumer. There have already been some notable casualties, where certain large corporates failed to recognise in time that they were under attack. Some have paid a heavy price. For those that remain alert to market change, Norris believes that the “continued buzz around harnessing technology” will steer the market to a point where many more are able to climb the curve and begin operating “in a more flexible and nimble way”.</p>
<p>Those that are on the low end of the curve, who feel they are nonetheless achieving good results, can take an even more positive stance if they realise that, whilst they have a long journey ahead of them, they have considerable opportunity to grow their business into something far more powerful. “For treasurers, the ones that will be successful will be the ones who understand this and can articulate it within their organisation, to the point where they can influence buy-in from senior executives, helping to shape strategy.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h2 id=""healthcare-industry-upheaval-creates-transformational-opportunities-for-treasurers"">Healthcare: industry upheaval creates transformational opportunities for treasurers</h2>
<br/>
<p>The healthcare industry is undergoing massive changes presenting numerous challenges for the sectors treasurers. Experts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch explain how they can meet them successfully.</p>
<p>There aren’t many sectors at present that are as complex and, at the same time, in the throes of as much upheaval as healthcare, with strong M&amp;A activity across the space an accurate indicator of the profound transformation taking place across the industry.</p>
<p>Law firm Baker McKenzie, for instance, predicts that M&amp;A volume in the healthcare sector will increase to US$331bn in 2019, up 7% on year, and mark a solid recovery from last year’s 5% drop. The report predicts deal-making activity is likely to be the most intense in the US and Asia as companies look to respond to a fast-changing healthcare market.</p>
<p>It’s certainly an outlook that chimes with what Mark Sims, Managing Director, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, is seeing: “There continues to be a high degree of M&amp;A activity across the sector. It is against a backdrop of; patent expirations, growing political uncertainty, evolving consumer demands, and mounting regulatory pressures such as those centered around protecting patient data.” As a result, he says, firms at the sharp end of the shakeout face numerous challenges including in cost containment; better management and forecasting of cash and liquidity; efficient integration of acquisitions; effective interaction with consumers; proliferating payment mechanisms; and making best use of new technology.</p>
<p>Sims adds: “Digitalisation is especially pervasive. It is not just associated with the different types of payment methods that are coming through. It’s about how people, consumers, now basically want to use mobile devices to transact. Digitalisation is a great opportunity to drive efficiencies, remove manual processes, as well as get visibility, whether its account management or global liquidity.”</p>
<p>Lynn Wiatrowski, Executive Vice President at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, echoes Sims, adding: “Innovation is disrupting the way payers and providers do business, but also creating new opportunities. There’s now an intense focus on gaining market share with consumers and employer groups, not just via consolidation but through innovation focused on the patient experience. This innovation isn’t just limited to the clinical experience – for example retail clinics or telemedicine. Innovation in the patient financial experience is occurring as well with improved price transparency, patient billing and collections processes, and new financial tools for consumers. We know that treasurers in our clients’ firms are partnering with other internal stakeholders to improve the patient’s or member’s financial experience.”</p>
<p>At the same time this shift to “consumerism” is occurring, efforts to move to “value-based” healthcare continue. In this delivery model providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes rather than procedures. “Payment models between providers, patients and their health plans are changing very significantly, often in ways that threaten fee for service revenue streams. Providers are challenged to make this transition while still maintaining financial health.”</p>
<h4 id=""changing-roles"">Changing roles</h4>
<p>More broadly, with governments increasingly alarmed by the ever-increasing cost of healthcare, firms globally are under huge pressure to reduce costs and that is squeezing margins. For Wiatrowski this particular challenge demands that healthcare organisations redesign their processes and increase automation across back and front office functions: “The banking industry has undergone its own digital transformation and has a lot to offer providers and payers.”</p>
<p>As transformation across the sector picks up pace, Sims has also noticed treasurers reviewing their role, with technology in particular provoking a change in their mindset: “In the past the treasurer’s focus was very much on the basic requirements – looking at capital markets for debt issuance, looking at hedging tools and so on. Now the whole focus is on how they can create a digitalised platform to secure all those benefits.”</p>
<p>Wiatrowski is equally emphatic about the need for healthcare treasurers to reinvent themselves: “They need to really think differently about their role and the value they bring to the organisation. The forward thinking treasurer is setting the example to inspire change and innovation. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, many find themselves running disparate, often antiquated systems. Often focused attention and investment is needed to redesign the operating approach and integrate or replace systems to become more efficient, create more centralised, digitalised, platform-driven models.”</p>
<p>There are already successful examples of treasurers using technology to manage cash and control costs more effectively: “Our CashPro corporate treasury platform allows treasurers to access all of their banking information, even via mobile. And our clients are continuing to integrate their financial systems directly with our platform through traditional means as well as our APIs. As processes are increasingly automated, treasurers are freed up to focus on more strategic activities. Focusing on automation and working with like-minded partners helps healthcare organisations build more efficient front, middle, and back office operations.”</p>
<p>Sims is sympathetic to the view that when it comes to digitalisation, treasurers are currently swamped with potential solutions and technologies like API’s, blockchain, AI, robotics and big data. “It’s all developing so rapidly and it’s a lot to take on for many. Certainly, we are a great source of information for our clients about what’s happening in the space so my recommendation to treasurers is leverage your bank relationships.”</p>
<p>One area Wiatrowski believes banks are supremely well placed to help healthcare organisations is cyber-security. The sector has traditionally been very protective of its patient and member data, but the increasing pace of M&amp;A, and changes in the relationship between provider and payer, and increases in third-party relationships are exacerbating cyber-security risks: “It’s the number one priority across the sector. Healthcare firms are realising that their extensive third-party relationships are opening them up to more cyber risk. High profile breaches and ransomware attacks have made cyber-security top-of mind.”</p>
<p>She strongly advises healthcare treasurers troubled by their organisation’s exposure to cyber attack to seek advice and help from their bankers. “We for instance have an abundance of educational opportunities for clients focused on protection against various cyber threats, ways to organise their companies to be better protected. As a major global player defending against cyber attacks and fraud is mission critical for us.”</p>
<h4 id=""leveraging-technology"">Leveraging technology</h4>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch is also seeing a lot of demand from treasurers looking for solutions that enable consumer to business payments to be digitised. Wiatrowski says: “Payment models are amazingly complex in US healthcare, creating multiple impediments to upfront collections. Providers especially struggle to determine what a patient owes and collect at time of service. This and other factors drive a high volume of paper based payments in healthcare. And payers and providers both end up over-collecting and needing to issue refunds back to their patients or members.”</p>
<p>While cheques are still the dominant form of payments from healthcare businesses to consumers – such as refunds and payments for participation in clinical trials – organisations do have a growing number of choices. “Patients can get a prepaid card, which isn’t a digital transaction, but it’s certainly more efficient than a paper check. Or they can receive digital disbursements whereby payments can be made electronically without the need for the consumer to provide their personal bank account information. And payers and providers are both rapidly adopting solutions to collect from consumers electronically. Patients and members increasingly have the option of paying online by card or direct bank account debit. In a consumer-centric health care environment, providing convenient payment options is critical to the patient or member experience.”</p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch is also investing heavily in exploiting leading edge technology to develop solutions to help healthcare firms and their treasurers. Machine learning is currently a major focus for application in receivables processes and predictive analysis to the benefit of Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s corporate treasury platform CashPro, while robotics is being implemented in its Lockbox solutions.</p>
<p>AI has found application in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s “Intelligent Receivables” product, a matching solution that helps to take the manual work out of reconciling receipts. Sims explains that by using AI and various web scanning techniques, IR scans all remittances for critical information and then enriches the payments with that data and matches them to open invoice files. It promises nearly 100% data capture and straight through reconciliation levels that may reach up to 90% or even more.</p>
<p>“Such technology helps to take people who were previously manually reconciling and better deploy them elsewhere for more value-added exercises. Everybody’s talking about virtual accounts and virtual account management. That’s great but what we are finding is that reconciliation is even more important. So, having virtual accounts and IR layered onto that is a real advantage.”</p>
<p>More specifically focused on healthcare is Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s HealthLogic platform which automates the historically paper-intensive flow of dollars and data from health plans to providers. “With very large health systems there could be hundreds of people involved in posting and reconciling payments, handling various correspondence from payers and consumers, and digitising documents,” Wiatrowski explains. “By combining HealthLogic with our patented Lockbox process we have created a highly automated solution for collecting these paper-based payment volumes. We are able to automate the posting of the complicated remittance advices that accompany healthcare payments and manage the ever-growing volume of correspondence, allowing for the redeployment of personnel to higher value-added opportunities.”</p>
<p>As healthcare organisations look to navigate the many challenges confronting them, Wiatrowski believes it more important than ever they look to examples of success across the sector: “What we’re seeing in the industry is that there are more “shiny objects” being offered to the healthcare industry than you could possibly imagine. What the most successful healthcare companies are finding is that partnering with someone who can be an end-to-end partner versus a bolt on here, a bolt on there, is a more successful strategy whether it’s to address cyber-security, or broader organisational and treasury digitalisation. It’s a more streamlined strategy, a more efficient way to deal with partners, and it doesn’t open up as many potential windows for cyber-attack or fraud.</p>
<p>“And I do think we’re seeing organisations taking that long view, and being very thoughtful and strategic about the partnerships they create. It is a lot of effort. It’s one of the reasons we created a consulting team whose role is to go into an organisation and help treasurers identify key opportunities for changes, begin prioritising and implementing them.”</p>


","If there is one element that unites most companies across sectors and regions it is the innate desire to improve operational efficiency. This series with Bank of America Merrill Lynch looks at how different sectors are using technology to achieve their goals. It reveals how lessons can be drawn from across the sectors, and how, by bringing together data and expertise, banking partnerships are adding more value for corporate clients.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/2019-07-08-tta-09-sf__abstract-blue-squares-background-ss114374386__1920x1080.jpg,2019-07-01,Market Insight,True

<p><em>Populist and autocratic leaders are finding favour around the world and their strand of politics and economics can no longer be regarded as a fleeting, easily reversible phenomenon.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t long ago that many commentators saw the election victories of Emmanuel Macron in France, Angela Merkel in Germany, and Mark Rutte in The Netherlands as a sign that the ‘populist advance’ had come to an end. That turned out to be premature. Now, approximately two years later, five out of the ten largest economies in the world – which jointly account for two-thirds of the global economy – are led by populists or autocrats, namely the US, China, India, Brazil and Italy.</p>
<p>The other five economies all face considerable problems. Wealth per capita in Japan may be exceptionally high, but growth has been low for decades, the country has humongous debts, and its population is ageing at speed. On top of this, many opponents of PM Shinzō Abe fear that he will eventually prioritise his nationalist disposition over Japan’s economic needs.</p>
<p>Germany’s Angela Merkel is on her final lap as chancellor. Her intended successor will not initiate any revolutionary shifts, which is dangerous in itself. Together, the two largest parties – the CDU/CSU and the SPD – are weaker than ever and voters can decide on a whim to go for even more fragmentation, whereas Germany could do with a breath of fresh air. Economic growth is slowing significantly and quite a few economists have warned that politicians have become complacent in recent years instead of addressing the weaknesses of the German economy.</p>
<p>The fifth-largest economy, the UK, appears to have spun out of control as it fights a many-headed dragon called Brexit. British businesses are beginning to feel the pain of the constant uncertainty and many important reforms have fallen by the wayside as politicians and civil servants continue to be steamrollered by Brexit. Theresa May’s Tories are deeply divided. The opposition party, Labour, is also at odds with itself; its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, with his left-wing populist ideas and support from the grassroots Momentum movement, is the business sector’s worst nightmare. Meanwhile, relations between countries within the UK are deteriorating and 90% of the UK population thinks that Brexit is being handled in a way that humiliates the country. The protracted and sometimes farcical divorce drama does nothing for the UK’s reputation or for Europe’s political clout.</p>
<p>In France President Emmanuel Macron is trying to improve Europe’s impact but his attempts to profile himself as leader are patchy at best and the Yellow Vest protests, which have been ongoing for months, have undermined his position.</p>
<p>Then there is Canada, where PM Justin Trudeau has been the favourite of social-democrats with a liberal mindset for years. Particularly following Trump’s election, many wanted to see him as the leader of the free western world but now he is being vehemently criticised in connection with a scandal that creates the impression that the PM was trying to get his Minister of Justice to stop an investigation into the corrupt practices of a large Canadian company.</p>
<h4 id=""new-norm"">New norm</h4>
<p>To sum up then, one half of the world’s largest economies is led by populists or autocrats while the political mainstream leaders are under attack. When it comes to Europe, despite major problems and dissatisfaction among many voters, so far Italy remains the only one of Europe’s largest economies that is governed by populist parties. While Lega Nord (Lega) and the Five Star Movement (M5S) are both part of the ruling coalition, Lega has gained strength whereas M5S has lost ground. That appears to be a negative development for the Eurozone and the EU as Lega is more inclined than M5S to take a stand against the EU and immigrants. It also has no qualms about collaborating with Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s party.</p>
<p>The political shifts in Europe have been triggered by a combination of factors: immigration, globalisation, neoliberalism and European integration. These developments have fostered a sense of uncertainty as the contrasts within countries increased. The jobs-for-life and the reassuring familiarity of one’s own village, church and largely homogenous country are mostly long gone. Simultaneously, technological developments and increased individualism have meant that political movements and parties cater more and more to the wishes and preferences of very specific groups. The upshot has been polarised societies and political polarisation.</p>
<p>These developments have had an impact not just on the political landscapes of the major European economies but also on smaller member states. We have even seen a tendency towards authoritarian leadership in a number of Central and Eastern European countries in recent years, leading to a decline of the EU’s democratic values from the inside. It is therefore a big mistake to think national populism is some fleeting or isolated phenomena; it has also found favour in Italy, Austria, The Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, Sweden and other countries too.</p>
<p>Matthew Goodwin and Roger Eatwell, authors of National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy, think that four factors are determining the success of the populists: an aversion to the administrative elite and the democratic institutions; fears that the ‘domestic’ culture will be undermined and destroyed; a sense of getting less than others in the context of a crumbling welfare state, growing inequality, unfair burden-sharing; and a widening gap between voters and the traditional parties.</p>
<p>The Dutch columnist Arie Elshout nicely and succinctly summed up what this entails: “If change is experienced as alienation, everything will shift to the right. It may be wise to see all of the brouhaha as a democratic correction. It is impossible to return to the (idealised) past. However, some things are feasible such as better control, better regulation, and more constraints when it comes to globalisation and immigration in order to prevent calamity. Change needs to be channelled.”</p>
<p>Suffice to say, the channelling is not going too well. And the aforementioned factors, which contribute to the success of the populists, are unlikely to change enough for the prevailing political trends to reverse. Mainstream politicians are trying to remove whatever fuels populism but they tend to go into shock if populists are successful before expounding that the populist politician in question is a danger to democracy. Or, they opt for populism-light policies, which carry the risk that voters will start to disregard them as a watered-down version of ‘the real thing’. At the same time, such surrogates can undercut essential components of the democratic constitutional state. Voters may also view the capitulation of the mainstream politicians as a legitimisation of ‘hardcore populism’.</p>
<h4 id=""zero-sum-game"">Zero-sum game</h4>
<p>Yet, nationalist populism does not need to have a negative impact on the financial markets in the first instance. Look at how the S&amp;P 500 has performed under Trump and something similar applied to the Bovespa Index in Brazil, following Bolsonaro’s election victory. The man’s democratic credentials may be woeful but investors gleefully anticipated privatisation and deregulation. As a result, the Brazilian stock exchange became one of the world’s best performing stock indices.</p>
<p>It very much remains to be seen whether investors will respond in a similar way in Europe – if populism continues to march on – as they did in Brazil and the US. The reason is that European countries are too small to take a hard line against great powers such as America and China. Whereas collaboration is imperative, nationalist populists take a stand against European integration. If Europe weakens further, Beijing and Moscow will be more than happy to reap the benefits. They are already playing countries against each other. And while economic relations are often not a zero-sum game, the interface between (geo)politics and economics can certainly be such a game.</p>
<p>The upcoming elections for the European Parliament (EP) will likely provide the financial markets with additional reasons to doubt the prospects for the European economy. Polls suggest that although the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) will remain the biggest parties, for the first time they will not be able to gain a majority together.</p>
<p>The Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) may well turn out to be the largest winner of the elections. Next, together with other Eurosceptic groups, ENF will be able to frustrate the performance of the EU, particularly as the role of the EP in the legislative process has gradually expanded from an advisory capacity to joint decision making with the Council of the European Union. For instance, the EP has contributed to the formation of the European Banking Union by adopting legislation and regulatory provisions for the single supervisory mechanism and capital requirements for the banks, among others.</p>
<p>However, the buttressing of the Eurozone has been interrupted for quite some time. Kick-starting it again will be significantly harder if the populists are successful at the European elections and start to stymie the process of decision-making. Therefore, it seems unwise to assume that Europe will be able to follow in the footsteps of the US and Brazil in the sense that populist success will translate into strongly performing stock markets.</p>
<p>Also – in marked contrast with Trump and Bolsonaro – some of the populists who have been successful in Europe combine a right-wing social-cultural stance with a left-wing social-economic course. Many voters may think that Europe is creaking and/or they feel that the continent is heading in the wrong direction. Yet, politicians such as Italy’s Matteo Salvini and Netherlands’ Thierry Baudet will most likely be unable to usher in the desired turnaround. The change they bring – if any – will probably not imbue the European economy and markets with new life.</p>

<h3 style=""clear:both;"">How are know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations affecting treasurers?</h3>
<p>KYC, or client due diligence, is a process that may seem relatively new for treasurers, yet the process has been in existence for as long as people have been doing business: you have to know who your clients are.</p>
<p>From a regulatory perspective though, this undertaking has been elevated to such a level of importance over the years that documentary evidence related to this is comprehensive. It also varies by country, and sometimes even by type of client.</p>
<p>From a client’s perspective, KYC is one drawn out process where the provider asks a lot of questions that are increasingly detailed and personal. But it can help in understanding what is required if we break KYC down into three stages.</p>
<p>First, there is onboarding where, for every new relationship, comprehensive due diligence is required. Next, that relationship has to be periodically assessed to ensure any changes are captured. This is called ‘renewal’. The third stage is ‘remediation’ where, in between onboarding and renewal, regulatory changes may demand that more or new information is recorded.</p>
<p>Part of KYC and client due diligence is related to the increased risk of money laundering, terrorist-financing and other criminal activities. It therefore involves gathering information to make sure that money-laundering risk is managed; it is our regulatory duty as banking services providers to ensure that funds do not move to support criminal activity.</p>
<p>Often KYC and AML are wrapped into a single comprehensive set of questions that your service provider must ask. Treasurers should know that we are trying to protect the safety and soundness of the financial system and that we are helping the regulators around the world ensure that financial crime does not occur under our watch.</p>
<h3 id=""to-what-extent-is-the-process-being-streamlined"">To what extent is the process being streamlined?</h3>
<p>I would like to say that the entire globe has consistent regulatory objectives and consistent means of evidencing those objectives. Unfortunately, that is not the world that we live in. Different countries place a greater or lesser emphasis on aspects of KYC and AML and its fulfilment by banks. As such, the regulations and their execution are not the same everywhere.</p>
<p>That said, I often tell clients who say, “you all ask for different things” that we really aren’t asking for different things because we are all following the same laws but may do so in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>From bank to bank, KYC is finding a high degree of consistency. The banking community has discussed what questions really need to be answered from a KYC/AML perspective and has tried to agree on one set of questions that we are going to hold ourselves to as the standard.</p>
<p>That has now been accomplished; I signed Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s due diligence questionnaire recently. Now, when a client asks for our AML/KYC due diligence questionnaire, it will be my signature on the back!</p>
<link href=""/assets/jquery.mediaelement/mediaelementplayer.css"" rel=""stylesheet""/>


<blockquote>We have created a system that will search every document storage system that we have across the firm. It can look for a particular document, grab it and use it for the purposes of KYC. We are also increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to scan responses that clients give to questions, and then auto-populate a system so that there is less manual keying.</blockquote>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Another aspect that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is very supportive 
of – and I would like the entire industry and all of our clients to be 
supportive of too – is using databases utilities to store the 
information.</p>
<p>The due diligence questionnaire responses that we have at Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch are stored in a shared utility administered by a 
third party. We do that because we want our other counterparties to have
 an easier time getting information from us.</p>
<p>I ask all of my clients “is there a database or a utility that you 
use to store your information?” If so, I will go there first, get that 
information, and then come back to fill in any gaps that might exist. 
It’s all part of the industry effort to make it easier for clients.</p>
<p>In terms of the regulations and the regulators, there are now 
industry organisations working to develop common standards. For example,
 BAFT, the Bankers’ Association for Finance and Trade, represents 
financial institutions, providing feedback on proposed changes in rules 
and regulations that impact KYC and AML. Aligned with other similar 
bodies, its aim is to make it easier for the industry and customers to 
comply by providing information.</p>
<p>The more governments work together to create standards, the more 
utilities enable databases of answers to be created, and the more banks 
agree to a common set of standards, the easier it will become. Until 
then, it can be hard to keep up, for all of us.</p>
<h3 id=""how-is-technology-helping-with-this-journey"">How is technology helping with this journey?</h3>
<p>The perfect solution for KYC/AML would be that the moment a 
regulation changes, it could be implemented from a single screen for all
 customers around the world instantly. Sadly, it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>Where standards are constantly evolving, technology is always going 
to be behind. You cannot build it while it is changing. We are investing
 technology dollars as fast as we can and I know our clients are trying 
as much as they can to automate their processes. The only solution is 
for change to happen at a slower pace, just so we can all keep up.</p>
<p>If there was one utility where all KYC information was stored 
globally, then I could build one pipe in to get the information, 
populate my system and all would be good for another year or two until I
 had to refresh. But there isn’t one utility; there are many. We can’t 
build a pipe to every single utility, so we end up with lots of manual 
processes.</p>
<p>There needs to be a narrowing of the set of regulations into a common
 standard. That doesn’t mean fewer questions, that doesn’t mean less 
information. What it means is that with fewer standards, and fewer 
places for those standards to be maintained, technology will not only be
 able to catch up, it will finally leapfrog the flow of rules.</p>
<p>In the meantime, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch we have created a 
system that will search every document storage system that we have 
across the firm. It can look for a particular document, grab it and use 
it for the purposes of KYC. We are also increasingly using artificial 
intelligence (AI) to scan responses that clients give to questions, and 
then auto-populate a system so that there is less manual keying.</p>
<h3 id=""do-you-foresee-change-for-the-better"">Do you foresee change for the better?</h3>
<p>I do but it will happen by evolution, not revolution. I am optimistic
 that within five years we will not consider KYC the burden, from a 
client perspective, that it is today.</p>
<p>All of the work that we are doing now around KYC/AML – thinking about
 the questions that we ask, where the information is stored, how it is 
used, how we comply with regulations – we are doing to make our clients’
 lives easier and make it easier for them to do business with Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Easier, simpler KYC/AML is in our future. Getting
 there allows us more time to focus on what our clients consider more 
value-added and that is helping them run their businesses more 
efficiently.</p>

<h3 style=""clear:both;"">What are the main concerns for your clients at the moment?</h3>
<p>One of the unavoidable challenges for many clients at the moment is Brexit. It is generating market uncertainty. Companies are worried about whether they have the right structure in place for a post-Brexit environment. They are concerned too about its impact on their banking relationships.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing is that there are no clear answers. No bank can say with any certainty to a corporate treasurer that they know exactly what Brexit is going to be and what they are going to need to do in order to be ready for it.</p>
<p>But we’ve been working closely with clients, explaining what we understand to date, and thinking through different scenarios and options and what the advice would be for each. It is about planning, responding as more information becomes available, and continuing to guide clients.</p>
<p>Cost and efficiency are additional key treasury themes. I don’t think you will find a corporate treasury anywhere in the world that says that they have got all of the staff they need to be able to fully do everything that they would like to do. The day job gets done but that value-add that we all talk about is harder to achieve if you don’t have the right resourcing.</p>
<p>Anything that can drive efficiency – whether that is through automation or new technologies such as robotics or artificial intelligence (AI) – can help make the treasury more efficient, freeing up resources to focus on value-adding activities.</p>
<p>Regulation is a constant challenge too. Some are seen as being purely for the banks, but the banks must ensure their clients understand what that regulation is and why it is happening because the effects vary, especially something like know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).</p>


<blockquote>Innovating is about more than just spending money on building new solutions. It is about collaboration with partners to bring new capabilities to market but, perhaps as a differentiator, it is also about innovating with what we already have in-house.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Matthew Davies, Head of Global Transaction Services EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>On this matter, open banking, particularly from a European perspective, is generating a lot of discussion. Traditionally, whichever institution held the bank accounts also provided the services linked to those bank accounts. PSD2 essentially enables that connection to be broken. Banks have to open up their infrastructure to third parties to be able to develop and provide services from those bank accounts.</p>
<p>Open banking has ostensibly been driven by consumer needs, offering them more services, more differentiation, more competition and more choice. It was not rolled out with corporates in mind. But what starts in the consumer space often leaches into the corporate space. Treasurers are very aware of that, so we spend time talking to them about the impacts of regulation such as PSD2.</p>
<p>We should not forget the power of data here. Think about how reconciliation is greatly aided by better data, and then consider the huge opportunity that arises as we move towards real-time clearing and get more information to accompany payments; this is leading to straight through reconciliations.</p>
<p>Corporates sit on a huge amount of data. If they can collect that in one place and use it in a more meaningful way, there is so much more that can be achieved in many different areas.</p>
<p>If, in the way a company runs its credit process against its key customers, it uses its own and third-party data to run a more efficient process, it has an opportunity to create more appropriate limits, potentially selling more product. There’s a lot that corporates and their banks can do to help source that data.</p>
<p>Of course, any talk about data should consider the regulatory challenge that comes in the form of GDPR compliance. This has global implications. Regardless of where in the world they are, any organisation holding data on an EU citizen must comply or face stringent penalties.</p>
<h3 id=""how-are-these-challenges-affecting-the-day-to-day-operations-of-treasury"">How are these challenges affecting the day-to-day operations of treasury?</h3>
<p>It is interesting to see how different corporate treasurers are responding. The core functions of treasury remain as they ever have. However, the capacity to add value and take a more prominent role in the organisation is as never before. But it takes diligence to carve out the time and resources to focus on what can be achieved from an efficiency perspective. Only through doing that can treasurers really free-up that capacity further down the line. The most effective treasurers make sure they can draw a line between BAU and adding value.</p>
<h3 id=""how-are-treasurers-staying-ahead-of-the-curve"">How are treasurers staying ahead of the curve?</h3>
<p>These are interesting times. Within transaction banking, nothing much changed for about 30 years. We are now in a period where a number of elements are coming together at the same time in terms of pace of regulatory and technological change. Treasurers have got to stay ahead of the curve in this period of great change.</p>
<p>They have to have the right relationships with the right banks and consulting firms to ensure they are getting the right advice and information, especially on the international stage where needs will be diverse. Treasurers must also possess an intellectual curiosity to seek out new ways, and, I believe, it is incumbent upon all of us to be open to change.</p>
<h3 id=""how-are-these-areas-of-treasury-concern-affecting-relationships-with-banks"">How are these areas of treasury concern affecting relationships with banks?</h3>
<p>Banks often touch a number of different areas within the client’s organisation and so can be effective at offering a holistic view of the organisation, from a group, regional and domestic entity level. Banks are also taking on a more advisory role than they have in the past, where the ability to tackle local issues from a global perspective is key.</p>
<p>Where transaction banking used to be about selling bank accounts and payments and liquidity structures, it has become one where technology is offered to make our clients’ financial lives easier, most notably at an international level where centralised operations can be removed from local activities.</p>
<p>We recently partnered with a fintech to bring ‘intelligent receivables’ to market, using AI to help clients automate their reconciliation processes, sometimes with automated match rates as high as 90%.</p>
<p>The impact of improved efficiency is felt throughout the organisation, allowing the redeployment of resources to more value-added functions. But quicker cash applications also help credit teams to free up capacity for the sales team to sell more to that client.</p>
<h3 id=""what-drives-your-creative-approach-to-meeting-international-client-needs"">What drives your creative approach to meeting international client needs?</h3>
<p>For us, innovating is about more than just spending money on building new solutions. It is about collaboration with partners to bring new capabilities to market but, perhaps as a differentiator, it is also about innovating with what we already have in-house.</p>
<p>We recently launched Liquidity Express, where we took our global liquidity platform and combined it with our virtual account management platform and our CashPro® front-end online banking application. From this combination, we are able to offer a more streamlined, easier to use liquidity management solution for a core segment of our client base.</p>
<p>In fact, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have spent quite a lot of time thinking about our clients’ needs, thinking about what we already have within the bank that we can put together in different ways to meet those client needs, whether it is driven by home or overseas market concerns about regulation, cost and efficiency optimisation or adding value.</p>

<h3 style=""clear:both;"">Tell me what innovation means to Bank of America Merrill Lynch and how you approach development.</h3>
<p>Number one: we have to ensure innovation in transaction services remains relevant to our clients. They want us to make it easier for them to use our transaction services. That means working with all of our clients, not just learning and understanding what areas of innovation they want us to work on, but also where they see the pain points in their own ecosystems and how the treasury function can best evolve within that structure for the success of all.</p>
<p>We need to know where to provide new services, and how to enhance our existing services; that way we enable our clients to be both relevant to their corporation and successful from a transaction services standpoint. 
</p>


<blockquote>Our innovation funnel gives every team member in transaction services an overview of each project that is under way. This means we get to think through every step of development from all angles.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Hubert J.P. Jolly, Global Head of Financing and Channels, Global Transaction Services Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>To deliver, it is essential that innovation is driven by collaboration with clients, their third-party providers such as TMS and ERP vendors, and, increasingly, with the fintech community. In fact, if a fintech solution can resolve a pain point for our clients, we have the ability to onboard them as a supplier, and even invest in them with us as a development partner, integrating their solution within our own technical environment. This enables clients to comfortably procure highly innovative services through us, not through an unknown provider.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if our client experience is better, then we know that we remain relevant to them and that we are supporting their growth.</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-your-development-work"">You use an ‘innovation funnel’. What is it and how does it help your development work?</h3>
<p>We manage innovation across all of our geographies and products. Our innovation funnel gives every team member in transaction services an overview of each project that is under way. This means we get to think through every step of development from all angles.</p>
<p>This essentially ensures that if we are collaborating with a set of clients, we can think through the development of the solution and deliver working prototypes that demonstrate to them how the solution would work within our ecosystem. They can then provide us with a response on its suitability.</p>
<p>By securing active client feedback, we can fail fast, learn from the experience and rework it. The funnel allows us to expose the solution to multiple viewpoints, right across the bank. By the time we are ready to commercialise it, not only will it meet the needs of the majority of clients but also, through their input, everyone from our sales teams to our service teams is equipped to help the clients get the most from it.</p>
<h3 id=""tell-us-about-your-current-points-of-focus-on-innovation-and-what-your-pipeline-looks-like"">Tell us about your current points of focus on innovation and what your pipeline looks like.</h3>
<p>From an innovation standpoint, the focus is always on the client experience. We want to make sure that our solutions are the easiest to use in the industry. There can be a gap between the complexity of our products and the ease of their use, especially as many clients expect something similar to the everyday experience they have in their consumer lives. We have to fill that gap.</p>
<p>As part of our response to this need, we were the first bank to roll out a Siri- or Alexa-style assistant in the transaction services space. The launch of CashPro® Assistant on our online portal is all about rapid self-service, helping clients to carry out their everyday activities when they login to CashPro® online.</p>


<blockquote>Client delight is our primary goal so we measure every one of our transactions from that standpoint. Our clients are afforded a number of ways of letting us know whether they are pleased with their experience – and we always respond, often using innovation, to keep that score as high as it can be.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Hubert J.P. Jolly, Global Head of Financing and Channels, Global Transaction Services Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Because innovation is also about giving clients information more 
easily when they go into CashPro®, we were one of the first transaction 
banks to roll out APIs. We asked the enterprise platform and treasury 
work station providers to connect to us via APIs. By making these 
connections more seamless, we are enabling many more clients to transact
 for the first time in real-time rather than through batch processing. 
We have several clients who have been leveraging these APIs to enable 
them to initiate payments and receive the information on the reporting 
that they need on the back of those transactions.</p>
<p>Another key focus in terms of innovation at Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch is adding to the types or payments that we offer to our clients 
today.</p>
<p>A number of clients were curious about person-to-person payments that
 have been evolving around the world. We see them as an opportunity for 
corporates and in the US, for example, we now enable our clients to 
initiate payments via Zelle, a platform that allows US consumers to link
 their bank account to their cell phone number and email address. As I 
said, it’s all about remaining relevant to our clients, giving them a 
choice of innovative payment tools.</p>
<h3 id=""how-does-baml-differentiate-itself-from-other-institutions"">All banks innovate. How does Bank of America Merrill Lynch differentiate itself from other institutions?</h3>
<p>We look at innovation in terms of how we can improve upon the client 
experience. Client delight is our primary goal so we measure every one 
of our transactions from that standpoint. Our clients are afforded a 
number of ways of letting us know whether they are pleased with their 
experience – and we always respond, often using innovation, to keep that
 score as high as it can be.</p>
<p>Of course, we aim to make it as easy as possible for clients to 
transact with us. But we are also open to clients working with us, to 
let us know what they want, and how they want it. We encourage them to 
reflect on their experiences: how quickly they can open an account with 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, whether it was a seamless process and if 
they were able to use electronic signatures, for example.</p>
<p>I would say that our differentiator is all the things that we are 
working on to make sure that every new client’s first experience with us
 is going to give them the same high level of client delight that we see
 every day from our existing clients who transact with us across 34 
countries.</p>
<p>We take great pride in delivering the right client experience and 
remaining relevant for them as they grow, from a business standpoint.

exactly how we keep delivering.</p>

How hard-liners are setting the scene for a new economic order,"

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>“If we cannot end now our differences, at least we can make the world safe for diversity.” – John F. Kennedy (10th June 1963)</em></p>
<p>There’s an expanding cohort of states that are moving in an authoritarian direction and which are worrying the financial markets. John F. Kennedy (JFK) already knew that a wholly liberal-democratic world would be unlikely and he wanted to ensure that liberal democracies could live peacefully alongside other forms of government. After the Cold War, a kind of euphoria took hold in the West. The idea briefly arose that capitalist democracy would be unstoppable. Now China, Russia and others bely that conviction.</p>
<p>Earlier, it was often thought that the populations of authoritarian countries would demand more freedom once a certain level of prosperity was reached. Mostly, this did not happen at all or countries were caught by the middle-income trap before citizens started to worry about their liberties. Only 13 out of 101 middle-income countries in 1960 had become high-income economies by 2008. This phenomenon is increasingly important; five of the 7bn people on earth live in middle-income countries. These states represent a third of the global economy and often drive worldwide economic growth.</p>
<h3 id=""prosperity-in-exchange-for-shutting-up"">Prosperity in exchange for shutting up</h3>
<p>In many of these countries – including China, Russia and Turkey as well – an implicit agreement between governments and people has applied (and often continues to apply) which dictates that the price for strong economic growth is political passivity, to put it mildly. Naturally, most regimes will not allow their citizens to abandon this ‘deal’ (as we have often seen in recent years).</p>
<p>There have been more and more signs in China recently that the authorities are tightening the reins and restricting freedom (even further) for fear of the painful side effects – including sluggish growth – of stabilising the credit system and transitioning from an export-oriented economy to a technologically advanced economy, powered by consumption.</p>
<p>Leaders in other countries are also shifting towards ‘authoritarian regime’ on the political spectrum. And whereas China has largely pursued a coherent and intelligible financial-economic policy – although disagreeable to many – leaders like Maduro in Venezuela and Erdogan in Turkey have brought their countries to precarious positions, with high FX debts, sky-high inflation, very unusual monetary policies, irresponsible government spending on vanity projects, large twin deficits and the loss of goodwill in the international arena.</p>
<h3 id=""very-fragile-model"">Very fragile model</h3>
<p>This takes us to the key trends at play around the world right now. Marian L. Tupy, connected with the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, wrote the following recently while discussing a book by Jonah Goldberg:</p>
<p>“Our rule-based society … a staggeringly complex global economy that turns strangers from different continents into instant business partners, and a meritocratic system of social and economic advancement that ignores people’s innate features…is both very new and extremely fragile… The forces of tribalism always linger just below the surface…From Russia and China to Turkey and, to some extent, the US, the all-mighty chieftain is back in charge.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the world that JFK purportedly envisioned – in which democratic and authoritarian countries co-exist in relative peace – is viable. Leaders such as Trump, Putin, Xi and Erdogan, increasingly question the world-order mainly devised by the West. Winner-takes-all-capitalism, growing inequality, stagnating real wages, and large cultural and social change are all playing into the hands of the aforementioned leaders.</p>
<h3 id=""the-glorious-thirty-is-no-more"">“The Glorious Thirty” is no more</h3>
<p>The period roughly until the 1970s is often referred to as The Glorious Thirty (Les Trente Glorieuses). An era that was characterised – especially in the West – by a bountiful combination of high economic growth, increasing productivity, rising real pay, robust technological progress, and the steady expansion of the welfare state. Clearly, this period is now behind us. This has led to a lot of public dissatisfaction, the emergence of populism, and a more inward-looking mentality in many countries.</p>
<p>Various negative trends are coming to the fore:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From democratisation to a focus on identity and culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a world of relative order to a world in chaos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From interdependence to decoupling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The forces of tribalism to which Goldberg and Tupy refer are fuelling these developments, and they will undermine global economic growth. Already, financial and trade wars are damaging free trade and putting alliances in jeopardy.</p>
<h3 id=""red-carpet-rolling-out-for-bears"">Red carpet rolling out for bears</h3>
<p>From a political viewpoint, there is plenty of scope for bears. Growth, international production chains and other forms of globalisation are under threat from identity politics, the erosion of institutes that have underpinned safety and economic growth in the past seven decades, and protectionism.</p>
<p>Populists rule Italy, Austria, Hungary and Poland. Right-wing populists are leading the polls in Sweden and are runners-up in Germany. Intolerant nationalism, xenophobia and illiberalism are the hallmarks of most of these parties and politicians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only 13 out of 101 middle-income countries in 1960 had become high-income economies by 2008. This phenomenon is increasingly important; five of the 7bn people on earth live in middle-income countries. These states represent a third of the global economy and often drive worldwide economic growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us not forget that Europe is more exposed than many realise. To provide an example, Hungary did well in the Freedom House index during the period 2005-2010 but it all went downhill from there. Countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal were suffering under authoritarian regimes not so very long ago. And of course, the eastern-European countries are fairly young democracies in any case. They are still trying to navigate the liberal western world as best they can. Meanwhile, we are seeing mounting tension in Europe between West and East in addition to the earlier tension between North and South. Of course, Europe’s borders are restive and there is huge pressure on the trans-Atlantic relationship.</p>
<p>As the West is being put upon, we see that the upcoming are taking a harder stance as they exploit any opportunity to play the western countries against each other. The West should also beware of possible alliances between parties that were seen as incompatible before. Significantly, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have met 26 times since 2013.</p>
<h3 id=""war-on-many-fronts"">War on many fronts</h3>
<p>Such developments are sowing the seeds for further weakening of the growth potential. The biggest fears so far have focused on the implications of a trade war but a combination of trade conflicts, geopolitical brinkmanship and muscle flexing, alongside the weaponising of global finance, is the largest threat.</p>
<p>Trump is not afraid to deploy trade and financial weapons and his opponents are little-inclined to bite the dust either. Considering the size of the US economy and bond market, as well as the power of the dollar, the most likely outcome is that America’s adversaries will eventually throw in the towel. However, by then a lot of damage may already have been inflicted.</p>
<p>The essential rate of potential growth will not rise on the back of the current (and expected) international political developments. Western countries will increasingly be hampered by ageing populations and high debt mountains. Emerging economies with high debts in foreign currency will also find it increasingly hard to overcome these debts through higher economic growth, whereas their populations are becoming ever-more demanding. On top of this, there is a growing chance of further political instability as more democracies move towards the twilight zone between democracy and autocracy.</p>
<p>We still think the crisis is unlikely to turn into a bloodbath that will engulf many other emerging economies. However, the global bear market that our economists fear has certainly come closer.</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><em>Matthew Davies, Richard Parkinson, Stephanie Wolf and Hubert J.P. Jolly </em></p>
<p><em>This July in New York City, Richard Parkinson, Chair of Treasury Today, sat down with three of Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s global executive team for a roundtable discussion. We wanted to get their perspective on what is keeping treasury professionals up at night. Drawing on Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s position as the Best Global Bank, it has a comprehensive view of the issues affecting today’s treasurers. In the first part of this multi-medium Executive Series, experts from the bank provide their insights into a diverse range of topics, from the rise of artificial intelligent (AI) in treasury management systems to the importance of measuring environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors for companies.</em></p>
<p>Joining Richard were Matthew Davies, Head of Global Transaction Services EMEA, based in London; Matthew oversees the global transaction services business for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Stephanie Wolf, Global Head of Financial Institutions &amp; Public Sector Banking for Global Transaction Services, based in New York; Stephanie runs the global financial services franchise from a client-coverage perspective. Also based in New York, Hubert J.P. Jolly, Global Head of Financing and Channels, has responsibility for financing and channels, which includes BofAML’s trade and supply chain business, CashPro treasury management system, cards and payables.</p>
<p>The conversation kicked off with assessing today’s corporate treasury environment. Matthew explained, “There has been quite a shift since the global financial crisis. Up until that point, the focus was very much on traditional areas of treasury. That focus continues today but what has changed is that the role of the treasurer has become so much broader. Treasurers have had to develop new skillsets to spread the influence of treasury much further across the company.”</p>
<p>J.P. added, “Corporates are also looking to drive operating efficiency from technology, which includes digitising the treasury function. Digitisation is driving treasurers to review their supply chains, and how they can help their partners in procurement and manufacturing be more efficient. This includes, how they should pay their suppliers and how they can get capital to suppliers who may require it. Last but not least, they are exploring how they can help their companies collect payments more efficiently.”</p>
<p>Talk turned to market environment, with Stephanie outlining, “We have a whole generation of treasurers and treasury departments who have not lived through a rising interest rate environment. So we spend a lot of time with our clients talking about how that environment impacts the deposit rates, the borrowing rates and the working capital cycle as a whole.”</p>
<p>Upon being asked which trends corporates should be watching right now the team outlined some strong themes, not surprisingly technology is at the forefront. Matthew noted “Corporate treasurers should be focused on the automation opportunities. Beyond that, it is really about how fintechs can help drive change in the broader market place. I think it is interesting to watch how banks are partnering with fintechs and what that is enabling them to bring to market. We are seeing much more collaboration in the bank/fintech space.”</p>
<p>J.P. added, “Treasurers are looking to their banking partners to innovate to help them work smarter and more efficiently. This could mean propriety bank products or partnering with fintechs. Staying on top of market trends and priorities is so important to innovation. Last year, we worked with Treasury Today on the Voice of the Corporate Treasury Global Study. The study provided insight on corporate  treasurer’s priorities over the next 12-18 months. Truly understanding trends and our clients’ needs is key to delivering the right solutions.”</p>
<p>Stephanie cited technology as a tool to mitigate fraud. “Cybersecurity is applicable to every single one of our clients and it is applicable to all of us personally. So, we at Bank of America Merrill Lynch have taken a global position that we are here to share information on how we think about cybersecurity – and, where we can, offer advice. And technology helps the ‘knowing your client’ relationship work much better. We have used technology to build databases that give us information on what a particular client or industry of clients or region of clients are doing. What type of receipts are we seeing? What type of payments? What is the gap between a receipt and a payment? What means of executing a payment is being used? We meet with our clients regularly and then we bring that knowledge to achieve more efficient execution.”</p>
<p>To learn more about the discussion please view our all new video story and read the article both available online from 14<sup>th</sup> September. The full report of the Executive Series roundtable discussion will also appear in print in the September/October editions of Treasury Today and Treasury Today Asia. Make sure you pick up your copy. Subsequent instalments of the Executive Series with Bank of America Merrill Lynch will go live this year so stay tuned!</p>

<p style=""clear:both;"">India has made significant investments in digitisation across the board and is embracing these changes to move with confidence into the digital age. The government is showing commitment to building a digital infrastructure, supported by regulators and the banking industry. Structural reforms in taxation and law, and the formalisation of the economy are matched with rapidly evolving consumer behaviour. For Mridula Iyer, Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, South Asia, Citi, India’s mood is positive and expectations are high. All this is having a direct impact on how corporates do business within and outside the country.</p>
<h3 id=""roots-of-change"">Roots of change</h3>
<p>The policies, initiatives and reforms introduced by the government are the bedrock of India’s change for the better. Among one of its reforms executed over the past few years is the national digitisation programme, which plays a key role in the country’s future.</p>
<p>The ‘JAM trinity’ (Jan Dhan – Aadhaar – Mobile) of initiatives encapsulates this movement. Jan Dhan is driving financial inclusion; Aadhaar gives each citizen a unique digital identity; Mobile is the practical means of inclusion in the digital economy for almost every one of India’s 1.3bn citizens. Additionally, with the introduction of real-time 24/7 payment channels like Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) that are faster, cheaper and more convenient, there has been significant progress in moving towards a digital economy.</p>
<h3 id=""spectrum-of-opportunities"">Spectrum of opportunities</h3>
<p>With GDP growth forecasts heading towards 7%, India has become one of the most attractive destinations for investment in the emerging markets. Government reforms in the recent past have led to a lot of positive change on the ground. Additionally, India jumped 30 places to 100<sup>th</sup> in the World Bank ‘Ease of Doing Business’ ranking. Key global players are now looking to expand their footprint in India, leveraging the development and consumption growth story in the country. Meanwhile, major Indian corporates are heading overseas, some strengthening their world-stage position through acquisition.</p>
<p>The major success in India is its US$50bn (c.US$120bn by 2020) e-commerce market. Propelled by favourable drivers towards rapid growth, the Indian ecommerce market is gaining further depth and breadth through new entrants, of which key priorities are increasing their presence in India and connecting Indian consumers to global merchants.</p>
<p>India is also emerging as a preferred export hub by many MNCs, manufacturing for the rest of the world. Automotive sector expansion has seen global players form vast ecosystems of national and international suppliers including OEMS, component-makers, financing companies and distributors.</p>
<p>India has long-been an IT hub for the world, playing host to some of the world’s largest technology companies. As a sector, IT is pushing outwards to countries such as the US and Canada. As key players work evermore closely with the administrations in these countries, they are finding new ways of enhancing their overseas presence.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical sector, much given to inorganic growth, is a major player in India too, the country ranking third in the world in terms of volume. With rapid overseas M&amp;A activity, strong footholds in the US and Latin America, for example, are being created.</p>
<h3 id=""paths-to-success"">Paths to success</h3>
<p>Given the scale and impact of India’s sweeping new digital reforms, Citi is helping clients create value and drive growth through its commitment to digitise and implement innovative solutions. Digitisation has eliminated much of the trade paper-flow. The creation by the government of a centralised data repository connecting customs, regulators, banks and clients, has enabled Citi to offer an end-to-end digital solution, simplifying cross-border trade payments and significantly improving efficiencies for clients.</p>
<p>With the rapid emergence of Indian e-commerce, Citi has helped clients by facilitating seamless payment mechanisms through specialised cross-border remittance solutions, working closely with the regulators.</p>
<p>To help clients navigate this dynamic environment, Citi is keen to partner with treasuries on their digital transformation journey. With progress encompassing the entire working capital cycle, Citi’s view is that the best next-generation solutions for clients can be developed through leveraging collaborative partnerships with the FinTech community. For Iyer, the agility, and new solutions of start-ups, combined with Citi’s unique global platform and network, will ensure the bank executes on its commitment to be the best for its clients.</p>

<figure class=""portrait left"" style=""float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0;""><img alt=""Portrait of Yigen Pei"" class=""photo"" height=""150"" src=""/i/2018/07/2018-07and08-tta-07-st__yigen-pei__100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h4 class=""fn"">Yigen Pei</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, China, Citi</h5>
<img alt=""Citi"" class=""logo org"" height=""29"" src=""/i/logo/citi-logo-blue-2012-50x29.png"" style=""margin: 1em 0 0 0;"" title=""Citi"" width=""50""/>

<p style=""clear: both;"">When making judgments about China as a commercial opportunity, there are three key concepts treasurers must contemplate, says Yigen Pei, Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, China, Citi: de-regulation, globalisation and digitisation.</p>
<p>China has become a fast-growing and complex market in a relatively short period. It used to retain a deeply conservative approach to regulation, particularly around exchange and interest rates, yet the trend is for a relatively accommodative environment for financial innovation.</p>
<h3 id=""two-way-flow"">Two-way flow</h3>
<p>The country has benefitted from globalisation, with the arrival of many MNCs onshore. But increasingly, Chinese companies are heading outwards, not least under the banner of the country’s vast Belt and Road initiative (BRI). With renminbi progressively becoming a usable international currency, and the gradual opening of capital accounts onshore, China’s increased accessibility is striking, with trading opportunities very much bi-directional.</p>
<p>No emerging economy has travelled far down the road without the adoption of new technologies; China is no different. The penetration of internet and mobile devices, and the development of new channels, especially in the consumer space, have been key to success. Indeed, the transformation of traditional payment products into the digital realm has pushed e-commerce to the forefront of China’s emerging market opportunities.</p>
<p>That said, China is still at a transitional stage, says Pei. MNCs in the country are looking for the introduction of best practice. They want to hook their Chinese operations into their international networks, matching systems and processes seen in Europe and North America. Transformation must reach the subsidiaries, and provide an overlay in selected centres within China, before connecting to global operations.</p>
<p>Home-grown companies are catching up quickly; as they reach out across the world, they are adapting success stories, upgrading entire ecosystems accordingly. Companies are seeking full platform uniformity and system support, often via their banks.</p>
<h3 id=""hope-and-patience"">Hope and patience</h3>
<p>China’s commercial ecosystem is dynamic and complex; tackling its regulatory landscape is sometimes a challenge for corporates, says Pei. While financial liberalisation is under way, government intervention in home affairs can see it correcting undue market practices, stepping in, for example, to cool an over-leveraged shadow banking sector. All this must be understood by treasurers for the right decisions to be taken. For the uninitiated in transformation, be hopeful but also be patient, advises Pei.</p>
<p>China is morphing into a dynamic consumer market. Domestic and international players in retail, pharma and auto sectors, in particular, are significant beneficiaries of this re-invention. With the country often cited by foreign majors as their largest or second largest market, corporates seeking growth cannot ignore it.</p>
<p>The services sector has been a major growth story in China too. App-based taxi services or travel service aggregators, for example, are exploiting new technologies and channels, playing on the provision of convenience, often to China’s young demographic.</p>
<p>Even indirectly, huge demand is being generated by China’s growth, says Pei. With Chinese companies moving further afield, investing and acquiring but also constructing under schemes such as BRI, foreign MNCs can benefit.

<p>Chinese companies – including those in the digital economy – are expanding into new markets, often by acquisition. These are often fuelled by international capital, PE firms or VC money. This activity also presents global banks such as Citi with opportunities to service corporates travelling in either direction.</p>
<p>Of course, Chinese businesses heading outwards must be prepared for new political risks, market volatilities (especially FX and interest rates) and cultural factors. They must establish process and management structures, and ensure people are in place with international vision, says Pei. Failure to respond can see operations become fractured, increasing risk. The same broad awareness applies to banking partners. The ability to advise on local market risk and opportunities, yet give a global perspective, is crucial for expansion, whether incoming or outgoing.</p>
<h3 id=""call-to-action"">Call to action</h3>
<p>The pace of change means corporates operating in China need to stay alert, says Pei. Treasurers must closely follow market developments and communicate changes to all stakeholders rapidly because what was done yesterday might be outdated by tomorrow.</p>
<p>It can be a challenge, says Pei, but with the right partner it is possible to adapt to even the most changeable of environments. Citi’s long history in the region, allied with its global reach, enables clients to benefit from a timely flow of essential and actionable information.</p>
<p>By accessing the bank’s local connections, global intelligence and flexible solution set, building upon the pillars of de-regulation, globalisation and digitisation becomes less about the challenges, and more about opportunities.</p>

<p style=""clear: both;"">The ten members of ASEAN have a combined GDP of circa US$2.6trn. This makes it the world’s fifth largest economy, a position that is expected to improve by one place by 2050, according to World Bank estimates. It boasts consistent growth over the past six years of around 5%. These figures meet ASEAN’s youthful demographic (more than 50% of its 550m people are under 30), and growing middle-class, head-on, presenting an exciting opportunity for businesses.</p>
<h3 id=""consumer-drive"">Consumer drive</h3>
<p>Consumption and wealth is expected to continue growing, with the overall expectation for ASEAN’s expanding middle-class and youth segments to raise aspirational consumption and online activity, says Debopama Sen, Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, ASEAN, Citi.</p>
<p>There is also noteworthy traction for ASEAN FDI, with Europe and the US showing increasing interest in the financial sector, for example, China ploughing a lot into finance, and the retail and wholesale trades, and Korea developing its manufacturing interests.</p>
<p>Intra-regional investment is conspicuously increasing too. It now represents around 25% of all ASEAN FDI. With 2016 setting a record intra-regional high of US$24bn, Sen notes that many regional corporates are making concerted ASEAN growth plans.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that corporates from all regions do not typically see their ASEAN investment through a single lens of, for example, cost arbitrage or consumer-market access, says Sen. Instead, it is commonly approached with multiple drivers in mind. This, she comments, makes for sustainable regional growth in what remains a highly changeable market.</p>
<h3 id=""digital-agenda"">Digital agenda</h3>
<p>At a government level, ASEAN is driven by different themes. Infrastructure spend, attracting foreign investment, improving business facilitation rankings, and encouraging innovation are, in varied combinations, part of the region’s growth plans. Singapore, for instance, continues to boost its status as a global liquidity centre, Vietnam as a manufacturing hub.</p>
<p>However, in all cases, there is a proactive regional-level agenda, says Sen. Almost every corporate today, whether it is a digital native or a traditional company, has a digital transformation strategy because this is seen as the only way to sustain growth. “This is a key place where we partner with these businesses, helping them on their digital transformation journey,” says Sen.</p>
<p>With several clients benefiting from Citi’s expertise in navigating the rapidly changing payments landscape in ASEAN, Sen says the process is about educating clients as to what is possible, helping them to understand the benefits of technology in their unique circumstances, and then making that happen.</p>
<p>A recent case in point is Citi’s work with an e-commerce retail client in Singapore. This business was struggling to provide immediate online confirmations to customers that their payments had been successful. “We worked to leverage the Fast and Secure Transactions (FAST) network in Singapore to give them instant reconciliations,” says Sen. This has helped the client process thousands of payments per month with instant confirmations for every end-customer.</p>
<p>As well as the efforts of Citi with its own clients, digital progress across the region is helped by determined knowledge-sharing amongst ASEAN members. There is a collective will to progress. With most members now driving a payments digitisation agenda, Sen believes that by 2020 all will have 24/7 real-time payments mechanisms, facilitating, amongst other benefits, rapid e-commerce growth.</p>
<p>It is vital now for treasurers to harness this evolving digital payments landscape. It is especially important to grasp what is happening in the real-time payments space, advises Sen, “as this may eventually impact how your customers do business with you”.</p>
<p>This means fully understanding how technology can impact end-customer relationships, channel management and, ultimately, liquidity planning. “If your business is using instant payments on both sides of your working capital cycle, then how you manage liquidity may also change,” she explains.</p>
<p>Similarly, treasurers must be proactively involved in sales and procurement cycles to optimise working capital, constantly investigating supplier and customer sides of the value chain to understand how the business can be more efficient on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, treasurers must be equipped to navigate the frequent regulatory changes that are typically issued by the developing members because here too there may be opportunities to leverage ASEAN’s developing trade environment.</p>
<p>At the corporate level, there are few, if any, serious impediments to market entry, says Sen. However, complexity and opportunity can present in equal measures. As such, Citi, as a global yet local partner, has the footprint and experience to steer clients through the ASEAN maze. Regardless of how progress is achieved, ignoring what could soon be the world’s fourth largest economy is surely not an option.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>As the payment world becomes increasingly electronic, many might think that the long-heralded death of cash is almost here. However, data shows that in many markets the opposite is true and notes and coins are in fact making a comeback. Should treasury teams be preparing for a cashless world, or is physical cash here to stay – and if so, what can treasury teams do to manage it effectively? Treasury Today finds out.</em></p>
<p> “Sorry, we don’t accept cash,” is an increasingly common phrase uttered in retail outlets around the world as businesses pivot customers away from notes and coins onto electronic forms of payment. In many markets, customers need no encouragement when it comes to using electronic forms of payment and are increasingly leveraging cards and mobile-based forms of payment as a matter of convenience.</p>
<p>The data clearly supports this. In the UK, for instance, cards are set to take over cash as the most popular form of payment this year, according to UK Finance. In Australia, 52% of consumer payments are made with cards – two-thirds of which are contactless – according to the latest Consumer Payments Survey. Meanwhile in Sweden, which is regarded as the most cashless country in the world, a 2017 study found that 36% of people never use cash or use it only once or twice a year.</p>
<p>The move away from cash is even more rapid in the developing world. Countries such as Kenya, China and India are very quickly becoming cashless economies as large unbanked populations leverage digital wallets as a means of financial inclusion. Indeed, according to the 2017 World Payments Report from Capgemini and BNP Paribas, cashless transactions in developing economies will grow at a rate of 19.6% until 2020.</p>
<h3 id=""why-cash-should-die"">Why cash should die</h3>
<p>Why then are we saying goodbye to cash? For Rohit Talwar, world-renowned futurist and CEO at Fast Future, the answer is simple: eliminating cash has huge benefits. He notes that digitalised payments provide a safer and more convenient way for individuals to transact. Indeed, a study from Tufts University found that on average, Americans spend 5.6 hours a year withdrawing cash from ATMs at a cost of US$8bn a year on ATM fees. There is also the hygiene factor: an Oxford University study showed that the average European banknote contains 26,000 bacterial colonies.</p>
<p>Businesses are keen to see cash disappear because it is inefficient and costly to manage. Cash also exposes businesses to significant risks, notably theft and fraud. Indeed, the Tufts University study found that US businesses lose roughly US$40bn a year to cash theft and loss, about 1% of total revenues.</p>
<p>Finally, governments are also keen to drive cash out of the system. Talwar comments on how this helps “reduce corruption, crime, shadow economic activity, and tax avoidance”. Again, Tufts University estimates that the US government loses out on US$100bn-US$500bn in tax revenues each year, due to cash being used as a method of payment to avoid tax.</p>
<p>In India, the government took a radical step to combat tax avoidance when it suddenly ordered the demonetisation of all Mahatma Gandhi Series Rs500 and Rs1000 notes – which constituted 85% of the total currency under circulation – in 2016. At the time, Prime Minister Modi said that corrupt officials, executives and criminals would be stuck with “worthless pieces of paper” as they would be unwilling to transfer these for the new Rs500 and Rs2000 notes.</p>
<p>A year and a half on, the success of the move is up for debate as it caused a significant shock to the Indian economy and negatively impacted individuals and businesses. It also seemingly has not driven out black money. Recent stats from the Finance Ministry show that 99% of the old notes have been swapped, far more than had been expected. It has been suggested that those in possession of black money have used complex money-laundering networks to deposit undeclared currency without exposing themselves to the tax authorities. Apparently, the only way to stop cash being used for tax avoidance may be to remove it altogether.</p>

<h3 id=""increase-in-cash-in-circulation"">Increase in cash in circulation</h3>
<p>Demonetisation was also meant to kick-start Modi’s Cashless India initiative. And whilst digital payment volumes in India have increased since 2016, the number has fallen short of the government’s targets. At the same time, the amount of cash in circulation across India has surpassed the amount before demonetisation.</p>
<p>India is not unique in this. Given the clear move towards digital payments around the world, it would be rational to assume that the death of physical cash is nigh. However, while the use of cash as a method of payment falls, the demand for cash and cash in circulation around the world is increasing at a steady rate.</p>
<p>Take the UK, for example: in 2017 there was £73,198m worth of notes in circulation, up from £67,819m in 2016. Yet apparently the UK is set to move beyond “peak cash” this year, with cards poised to be used for purchases more frequently than cards and coins. The story is similar across many eurozone countries, the United States, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan.</p>
<p>There is no single reason that this is the case. However, Talwar speculates that in developing countries “the cashless movement could lead to exclusion of poor and more vulnerable segments of the population that do not have bank accounts or cell phones”. He also notes that opposition to digital payments may be coming “from those who see this as a further incursion of ‘big brother’ into our lives, and yet another erosion of individual privacy”.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-headaches"">Treasury headaches</h3>
<img alt="""" height=""669"" src=""/i/2018/05/2018-05and06-tt-01__ia__infographic-01__249x669.png"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""249"">
<p>The continued use of cash is not good news for treasury teams that must put in place products and strategies to manage its collection. The treasury team at British American Tobacco (BAT) is fully aware of these issues. Indeed, Philip Stewart, Global Head of Cash &amp; Banking at BAT says that the company collects a “significant” amount of cash around the world, including in key markets like Indonesia, Brazil and South Africa where it sells directly to retailers.</p>
<p>In those markets where cash is a reality, Stewart explains that BAT has strived to put in place processes that make cash collection and management as efficient as possible. For example, in some of the large depots in Colombia and South Africa, the company has tellers from its relationship banks count and deposit the cash on site. “This enables us to quickly transfer the risk to the bank,” says Stewart. “It also allows us to achieve same day value and same day reconciliation.” In the company’s smaller depots, BAT utilises cash counting machines, which provide similar benefits to the onsite tellers.</p>
<p>Stewart explains that employing these solutions and making cash collection as efficient as possible is not just about mitigating risks and reducing costs: it is about enabling the company’s representatives to focus on selling its products. “When they are working we want them to be out there selling, not coming back to the depo to count cash,” he says. “So, making this process efficient and standardised is adding value to the business.”</p>
<p>Of course, the ultimate aim for the BAT treasury is to drive cash out of the business by incentivising its customers to use digital forms of payment. “There is a lot of work being done across the company to encourage our customers to pay without using cash and we have had some success with customers beginning to pay us using cards or through mobile wallet solutions,” says Stewart. “However, we cannot force this because we are not going to risk losing business by forcing our customers to pay in a way that they don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Stewart believes it is just a matter of waiting for the markets that still rely on cash to reach that tipping point where digital payments become the norm. “We have worked hard to make sure we have the tools to facilitate digital payments in all our markets once the market is ready and we will continue to do our part driving the change.”

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading"">Case Study</h3>
<h3>Sweden: the most cashless country on earth</h3>
<p>Cash is dying in Sweden. Statistics from the Central Bank show that between 2010 and 2016 the use of cash payments in the retail sector declined around 40%. And with businesses across the country increasingly no longer accepting cash, it is unlikely to be long before the Swedish krona only exists in bits and bytes.</p>
<p>The reason for this, explains Gabriela Guibourg, Head of Division for Analysis and Policy at Riksbank, is two-fold. Firstly, demographically Sweden has a homogeneous, well educated, technology savvy population that responds positively to innovation. This has seen the consumption behaviour of Swedes rapidly change with more and more preferring to shop online which requires digital forms of payment, which they then want to use in the high street. “In this respect, the shift to digital payments is following the natural evolution of societal behaviour,” says Guibourg.</p>
<p>Another driving factor is the highly cooperative and innovative financial sector in Sweden, which has responded to market demand for digital payments by creating the infrastructure to make this happen at scale. Guibourg cites the success of the Swish mobile payment system as being a prime example. Launched in 2012 by seven large Swedish banks in partnership with the Central Bank, Swish is now used by over 50% of the population.</p>
<p>“Swish was initially created as a platform for real-time, low-value P2P payments,” says Guibourg. “It then began to be used as a collection method by businesses and most recently as an online payment method. The solution has therefore played a big role in removing cash from many different types of transactions.”</p>
<p>In Guibourg’s view, the disappearance of physical cash in Sweden is largely a positive phenomenon. However, it also creates some issues. “Firstly, there are individuals in Sweden that are not ready to live in a cashless county,” says Guibourg. “Also, the disappearance of physical cash means that individuals will no longer have access to Central Bank money – historically the only asset that is completely risk-free and liquid.”</p>
<p>The rise of digital payments also means that there is the possibility that the payment market will become dominated by a few private participants, says Guibourg. “This creates vulnerability and may stifle innovation if these new entrants are barred from accessing these payment rails.”</p>
<p>These are the main reasons behind the bank’s exploration into issuing a state-backed digital currency, the e-krona. “This would act as a complement to cash and ensure that individuals still have access to central bank-backed money,” says Guibourg. “The idea is also to build a new payment infrastructure to underpin the e-krona that would be competition neutral. This would allow the market to build innovative solutions and ensure that Sweden continues to lead the world when it comes to digital payments.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is important that in a cashless world there is still the ability to access central bank-backed money, says Guibourg. “A strong and sound monetary system needs to have a trusted issuer – the whole system of fiat money relies on the fact that people trust that money will be accepted by others and have a stable value.”</p>

<p>It is clear then that one of the chief tasks for any treasury
team working in a cash-heavy business is to wean customers off cash. The
good news is that in many traditional cash-heavy countries, like China
and many African and South East Asian markets, there are now solutions
that enable businesses to do this. Namita Lal, Managing Director, Global
Head Payments, Collections, Mobile Money, eCommerce at Standard
Chartered, cites the mobile phone and the emergence of mobile money as
being a game changer in these markets, “bringing financial solutions to a
traditionally large unbanked population”.</p>
<p>While mobile money may have been developed to facilitate P2P
payments, businesses have quickly recognised the opportunity to collect
and pay using these solutions. Doing so has helped many companies reduce
the amount of cash they must manage, bringing efficiency gains and cost
savings. However, Lal explains that beyond that, the proliferation of
mobile money has enabled businesses to access a much bigger market of
consumers and even evolve their business models. She cites insurance
companies as an example, many of which are now able to offer
micro-insurance products due to the reduced cost of the payment process.</p>
<p>However, whilst the growing acceptance of mobile wallets
has certainly benefited businesses, it has also created some challenges
for treasury. Most notably, treasury teams are now having to facilitate
and manage a multitude of payment types, as businesses must offer
customers their preferred method of payment to be competitive. This is a
challenge for treasury because onboarding these wallet providers takes
time and resources. At the same time, treasurers have no desire to
manage tens, if not hundreds, of individual payment portals.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered thinks it has the solution. “We’ve built a single
gateway that enables our clients to seamlessly connect with multiple
payment options in the countries they operate in,” says Lal. “This
removes the need for treasury to create bespoke arrangements with these
wallet providers. It also ensures that they receive a consistent
experience, no matter how they are being paid, and all the
reconciliation efficiencies this brings.”</p>
<h3 id=""value-adding"">Value adding</h3>
<p>Moving from cash to digital payments is not just about efficiency: it
is about data. Data that if harnessed correctly can see treasury
deliver increased value to the wider organisation and ultimately boost
the top line.</p>
<p>Andrew Wray, Vice President at Yoyo Wallet, explains that currently
retailers only receive basic transactional data at the point of sale
(POS). “However, by tapping into the point of sale through a simple
transaction API, retailers can gain full stock keeping unit level basket
data, which reveals who each customer is, what they’re buying and
when.”</p>
<p>Wray explains that with basket data insight comes the ability to
segment customers, connecting basket data to preferences and behaviours
on an individual level. “The next step is to use this insight to engage
each individual by personalising their experience, which will increase
the effectiveness of campaigns,” Wray says. “It’sabout the consumer
receiving offers and rewards that are most relevant to them. And the
more relevant the offers and rewards are, the more engaged a customer
will be with a brand.”</p>
<p>With this information, businesses can then engage individuals by
personalising their experience, which will in turn increase the
effectiveness of campaigns. “Once customer segments are developed,
retailers can target them with a campaign that either rewards, thanks,
or encourages them to carry out a certain behaviour,” Wray adds.</p>
<h3 id=""the-end-of-cash-is-coming"">The end of cash is coming</h3>
<p>For treasurers in certain businesses, it is clear that the move away
from cash presents a tremendous opportunity to add value to the
organisation by creating efficiencies and harnessing the power of data.
The challenge, however, will be to find ways of accepting this plethora
of payment types without creating a spaghetti-bowl of complexity.</p>
<p>And cash will have to remain a consideration. Indeed, whilst it is
widely believed that cash will soon disappear, it is clinging on for
dear life. Fast Futures Talwar anticipates that it might take 20 to 30
years for cash to become extinct.</p>
<p>“While there are clearly many potential benefits to shift to an
entirely digital medium of exchange, there are also significant hurdles
and concerns to be addressed,” he says. “The pace of transition could
therefore vary quite dramatically between nations and the process may
require a fundamental reshaping of economies.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Will the game of musical chairs in the White House and Trump’s stance towards the rest of the world fan the geopolitical flames and what will this mean for global markets?</em></p>
<p>“I’ve heard that you’re actually the devil incarnate and I wanted to meet you,” said US Secretary of Defence, James Mattis, to John Bolton, President Trump’s new National Security Adviser. The latter has a reputation as a neoconservative hawk who is not that worried if war breaks out. Nor does he shy away from confrontations with America’s allies. The appointment of Bolton continued the trend of choosing ever tougher hardliners as advisers and ministers. At the same time, many officials who were known for being moderates have been given the boot – often via Twitter.</p>
<p>Two comments are in order. First, folk who are not particularly diplomatic and thoughtful have also been ejected from the White House including Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn, and Sebastian Gorka. Plus, some of the people who were expected to keep Trump on track were not up to the task so their departure does not give cause for great concern. Take, for example, former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. Trump refused to take him seriously and/or ignored him. On top of this, he managed to antagonise his own department.</p>
<p>Second, the fact that ‘hawks’ are appointed to important positions does not automatically spell disaster. Historically, there have been instances when hardliners came up with gestures of reconciliation. This is not as surprising as it seems. After all, if a hardliner strikes a compromise this is easier to sell to supporters. Examples are Yitzhak Rabin’s territorial concessions to the Palestinians and the opening to China orchestrated by Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon.</p>
<h3 id=""dangerous-people"">Dangerous people?</h3>
<p>In other words, the game of musical chairs in the White House may not have such a dire outcome as some are predicting. Yet there is no guarantee that everything will turn out fine. Trump seems hell-bent – consciously or not – on doing everything within his power to confuse allies and opponents alike with his zigzag policies and out-of-control tweets. The hardliners outnumber the rest. John Bolton is far from alone; there is also Peter Navarro (the main economic adviser) and Mike Pompeo (the new Secretary of State). Meanwhile, those who appeared to keep things together are either increasingly irrelevant or gone.</p>
<p>The aforementioned trio – Trump, Pompeo, and Bolton – bring to mind British writer D.H. Lawrence who said in 1923: “The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer. It has never yet melted.” Half a century later, US historian Richard Hofstadter added: “Americans certainly have reason to inquire whether, when compared with other advanced industrial nations, they are not a people of exceptional violence.”</p>
<p>It is crystal clear that Trump has no qualms about taking a hard stance. Apparently, he enjoys seeing his allies flounder in an ocean of uncertainty and unpredictability and relishes being blunt.</p>
<h3 id=""north-korean-pessimism"">North Korean pessimism</h3>
<p>We will find out shortly if the US President will continue to steamroller forward and if he is going to initiate new crises with Pyongyang and Teheran and/or unsettle the world trade system.</p>
<p>We think the likelihood of a major breakthrough in relation to North Korea is not that high:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kim Jong-un will not give up his nuclear arsenal; he has seen what happens to dictators who discarded their weapons of mass destruction (Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kim’s attitude has frustrated China in recent years but the chance is very slim that Beijing will give the North Korean leader the chop. Millions of refugees could flock to the Chinese border in a worst-case scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Japan and South Korea (both are allies of the US) do not want to put the screws on North Korea with too much force as they fear a destabilising regional crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US demands complete nuclear disarmament from North Korea. Pyongyang wants America to considerably scale down its involvement in the region. There is not much room for manoeuvre on either side of the fence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North Korea is haunted by deep fears of the US. The Americans carpet-bombed the country in the 1950s. Korean cities suffered greater damage than the German and Japanese cities that were firebombed during World War II.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>So from a geopolitical perspective Trump &amp; Co could fan global tensions rather than douse them in the coming period.
</p>
<h3 id=""fading-order"">Fading order</h3>
<p>As to trade, it is increasingly clear that Trump regards China as his real adversary. The problem is that he riles countries that he badly needs to help him rein in the giant country. On top of this, he is undermining the global liberal order that has benefitted America in the past decades.</p>
<p>Voltaire wrote about the Holy Roman Empire – which was tottering on its last legs after 1,000 years – that it was no longer holy, nor Roman, or even an empire. The same now applies to the global liberal world order according to Richard N. Haass, “the fading liberal world order is neither liberal nor worldwide nor orderly”.</p>
<p>Trump appears to half-heartedly apply the lessons learned from Lord Palmerston, the 19<sup>th</sup> century statesman who said: “We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow.” The British interpreted Palmerston’s wisdom as a constant rebalancing of the European powers whereby the idea was to support the weaker European powers against the strongest great power in order to prevent hegemony on the continent. Trump takes a different approach. His very free translation boils down to America First. He does not seem to have any permanent friends or enemies even if he occasionally makes an exception for both camps. The only ‘fixed point’ seems to be Trump’s own (permanent) interests.</p>
<h3 id=""vulnerable-america"">Vulnerable America</h3>
<p>This takes us to the implications for the financial markets. Most experts think the US economy is way ahead of Europe (and other countries) in the economic cycle. If so, one consequence is that the statistical likelihood of a recession is rising. And whereas the Fed may slowly be applying the monetary brake, the central bank has too few buffers, it would seem, to effectively counter the next recession.</p>
<p>America is more vulnerable than it appears at first glance. Inequality has markedly increased in recent years. Plus, the median earnings for a fifth of all jobs are below the poverty line. Debts are again rising steadily while the financial sector comprises almost as large a portion of the economy as before the crisis and it very much remains to be seen if the sector is supervised properly.</p>
<p>Considering these weaknesses, whereas the central bank certainly has not regained its full fire power, the US cannot really afford to opt for political stunting. Europe is also riddled with weaknesses. Our economists refer time and again to the considerable interest rate gaps between Europe and the US. However, whereas EUR/USD could indeed drop substantially in the long run, the uncertain goings-on in Washington could counter that movement to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Self-evidently, neither John Bolton nor Donald Trump really is the devil incarnate. Yet, there seems to be a growing chance that Washington will fan the geopolitical flames. If so, things may well get too hot for the liberal world order – in as far as the latter still exists.</p>

<p><em>With 12 months remaining before Brexit becomes a reality, what are the possible outcomes – and how should treasurers be preparing?</em></p>
<p>With only a year to go before the UK leaves the European Union – the departure is scheduled for 11pm UK time on 29<sup>th</sup> March 2019 – much remains unclear about the final form that Brexit will take. While some agreement has been reached on issues such as the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens in the EU and the status of the Northern Ireland border, there is plenty yet to be decided.</p>
<p>More should become clear in the coming months. Negotiations are due to take place in March about the proposed transition period, with the UK aiming for a two-year period following the departure date. The next stage of talks will focus on negotiating a trade agreement, the outcome of which will have lasting implications for companies in the UK and Europe.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is plenty that treasurers should be doing to help prepare their businesses for the challenges ahead. From understanding changes to the business model to carrying out quantitative analysis, Treasury Today explores some of the areas that treasurers should be looking at in 2018.</p>
<h3 id=""hard-or-soft-brexit"">Hard or soft Brexit?</h3>
<p>There may be only a year left before Brexit becomes reality, but there are still many questions remaining about the final form that the UK’s departure will take. At this stage, given the continuing uncertainties, there are three possible scenarios to consider, says David Farrow, Head of Global Transaction Banking, Barclays Corporate Banking.</p>
<img alt=""The UK will leave the EU on 29th March 2019"" height=""125"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/2018-03and04-tt-02-ia__fact-01__uk-will-leave-the-eu-on-29th-march-2019__222x125.png?la=en&amp;hash=DE72F322D11928BE35B977ACC9F6CC96"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""222"">
<p>“At one end of the scale, a ‘soft’ Brexit with the status quo largely maintained and a transition phase for EU businesses to adapt; at the other end a ‘hard’ Brexit with the UK taking a full exit from the EU/EEA with no passporting rights or transitional arrangements,” he explains. “In the middle is what we’re calling the ‘Flavours of Brexit’, essentially a blend or patchwork quilt from both ends of the scenario scale.”</p>
<p>The still-wide range of possible outcomes makes it challenging for treasurers to predict what the outcomes of Brexit will be for their businesses – but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be examining these. As Farrow notes, “The lack of clarity means treasurers should ensure they have given thought to what a ‘no deal’ Brexit would mean for them and how they would ensure continued UK-EU access in the absence of a deal.”</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-the-impact"">Understanding the impact</h4>
<p>As a result, treasurers should consider the impact of the different possible Brexit outcomes. For example, Farrow says that a ‘hard’ Brexit could mean treasurers face material impacts on core activities. “Impacts could be felt across the spectrum of treasury activities, with many facing increased costs, increased friction or inefficiencies and potentially increased tax liabilities,” he says. “While the impacts are conceptually no greater than the complexities of doing business cross-border in other markets, treasurers used to a coherent single market with relatively low costs will need to restructure their treasury operations to mitigate these impacts.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Profit growth at the UK’s largest companies is expected to fall by more than half in 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, he says that in the case of a ‘soft’ Brexit, “we believe the status quo will be largely maintained and corporates will continue to be able to access financial markets across the EU and UK without material changes”. Nevertheless, Farrow also points out that there are many possible permutations within the ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ scenarios – “including the possibility that the UK could be granted continued SEPA membership even in a ‘hard’ Brexit”.</p>
<h4 id=""planning-for-the-worst-case-scenario"">Planning for the worst-case scenario</h4>
<p>While the final details of Brexit will become clearer in the coming months, treasurers should not be tempted to wait and see how things progress. Farrow says there is a risk that the time between an agreement being reached and the point of Brexit will be shorter than the time needed to implement mitigating strategies. As a result, “companies need to plan for the worst-case scenario and start exploring contingencies now and implement any ‘no regret’ moves”.</p>
<h3 id=""staying-informed"">Staying informed</h3>
<img alt=""Brexit vote has already inflicted a hit of almost £20bn on the UK economy"" height=""125"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/2018-03and04-tt-02-ia__fact-02__brexit-vote-has-already-inflicated-a-hit-of-almost-20bn__169x125.png?la=en&amp;hash=E456B874F7B5E1697804484734781A32"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""169""/>
<p>It goes without saying that treasurers need to make sure they are well informed about the implications that the UK’s departure from the EU will have on their businesses. David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC, says that a key consideration is how business models may change as a result of Brexit.</p>
<p>“Treasury is there because the business is there, and not the other way around,” he comments. “So if the business is amending the way it does business, your policies might not change – but the way that you do things might have to change.” He adds that changes to the business model could alter the nature of a company’s FX exposures or cash flows, meaning that FX hedging will need to be amended and cash management adjusted to take account of the new business environment.</p>
<p>“Our greatest focus is on regulatory developments, to which end we stay in close touch with a range of contacts at financial institutions and external counsel,” says Rick Martin, Group Treasurer at GasLog, an owner, operator and manager of liquefied natural gas carriers. “At a more general level, we monitor developments that could impact international trade, given the nature of the shipping business.” Martin notes that while there is considerable uncertainty, “we are maintaining a high degree of flexibility in our operational treasury ‘tool kit’, such that as the way forward becomes clearer, we nonetheless maximise our ability to continue operating at a high level of efficiency”.</p>
<h3 id=""understanding-the-risks"">Understanding the risks</h3>
<p>As Brexit approaches, treasurers will need to understand the full range of possible risks and impacts. From trade tariffs to FX volatility, here are some of the areas which treasurers should be monitoring in the months ahead:</p>
<h4 id=""supply-chains-and-labour"">Supply chains and labour</h4>
<p>According to Farrow of Barclays Corporate Banking, “The biggest potential impact of Brexit will be on physical supply chains, where new tariffs or restrictions could create costs or delays, and on the labour market where some employment practices may no longer be viable.” However, not all of the possible impacts are disadvantageous. As Farrow explains, “Businesses may benefit from new trade deals, a more favourable regulatory environment in the UK and the near-term benefits of sterling depreciation for UK exporters.”</p>
<h4 id=""fx-and-interest-rate-volatility"">FX and interest rate volatility</h4>
<p>Eric Peterson, Director and corporate treasury services lead at KPMG UK, notes that the main issue for corporate treasurers is how to deal with the volatility which has arisen in the currency market and interest rate market from the uncertainty about how exactly Brexit will play out.</p>
<p>“The key aspect when we’re speaking with corporate treasurers is that they really understand their cash flows,” he says. “When you’re dealing with some of the volatility in the FX market, a lot of the outflows in your purchases are in pounds, but actually your transactions might be linked to other currencies like dollars. So if I’m buying energy, I’m probably paying pounds for energy – but that energy price is very much dependent on another currency. Commodities are similar. Then you might have outbound expenses in other currencies.”</p>
<p>Once treasurers have mapped their exposures and inflows, Peterson says the next step is to use value at risk (VaR) or cash flow at risk (CFaR) quantitative models to test whether a company has the flexible liquidity and the tools needed to make it through any adverse shocks. This might involve modelling a range of different scenarios to test what specific shocks could mean to the business, from losing 20% of revenue to being unable to access commercial paper.</p>
<p>Peterson says that that the use of quantitative analysis is a notable development. “Far more treasurers are using quantitative analysis instead of ‘back of the envelope’ types of calculation,” he says. “So they are looking at their FX risk, what that means from a CFaR perspective and what mitigations they can take – Should I enter into derivatives? Should I get additional liquidity? Do I have the right balance to make it through a period of instability?”</p>
<h4 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h4>
<p>Treasurers should also be monitoring the impact on their companies’ cash management arrangements. Andrew Marshall, Managing Partner of Covarius, notes the importance of engaging with banks to discuss the impact of Brexit on cash pooling and sweeping structures, “in particular where eurozone cash pool structures may be swept/centralised to a London-based account”.</p>
<p>According to Marshall, there may be possible disruption to the normal operations of the sweeping structure. “Exactly how disruptive is unclear but the discussions need to begin with your banking partners to better clarify and understand the risks, and to start formulating a ‘Plan B’ – which may ultimately mean moving/relocating cash pool centres away from London-based accounts,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""certainty-of-contracts"">Certainty of contracts</h4>
<img alt=""Brexit vote has already inflicted a hit of almost £20bn on the UK economy"" height=""172"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/2018-03and04-tt-02-ia__fact-03__25-percent-decrease-in-uk-business-investment-expected__232x172.png?la=en&amp;hash=E3B9A40076428594BBCF3ABB41E37323"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""232""/>
<p>Joe Cassidy, Partner and Brexit lead for Financial Services at KPMG UK, says that another issue relates to the certainty of contracts such as commercial contracts, insurance contracts and derivative contracts. “The only thing we’ve got any certainty on is the consumer side of insurance contracts – everything else is up in the air,” he says.</p>
<p>For derivative contracts used to hedge the interest rate risk and inflation risk associated with long dated bond issuance, Cassidy says that a key question will be about the basis for that contract going forward. “If you talk to regulators, our own view is that’s not a bilateral discussion about the certainty of that contract,” he says. “It’s an industry-wide global challenge, with interested parties including the reserve currency banks as well as the various jurisdictions under which the contract has been papered.”</p>
<h4 id=""certainty-of-counterparty"">Certainty of counterparty</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, Cassidy says that another concern is certainty of counterparty, given that banks may be subject to “significant reconfiguration”. “They may have to get reauthorised in terms of their branches,” he says. “In a bad situation, they may need to create new subsidiaries, which may affect the quality of the counterparty you’re facing in terms of its credit risk.”</p>
<h4 id=""market-access"">Market access</h4>
<p>A further concern is the issue of market access. Farrow warns that in the event of a ‘hard’ Brexit, treasurers may need to make fundamental changes to their treasury models to ensure continued access to European markets, and to mitigate the increased costs of doing business. “At the extreme, some firms may even choose to relocate European treasury centres from the UK to the EU to ensure continued access,” he says.</p>
<p>Market access may be more problematic for some companies than for others. “The irony is that UK domiciled institutions with treasury, funding and even FCA-regulated entities domiciled in the UK are going to be the least impacted,” says Cassidy. “Those who will be most impacted are the regional corporates. If they need to access FX markets and interest rate hedging, or do some form of securitisation, those markets, on a cross-border basis, tend to be anchored in the UK.” In a worst-case scenario, Cassidy says that regional corporates could be inhibited from accessing these markets, meaning that access becomes far more expensive.</p>
<img alt=""The UK is expected to have lost 10,500 finance jobs by day one of Brexit"" height=""124"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/2018-03and04-tt-02-ia__fact-04__the-uk-is-expected-to-have-lost-10500-finance-jobs__233x124.png?la=en&amp;hash=1E8AEAF3A242A22240F09ECE9215B4F3"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""233""/>
<p>However, Cassidy also points out that corporates which have FCA-regulated entities in the UK, such as car manufacturers with consumer finance and banking capabilities, may have an advantage where market access is concerned. “This provides them with a platform to almost bypass the worst of Brexit in terms of their means of accessing capital markets, liquidity, hedging and funding,” he explains. “If you have entities in London which are regulated, you don’t have to worry about facing a weaker banking entity in continental Europe to access London markets.”</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-brexit"">Beyond Brexit</h3>
<p>As talks continue it is important to remember that Brexit is not taking place in a vacuum – and treasurers should be monitoring a number of other geopolitical risks and developments alongside the issues specifically relating to Brexit.</p>
<p>“Beyond Brexit, it is clear that US politics will have a disproportionate impact on decisions for corporate treasurers,” says Farrow. “Legislatively, the recent tax changes will have a real impact on firms with US exposures, whilst politically, the Trump twitter handle will continue to shape important geopolitical issues from North Korea to the prospects for US trade and relationship with China.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Farrow notes that political risks in Europe include the upcoming Italian elections, as well as increasing tension in Poland. “Finally, the Middle East will always remain a focal point but particularly, the ongoing proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran,” he concludes.</p></img>

The unintended consequences of US fiscal policy,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>The Trump government believe its economic policy will result in a growth rate of 3%; economists believe this is more likely to be 2% at best. What then will be the real impact of US fiscal policy and what will this mean for markets?</em></p>
<p>The US public deficit is likely to exceed 5% of GDP before too long as a result of tax cuts and higher expenditure on defence, infrastructure et cetera, in the absence of substantial cutbacks in other areas. This cannot be sustained for long. However, it will not get to this point according to Trump and the Republicans. They believe that their measures will result in far more investment activity, as a result of which productivity growth will accelerate in the future. This is expected to result in a growth rate of 3% or higher. It is believed that the resulting additional tax revenue would prevent the public deficit from rising substantially.</p>
<p>Most economists have a different view. To start with, they believe the point of full employment has virtually been reached in the US. They therefore envisage additional wage increases before long (there is more and more anecdotal evidence of this). This means that if US economic growth were to stay well above potential, imbalances would occur to the extent where a recession would soon ensue. In other words, growth would have to be pushed back to potential fairly quickly in order to prevent this.</p>
<p>This brings us to the question as to the exact level of potential growth. In this respect, the views of most economists differ from the optimistic outlook of the White House – said economists expect growth to end up at around 2% at best. However, the Fed prefers interest rates to rise to 3-4% in order to be able to absorb the impact of the next recession.</p>
<p>In the current circumstances, this would only be possible if inflation were to climb to this level as well. Hence, we believe the Fed will pursue a policy that will ensure growth still stays above potential for a while. However, the Fed would have to tread very carefully here because once the markets believe the Fed allows inflation to rise rapidly, the bond market will spin out of control – due to concerns about even higher inflation.</p>
<p>This would be a very risky development given the current soaring debts. Hence, we envisage the Fed setting the target for growth at 2.25-2.5% for the time being – it will therefore aim for a growth rate that is just above potential, as a result of which inflation would only rise slowly.</p>
<p>We therefore draw the following conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The White House and the Republicans overestimate the growth rate with their assumption of 3% growth. We believe growth will be at 2.25-2.5% in the slightly longer term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also remains to be seen whether the Fed will be able to fine-tune growth so that it reaches this level. It usually failed to do so in the past in any event. If the economy were to grow too fast for a while, with inflation rising too rapidly, a recession would definitely occur before too long. Importantly, the lower the level of productivity growth, the sooner and faster inflation would rise. This is an important point, now growth seems to keep hovering at around 3% for the time being as a result of the tax cuts – this would be well above potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All leveraged parties in the US could soon be hit by far higher interest charges. In itself, an interest level of approximately 3.5% is still historically low. However, debts have exploded over the past decades because interest charges stayed at more or less the same level as a result of lower interest rates. If the interest level were to increase from 1% to 3.5% now, this would come down to roughly a tripling of interest charges over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wage increases will probably reach higher levels before inflation starts rising. In a situation where productivity growth lacks a distinct uptrend, this would soon result in higher unit labour costs. In conjunction with rapidly rising financing expenses, this could soon limit the increase in corporate profits considerably.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If we subsequently look at the consequences all this entails, our first assumption is that the US economy still receives substantial monetary stimulus, with fiscal stimulus coming on top of this now. In addition, fairly high growth in the rest of the world is a stimulating factor as well. This is why we believe US economic growth will amount to roughly 3% for the time being. This, in turn, means the Fed would have to pursue a tighter monetary policy. Both short-term and long-term interest rates would have to be driven to higher levels in order to gradually push back growth to 2.25-2.5%.</p>
<p>Longer-term interest rates will come under (far) more upward pressure anyway in the course of this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The prospect of higher inflation as per the Fed’s intention will drive up long-term interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fed will downscale its bond portfolio increasingly rapidly in the course of this year. The central bank will consequently have to sell more and more bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government will have to step up borrowing considerably in order to finance its deficits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China wants to invest more of its surpluses rather than saving them. This means China would have less demand for US bonds. Should Trump maintain his protectionist stance, this process would be accelerated and the same would apply to other countries as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US is developing major twin deficits (on public finances and the current account). Considering the low level of savings in the US, this requires foreign capital – in the event of a well-performing economy. The fact that the dollar exchange rate has declined lately and long-term interest rates have risen shows that foreign capital holders believe the dollar exchange rate is too high and/or US interest rates are too low for substantial investment in the US. This would probably first require monetary tightening. This would only get off the ground if wage increases and/or inflation were to reach distinctly higher levels. This is yet to happen and US monetary policy is still too loose to attract sufficient foreign capital. As long as this remains the case, there will be downward pressure on the dollar exchange rate and/or upward pressure on longer-term interest rates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Share prices have been driven up enormously since 2009 by ever lower levels of interest rates and an increasing surplus of money as a result of quantitative easing, not just in the US but outside the country as well. However, this will change now – first of all in the US, where a turnaround will occur from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening and interest rates will rise.</p>
<p>As for Europe, policy will shift from quantitative easing to neutral, rising long-term interest rates are envisaged this year and the ECB is expected to start hiking its rates by next year. A similar policy is envisaged for the rest of the world in the years to come. This therefore means that share prices were initially driven up to excessively high levels by massive monetary growth and artificially low interest rates, while they will now be faced with monetary tightening and higher interest rates to a far greater extent.</p>

</figure>
<p>Such a transition normally occurs at a slow pace, but it will probably be faster now due to the US suddenly implementing far more fiscal stimulus than was foreseen – for a long time, it was believed the tax cuts would be offset by major cutbacks on expenditure. Germany seems to be heading in this direction too. Furthermore, growth in the rest of the world is better than expected as well, which has an accelerating impact on the process.</p>
<p>In combination with persistent high valuations, we certainly expect the above-mentioned turnaround in monetary policy to cause the S&amp;P 500 index to decline towards 2,300 in the months or quarters ahead. However, as a decline below this mark would also affect US economic growth, this could moderate a further increase in interest rates.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>As China enters a brave new era and looks to gain even greater political and economic prominence around the world, new opportunities and challenges will emerge for organisations doing business in the country. Treasury Today Asia analyses the forces driving the country’s transformation and looks at what this all means for treasury.</i></p>
<p>President Xi Jinping heralded the dawn of a “new era” for China at the recent 19<sup>th</sup> Party Congress. He proclaimed that thanks to decades of “tireless struggle”, China stood “tall and firm in the east” and it was time for China to transform itself into “a mighty force” that could lead the world on political, economic, military and environmental issues. He called this the “China Dream”.</p>
<p>Xi’s words come at a time of broader global upheaval, with uncertainty awash in the world’s other great spheres of power. It is therefore possible that Xi is being opportunistic and taking advantage of the chaos elsewhere to further China’s ambitions. Xi has certainly positioned himself as the opposite to US President Donald Trump by denouncing isolationism and championing cooperation among nations, which gives weight to this claim.</p>
<p>Yet a broader analysis of Chinese political and economic systems shows that rather than being opportunistic, Xi is simply guiding China on a course that it has been on for over a decade now. And as China spreads its wings, gaining even greater political and economic prominence around the world, new challenges and opportunities will emerge. Indeed, rather than just bringing a “new era” for China, the country’s ambitions may usher in a new era for the world. As a result, corporates, perhaps more than ever, need to keep a close eye on what is happening.</p>
<h3 id=""changing-economic-direction"">Changing economic direction</h3>
<p>China’s economy – the world’s second largest – powers the country’s global aspirations. However, it is an economy currently in transition. This has seen growth in China’s economy slow down, with growth rates dropping from double digits to between 6% and 8%. A decade ago, the 6.9% GDP growth posted in 2016 would have spelt trouble for China’s leadership, which measured its success on these numbers. Today, China’s economic ambitions are different and these numbers are regarded as the “new normal”. The focus for the government is on quality and sustainability, rather than the pace of China’s economic growth.</p>
<p>Driving the shift to quality economic growth is the rebalancing of the economy. The objective of this structural transformation is to reduce the dependence on investment and manufacturing and shift towards a more service, innovation, and household consumption-driven economy. “This is something the government has been pursuing for some time and the evidence of this is starting to come through,” says Louis Kuijs, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics. “For example, the role of consumption in the economy is rising whilst the role of investment is declining in line with what we all would like to see. There has been a pronounced trend towards a larger role for the service sector in the economy.”</p>
<img alt=""Debt held by non-corporates in China stands at US$18trn"" class=""right"" height=""154"" src=""/i/2018/03/2018-03and04-tta-02-ia__fact-01__debt-held-by-non-corporate-in-china-stands-at-usd18trn__250x154.png"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""250""/>
<p>This positive news has seen China enter 2018 on a decent footing. However, some sizeable risks still exist. “When it comes to China, sentiment often changes faster than the underlying risks,” says Kuijs. “High levels of debt, which is the big risk people were emphasising a year ago, have not gone away. If anything, debt is still only rising as a share of GDP.”</p>
<p>These debt levels saw China’s long-term sovereign credit ratings cut by one notch to A+ from AA- last year by S&amp;P Global Ratings. And the rating agency still has concerns about China’s macro-credit path, calling it “unsustainable”.</p>
<p>“Credit growth remains higher than nominal GDP growth, although the gap has narrowed in the past year or so,” says Paul Gruenwald, Chief Economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings. “Although there is a healthy rebalancing toward consumption taking place, GDP growth targets need to be lowered below 6% in the medium term and reform of the credit-heavy state enterprise sector needs to be accelerated.”</p>
<h3 id=""balancing-risk-and-growth"">Balancing risk and growth</h3>
<p>The careful balancing of risk and growth is what Julia Wu, President of J.P. Morgan Chase Bank China and Head of Corporate Banking for J.P. Morgan China, pinpoints as the biggest trend in China right now. “The government has publicly stated that preventing systemic risk is its top priority,” she says. “This is why it is pushing local corporates to deleverage, pushing the banks to bring off-balance sheet items back onto the balance sheet, and strengthening the regulatory regime.”</p>
<p>China’s vast shadow banking sector is one area that has come under particular scrutiny. This has led the regulators to put several reforms in place to curb risks. One of the most notable for corporates has been the measures introduced by the CSRC to strengthen China’s money fund industry – which has total assets under management of around RMB6.5trn. These measures impose tighter limits to reduce concentration risk, limit a fund’s exposure to any single borrower and reduce a fund’s ability to invest in assets with a lower credit rating. Asset managers are also no longer able to promise investors a guaranteed rate of return.</p>
<p>Another area of China’s shadow banking industry impacted by the regulators is the use of entrusted loans – loans that are made from one company to another with a bank earning revenue by guaranteeing and arranging the transaction. Towards the end of 2017, Beijing began to clamp down on these products, meaning that banks are no longer able to provide guarantees for the loan. They have also stopped the loans from being used to buy equities, bonds or derivatives by the company borrowing.</p>
<p>Whilst these moves are clearly a step in the right direction to drive risk out of China and align the country more closely with ‘international standards’, there is a fear that they will negatively impact growth. However, with China’s economy growing faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017, this isn’t happening just yet.</p>
<img alt=""Mobile payments in China totalled RMB81trn for the first ten months of 2017"" class=""left"" height=""140"" src=""/i/2018/03/2018-03and04-tta-02-ia__fact-02__mobile-payments-in-china-totalled-rmb81trn-for-the-first-ten-months-of-2017__295x140.png"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;"" width=""295""/>
<p>China is also balancing its regulatory tightening by loosening its grip on other parts of the economy. Notable moves include the launch of bond connect – a mutual market access scheme that allow investors from mainland China and overseas to trade – which further integrates China’s financial markets with international markets. Elsewhere, China has said that it will remove foreign ownership limits on banks, while allowing overseas firms to take majority stakes in local securities ventures, fund managers and insurers – a move that will make China’s banking sector more competitive.</p>
<h3 id=""local-impact"">Local impact</h3>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s Wu says that local Chinese corporates will feel the biggest impact of these changes. “They are clearly going to have to deleverage faster than they might have initially expected,” she says. “These companies, especially those heavily engaged in or reliant on the shadow banking sector, will also be required to rethink their processes and operations.”</p>
<p>This will accelerate a broader evolution within many Chinese companies that are looking to adopt best in class principles to ensure they also achieve lasting and sustainable growth. “Many local corporates are moving overseas and expanding their operations,” explains Wu. “At the same time, they are also refocusing to ensure they concentrate on their core business.”</p>
<p>Both these trends are requiring enhanced treasury capabilities, says Wu. “Treasury teams of local corporations are very interested in how global businesses manage risk and liquidity when operating across many different markets. They are then coming to us and asking for solutions that provide them with visibility, efficiency and that also enable them to hedge risks.”</p>
<p>Tied to this uptick in treasury sophistication, Wu is seeing many companies looking to centralise their treasury activity. “Hong Kong is becoming a very attractive destination now for Chinese corporates looking at establishing regional or global treasury centres,” she says.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">In focus: the debt pile to end all debt piles?</h2>
<em> Corporate debt is a problem in China. A big problem. Data published by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) at the end of 2017 highlights this, showing that debt held by non-financial corporates in China stands at US$18trn. </em>
<p>This debt is making people nervous. The IMF has called it “dangerous”, whilst Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor at the PBOC, has acknowledged that companies in China have taken on too much debt. The fear is that with corporate debt in China continuing to grow faster than the economy, the bubble will eventually burst. The impact of this on the Chinese and global economy could be devastating, potentially creating another global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The good news is that the risk of a near-term crisis is relatively low, according to Paul Gruenwald, Chief Economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings. “Owing to its high savings rate and current account surplus, China is a self-funded country,” he says. “As long as domestic confidence remains high – which remains true at present and shows little chance of changing – the risks of an economic crisis are contained.”</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that the problem doesn’t need to be solved by the Chinese authorities. “There has been a large accumulation of bad debt in the economy,” says Louis Kuijs, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics. “Around a quarter of this is found in sectors with weak financial indicators where there are sub-par rates of return and high debt to equity ratios. But these firms continue to borrow and it will become increasingly harder for them to repay.”</p>
<p>The Chinese government is aware of these issues and has issued various statements calling for Chinese companies to reign in debt. One such statement came in August last year when the finance ministry issued directives saying that state-owned companies should improve returns, control risks and make sure that “projects are financially viable before decisions are made”.</p>
<p>“SOEs are heeding the central government’s directive to control debt leverage and they made tentative progress in 2017,” says Christopher Lee, Analyst at S&amp;P Global Ratings. “We expect SOEs to put in a bigger effort to control debt leverage in 2018-2019 because the regulators have recently announced that SOEs need to reduce leverage by 200bp over the next two years. We expect SOEs to raise equity, sell non-core assets and undertake debt-for-equity swaps to improve their leverage.”</p>
<p>It’s clearly a delicate balance for the Chinese authorities. On one hand, they want to curb risks that exist in the economy because of corporate debt. On the other, they do not want to stifle economic growth. The IMF has noted that growth will come first and the Chinese authorities will do what it takes to attain the 2020 GDP target. As a result, it expects China’s non-financial sector debt to exceed 290% of GDP by 2022.</p>

<p>The move to align the Chinese economy more to international standards
can only be a good thing for international corporates. However,
treasurers at these companies are not getting carried away or expecting
that operating in China will be like operating in Singapore or Hong Kong
anytime soon. Recent experience has shown them that in China, things
can change very quickly.</p>
<p>This is especially true when it comes to currency controls. “For a
while, the regulatory environment was relaxing and we were able to move
money into and out of China quite freely,” says Anthony Osentoski, Head
of Corporate Treasury and Insurance, Asia Pacific at Solvay. “Then in
late 2016/early 2017 things changed and the regulators introduced rules
that brought in tight quotas, limiting the amount of CNY they could
transfer offshore.”</p>
<p>For treasury teams, this ‘window guidance’ has had multiple impacts.
For example, some corporates had spent considerable time and effort
building cross-border cash pools that overnight they were no longer able
to use. For Osentoski, window guidance meant that Solvay had to
readjust its processes. “We were working on rolling out all of our
intercompany payables to be paid in CNY — buying into this vision of CNY
being a world currency,” he says. “When window guidance came in we had
to roll all this back and revert to using the US dollar for cross-border
settlement.”</p>
<p>With window guidance lifting, Osentoski is hopeful for the future and
expects things to become easier for treasury teams. However, he is
cautious that China could, at any time, put the brakes on again.
“Despite the challenges that window guidance created for many treasury
teams dealing with China, the policy ultimately worked and allowed the
authorities to regain control over cross-border cash flows. Therefore,
if something like the events of late 2016 happened again, I think we
might see the reintroduction of these rules. So, whilst the opening of
China is positive, we must always remember that this is happening with
an underlying control mechanism ready to be put in place whenever
needed. This is very different from many other developed economies.”</p>
<h3 id=""leading-the-world"">Leading the world</h3>
<p>Another area in which China is different from other developed
economies is the development of its digital payments ecosystem. China is
arguably leading the way when it comes to being a cashless society
thanks to the rise of platforms such as WeChat Pay and Alipay.</p>
<p>Whilst in the corporate space the initial impact of this development
is being felt largely by B2C companies, the entire corporate ecosystem
in China is beginning to find value in the use of digital payments. To
provide an example, Sam Xu, Head of Transaction Banking, China at
Standard Chartered, talks about the work the bank has done with a
company that services elevator shafts across China.</p>
<p>“This company uses contractors to carry out maintenance,” he says.
“Traditionally, the building owners would pay the contractors in cash,
and the contractors would then be required to take the cash back to the
company that hired them. The issue for the company was that the
contractors were often slow in bringing the company the cash, and, in
some cases, misplaced it.”</p>
<span class=""scWebEditInput"" contenteditable=""false"" id=""fld_EA619D1B5CCB4C769522CDFB1869E34D_D74F396D5C5E4916BD0ABFD58B6B1967_en_1_f64b4ad44e82449fb9caf0d3cffaa635_21938_edit"" sc-part-of=""field"">

</img></span>
<p>This created a big problem for the treasury team, which was solved by
a solution that utilises WeChat Pay. “Each elevator now has a QR code
that the contractor’s scan once they have completed the job,” says Xu.
“This automatically initiates a digital payment for this work that goes
straight to the company. In addition to removing the risk posed by
asking contractors to handle cash, this solution has also added-value by
allowing the treasury to achieve automated and straight through
reconciliation of payments.”</p>
<p>It must be noted that given the incredible surge in popularity around
QR code-based forms of payment in China, the regulators are paying
attention. In a bid to encourage payment companies and merchants to
adopt better and more secure technology, at the end of last year, the
Central Bank introduced rules to set daily payment limits for
individuals across all their registered mobile wallets. The limits are
tiered based on level of security, with static QR codes capped at CNY500
and dynamic QR codes capped at CNY1,000 per day to uncapped for
transactions verified with two or more authenticate factors. “This is a
positive move,” says Xu. “It will increase protection to consumers and
give room for mobile payments in China to continue their impressive
growth.”</p>
<h3 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>With so much happening right now in China, it can be difficult for
businesses to think too far ahead. But as previously mentioned, the only
way to be successful in China is to keep one eye on the future and
understand the direction in which the country is heading.</p>
<p>For Oxford Economics’ Kuijs, the future is looking bright for China.
“Despite some of the difficult issues and reforms that China needs to
tackle, I am relatively optimistic on China’s outlook,” he says. “If you
look at what is happening in the real economy, there are lots of
positives – and China is well placed to do well in the global economy.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Compared to the major political and economic upheaval of 2016, 2017 was relatively calm. But what will the next 12 months bring? And how can treasurers begin to take advantage of new and emerging technologies in the year ahead?</em></p>
<p> Twelve months ago, the world was still reeling with the impact of unexpected world events in the form of Brexit and the election of President Trump in the US. Many were concerned that further shocks could dominate the headlines in 2017 – and consequently caution and uncertainty were uppermost in treasurers’ minds.</p>
<p>Another year on, has this changed? “In some ways, geopolitical risk is less front and centre of mind today than it was a year ago,” says John Feeney, Head of Global Corporates at Lloyds. “One of the great concerns for 2017 was European risk, with quite a few key elections on the horizon. We’ve moved through that period – and broadly it’s a calmer European political landscape today, and a much stronger European economic picture as well.”</p>
<p>That said, Feeney points out that whereas a year ago President Trump was a concept, “he is now a reality. There was a lot of uncertainty about whether President Trump would be different from candidate Trump, but we’ve now seen that the two are very consistent in terms of the approach taken by the United States administration. The expectation that comes from that is that there will be surprises through the course of the year.”</p>
<p>Brexit, meanwhile, continues to dominate headlines. With continuing uncertainty around the process and the ongoing relationship between the UK and the EU, Feeney notes that Brexit is still “front and centre of treasurers’ minds”. Consequently, 2018 will see a “huge focus” on the progress of the political and economic settlement with the EU, and the ongoing trade relationship.</p>
<h3 id=""rising-rates"">Rising rates</h3>
<p>Also significant is the question of how the interest rate environment will develop in 2018. Last year saw the Bank of England finally raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, albeit by only 0.25%. In the US, meanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased rates in March, June and December, with three further increases expected this year. And in Europe, the ECB has begun the process of scaling down its quantitative easing programme.</p>
<p>“We have had a decade of ultra loose monetary policy, and indeed there are many people in treasury teams who have never seen an increasing interest rate cycle,” comments Feeney. “They are used to funding being ample and diverse and, in many cases, have never experienced difficulties in managing access to liquidity.” Consequently, Feeney says that if interest rates rise above and beyond the market’s expectations, “it may ask new questions of treasury teams which may not have been through this before”.</p>
<p>Feeney says that a combination of factors – such as access to relatively cheap longer dated funding, the apparent turn in the interest rate cycle and the likelihood of further geopolitical drama on the horizon – means there is currently an interesting window for treasurers who may wish to take advantage of very supportive conditions while they last. He adds, “we’ve seen quite a few clients take advantage of this.”</p>
<h3 id=""developments-in-asia"">Developments in Asia</h3>
<p>In Asia, meanwhile, “currencies have stabilised – in fact, some of them have appreciated against USD – and emerging markets have performed better than people were expecting last year,” notes Gourang Shah, Head of Treasury Services Solutions for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan. “So for me that was the biggest change in terms of people’s expectations at the beginning of 2017 versus what happened, which in a way was a positive surprise for many people.”</p>
<p>At the same time, however, companies have had to take more restrictions into account when moving money out of China or Malaysia. In November 2016, Bank Negara Malaysia re-enforced rules prohibiting offshore ringgit trading – a move which Shah says had a continuing impact on treasurers in 2017. In China, meanwhile, regulators took steps at the beginning of the year to restrict the movement of renminbi offshore, although this was later relaxed in April.</p>
<p>“Treasurers have certainly had to adapt to these changes,” said Shah. “Of course, these changes have made cash more trapped in certain markets – but at the same time, with negative rates in Europe and dollar rates not very high, people have started sweeping less from Asia into Europe. Yield in the developing world is low compared to historical standards, but it’s high on a relative basis compared to the developed world. This I think has played a role in keeping more liquidity in Asia.”</p>
<p>Shah adds that this could change if tax incentives make it more attractive for companies to move surplus funds to developed markets. “But the operating liquidity in Asia is growing: most companies have got a higher revenue share here, and they’ll have to keep that money here for managing their businesses. Everybody is looking for growth, and it’s coming from Asia.”</p>

<h3 id=""looking-forward"">Looking forward</h3>
<p>Three treasurers share their plans and priorities for the year ahead:</p>
<h4 id=""rick-martin-group-treasurer-gaslog-ltd"">Rick Martin, Group Treasurer, GasLog Ltd</h4>
<p>“Being in shipping, we are always mindful of any trends towards protectionism,” comments Rick Martin, Group Treasurer of GasLog Ltd, which specialises in the transportation of liquified natural gas. “So far, it would seem that it is more talk than action, which is good news – and not just for us, either.”</p>
<p>Also key for the company is the continuing growth in demand for natural gas (methane). Martin explains that trends in China and India towards cleaner fuels are helpful, as is Korea’s move away from nuclear power. He adds, “we welcome the opportunity not only to grow our business, but to help reduce the global carbon footprint as well.”</p>
<p>Combined with the supply/demand balance for LNG shipping moving into more favourable territory, Martin says, “we are looking forward to 2018 – albeit without ever letting down our guard in what can be a quite volatile market.”</p>
<h4 id=""marianna-polykrati-group-treasurer-chipita"">Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer, Chipita</h4>
<p>As the Group Treasurer of Greek food company Chipita, Marianna Polykrati has been paying close attention to geopolitical risk in recent years. She notes that 2018 is a year that will probably be “quite vulnerable to geopolitical developments, with a main focus on the Brexit finalisation and the effects on the European Union”.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she has plenty of plans for advancing treasury in the year ahead. As in 2017, she says the top priorities include the automation of treasury, “since we consider that the treasury digitalisation era has started, and the IT landscape shall be materially changed in the near future”. She notes that a side effect of this automation will be the increasingly higher levels of fraud and the safety measures that need to be taken as a result – a concern which is another priority for Chipita’s treasury.</p>
<p>“And as always, we are investigating solutions to make the treasury function more effective within our Group, focusing on in-house bank set ups, cash flow management and seeking alternative funding sources,” she says.</p>
<h4 id=""george-dessing-senior-vice-president-treasury-and-risk-wolters-kluwer"">George Dessing, Senior Vice President Treasury &amp; Risk, Wolters Kluwer</h4>
<p>George Dessing says that with the world becoming more ‘global’, complex, connected and volatile – and therefore more uncertain – the information, software and services provider is “translating these projected trends and possible risks into opportunities”.</p>
<p>For example, he says that Wolters Kluwer is protecting its people, environment, assets and reputation by investing in programmes such as a cyber risk governance framework and incident management and crisis communications. “Furthermore, proactively we translate these risks into new and innovative ways to help our customers,” he notes, adding that digital and services now represent 88% of the company’s total revenues.</p>
<p>Where priorities for this year are concerned, Dessing plans to “stay ahead of the curve by being closely connected to our business, whereby we are further building on our internal treasury and risk communities as a key enabler for integration and adding value to our business”. He adds that other upcoming challenges include US tax reform, GDPR, and new IFRS regulations relating to leasing and derivatives.</p>

<h3 id=""technology"">Technology</h3>
<p>Geopolitical risk continues to be a concern for treasurers around the world – so how can treasurers make sure they are fully equipped to manage the challenges that lie ahead?</p>
<p>“Geopolitical risk is and has been a part of the world we live in,” comments Peter Seward, ION Treasury’s VP of Product Strategy at Reval. “Clearly there are ongoing developments in areas such as North Korea, the Middle East, Britain and the EU that can have meaningful effects on FX, interest rates, the availability of funding and overall government policy and regulation.” But while it is always difficult to assess the impact of geopolitical events as they are happening or in advance, Seward says that treasurers always need to be proactive and prepared – and that technology “can really help codify information in real time and model possible outcomes and their impacts to treasury”.</p>
<p>For example, Seward points out that treasurers will need to be ready to comply with new leasing and hedge accounting regulations coming into effect across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Likewise, treasurers will need to understand the impact of increasing interest rates in the US and the end of quantitative easing in Europe. “Scenario planning and simulation tools are key in assessing the impact events may have on treasury,” he comments, adding that treasurers “need time to assess and implement system changes to comply with any new regulations that will impact their organisation”.</p>
<p>With an eye on market developments and upcoming regulatory changes, it may be an opportune moment for treasurers who rely on spreadsheets to consider how more sophisticated technology could help them manage their risks and operate more effectively.</p>
<p>“FX exposure and cash forecasting is still often performed via a series of spreadsheets and manually pieced together through reports,” comments Andrew Marshall, Managing Director of consulting and technology solutions provider Covarius, pointing out that these manual processes can be slow and inherently prone to significant errors. “By turning to data lakes and outsourcing the analysis of this kind of data to machine and predictive learning services, treasurers can begin to realise some incredible insights around cash forecasting and FX exposure.”</p>
<h3 id=""new-and-emerging-technologies"">New and emerging technologies</h3>
<p>Treasurers may also be paying close attention to new and emerging technologies, from application programming interfaces (APIs) to artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, development continues in the area of blockchain: notable projects include the Digital Trade Chain initiative, a trade finance project which is being built by a consortium of seven banks. But from a treasury point of view, real progress is still some way off. “There is still a lot of hype,” comments Sven Lindemann, CEO at Hanse Orga. “We have connectivity to a payment service provider who is also offering blockchain payments, but we do not really have existing customers with existing use cases today. From a technology standpoint we are ready to receive files and pay files via blockchain – but when it comes to interesting use cases, I think that’s what everybody is waiting for.”</p>
<p>It may be a while before some of these developments translate into viable opportunities for corporate treasurers – but it’s never too early for companies to begin exploring the potential benefits. “Everybody has been talking about the technology revolution and we are hearing a lot from people who are talking about data analytics, APIs and robotics,” says J.P. Morgan’s Shah. “However, most treasurers are actually a few steps away from this: they hear about the developments, but they don’t know what the value is to their own organisations. Many companies have therefore created a digitisation expert whose job it is to figure out what makes sense of these technologies and how to implement them in their own ecosystem.”</p>

<h3 id=""embracing-innovation"">Embracing innovation</h3>
<p>Andrew Bateman, Head of Corporate Liquidity and Bank Treasury at FIS, predicts that 2018 will bring continued innovation across all areas of treasury and risk, “but especially within the areas of payments, fraud mitigation and artificial intelligence,” noting that demand for advanced fraud mitigation technology has never been higher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as a result of continuing cyber threats, Bateman says that treasurers have been “tasked with playing a greater role, in co-operation with the CTO, in understanding and mitigating cyber risks, and have therefore pushed technology vendors to strengthen their security offerings”. He predicts that increased need in the market will result in improvements in preventative, detective and machine learning security.</p>
<h4 id=""application-programming-interfaces"">Application programming interfaces</h4>
<p>Where other developments are concerned, Bateman predicts that advances will be made in payments automation and simplicity. “FIS recently worked with Citi to enable real-time payments for corporate treasurers through Citi APIs,” he notes, adding that the increased availability of API technology will transform how financial services are going to be both consumed and provided.</p>
<h4 id=""artificial-intelligence"">Artificial intelligence</h4>
<p>Bateman also predicts that AI will begin to have strong, practical benefits for treasurers in 2018, “as organisations seek solutions which can not only process data, but learn from that data in order to improve analytical output and reduce human intervention in decision making”.</p>
<p>He adds that liquidity management and payments processing are two areas which could lend themselves to AI improvement. “On the payments side, there is an opportunity for systems to better learn from payment histories, using counterparty and value data in order to improve the identification of potential fraud, or to identify opportunities for lower cost channels, or payment types,” he says. “Liquidity management, specifically cash forecasting, on the other hand, should be able to use a history of data in order to better predict future cash flows.”</p>
<p>As a result, Bateman says that treasurers “should expect an AI-enabled world to introduce itself over the next several years, within individual functional components of their software”.</p>

<h3 id=""questioning-assumptions"">Questioning assumptions</h3>
<p>In light of all these developments, there are plenty of opportunities to pay attention to this year – alongside the numerous challenges. “I think 2018 is going to be an exciting year,” concludes Feeney. “I suspect change will come and there will be moments of drama. From a treasury perspective, the key thing is to expect the unexpected, keep appropriate flexibility of funding and keep plenty of healthy banking relationships. At the same time, this cultural evolution is a very important point – it is a time when we’re going to have to question some of our long-held assumptions and innovate more than we are seeing now.”</p>


","Compared to the major political and economic upheaval of 2016, 2017 was relatively calm. But what will the next 12 months bring? And how can treasurers begin to take advantage of new and emerging technologies in the year ahead?",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/coin-operated-binoculars-panoramic-view-city-ss519597271-1920x1080.jpg,2018-01-01,Market Insight,False

<p><em>With nation states ‘applying 19<sup>th</sup> century statecraft in a world of 21st century weapons’ it comes as no surprise that geopolitical risk remains the biggest concern for businesses around the world. What are the potential flash points and what might they mean for businesses?</em></p>
<p>Geopolitics is the largest risk the financial markets face in 2018. At least, so says a survey commissioned by Barclays among 700 of its institutional clients. Other risks mentioned are Fed tightening, unanchored inflation expectations and a growth slowdown in the rich countries. There is something for everybody, in other words.</p>
<p>We tend towards the notion that some market parties may have played ‘the joker’ when answering the questionnaire. Perhaps it is laziness? There is a sense that “all is well, growth will not be coming under attack any time soon”. As investors are not aware of any big risks, they may have opted to just mention a sweeping term such as geopolitics. If this is correct, the geopolitical risks have hardly been priced in (if at all) as yet. The implication is that geopolitical crises could have a significant impact on prices.</p>
<p>The question is what are the risks that fall under the heading of geopolitics? Very relevantly, the global security situation is deteriorating. We foresee a new weapons race, which differs from the one during the Cold War in an important and worrying way. There was a race between two blocs at that time, whereas now it is a matter of everyone for themselves. Intentions and capacities are more opaque and there is a growing chance of accidents and escalations.</p>
<p>The organisation monitoring weapon sales has identified three reasons for the higher expenditure. Namely, the introduction of new and large-scale weapon systems, ongoing military conflicts in various countries and mounting regional tensions.</p>

<p>The worsening safety climate goes hand in hand with the crisis that democracy faces. The number of fully-fledged democracies has been decreasing for approximately a decade. The support for (and quality of) the principles of democracy is also steadily decreasing in existing democracies whereas the idea of a ‘strong leader’ is gaining popularity.</p>
<p>Democracy faces three major challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Income and especially wealth inequality, polarising societies and the inexorable flow of news about corruption scandals have undermined confidence in democracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media provide authoritarian regimes with more opportunities to exert control and simultaneously allow them to fuel tensions and discord in the democratic countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China’s unprecedented success which undercuts the idea that democracy is the best or only way to achieve prosperity and peace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>A decline in security and democracy goes hand in hand with difficult relationships between nation states and the markets; especially the financial markets. States tended to be all-powerful in modern history until recently, but the financial markets have stolen a march on the sovereignty of governments – and then some – in the past decades.</p>
<p>It is no accident that James Carville, one of Bill Clinton’s important advisers, famously said in the early 1990s, “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a 400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.”</p>
<p>It is increasingly clear that the financial markets do not offer any solutions to growing inequality, stagnating wages and job insecurity. On the contrary, they often facilitate these developments.</p>
<p>We see escalating international security risks, democracy in choppy weather and tensions between nation states and the financial markets. It would be so nice if the global world order that evolved (particularly) after the second world war, largely shaped by the West, would continue to provide some form of stability and security. Unfortunately, this is not the case, particularly as the world’s policeman – America – under President Trump is undermining the certainties and pillars that support the global order.</p>
<p>Trump likely opts for this approach in order to divert attention from the domestic problems and pacify his financial backers, while really believing that the US should steer a unilateral course with narrow defined self-interests as a compass. According to some, he relishes going against conventional wisdom. In the meantime, he is exacerbating the exact same problems and tensions that have brought him to power. The chance is slim that we will see any improvements in this area in 2018.</p>
<p>The US course side by side with China’s seemingly unstoppable advance, causes many major economies to worry about how to maintain ties with America and China. We foresee a gradually shifting focus from Washington to Beijing. The security and economic relations with the United States and China are being revised in many areas; Beijing is often the beneficiary of this change.</p>
<p>The relationships between the other large economies play out against the backdrop of what may be the 21st century’s major geopolitical narrative. Whereas before, only a very select group of economies was really important to the world economy, the developments in and between far more countries than before have become relevant to the global financial markets, due to the unprecedented economic growth and intertwining interests of the past decades.</p>
<p>We are seeing more mutual dependence and political/economic collaboration but also more competition. Plus, nation states are – in the words of Brookings Institute’s Bruce Jones – “applying 19th century statecraft in a world of 21st century weapons”.</p>
<p>Owing to these shifting geopolitical sands, it is not that strange that many institutional investors have put (geo) politics at the top of their worry list for 2018. In which areas could we see actual crises break out?</p>
<p>The geopolitical worries that investors have for 2018 do not come as a surprise. The abovementioned global trends are increasing the likelihood of instability. These developments translate into various regional potential pockets of (geo) political turmoil:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the United States, Washington can become even more chaotic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Europe still struggles with major internal problems as external and negative forces gather momentum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latin America is on the eve of political shifts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Middle East is increasingly the arena for proxy wars between regional and global great powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North Korea will continue to hang over the world like a dark mushroom cloud.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To sum up, the fact that geopolitics is the main worry for the markets in the coming year is not exclusively due to the absence of economic thunderclouds on the horizon. There actually is a range of political factors that could disrupt the markets in 2018, also considering the positive (some will even say lazy) stance of many market parties. When a sunny spell is anticipated, a rain shower can abruptly change the mood.</p>

<br/>
<p>In a world in flux, it is good occasionally to take a step back and assess where we are and, most importantly, where we are going. These were the key objectives of this year’s Voice of Corporate Treasury Global Study, conducted in partnership with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>The results of this quest provide a detailed and unique snapshot of the treasury universe. They show it at an inflexion point where, on the one hand, treasurers are having to weather the storm created by recent political, regulatory and economic upheaval, and on the other they are taking the next step and leveraging new technology and ideas, allowing them to better support their business. It goes without saying that these are interesting times to be a treasury professional.</p>
<p>Conducted in the first half of this year, the wide-ranging study attracted 625 corporate respondents from around the world. The universe was diverse in terms of company size, industry sector, geography and treasury structure. As expected, there were some nuances that arose when the data was cut by region. Broadly speaking, several key themes emerged.</p>
<h3 id=""political-turmoil"">Political turmoil</h3>
<p>Almost half of the sample view the outlook for the next 12-18 months as challenging and very uncertain. This is to be expected, given the myriad of political surprises the world has faced over the past two years. Respondents cited the uncertainty around the Donald Trump presidency and the direction of Brexit as two major concerns. Even if corporates are not directly impacted by these two factors, it is clear that they have caused ripple effects around the world.</p>
<p>During a recent webinar covering the results of the study, Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Director, Regional Treasury Services Centre, APAC at Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the political environment, “is one of the factors contributing to the uncertainty”. This, she added, “presents its challenges across cash and liquidity management as well as foreign currency exposure management”.</p>
<p>Specifically, she noted how several countries in Asia, especially China and Malaysia, have introduced new regulations aimed at protecting their currency as a result of political events. These decisions, she explained, “impact the way we would have previously executed our risk management strategy and also impose onerous obligations on the business to be able to operate within the financial markets”.</p>
<p>Séverine Le Blévennec, Director, Treasury EMEA at Honeywell, participating in the same webinar, notes that such events remind us that “political risk exists”. That said, she insists that her treasury sees more opportunities than threats in today’s market.</p>
<figure class=""left""><img alt=""Figure 1: brief details on Voice of Corporate Treasury Study 2017"" height=""250"" src=""/i/2017/11/2017-11and12-tt-06-voct-insert__figure-01__625x250.png"" width=""625""/></figure>
<h3 id=""treasury-at-tipping-point-or-crossroads"">Treasury: at tipping point or crossroads?</h3>
<p>Today, most treasury functions are either at a tipping point or a crossroad. They are undergoing a major transition, having to embrace additional responsibilities whilst continuing to operate with extremely lean teams. There is a keen focus on risk management in its many guises but also a focus on growth. The latter can be influenced by cash-flow forecasting, a frequently cited area in the study, as both the enabler of growth and of capital funding. Treasurers continue to balance risk versus investment, striving to answer the burning question, “where is the best return?”.</p>
<p>That investment may well be in new technology. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Jonathon Traer-Clark feels many corporates, “are waiting for the ‘light-bulb’ moment use-case and a compelling event to justify such an investment”.</p>
<p>Treasurers are also navigating the changing technology landscape in a period when their companies are changing too. Many treasurers noted that one of the fundamental changes is that their decisions are being much more influenced and driven by external factors, most notably the shifting commercial models of their organisations.</p>
<h3 id=""kyc-continues-to-challenge"">KYC continues to challenge</h3>
<p>Whilst the course of business changes, some issues remain static. KYC is a case in point with many respondents citing this as a major test. “Around the world, we’re helping clients address the KYC challenge in multiple ways, focusing primarily on advisory and secure information sharing,” says Traer-Clark. “Our documentation specialists are current on local regulations so they know exactly what information is required in specific jurisdictions or entity types.” The degree of variation is significant and thus, he adds, “it is important we collate only the information we need and do so in a single streamlined request to avoid any unnecessary duplication or rework from a documentation perspective”.</p>
<p>Realising how big a pain point this is, Traer-Clark also notes that his bank tries, where possible, to self-source information on behalf of its corporate clients. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, he says, also continually seeks to leverage technology. The team recently installed a global ‘document crawler’ that finds and retrieves client information or documentation already held across its global data repositories – whether in credit, a different region or a different line of business, he explains.</p>
<p>Non-bank providers are also looking to solve the KYC challenge. These firms, notes Traer-Clark, are now starting to gain traction. The bank has “cast a wide net” in this regard. It offers “complete flexibility” for its clients and is currently signed up to numerous industry KYC utilities such as SWIFT’s KYC registry, IHS Markit’s kyc.com, Clarient’s entity hub and Bloomberg’s entity exchange. “We think these utilities present a real opportunity in the KYC space – helping banks satisfy the need for robust KYC, and doing so in an operationally-efficient manner.”</p>
<h3 id=""bank-relations-are-as-important-as-ever"">Bank relations are as important as ever</h3>
<p>Given that many corporates work with a mix of global, regional and local banks, solid relationships are key to success. Although the global financial crisis was almost a decade ago, its legacy dictates that honesty, integrity and trust are most important in the bank-corporate relationship.</p>
<p>Maeve Robinson, Assistant Treasurer at Omnicom Group Inc. commenting on bank relationships and the main factors in the selection process, said that she starts with the banks in the company’s credit agreement, then assesses product capabilities, looking for “the superior product providers” in each market.</p>
<p>For Omnicom, the arrangement relies upon a core banking group supplemented by numerous regional banks servicing operations in each of the company’s home markets. “We find this approach works best given time zones, languages and access to client service or relationship managers,” she explains. “We closely monitor the various products and services each provides to be sure our wallet is fairly distributed according to each bank’s credit support.”</p>
<p>According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Traer-Clark, transaction banking relationships have noticeably evolved since the crisis. “Relationship banking is not a new concept but it became more salient post-financial crisis,” he says. “Both corporates and banks realised they want more visibility and less complexity in their respective relationship groups.”</p>
<p>It is not necessarily easy for corporates to achieve these aims, not least because many corporate bank groups and structures have grown both organically and acquisitively over time. “Rationalising bank structures has obvious advantages from a structural cost and visibility perspective, but the relationship management piece shouldn’t be underestimated,” explains Traer-Clark. “Banking is very much a ‘people business’ so having solid relationships with a select group of banks that know you and your business is really important”. This, he adds, makes it easier to do business and build the collaboration and experience “that really form the foundation of reciprocal trust”.</p>


<blockquote>Relationship banking is not a new concept but it became more salient post-financial crisis.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The crisis had a severely negative impact on the trust people and corporations have in banks, but Traer-Clark believes the industry is doing a good job rebuilding this. “In terms of trust and integrity from a financial stability and counterparty perspective, this is one of the positive outcomes arising from a decade of increased post-crisis regulation,” he comments. “From contingency planning and capital adequacy, to operational segmentation or ring-fencing – much has been done to ensure the industry is more robust and worthy of our clients’ trust.” And to keep banks accountable, corporates and society at large “should, frankly, expect their banks to treat them fairly, honestly and with complete integrity”.</p>
<figure class=""left""><img alt=""Figure 2: brief details on Voice of Corporate Treasury Study 2017"" height=""250"" src=""/i/2017/11/2017-11and12-tt-06-voct-insert__figure-02__625x250.png"" width=""625""/></figure>
<h3 id=""cyber-security-is-top-of-the-agenda"">Cyber-security is top of the agenda</h3>
<p>Banks are also rebuilding trust with clients by acting as strategic advisors, especially around areas such as cyber-security. And with almost a third of the study respondents having been victims of a cyber-attack or fraud in the past five years, corporate treasurers are now heavily focused on technology and processes which mitigate the risk of such occurrences.</p>
<p>Digital security company Gemalto recently published its findings from the ‘Breach Level Index’. They revealed that 918 data breaches led to 1.9bn data records being compromised worldwide during the first half of 2017.</p>
<p>“We take this issue extremely seriously but we are not working in isolation,” says Traer-Clark. “We certainly maintain awareness and have introduced procedures that aim to spot things that are out of character, allowing us to identify potentially rogue transactions in a timely manner.”</p>
<p>In general, the banking community is providing a lot of education in this space, hosting workshops and webinars, and ensuring its own shops are in order so it can be a trusted partner to clients. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a very clear focus on policy, procedures and best practice and strictly adheres to legal and regulatory obligations. “Security is key and we develop, train and encourage the appropriate mind-set around these issues,” Traer-Clark says.</p>
<h3 id=""blockchain-revolution"">Blockchain revolution</h3>
<p>Banks talk a lot about blockchain, but do corporates have the same interest? The results of the survey are somewhat mixed. Whilst there are detractors amongst treasury professionals, blockchain is cited as an area of serious interest and many corporates are considering their own blockchain projects.</p>


<blockquote>We are taking a collaborative approach to blockchain technology which often utilises an open sourced framework. The technology has clearly helped encourage collaboration between banks and regulators, and between banks and fintechs.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Jonathon Traer-Clark, Head of Strategy &amp; Advisory for Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch is evaluating blockchain technology too, validating the benefits and framing the path to commercialisation, says Traer-Clark. “We are taking a collaborative approach to blockchain technology which often utilises an open sourced framework. The technology has clearly helped encourage collaboration between banks and regulators, and between banks and fintechs.”</p>
<p>In September 2016, the bank announced its participation as a founding member of Ripple’s Global Payments Steering Group (GPSG). The GPSG will oversee the creation and maintenance of Ripple payment transaction rules, formalised standards for activity using Ripple, and other actions to support the implementation of Ripple payment capabilities.</p>
<h3 id=""focusing-on-the-client-experience"">Focusing on the client experience</h3>
<p>Much has been made about the disruptive nature of fintechs on traditional financial institutions, but in recent years, the dialogue has shifted from disruption to collaboration. Traer-Clark agrees with this notion. He believes banks and fintechs together can make a “formidable team”. Banks have the scale and relationships whilst the emerging fintechs, “make us think differently and make good partners,” he says.</p>
<p>What is most important is that banks are addressing the big issues and leveraging the speed, agility and innovation of fintechs to find solutions to these issues. In doing so, they are also focusing on the client experience. “Assuming that banks can get the basics right first – and that isn’t always easy – they can then think about delivering an enhanced client experience which is where the fintechs have a role to play,” says Traer-Clark.</p>
<h3 id=""where-will-corporate-treasury-be-in-20-years"">Where will corporate treasury be in 20 years?</h3>
<p>Progress is often incremental – and this is well illustrated by the motor industry. Exactly who invented the automobile is a matter of opinion but if we had to accredit one inventor, it would probably be German, Karl Benz. Many suggest that he created the first true automobile in 1885/1886. In 1903, Henry Ford established the Ford Motor Company and five years later the company rolled out the first Model T. Elon Musk, CEO at Tesla Inc. has taken the automobile to new heights with electric vehicles. And we now hear that British inventor James Dyson is investing £2bn into developing a battery-powered vehicle which is expected to launch in 2020.</p>
<p>It has taken well over 100 years for the motor car to evolve to the type of vehicles we see on our roads today. Yet in less than 30 years since Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, we are now all using the internet and mobile technology as if they had been around for a century or more. What does this all mean from a technology standpoint with regard to the world of corporate treasury? The answer must of course be set against a backdrop of geo-political uncertainty, the increasing threat of cyber-attacks, ‘Black Swan’ events and the naturally conservative approach to new technology exhibited by corporate treasury in general. One thing is certain – there are further interesting times ahead.</p>
<h3 id=""a-voice-being-heard"">A voice being heard</h3>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s client base made up around 30% of this study’s respondents. Nonetheless, it is fair representation of the corporate treasury industry as a whole, concludes Traer-Clark. “We are delighted to have been associated with this body of work. Part of our client-centric approach is to understand their concerns, their challenges and their plans for the future, so that we can support them in the best way possible. The industry is certainly in transition and we hope that by providing the community with an opportunity to express itself, and to be listened to, we are helping to facilitate better solutions and better financial outcomes for all.”</p>

"Inflation, interest rates and asset prices in a transition phase","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Firstly, reserve capacity is increasingly on the wane worldwide and in some major economies such as Japan, the US and Germany the situation is already tight, especially on the labour market. This will lead to loose monetary conditions, higher wage incomes and increased investment, resulting in economic growth being above potential in most countries in our opinion. Subsequently, the reserve capacity will continue to decline and the tightness on the labour market will increase. Because of this we anticipate higher levels of wage increases in the quarters ahead and therefore upward pressure on inflation expectations. In this scenario, we see many central banks accelerating the pace at which they make monetary policy less loose.</p>
<p>Secondly, we expect additional wage increases to lead to higher wage costs and, due to fierce competition of, among others, internet businesses, we see many businesses allowing higher wage costs to come at the expense of profit margins.</p>
<p>Thirdly, an important congress of the Communist Party of China took place in October, (this Market View was written before the congress) where President Xi was awarded a second term. In the run up to the congress, the Chinese authorities are making every effort to ensure the greatest possible financial and economic stability, meaning the authorities will not seriously tackle the unstoppable rise in debt/GDP ratios until afterwards. Putting the brake on credit provision means downward pressure on growth. As China is the second largest economy in the world and is responsible for the largest contribution to global economic growth, this also means downward pressure on growth worldwide.</p>
<p>Fourthly, in recent years the US and Europe in particular have benefited from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lower interest rates, which have enabled governments, businesses and consumers to borrow more without rising interest charges (or only to a limited degree).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pent-up demand, because businesses and consumers postponed major expenditure during the credit crunch, although it must be noted that expenditure has increased in recent years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stimulus as a result of pent-up demand and more debt does not necessarily have to stop immediately, but we do see its positive effect on growth decreasing, certainly if interest rates start going up in the period ahead.</p>

<h3 id=""positive-upply-shock"">Positive supply shock</h3>
<p>Finally, the post-1980 positive supply shock, as a result of China and the former Communists European countries opening up to the world economy, threatens to slowly turn now due to a rapidly ageing population in many Asian and European countries. In most developed economies (including China) the number of working people in relation to the number of pensioners will decrease greatly in the decades ahead if policy remains unchanged. Not only does this mean there will be relatively fewer people creating output, but also that more and more people will use their savings for consumption. At some point, this will contribute to increasing upward pressure on wage increases and inflation and result in less (pension) money requiring investment.</p>
<p>Consequently, we see persistent downward pressure on inflation and long-term interest rates gradually turning to persistent upward pressure, and we envisage share prices coming under mounting downward pressure. It will also have a significant impact on economic expectations and monetary policy. In the event of rising interest rates, soaring debts will weigh more heavily and refinancing risks will increase. Furthermore, with rising inflation and interest rates it will become more difficult for central banks to boost asset prices and growth.</p>
<h3 id=""transition-phase-for-financial-markets"">Transition phase for financial markets</h3>
<p>Because we foresee a reduction in force or even the complete disappearance of the factors that have created a very favourable backdrop for financial markets in recent years, we anticipate investors becoming increasingly concerned about the high valuations and the consequences of low potential growth, a less loose monetary policy and the excessively high debts.</p>
<p>We do not see this leading immediately to a considerable decline for asset prices or much higher borrowing costs. Some of the aforementioned developments are progressing slowly and will therefore not have a major impact on the markets over the next months or perhaps quarters. Furthermore, we foresee several developments over the next couple of months which are positive for asset prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We consider the option of tax cuts in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the tighter labour market in countries such as the US, Germany and Japan, we anticipate businesses stepping up investment. As a result, we anticipate a boost in hopes for a positive scenario as previously described in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We envisage that additional wage increases and consequently higher inflation expectations and a less loose monetary policy will initially be regarded as a confirmation that the economy is recovering sustainably. This might even additionally boost confidence among consumers and businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We foresee the ECB and the Bank of Japan keeping monetary policy very loose for the time being, thereby offsetting the effect of a less loose monetary policy in the US, for example. It has been evident over the last quarters that Fed rate hikes have not led to tighter monetary conditions in the US. The reason may be that investors assume the Fed is pursuing too tight a policy at present. As a result growth will ultimately be slowed down too much and the Fed will have to climb down again. Hence US long-term interest rates remained under downward pressure and the dollar has weakened. But it is also down to the ultra-low interest rates in Japan and Europe, which create downward pressure on US long-term interest rates as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the positive climate for stock prices might continue, we do expect upward pressure on long-term interest rates because of the expanding economy, tighter monetary policy and upward pressure on inflation expectations. Initially, long-term rates could increase gradually, followed by a stronger increase as we expect investors will realise that higher borrowing costs will make high debt levels much harder to service, prompting many central banks to pursue a too loose monetary policy, with higher inflation as a consequence.</p>

Rife uncertainty on the global chessboard,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The power on the lowest board is divided among many players and it is unclear who has the most influence. Positions, moves, rewards and players tend to change often. States increasingly need to reckon with the players and topics that matter on the third chessboard. Owing to globalisation and the information revolution, this ‘grassroots’ chessboard has steadily gained importance in the past ten years.</p>
<p>If anything, the games played out on the 3D chessboard have intensified, while the political, financial, economic and military connecting threads are so convoluted that the ensuing maze resembles a combination of the Rubik’s Cube – with panels that are constantly shifting so that every twist and turn can change the face of the cube – and the Whack a Mole game, with rodents popping up at unexpected moments and in unexpected locations.</p>
<p>In this complicated, chaotic, gigantic web of interests, parties and erratic connections, the world’s leader – still the US – finds it increasingly hard to run the show. Militarily, the country is still way ahead of the pack but China and the Eurozone players are now operating at a similar level from an economic sense. Nevertheless, America’s financial power continues to outflank the competition due to the dominant role of the dollar and the open, deep and broad financial markets. However, the US has lost its leading edge in other respects – and President Trump isn’t helping matters.</p>
<h3 id=""stability-order-and-chaos"">Stability, order and chaos</h3>
<p>The world continues to hover between stability, order, chaos and disorder. Roughly speaking, order used to dominate the world in the past decades. Unfortunately, the scales now seem to be tipping the other way, due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The (aftermath of the) financial crisis and the subsequent credit and government debt crises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crumbling stature of the US and the associated emergence of a global system consisting of multiple power centres and non-state actors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump’s policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putin’s nationalist, authoritarian, revanchist and xenophobic course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Political, economic, cultural, historic and military tensions in Asia, with China as an awakening giant with larger-than-life ambitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geopolitical, territorial, social, sectarian, religious and ethnic tensions across the Middle East.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote at the end of 2014 that, “The question is not whether the world will continue to unravel but how fast and how far.” An actual war seems fairly unthinkable at this stage, many would say. Not according to US Professor Graham Allison, who has been writing about the so-called ‘Thucydides Trap’ in recent years, which implies there is a high chance of war during a period when a rapidly evolving power starts to compete with a dominant great power. There have been 15 such situations in the past 500 years and war broke out in 11 cases; often triggered by the interaction between assertiveness and fear.</p>
<p>Many in the West would love to go back to the post-Cold War period when quite a few Western leaders and observers believed that an international order had been firmly established that prioritised human rights, international law, collaboration, global institutions, peaceful conflict resolution and free trade, the “new world order” as former US President George H. W. Bush called it then.</p>
<p>However, as law professor Eric A. Posner wrote, “The liberal order that was born with the Soviet Union’s collapse rested on a fiction: that all nations were equal and submitted to the same rules because they reflected universal human values. In reality, of course, the rules were Western rules, and they were enforced largely by the United States, which was no one’s equal. Today, the fiction has been exposed, and the world order looks increasingly like the one that reigned during the 19th century.”</p>
<p>In other words, Putin is not alone when he tries to reintroduce 19th century geopolitical power balance thinking in the 21st century. Putin is not travelling back in time but is a man of his time. The West, on the other hand, often tries to hang on to a period that is on its last legs.</p>
<p>Under this brand new order, the great powers will eventually start to balance each other out. And whereas the US will continue to be the key actor for the time being, it can no longer unilaterally mould the world to its will.</p>
<p>The new order has not yet taken a definite shape by a long shot. A structural, painful transformation of the international system is ongoing, as evident from the Ukraine crisis, clashes in Asian waters, and the ‘proxy wars’ in the Middle East.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to think that the power games will play out in the same way as they did one or two centuries ago. The global game board has changed fundamentally, power is exercised very differently and more variations, individual nation states, and non-state actors add unpredictability to the mix. As a result, it has become harder to foretell the outcome of the geopolitical chess game. And there is no guarantee – whatever some experts may say – that global economic intertwinement will be enough to limit the risks of chaos, instability, and violence.</p>
<h3 id=""europes-new-order"">Europe’s new order</h3>
<p>Europe is clearly struggling to define its role in the new order. Yet, it is undoubtedly in better shape than before.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After the inward-looking years when it was forced to fork out hundreds of billions on propping up the economy and financial sector, Europe can again afford to spend money on military, political and other initiatives that should safeguard its position. Although progress is slow, change is definitely in the air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whereas the survival of the Eurozone was largely achieved through panic measures in the past years, there is now a larger focus on strengthening the European structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Europe also radiates more confidence when dealing with the rest of the world. It no longer seems fragile, uncertain and divided (even if it has deep-seated problems).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The member states and the EU aim for sustainable peace and stability. A ‘social contract’ between citizens and the states is underpinned by the EU as it strives to protect security, prosperity, freedom and equality for the European citizens. Perhaps the protection and social security that most European countries offer their citizens has a larger chance of success in the long run than the everyone-for-themselves model that is prevalent in the US.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, we should not be taken in too much by the European euphoria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Brexit means that the EU will lose its second economy and most important military power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theoretically, the social welfare net should enable Europe to weather the next economic storm in better shape than the US but it remains to be seen if future savings and earnings will allow European countries to pay for pensions and social welfare as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several Eastern European states – especially Hungary and Poland – are dismantling the democratic cornerstones of the EU.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of these critical comments, it will be clear that Europe is considerably better off than many predicted a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>In the US, the worries about Team Trump’s chaos are slowly having an effect. However, they are mainly connected to a dearth of economic stimulus including infrastructure investment and tax cuts. Once the markets really start to pay attention to the (additional) unravelling of the Western structures and the risks associated with the ‘Thucydides Trap’, we may well see large-scale volatility.</p>
<p>America is more likely to thrive in a brave new world (at least, for the time being) compared to Europe. After all, its economy is relatively self-supporting, it has retained a dominant military position, and it is – despite all its problems – more united than Europe.</p>

Hawkish Fed despite low inflation,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The Fed recently initiated a 0.25% rate hike and announced its intention to start decreasing its balance sheet this year. The latter means the central bank will gradually allow a fixed amount of the assets it owns to roll off. To do this, the Fed will start off by no longer investing the monthly US$10bn of bond repayments. After three months, this amount will increase to US$20bn and to US$40bn three months after that. Another increase will occur later, after which the amount will remain constant. This way, the current Fed balance sheet of about US$4,250bn will halve in about five years’ time. This intended quantitative tightening will have two effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It will place upward pressure on long-term interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will remove money from the economic system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two effects combined will cause a considerable increase in short-term interest rates. However, the tightening of monetary policy does not stop here as far as the central bank is concerned. Indeed, the Fed intends to raise its rates further, by another 0.25% this year. It will repeat this three more times in 2018 and then another four times in 2019. This is to achieve a Fed Funds Rate of approximately 3% by the end of 2019, the level the central bank regards as neutral – the economy is neither stimulated nor decelerated monetarily.</p>
<h3 id=""is-the-fed-going-too-far"">Is the Fed going too far?</h3>
<p>Two issues are very striking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Fed’s intention amounts to a fairly aggressive method of monetary tightening. However, economic growth has been low and wage increases and inflation have been at persistently low levels recently. Many analysts are therefore wondering why there has been such an about-turn in the Fed’s attitude. Until recently, the mantra of the central bank was “maximum economic stimulus” and consequently it refrained from rate hikes whenever possible. Now this has been reversed to “maximum tightening of monetary policy, unless this proves too heavy a burden on the economy”. Many consider this to be overkill and a policy mistake in the current circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The markets totally disbelieve the Fed and indicate they anticipate that for the time being, growth, wage increases and inflation will remain at levels so low that the Fed will barely be able to raise its rates in practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not the first time a major discrepancy exists between what the Fed indicates it intends to do and what really happens. The markets are usually proved right in these cases, so it is even more remarkable that the central bank is taking such an opposing stance. What could be the cause of this?</p>
<p>When answering this question, the most obvious step to begin with is to look at what the Fed itself says about this. The central bank first of all believes the recent low levels of growth, wage increases and inflation are, to a large extent, rooted in one-off developments, which will soon blow over. According to the Fed, growth will pick up soon in all likelihood, especially as monetary policy is still very loose, which is stimulating the economy considerably, while the labour market is already tight. This means that if the US economy were to continue to grow by 2% or more, the labour market would tighten further, with substantially higher levels of wage increases therefore no longer being far off, despite all manner of structural forces exerting downward pressure on wage increases. Of course, the central bank could still delay further tightening of monetary policy until all this clearly emerges, but this would run the risk of the Fed suddenly having to hit the monetary decelerator hard, which could easily lead to a recession, the collapse of asset prices and the debt pyramid. Making a start with tightening monetary policy now and proceeding with this at a steady pace seems a safer policy.</p>
<h3 id=""inside-information-and-political-games"">Inside information and political games</h3>
<p>What could also play a role here in the background is that the Fed might have good indications that Congress will decide upon tax reforms and tax cuts after all by the end of this year/the beginning of next year. Added to this, the White House is, at the time writing, working on a relaxation of rules for banks. These are all elements that could additionally boost growth and could ensure it ends up above 3% for several quarters next year. Given the low increase in the workforce and in productivity, this would lead to a further substantial decline in unemployment. This would therefore basically mean the markets currently have far too negative a view of growth forecasts, at least as far as the interest and capital markets are concerned, because stock markets actually foresee a very favourable future.</p>
<p>An entirely different angle is that the Fed is playing a political game. Indeed, many Fed members will have to step down at the beginning of next year. Combined with the positions that will have to be filled anyway, this will give Trump the opportunity in the Senate – which has to endorse the nominated Fed members – to compose the Fed entirely according to his own preferences. Trump himself has regularly changed opinion in this respect because he initially believed Janet Yellen was causing market bubbles with her low interest rates and high money creation, while he later actually complimented her on keeping rates low.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a large group within Congress that believes the policy of low interest rates and high money creation interferes far too much with free market forces. According to them, this leads to more and more misallocation of capital, which could ultimately catch up with the economy. This group of Congress members intend to appoint new Fed members who will quickly put a stop to high money creation and low interest rates. All predictions of further rate hikes might therefore well be a pretence of the present Fed members seeking to accommodate the views of the hawks in Congress. For the interest rates it makes a huge difference what the right interpretation is.</p>
<p>We believe the first interpretation is the most likely as we think a combination of very easy monetary conditions, increasing purchasing power, possible tax cuts and deregulation will result in higher growth and more upward pressure on inflation in the coming quarters. In itself, the Fed could easily implement its plans for interest rates. However, it should be expecting downward pressure on inflation exerted by oil prices as well as problems in the oil sector, oil-exporting countries and with riskier bonds based on oil prices.</p>
<p>The statements by Fed members are evidence of the fact the central bank is harbouring more and more concerns about share prices rising ever further and declining credit spreads. In this scenario, it will not be long before the onset of bubble formation is evident. This is why we expect the Fed to initiate another rate hike of 0.25 percentage points this year, but probably not until December. The central bank might announce in September it will start downscaling its bond portfolio, but this would not have too many consequences initially, as it would remain restricted to relatively very limited amounts for the time being.</p>
<p>This also means that we see US (and European) long-term interest rates gradually coming under upward pressure and that a ten-year US interest rate of 3.25% in the middle of next year would not surprise us.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>From moving capital and managing foreign exchange to building partnerships with local banks, how should treasurers navigate emerging market risk and regulation?</em></p>
<p>Emerging markets have long been a critical part of the business mix and growth strategy of multinationals. For many, initial sales growth has been followed by acquisitions or has driven decisions to relocate production to emerging markets to match costs with sales growth. This trend is set to continue, despite the slowdown in global trade and mutterings of some multinationals retreating as domestic growth and interest rate hikes draw investment back to the US.</p>
<p>According to the Boston Consulting Group, some 300m additional households will enter the consuming class in emerging markets this decade. Populations in developing countries are also growing four times faster than those in developed countries so that by 2020, 6.4bn people out of 7.5bn people worldwide will be living in emerging economies.</p>
<p>Managing fast-growing trade in emerging markets is a top priority in corporate treasury at British ingredients maker Tate &amp; Lyle. New consumers in China, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil are driving growth for the company’s high margin, speciality ingredients that includes brands like Dolcia Prima, a low-calorie sugar, and Claria, a “clean label” starch range, free from artificial ingredients.</p>
<p>“We are currently spending a great deal of time making our emerging markets treasury proposition as good as our developed markets treasury proposition,” says Oliver Whiddett, Head of Group Treasury at Tate &amp; Lyle. “The business will look to make targeted acquisitions in speciality food businesses in emerging markets. This will drive treasury complexity and how we assess our local needs.”</p>
<p>Managing trade and investment in emerging markets ushers in a new level of complexity for treasury, which is responsible for financing, hedging and safely steering the company’s financial interests in these more challenging jurisdictions. Each country has unique risks, regulations and restrictions, be it around moving capital, managing foreign exchange or governing relationships with local banking partners. Different cultures and time zones add to the challenge. So where should fast-growing companies focus to ensure a strong emerging market treasury?</p>
<h3 id=""get-the-fx-right"">Get the FX right</h3>
<p>Even if a corporation has a small exposure to emerging market currencies, exchange rate volatility can cause chaos, pushing up costs or evaporating margins. “FX plays a crucial role; get it wrong and it can have a big impact on corporate earnings,” says Gerald Dannhaeuser, Head of Corporate Sales in Asia for Commerzbank.</p>
<p>Corporates tend to have fixed hedging programmes in developed market currencies. But when it comes to managing FX risk in emerging markets, where hedging is expensive because of transaction costs and interest rate differentials, a bespoke and dynamic approach can work best.</p>
<p>“In emerging markets, a corporate’s hedging committee often decides to meet quarterly rather than have a definitive approach,” says London-based Adrian Williams, Head of Corporate Solutions at Commerzbank who counsels a nimble approach. “If markets are illiquid, treasury may think the market is too thin to get an effective hedge. In more dollarised economies, corporate exposure may be moving more in line with the dollar and treasury could better react to changes in the market by putting up costs. Nor may a team always know in advance what specific derivatives to draw on, like forwards or options.”</p>
<p>At Tate &amp; Lyle, which hedges transactional FX exposure, reports in sterling and has its largest exposure in dollars, the most challenging aspect of currency risk is understanding where the company’s FX exposures lies in its supply chain. “In a business with integrated supply chains, unpicking FX exposure is complex. It can also overlap with tax rules around transfer pricing like, for example, which entity is expected to bear the commercial risks,” says Whiddett. “When a business is rapidly expanding, it could be that FX risk management is pushed down the list of priorities compared to building customer relationships or sales. But treasury has to keep up to speed to actively support the business, enabling its ambitions whilst ensuring that risks are managed to within acceptable limits.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Companies with growing trade in China will have to navigate a complex and volatile currency environment. According to SWIFT, the renminbi was the fourth most used currency for global payments behind the dollar, euro and sterling in 2015. That was the same year that treasury teams woke up to renminbi volatility following the currency’s sudden devaluation by the Chinese central bank.</p>
<p>“Hedging renminbi risk requires a degree of sophistication,” says Dannhaeuser, explaining that corporations can hedge renminbi onshore, offshore or in the NDF market. Deciding whether to manage a renminbi hedging policy on a centralised basis from head office, or to delegate decisions to subsidiaries, is an important consideration.</p>
<p>“Hedging onshore requires an onshore presence, a greater level of documentation and administration,” Dannhaeuser says. Corporations have no administrative risk hedging offshore, but will need to balance this against basis risk. “Offshore and onshore renminbi are highly correlated so they move in parallel; it is not a perfect hedge,” he says, adding: “If corporates decentralise they can take advantage of onshore and offshore markets. In China we see most corporations with this two fold approach, hedging both from their headquarters, and using their local treasury centres to hedge onshore on the ground.”</p>
<p>But not all emerging markets have this flexibility. “The Brazilian real isn’t tradable so it could be cheaper for the subsidiary to do the hedging,” says Williams. “Here corporates can opt for a non-deliverable hedge offshore, or deliverable and settled in Brazil, pricing between the two differentials.”</p>
<h3 id=""hub-and-spoke"">Hub and spoke</h3>
<p>How to structure treasury in emerging markets is the next question. In one model, multinationals are choosing to move their emerging market treasury to financial hubs in the region. Singapore serves Asia; the UAE serves Africa and the Middle East – and basing treasury in Miami serves markets in Latin America. It’s a model that establishes “policy level” governance and regulatory coverage, and solves issues around time zones and the working week.</p>
<p>“A hub and spoke model is fairly common during a company’s growth phase in emerging markets,” says Navinder Duggal, Managing Director, Global Transaction Services, at DBS Bank. “Typically, the hub will be located in an international financial centre that has a well-defined regulatory regime, provides easy access to sophisticated banking services, and has good access to liquidity and FX capabilities as well as the skilled manpower to support a regional treasury operation. At the same time, having people on the ground in the main sales or manufacturing locations allows improved implementation of treasury functions.”</p>
<p>He also observes that as companies become more proficient in emerging markets, so the local presence becomes less necessary. “For more mature industries, it is possible to operate entirely through a centralised regional treasury once the processes and responsibilities have been clearly established.”</p>
<p>In other cases, companies may operate a devolved approach, delegating control to local entities in more challenging countries owing to in-country regulations, complexity of markets or limitations in the financial environment. On a small scale, this could mean a team sitting “in country” to support banking and funding activities, says David Stebbings, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC.</p>
<p>He notes, however, that integrating treasury activities such as payments and daily cash management in emerging markets into a centralised shared services environment can be a challenge. “It is more difficult, and probably less cost effective, to take cash activities in, say, Angola and put them into a shared services. In emerging markets it would be more likely that these tasks were done in country.”</p>
<p>It’s a challenge that leads him to favour a tiered approach. The first tier would be focused on developed markets where risk and cash management activities can be more centralised, hedging more mechanical and processes more easily automated. Subsequent tiers then comprise less developed and emerging markets where treasury activities require more diversity and flexibility. In lower tiers, it may not be possible to hedge risks or move cash very easily. The actual standards will often depend upon regulation, costs and the banking infrastructure in relevant countries.</p>
<p>Stebbings adds that many emerging market countries should move up through the tiers over time. “For instance, in India treasurers are less restricted in how they can manage FX and cash risk than in the recent past, although there are still a number of significant constraints,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""strong-relationships"">Strong relationships</h3>
<p>By ensuring broad expertise, product offerings and geographies in core banking relationships, treasuries can often tap the subsidiaries of their core banks in far flung jurisdictions. Yet this is not always possible, and local bank relationships also bring local market and industry expertise. Local banks also fulfil particular requirements, like cash payments to a local workforce, or providing a source of local funding if strategy has focused on limiting foreign capital going into an emerging market.</p>
<p>Although Tate &amp; Lyle counts ten relationships in its core banking group, including Japanese, US and European banks, the company has still built strong local bank relationships in Brazil and South Africa. “We have a good diversity in our core banking group. But there are some areas where these banks don’t operate and we need to branch out and build contacts with local banks,” says Whiddett, who brought valuable bank contacts in emerging markets to Tate &amp; Lyle when he joined six months ago from mining giant Anglo American.</p>
<p>It’s an experience that leads him to advise treasury teams to develop banking relationships that are strong enough to weather the bad times, not just the good. “If the ratings drop and the cash flows fall away, there are never so many banks knocking on the door,” he observes. Good documentation is also important: “You think you’ll never need that banking clause, but then it turns out that you do.”</p>
<p>Working with banks in emerging markets adds a new level of counterparty risk. The mere thought of a local banking partner being unable to repay deposits made by its corporate clients, or renew a revolving credit facility, is enough to rattle boardrooms. “Global banks are stronger and less likely to go under,” says Stebbings who advises treasury teams to approach only “top end local banks”, carefully assess the extent to which local partners compliment their business, and be alert to early warning signs of bank distress.</p>
<p>Sovereign downgrades are a common hazard that can increase borrowing costs, shrink liquidity and put pressure on local banking systems. Global clients of Brazilian banks had a volatile ride when Brazil was downgraded to junk status in 2015, taking the credit rating of many local banks with it. Today, treasury at Tate &amp; Lyle, which sets a strict risk appetite for the company in each country, is preparing for the impact on South African banks of a similar downgrade to the country’s credit rating.</p>
<p>Local banks’ ability to integrate technology is another consideration. Local banks may not have electronic banking platforms, relying instead on manual, administratively-heavy processes. This is in contrast to regional treasuries being “quite lean and having adopted technology to automate many of the functions,” observes DBS’s Duggall. He adds: “Corporations will need banking partners that can integrate seamlessly with their treasury operations, and can provide timely electronic information to enable faster, and more effective decision making.”</p>
<p>It’s a point that Emre Karter, Head of Treasury and Trade solutions at Citi, expands upon. The treasury trend towards automation, standardisation and centralisation doesn’t stop at the door to emerging markets. Given the challenges of maintaining visibility and control while partnering with different banks in multiple, risky markets, it is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Bank-agnostic services like SWIFT, that enable corporates to exchange information with multiple banks using common channels and standard formats, have become the norm. Treasury in emerging markets needs to ensure it is working with banks that are adapting to this environment and can go beyond single-bank proprietary solutions to address global, multi-banking needs.</p>
<p>“Corporations don’t want to manage bank relationships country by country,” Karter says. “There is a shift towards streamlining bank relationships, whereby companies can plug-and-play bank connectivity between their home banks and network banks. Many businesses want better integration and now enterprise resource planning (ERP) and treasury management systems (TMS) are allowing this between banks, as well as host-to-host solutions for timely information and decision making in near real-time.”</p>
<h3 id=""rules-and-regulation"">Rules and regulation</h3>
<p>Navigating regulation in emerging markets is another priority. In an attempt to curb capital outflows or shore up foreign exchange reserves, governments in emerging markets go to regulatory lengths to stop companies taking money out of the country. For corporations with exposure to China, treasury needs to be prepared for policy makers to tighten capital controls with a suite of regulations when the pace of renminbi outflows accelerates.</p>
<p>Currency controls recently caused havoc in Nigeria’s auto sector, where the likes of Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen have developed assembly plants with local partners. Currency policies and associated import controls, set up to conserve hard currency and boost local manufacturing by forcing Nigerians to buy local, starved the sector of inputs and led to a collapse in supplies of product lines from glass to rubber. Industry body OICA estimates that total new vehicle sales in Nigeria dropped by more than half in 2015 compared to 2014.</p>
<p>“Exchange controls demand day-to-day management and bring complexity against a political backdrop,” says Karter. The problem manifests particularly in cash management, where cash trapped due to sudden, or unexpected currency or capital movement restrictions impacts access to working capital across emerging markets and through supply chains.</p>
<p>PwC’s Stebbings says this leaves some treasury teams deciding to keep “as little cash as possible in the local market – just enough to meet local needs, taking every opportunity to reduce surpluses.” Some corporates request that receivables be paid in another currency altogether, “collecting revenues offshore” with payments made in US dollars to circumvent the currency restrictions. In bilateral trade relationships, where a company both sells into and buys from an emerging market, trapped cash, currently owed as a receivable, could be used to settle accounts payable in that country.</p>
<p>A clear view of what cash the business needs, often difficult because the business is expanding, is crucial. “Trapped cash is the kind of instability that triggers liquidity problems and it demands quick thinking to manage distribution and supply chains,” says Stebbings. “We are seeing key emerging trends from our clients as they get to grips with the process. They are using technology, tightening governance and managing their working capital to improve visibility and control.”</p>
<p>Other regulation may be more mundane, but just as frustrating. Cross-border payments typically require additional documentation and, if mismanaged, can lead to significant delays in receipt of funds. The use of cheques, common in some markets, also poses challenges around the timely realisation of funds. “The regulatory environment in emerging markets does change fairly often and corporate treasuries need to constantly review and adapt their plans. At times, the changes can be quite sudden and the interpretation of the new requirements may need further clarification with the authorities,” says Duggal.</p>
<p>Tate &amp; Lyle’s Whiddett pauses before considering the most important criteria for a strong treasury proposition in emerging markets. “Take, for example, a new customer in an emerging market,” he says. “If treasury is involved halfway through the process, putting in place the infrastructure needed becomes rushed, and there is a sub optimal outcome. Ideally, we are one step ahead of the markets the company is focused on. We’ve already looked to our banking group or started conversations with new banks, and we are already across local regulations, capital restrictions and our hedging options.” Anticipation, it seems, is the magic ingredient.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>This 2005 hit song was about a night out in Leeds, UK but the lyrics could just as well have been written about today’s global political landscape. Many are under the spell of populism, nationalism, isolationism, and various other worrying isms. Incessant social media rants polarise and add fuel to the fire, as does the focus of the media on negative events and developments.</p>
<p>The truth is that on average the global population has never had it this good. People live longer, are richer, healthier, and better educated than ever before. At the same time, large sections of the population view the world as an increasingly scary place. Numerous ‘first world people’ are turning towards inward-looking movements, freaked out by today’s frightening mix of declining truth, declining western values, declining order and increasing uncertainty.</p>
<p>The ruling elite and its cosmopolitan globalisation ideals are under a lot of pressure. Populists are tapping a bountiful reservoir. After all, what characterises this era is a deep-seated belief that the times are getting worse. Many voters think the elites will do little or nothing to make things better. This thinking is known as declinism. In fact, we have seen this declinism in America for a number of decades and even under presidents that one would not immediately associate with such an attitude. For instance, Bill Clinton would refer to REstarting, REnewal and so on. His theme was social decline and he would be the one to turn the tide. Even Obama alluded to deep-seated fears that decline was inevitable.</p>
<p>Trump’s MO is essentially a generic step-by-step plan for populists: encourage declinism, squarely put the blame on the establishment, and present yourself as the solution. Declinism often goes hand in hand with apathy towards politics – “why would I vote, nothing will change, and I do not have any influence”.</p>
<p>When it comes to Europe, politicians have a lot to explain to their voters. Europe has not delivered. Citizens were left with the impression that whereas the banks were saved, young people and workers paid the price for the financial-economic crisis. Plus, the European ‘community of values’ could not put a stop to the authoritarian tendencies within Europe and at its borders. It is also evident that many countries and politicians don’t think they need to stick to the EU rules. On the other hand, most voters would like to keep the EU and the euro whereas they think it should be improved.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: Europe will continue to be a thorny business for most national politicians. This is to a large extent linked to the legitimacy crisis facing globalisation. Many people believe that globalisation has nothing to offer them any more.</p>
<p>Dani Rodrik’s globalisation trilemma offers a useful framework. Owing to globalisation, countries are hemmed in between democracy, economic integration, and national sovereignty. These three goals cannot be achieved simultaneously. Democracy can only be combined with national sovereignty if globalisation is kept in check. And if globalisation is the highest goal and the nation state is to be preserved, democracy will fall by the wayside. To achieve democracy plus globalisation, the nation state needs to be abolished and a ‘world government’ is needed.</p>
<p>We are currently seeing a general tendency to focus on nationalism and direct democracy whereas economic integration is going down the drain. The resistance against globalisation is intimately connected to a resurgent inclination among people to protect their ‘own’ culture and the tendency to exclude other groups. Social, cultural and economic changes that are influenced by globalisation and technological progress have simply unfolded too rapidly. Many people feel that their very survival is at risk. And whereas the social contracts between the haves and have nots (and the cans and cannots) are obsolete, a new contract does not seem to be on the cards.</p>
<p>Uncertainty and angst has risen to great heights. Simultaneously, both dissatisfied citizens and populist leaders think the existing institutions will need to be destroyed before they can be ‘saved’. Trump’s main strategist Steve Bannon literally said so. He claims that at the top of Trump’s agenda is “the deconstruction of the administrative state”. Earlier Bannon stated that, “Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.”</p>
<p>Such messages can easily take root in a world of growing ethnical nationalism, waning confidence in democracy, calls for isolationist security and trade policies, a crumbling international order, and an economic recovery that seems to pass many by. Numerous people think that the social rules of play are no longer mutually beneficial to the elite and to the rest. Worse, they feel the establishment is just circumventing the rules whereas ordinary folk come off worse if they observe the rules. The result is a poisonous cocktail of envy, humiliation and powerlessness.</p>
<p>Voters have a point. As history professor Michael Kazin wrote about America, “populism has had an unruly past… But Americans have found no more powerful way to demand that their political elites live up to the ideals of equal opportunity and democratic rule to which they pay lip service during campaign seasons. Populism can be dangerous, but it may also be necessary.”</p>
<p>Perhaps this is indeed a ‘moment of truth’. Political parties are too much alike. The complications arising from free trade and open borders have been ignored for too long. National politicians often appear powerless whereas national governments have transferred a lot of their powers to international institutions. Unelected actors such as central bankers and multinationals seem to be more important than the democratically elected representatives while the shortcomings of politicians are expatiated upon online and in countless media channels.</p>
<p>So perhaps the time has come to shake up the established political order. The big question is, when will the scales tip toward unnecessary and dangerous torment? Populism, as championed by Trump and Wilders does not just take aim at the political and sometimes corporate elites but is also based on a very narrow (implied) definition of who “the people” actually are. Trumpism may not be automatically anti-democratic but it is evidently illiberal. To quote populism expert Cas Mudde, “The populist surge is an illiberal democratic response to decades of undemocratic liberal policies.”</p>
<p>The ‘moderate forces’ are busily trying to find an answer to illiberal democratic populism (which has turned into illiberal authoritarianism in countries such as Turkey and Russia). The answer does not seem to be available right now. Pessimists can take to heart Leonard Cohen’s lyrics for The Future:</p>
<p><strong><em>Things are going to slide (slide) in all directions, <br/>Won’t be nothing (won’t be), <br/>Nothing you can measure anymore, <br/>The blizzard, the blizzard of the world, <br/>Has crossed the threshold.</em></strong></p>
<p>The world is indeed sliding faster than it has done in a long time. Nevertheless, we doubt if the political storm that has blown up is strong enough to topple the EU and Eurozone. However, the dissatisfaction among voters could increase if they get the impression that politicians will view election results in which populists didn’t emerge as number one, as signals that they can more or less carry on in the same old vein as before. There have merely been “riots” so far but unless the establishment pays heed to the electorate’s worries, Cohen’s lyrics could still hold water:</p>
<p><strong><em>There’ll be the breaking of the ancient western code, <br/>Your private life will suddenly explode, <br/>There’ll be phantoms, there’ll be fires on the road.</em></strong></p>

Global economy picking up,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The global economy has been boosted as countries around the world have posted improved economic figures of late, highlighting that Trump’s ‘America first’ attitude has not immediately led to fierce countermeasures. However, despite this positive news, there are signs that inflation may start picking up as well. If this happens there are two likely directions for the global economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, it can be argued that, given the tight labour markets, higher inflation will lead to accelerated wage increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also possible to argue that, due to high-level international competition and low productivity growth, it will take time for businesses to give in to higher wage demands. This has been evident in Japan and Europe so far and has led to lower consumer purchasing power. If this happens elsewhere economic growth will soon fall back again, as will inflation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""monetary-transition-imminent"">Monetary transition imminent?</h3>
<p>It seems that the central banks are leaning towards the first scenario at present. By factoring in the fear of US protectionism harming global trade and therefore growth, they are acting cautiously.</p>
<p>However, there is no longer a great deal of room for policy errors and if growth keeps turning out better than expected, inflation, which has bottomed out, will increase further. This may not happen rapidly at first, but any increase will likely be sufficient for the Bank of Japan and the ECB to start downscaling their enormously loose monetary policies.</p>
<p>As far as Europe is concerned, something else needs to be considered: the important elections taking place this year. There is great concern that populists will emerge powerfully in Europe, which in turn could lead to the collapse of the European Union and the European Monetary Union. The uncertainty that this creates pushes down growth and leads the ECB to keep pursuing its very loose monetary policy for the time being.</p>
<p>That being said, as it looks now, we believe concerns about the outcome of the elections are exaggerated. We actually see the populists securing a substantial share of the votes, but we do not expect them to gain a majority. As a result, we expect the constraining effect on the European economy and ECB policy to disappear in the course of the year. It therefore cannot be ruled out that growth will be slightly better than expected and inflation will be slightly higher than expected over the course of the year. This could lead to a fairly fundamental change for the markets with regard to monetary conditions.</p>

</figure>
<p>Although the Fed is already gradually tightening monetary policy, the very loose policy of the Bank of Japan and the ECB offsets this. However, if the latter two gradually start moving towards tightening as well, there will be an end to an eight-year period of excessive money creation and abnormally low interest rates. Given that these elements actually represented the key engines behind the financial markets throughout this period, a significant price reaction will be likely. In fact, the markets are already seen to be reacting very tentatively to such a scenario.</p>
<p>Long-term interest rates have largely retained their increase of the past months and are inclined to increase further. However, what is very striking is that inflation has been increasing significantly faster than interest rates of late – perhaps because the markets too, just as the central banks, assume higher inflation will push down growth again. So far, this phenomenon has resulted in real interest rates declining, which actually boosts growth. Better-than-expected growth will soon lead to a worldwide monetary policy being tighter than the markets have become used to. Hence the increase in share prices is beginning to stagnate. Of course, the latter is also due to all the uncertainty caused by Trump.</p>
<p>Europe is also starting to adopt a more cautious approach to the bonds of weaker countries. On the one hand, this is because of the warnings of the IMF with respect to Greece as well as political uncertainty, but it is also due to the possibility of German inflation starting to increase too fast. Berlin is likely to exert increasingly more pressure on the ECB to reduce the purchasing of European bonds. However, once this occurs, there will be mistrust of Italian bonds once again. Hence, interest rates in the weaker countries have come under more upward pressure than those in Germany. These trends should be closely monitored, certainly with a view to the emergence of protectionism, because the Italian economy and government will soon derail in the event of increasing interest rates.</p>
<h3 id=""attempts-to-talk-down-the-dollar-are-futile"">Attempts to talk down the dollar are futile</h3>
<p>As part of the ‘America first’ policy stance, the Trump team have made statements lately that are part of an attempt to talk down the dollar exchange rate. For example, China, Germany and Japan have been told they have created an unfair competitive advantage by keeping their currency low, with US business supposedly being the victim of this. The error in the idea from the Trump administration is that trade flows on the currency market only make up a fairly small proportion of turnover. The vast majority concerns international capital movement. So, the movement of a currency rate depends on trade flows, but perhaps even more on capital flows.</p>
<h4 id=""one-way-or-the-other"">One way or the other</h4>
<p>Without exploring all manner of theoretical models, this means the following in the current circumstances. The US economy is running at virtually full capacity utilisation and is growing above potential. So, the risk of additional wage increases and inflation is gradually emerging. It should also be remembered that the Fed has created vast amounts of additional money over the past years. It should therefore be wary of inflation increasing excessively. Growth then should be gradually pushed back to potential – approximately 1.75% – in order to prevent inflation from getting out of hand. Hence, the Fed has already indicated it will raise interest rates further. However, the question is to what extent interest rates should be raised to this end.</p>
<figure class=""center"">

</figure>
<p>In Japan and Europe, the loose monetary policy being followed by the central banks means that if the Fed were to raise its rates, so much capital would flow to the US that the dollar would become stronger. This would then cause deterioration in US foreign trade, with the US economy being pushed down in the process. The more this happens, the less the Fed will need to raise its rates to push growth back to approximately 1.75%.</p>
<p>All then that is achieved by talking down the dollar is the Fed having to hike rates more than in the situation where the dollar rate would have increased in tandem. In other words, in terms of ultimate economic growth it does not matter at all whether or not the dollar increases in tandem. However, in the one case the pain will be felt in terms of foreign trade, and in the other it will be fely by anyone who wants to borrow money.</p>
<h4 id=""capital-flows-reign-supreme"">Capital flows reign supreme</h4>
<p>Moreover, what the Trump team forgets is that the situation was precisely the other way around a number of years ago. Back then, it was the US that pursued a far looser monetary policy than Europe and Japan. A great deal of capital therefore actually flowed overseas, resulting in an enormous decline in the rate of the dollar. EUR/USD is currently at 1.07, while purchasing power parity is somewhere around 1.20. However, at the time the rate soared all the way to 1.40 – 1.60, as a result of which there was a far greater overshoot than now.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is important to note: history shows that interventions – both verbally and on the currency market – can never push currency rates up or down for long. Capital flows will always win in the end, unless the fundamentals change (eg higher or lower interest rates). So, in the current case the dollar exchange rate may be kept low for a while or even be pushed down, but if the result is even higher US interest rates, the dollar exchange rate will ultimately still increase.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>There has never been a better or more necessary time for treasurers in Asia Pacific to start thinking about e-commerce. The region is already the largest e-commerce marketplace in the world and according to Munir Nanji, Asia Pacific Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, it could in many markets be described as the next frontier.</p>
<p>Today the fastest rates of digital adoption are seen in Asia’s emerging markets, where the falling cost of internet access and mobile devices are now driving exponential growth in all forms of e-commerce. Just over 20 years after US internet giant Amazon delivered its very first parcel, the world’s largest e-commerce business is no longer headquartered in Silicon Valley, but is another company based in Hangzhou, China.</p>
<p>“In China the biggest company in this space is Alibaba – and that business alone is bigger than the entire value of US e-commerce,” says Nanji. “India has also just surpassed the US for the number of people with internet access. So I think you have got to be in Asia if you are in e-commerce – otherwise you are not on the map at all.”</p>
<p>Yet, Nanji believes that despite the advanced state of e-commerce penetration in the region, there is still plenty of room for growth in emerging markets and even in Asia’s more affluent economies. “E-commerce in India has an incredible amount of potential, but also faces a lot of challenges.” In other parts of Asia meanwhile, e-commerce is hampered not by infrastructure but by the continued prevalence of cash as a payment method. However, one by one these barriers are beginning to break down across the region.</p>


<blockquote>E-commerce in India has an incredible amount of potential, but also faces a lot of challenges.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“In India we see a lot of issues around regulation,” Nanji says “and there is a lack of fibre optic connectivity in some places too; while logistics can be a nightmare. But the way we pay is also an area of evolution here. In the US and Europe the use of credit and debit cards is widespread, but in Asia this is still growing in acceptance.”</p>
<p>“But internet access and mobile technology are big drivers of e-commerce, and it is forecast that there will be 117 smartphones per 100 people in Asia by 2017. That is going to drive online purchasing; it is going to drive greater use of e-wallets and the use of other mobile payment methods by consumers.”</p>
<p>The growth of e-commerce and the digitisation of business processes to support it present a myriad of opportunities for corporate treasurers. At a high level, digitisation offers a means to improve the way payments are made, received and reconciled by the treasury department, driving better management of working capital and liquidity. With more commercial activities shifting into digital channels, treasurers also have the chance to begin leveraging analytical tools such as big data.</p>
<p>However, Nanji emphasises, the opportunities – and challenges – that e-commerce presents to treasurers in Asia Pacific will not be the same at every company. The e-commerce trading model can be subdivided into a number of spheres, he points out. There are companies creating digital marketplaces, payment tools, online games; companies providing telecom and web hosting services; and companies investing in fintech. Across these spheres, the bank often sees quite different demands from its clients.</p>
<p>“Payment reconciliation and foreign exchange are key for online travel companies like Ctrip or Traveloka for example, and so we see a lot of demand for things like virtual card solutions from companies in this space. But then you also have retailers in China, meanwhile, who are seeing increased demand from consumers to be able to pay using mobile messaging apps like WeChat, and so they often require back-end solutions so that they can support these new consumer payment methods.”</p>
<p>This is where Citi’s expertise becomes a useful resource for many of the bank’s corporate clients. As e-commerce evolves into all-commerce – or all areas of commerce, at least – companies need partners that are able to understand, not only the digitisation and e-commerce opportunities within each country or market, but also within their particular business sector.</p>
<p>Across key sectors like industrials, healthcare and consumer goods, non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), technology, media and telecommunications, and consumer and healthcare, Citi can offer specialist advice and tailored solutions to clients. These are services that might make all the difference for those looking to leverage the financial and operational efficiencies afforded by e-commerce.</p>

<h3 id=""a-new-frontier"">A new frontier</h3>
<p>One example of the transformative impact e-commerce is having on Asia Pacific businesses and the treasuries that support them can be found in the industrials sector. The companies operating in this space are a diverse bunch. Some, like the airlines and hospitality and services companies, are not new to e-commerce, having conducted a majority of sales made through electronic channels for many years now. But for many other business types – shipping companies, aviation suppliers – buying and selling online is something that is only just now beginning to take off.</p>
<p>“It is relatively new, but e-commerce is a growing channel for these companies,” says Deborah Mur, Asia Pacific Industrials, Energy, Power and Chemicals Sector Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “We are seeing emerging B2B online purchasing by companies; we are seeing companies setting up procurement websites with their suppliers and, in some instances, third parties – and we are being asked for solutions.”</p>
<p>More and more of these companies are finding that e-commerce can be just as much of an enabler for business-to-business (B2B) transactions as it is in the business-to-consumer (B2C) world. Utilising web channels for procurement, for instance, promises similar operational efficiencies B2C enjoy: the ability to reach more customers faster and at a lower cost.</p>
<p>Greater operational efficiency is also being seen in the financial operations of these industrial e-pioneers, notes Mur. The industrial aviation supplier selling goods to suppliers online, for example, often boasts a faster payments cycle, better days sales outstanding (DSO) metrics, and higher rates of automation in the processing and reconciliation of payment transactions. Treasurers at these types of companies have an important role to play in assisting the procurement department. For example, they will want to ensure, first and foremost, that the payment methods being offered through e-commerce channels are the most appropriate methods for customers and the business. And how that is perceived still tends to vary market-by-market and company-by-company, Mur says.</p>
<p>“In some cases, companies will have an online B2B marketplace, but are settling transactions offline using traditional payment methods,” she says. “Is that the most efficient way for these companies to operate? We think we can help our clients do better.”</p>

<p>In the consumer goods sector, e-commerce has been a disruptive force for some time and across Asia it is becoming a ubiquitous feature of the landscape. Indeed, for many of Citi’s clients this sector is now the primary focus of their growth plans. “E-commerce is centre of our clients’ Asia expansion strategy and, as a channel, it has experienced the highest growth in the last five years,” explains Rohit Jamwal, Asia Pacific Consumer and Healthcare Sector Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The segment that has seen the highest adoption of e-commerce is the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, in particular the food and fashion industries. Increasingly e-commerce is taking a greater share of the overall market. In the largest markets in Asia FMCG online retail now accounts for between 7-10% of overall sales, and is growing between 25-40% year on year.</p>
<p>Jamwal says that there is a lot of talk in the sector today about the ‘Next One Billion’, a metaphor for the future of the internet – both the exponential growth in connectivity in emerging markets and the growth of next-level technology in mature markets. This trend raises a number of issues for businesses, says Jamwal. “For example, how to approach online content versus distribution in rural areas, the need to invest in partnerships with distributors to provide “last mile connectivity” and support the business – in respect to stretched DSO and days inventory outstanding (DIO) – by providing digital methods of collections.”</p>
<p>India, for instance, still sees 75% of e-commerce payments conducted through “cash on delivery”, something that presents significant logistical problems for businesses, not to mention collection inefficiencies. Many companies in this sector are therefore looking to the growing uptake of digital wallets in these markets as an opportunity to eliminate such inefficiencies and provide impetus to growth of e-commerce in India.</p>
<p>Citi is partner to corporate treasury for a “go to market” strategy, says Jamwal. “We advise clients on best in class solutions in the consumer sector,” he says. “We show them what works and what does not, what are challenges and risks embedded in each e-commerce model, what is possible in each regulatory environment. Citi leads in offering advice for best in class solutions as well as helping our clients managing risks around their online channels, cyber security in tandem with the business’ growth.”</p>
<p>This includes providing treasurers with solutions for handling collections online and in-store, legal entity and account structuring, reconciliation using Citi’s Working Capital Analytics and FX and Risk advisory solutions.</p>

<h3 id=""disruption-and-growth-opportunities"">Disruption and growth opportunities</h3>
<p>In contrast to the nascent trends seen in the industrial sectors, e-commerce has long been a disrupter for Asia’s technology, media and telecommunications businesses. “The change e-commerce is driving across businesses in these industries shows no sign of abating soon,” says Nick Howden, Asia Pacific Technology, Media and Telecoms Sector Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi.</p>
<p>“It is forecasted that the gross merchandise value (GMV) of goods and services purchased online will increase five-fold over the next ten years,” he says. “Technology, media and telecom businesses will be major driving forces underpinning this growth story. We see digital services including content streaming, cloud and data as being pivot growth areas. Not only is the overall value of e-commerce growing significantly, but high growth disrupters demonstrate the proportion of sales made online is gaining pace faster than offline channels.”</p>
<p>In Asia, companies have been driven to diversify models in established markets to capture more sales and continue to be relevant to customers, whilst emerging markets are a key focus for expansion and as testing grounds to try new products. Many are interested in the possibilities of stored value solutions including e-wallets which can have a range of potential applications and a number are branching out into point of sale (POS) and fintech payment solutions as well.</p>
<p>Howden says that enabling a smooth checkout process for a mobile application is one of the hottest growth areas to increase sales for his clients. In China, he points out, m-commerce is growing at an astonishing rate of 70% year-on-year. Much of this growth across Asia is driven by generational “leap frogging” as people move onto the internet for the first time through their mobile phone, as opposed to a desktop, due to the falling cost of smartphones, lower cost of data, and growing connectivity of such devices.</p>
<p>Cash application, reconciliation and using standardised technology interfaces with bank partners are probably the most important areas for treasurers respond to business growth opportunities quickly. A primary challenge for treasurers, he says, is access to and analytics of data. “For example knowing a customer’s payment preference in a particular country can help the business grow but the payment data generated will influence cash application, credit control and reconciliation processes. Companies are asking for standardised data in order to automate order fulfillment processes in as close to real-time as possible.”</p>
<p>There have been some significant developments in this area in recent years. One example is faster payment schemes, such as Singapore’s Immediate Payments G3 scheme, which was launched in 2014 and supports credit transfers and direct debits with a mainly C2C retail application at the moment. Similar payment infrastructure initiatives have also been seen in Australia and India.</p>
<p>On top of upgrades to ageing payment infrastructures, treasurers in this sector have also been driving standardisation. Lean treasury teams in the tech sector are always facing pressures to centralise, consolidate and standardise systems and processes.</p>
<p>However, geographic expansion can sometimes result in a high degree of inefficiency as banking relationships and the different processes associated with each relationship threaten to multiply.</p>
<p>One thing Howden says his clients really value from their relationship with Citi, is the ability to roll-out new businesses to new markets in a relatively short space of time. Advances in bank-to-corporate communication processes, like the industry’s adoption of the ISO 20022 XML standard for payments and reporting is certainly an important facilitator of this trend. But treasurers also want to feel confident they will get a consistent user experience and data set however they choose to access services and in whatever market they operate in.</p>
<p>This, explains Howden, is of crucial importance for the big billers in the technology, media and telecom sector. “Very lean organisations are focused on the next thing: they don’t want to spend time and IT resources connecting with different banks using different standards,” he says. “Choosing a bank with a broad footprint, and consistent network, enables standardisation. The use of virtual accounts for cash application and reconciliation is common. Whilst for outgoing payments, if I send an XML payment file and something goes wrong e.g. the beneficiary account number was incorrectly entered during an online registration process, then I need a standardised report explaining what went wrong. E-commerce companies typically have huge volumes of payments so reject rates can be a huge operational issue. Standardisation helps to identify what went wrong faster and with less manual intervention.”</p>

<h3 id=""the-rise-of-fintech"">The rise of fintech</h3>
<p>Given the speed and ease with which financial information can now be transmitted digitally it is perhaps little surprise that another of the key sectors in Asia Pacific where Citi is seeing e-commerce taking a very strong hold is financial services.</p>
<p>Damian Macinante, Asia Pacific Non-Bank Financial Institutions Sector Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, says that Citi’s clients in the non-bank financial sector have adopted e-commerce business models across the board in recent years. It is a trend that has afforded many different types of financial services companies the ability to re-align processes that would otherwise be hampered by manual processes.</p>
<p>“It really started with the fund managers and brokers,” he says. “They were the ones who first saw how digitisation was going to change the game. They saw an opportunity to reach a far bigger market, and the readiness of their customers to move to trading or investing online rather than of picking up a telephone, for example.”</p>
<p>If you look at trading trends we see continued electronification of trading across all asset classes and as a result as electronic trading increases, average trade size decreases and number of trades per day increases,” he adds. This does however vary depending on the sophistication. At present, approximately 90% of global equity trades are executed electronically versus 20% of OTC derivatives. Citi expect this to increase to 75% by 2020.</p>
<p>For these types of companies, it also provides an avenue for reducing costs for the same service usually offered via direct contact or intermediaries. The online products of insurers, for example, can be made available at a substantially lower cost, especially when agents or brokers are disintermediated. This in turn can popularise householders’ insurance, health and accident policies etc. “If available online and at a lower cost, people may start buying cover they traditionally didn’t have or thought was unaffordable or excessive,” says Macinante.</p>


<blockquote>We support our clients in this space by doing a lot of work on analytics, helping them to get a clear view of all the transactions coming through our system.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“Take fund managers, for instance,” he says. “They are now able to articulate immediately what their products’ performance is for their funds. That allows investors to configure their portfolios to local regulations through the platforms themselves where historically they would have had to have spoken to an advisor who is abreast of all the new regulations. Now they have the ability to do it themselves.”</p>
<p>Of course, in order to leverage all the increased flows and additional information obtainable today through digital channels, companies require sophisticated analytical tools without jeopardising governance and controls. To meet this need, Citi offers analytical tools that deliver enhanced visibility across banking processes, helping treasurers to achieve greater operational efficiencies through the conversion of manual processes and greater end-to-end automation.</p>
<p>“We support our clients in this space by doing a lot of work on analytics, helping them to get a clear view of all the transactions coming through our system. This then helps clients to operate straight through and see how they are represented in multiple countries and from a cash management perspective, for example, conduct comparisons between payment mechanisms.”</p>
<p>Citi also provides risk management tools. “A monetary transaction is taking place and our clients need to have control over that,” he says. “It is important then to offer clients the ability to have oversight on the transactions they are generating and enable them to use our system to automatically identify payments that are not part of their normal transaction flows. This allows them to have a second line of defense in case there are internal breaches.”</p>

2017: expecting the unexpected,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>It’s fair to say that 2016 was something of a rollercoaster ride for treasurers around the world. As such, when asked to predict what shape 2017 will take, the word that first springs to mind is uncertainty. The events of 2016 will certainly lead to an adjustment for many in the year ahead. Treasurers will be keen to understand the impact of last year’s political and other developments, while monitoring new events with renewed caution.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the core priorities of corporate treasurers are the same as they have always been. A recent survey by Ovum found that treasurers’ priorities in 2017 included managing liquidity (a priority for 50% of respondents), cash visibility (27%), managing FX and credit risk (39% and 31% respectively) and data analysis to improve decision making (36%).</p>
<p>While the repercussions of recent and upcoming world events will loom large in the coming year, treasurers will continue to focus on the fundamental components of the job – and to ask how developments in technology can support them in increasing efficiency, reducing costs and making effective decisions.</p>
<h3 id=""changing-political-landscape"">Changing political landscape</h3>
<p>The last year has been nothing if not surprising. On 23<sup>rd</sup> June, the world was shocked by the UK’s decision to exit the European Union. More was to follow with Donald Trump’s election victory in November, as well as the resignation of Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi in December, following the resounding defeat of his referendum on constitutional reforms. Following this wave of political upheaval, treasurers will be watching events closely in 2017 – particularly the upcoming elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<h4 id=""interest-rates"">Interest rates</h4>
<p>Recent political events have the potential to impact treasurers in a number of different ways. Speaking after the US election, Daniel Jefferies, Group Treasurer of Equiniti Group, said he will be watching the rates environment closely in 2017, particularly in light of Brexit and uncertainty in other economies around the world. “About six weeks ago, before the US election, we were looking at the scenario where base rate was looking to be bumping along the bottom at a few basis points out to 2020 and beyond,” he explained. “But even in the last six weeks, we’ve seen that rate kind of flatten out, and there’s more speculation now about rates potentially going up rather than down.”</p>
<p>Rick Martin, Group Treasurer at GasLog, is similarly interested in the impact of political events on interest rates in the coming year. “My prediction is that President Trump is going to do a ‘Nixon to China’ on domestic policy,” he says. “Meaning? Just like it could only be an ardent anti-communist like Nixon to welcome China back to the family of nations, it will take a Republican president to push through Congress the sort of fiscal stimulus that President Obama could only dream of. And with that, US rates head up, even a bit more than they already have.”</p>
<p>Any such developments in interest rates would be of considerable interest to corporate treasurers. “In the US, with rising interest rates, treasurers will be looking at their cost of funds and when is the right time to tap the market for funding, from banks or through bonds,” notes Matt Tuck, Head of Global Transaction Banking at Barclays Corporate Banking. “The as yet unknown impact of Trump is also hampering clear decision making.”</p>
<p>In Europe, meanwhile, Tuck says that investment decisions are becoming harder to make in light of forthcoming elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands, alongside the impact of the UK’s approach to Brexit on the wider economy and trade flows. “Whilst low interest rates in Europe seem to be here for the foreseeable future, the volatility created by unknown political outcomes will be weighing on treasurers’ minds, with continued uncertainty around FX post-Brexit,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""funding"">Funding</h4>
<p>The changing political environment may also affect companies’ funding decisions. While different companies have different priorities, Tuck says that a common theme has been to renew banking credit facilities early – in some cases very early – in order to lock in funding/backup at favourable margins and attractive structures.</p>
<p>“Issuing debt in the capital markets will also be at the forefront of treasurers’ minds; despite higher USD rates, long-term debt is still historically very cheap,” he says. “Treasurers are also very interested in new digital applications to improve processes and automation of cash management and trade. Part of this has been driven by some organisations employing smaller treasury staff, with treasurers (like professionals in many industries) trying to do more with less.”</p>
<h4 id=""managing-political-risk"">Managing political risk</h4>
<p>After the events of 2016, treasurers will be unlikely to make any assumptions about the outcome of upcoming elections and other political events. Nevertheless, predicting and mitigating political risk is a considerable challenge.</p>
<p>Paul Taylor, Managing Director, Regional Sales Head, GTS EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, points out that companies have different levels of exposure. “Multinationals with a broad exposure across multiple national, legal and tax jurisdictions have been reviewing their banking arrangements,” he says. “They are probably less keen on dealing with large numbers of counterparties now, because that’s more risk to manage. So they are looking at consolidating banking providers. They want very certain statements from their providers that those banks still plan to be there, and that they have a strategy in place to cover any sort of dramatic political challenge.”</p>

<h3 id=""2017-whats-on-the-agenda"">2017: what’s on the agenda?</h3>
<p>Paul Taylor, Managing Director, Regional Sales Head, GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch says that five key themes are emerging from conversations with corporate clients:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Back to business.</h5>
<p>I feel that for many corporate treasurers, the last few years have been about regulation, responding to change and addressing financial risk. A lot of people are saying that they have realised this is the new reality: the world is constantly changing, and the changes can be quite dramatic, as we’ve seen this year. But they are realising that they can’t live in obeyance of that and are focusing on new projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Staying alive.</h5>
<p>Treasurers want to make sure they are managing compliance risk, political risk, regulatory risk, technology risk and counterparty risk. For example, they have seen several of their banking counterparties exit markets, products and clients this year. As such, they want to ensure that their banks will still exist – and that they will still want to continue serving them as clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increasing efficiency and reducing cost.</h5>
<p>In the last few years, we’ve seen a lot of treasuries centralising and adopting payment factories, shared service centres and in-house banks. We have people looking at the working capital cycle and figuring out how their companies can become more efficient. We’ve also seen more use of solutions such as e-procurement, virtual account management and supply chain finance. These are rapidly becoming core solutions, and increasingly, treasurers are proactive about using them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Supporting growth.</h5>
<p>With companies getting back to business, we have seen a big pick up in the M&amp;A cycle in 2016. We’ve had a lot of conversations in the pre- and post-M&amp;A integration space around treasury, with companies which are looking at acquisitions asking how they can get the maximum benefit from that integration.</p>
<p>At the same time, companies are moving into new markets and are dealing with increasingly global client bases. As such, they want a treasury set-up which is geared towards easy market entry and easy treasury integration. This is an element of the treasurer’s life which might have seemed somewhat exotic five or ten years ago, but which is now very much part of the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Predicting the future.</h5>
<p>Treasurers are deluged with buzz terms such as fintech, blockchain, bitcoin and dematerialisation. But they are concerned about investing too early because, as yet, there is no interoperability between these solutions and no industry standard. They don’t want to back Betamax in a world of VHS; and on the other hand, they don’t want to miss out completely when others may be benefitting. The challenge is to be able to predict the future, and we find many clients coming to us for our insights, for validation, and, increasingly, to adopt or pilot those solutions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id=""automation-security-and-technology"">Automation, security and technology</h3>
<p>Mark Smith, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services at Citi, says that investing in automation and security will be another priority for treasurers in 2017 – not only as a means of achieving efficiency gains, but also to increase the security of treasury operations. Last year’s high profile cyberattacks have not gone unnoticed by treasurers, and many will be putting measures in place to minimise the risk of similar attacks on their own businesses.</p>
<p>“Automating manual processes brings a number of different benefits,” says Smith. “These include reducing errors and achieving a consistency of approach, as well as greater security compared to manual intervention. Automation also frees up different members of the corporate treasury team to focus on other areas, such as risk management and regulatory change.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, treasurers will be monitoring developments in technology and gauging which opportunities can be leveraged. “There is major awareness of disruptors such as fintech and blockchain, and appetite to learn more, but resource and funding is limited,” says Mitko Iankov, Head of Market Development – GTM Europe, Thomson Reuters. “We expect corporates to embrace big data in a much more comprehensive manner, by tagging and organising internal data, sourcing data externally to complete the picture, and by recruiting data scientists that can help take the corporate to the next stage of their digital evolution (Industrial 4.0).”</p>
<p>Iankov adds that despite the presence of peer to peer lending, the vast majority of corporates still look to their banks for transactional banking and capital market access. “The value of that relationship does need more transparency and the shift of power is in favour of corporates (better rated and having more choice),” he says. “Multibank platforms and transparency of capital market fees means more leverage for the corporate.”</p>
<h4 id=""frictionless-user-experience"">Frictionless user experience</h4>
<p>Enrico Camerinelli, Senior Analyst at Aite Group, says that corporate practitioners are looking for a frictionless user experience across their financial relationships, and they want to access financial services in order to increase their operational efficiency.</p>
<p>“Banks, although capable of understanding their corporate counterpart’s business issues, are slow in implementing the identified proposition, making delivery time, speed of business, and turnaround time a major corporate concern,” he explains. “Solutions to this issue could come from fintech applications that enable a single customer view, a single digital solution for cross-business workflow, relationship services, network integration and faster turnaround of bank onboarding.”</p>
<p>Camerinelli adds that treasurers are looking for total oversight of areas such as working capital management and financial supply chain management. “Ensuring supplier financial stability and multi-tier engagement, rather than just immediate first tier suppliers, calls for sourcing and working capital management strategies (including supply chain finance and accounts payable),” he says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I certainly sense there is more engagement at a very early stage of setting up a growing business. The treasurer, in many cases, is one of the first people sitting around the table and talking about the foundation in setting up the business, which is an exciting place for treasurers to be.”</p>
<p><cite>Mark Smith, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services, Citi</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“These can be best supported with an application that could provide one web services portal to aggregate information from multiple banks, non-bank financing solutions, marketplace lenders and e-document platforms. Corporate subscribers only supply their information (eg KYC) once, making it available to all authorised parties through a single platform that links various marketplaces, financiers, distributors and business partners.”</p>
<p>He also points out that technology can help treasurers overcome challenges in areas such as funding and investments. “Corporate treasurers are committed to increasing yield on non-utilised funds through better investments and extending credit to supply chain partners, taking an active role in advising management on the best capital allocation strategies for deploying cash (eg dividends, buy-backs, investments),” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""other-areas-to-watch"">Other areas to watch</h3>
<p>Aside from the changing political landscape and developments in technology, the following trends and topics are also likely to be significant in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Regulatory change.</h5>
<p>In keeping with the last few years, regulatory change continues to be a major area of focus – and this is set to continue in the coming 12 months. “One key theme for 2017 is managing regulatory change – and within that, tax changes,” comments Smith.</p>
<p>“This includes changes such as BEPS, the anti-tax avoidance directive and Brexit, as well as potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) following the election of Donald Trump in the US. It also includes regulatory changes around capital controls, including changing capital restrictions in China.”</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, treasurers are continuing to face a wide range of compliance challenges spanning different areas of treasury. These challenges are covered in more detail in this month’s Regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Relationships.</h5>
<p>Jefferies says that in the current low rate environment, both banks and corporates are looking to get the most out of their relationships. “Certainly that’s what we do as well. We’re trying to align ourselves to the way that the banks are operating in order to develop the deepest relationships we can in areas such as operational efficiency, rates environment and foreign exchange.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Role of the treasurer.</h5>
<p>According to Smith, treasurers are continuing to be more engaged in driving business decisions on topics such as how and where best to set up working capital frameworks and liquidity pools. “I certainly sense there is more engagement at a very early stage of setting up a growing business,” he says. “The treasurer, in many cases, is one of the first people sitting around the table and talking about the foundation in setting up the business, which is an exciting place for treasurers to be.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Regional variation.</h5>
<p>While treasurers around the world will be affected by certain trends and developments, they will also be paying attention to trends specific to key markets. For example, Jason Marsden, Head of Client Solutions – TPS International at Standard Bank outlines some of the issues that treasurers will be focusing on in Africa.</p>
<p>“Even though growth in Africa has slowed overall, the region still continues to deliver some of the highest growth rates relative to others,” he comments. “A key challenge for treasurers will be priming their operations to take advantage of the growth which can be expected once the commodity cycles recover.”</p>
<p>Marsden adds that there is a strong focus on payment modernisation across a number of markets in Africa, as evidenced by the introduction of local and regional real-time payments solutions. “This should also lead to a review on some of the liquidity management rules and enable the deployment of more efficient structures compared to what is currently in place.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>While the core priorities of treasurers continue to be on managing cash, liquidity and risk effectively, the events of 2016 mean that treasurers are likely to be entering January with a greater sense of caution about the coming year. If treasurers took just one message from last year, it would be to expect the unexpected.</p>
<p>As Smith concludes, “There is an element of continuation in many of these themes. A number of new risks have come up over the last year, prompting companies to make sure that day-to-day activities are as automated as possible, and that their processes, controls and governance are fully bedded down. As different focus areas come along in 2017, it will be up to treasurers to make sure they are best placed to handle these.”</p>

"Fiscal stimulus, austerity and sustaining global growth – what does 2017 have in store?","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Monetary easing on an almost permanent basis has led to interest rates that are desperately low, not just in Europe but also in the US, the UK and Japan. None of this has generated enough sustainable growth to cut debts, substantially reduce unemployment and counter voter dissatisfaction. Major trends stoke insecurity, depress the growth potential and/or undermine employment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ageing populations mean that too few workers have to keep the welfare state alive whereas the costs of the welfare state are rising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technological progress such as the disappearance of entire job categories due to automatisation alongside technological stagnation (according to scientists such as Robert Gordon the largest breakthroughs are now behind us).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geopolitical and economic power shifting from West to East.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opposition to free trade and other facets of globalisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Organisations such as the IMF and the OECD as well as central bankers – who have increased their balance sheets by fourfold or even fivefold – argue in favour of more government stimulus in order to give economies a leg-up. Last summer the US Secretary of the Treasury said: “Today the G20 is no longer debating growth versus austerity, but rather how to best employ fiscal policy to support our economies.” Since then, Americans have elected a president who promised to spend a thousand billion dollars on infrastructure investment. The European Commission has given Portugal and Spain more time to reduce their budget deficits. Meanwhile PM Abe has presented various stimulus packages in Japan.</p>
<p>Public investment has declined markedly in the past decades and years. In other words, there is a lot of catching up to do in terms of infrastructure. Markets are quite sanguine about the combination of investment and tax cuts Trump has promised. This enthusiasm is fuelled by the large sums that Trump has mentioned and the notion that it should not be hard to select fruitful investment projects. A third of US levees and highways are in bad or poor condition. Nevertheless, we believe the prevailing positivism could be too much of a good thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The power of the purse is vested in Congress so Trump needs the latter to approve his investments and tax cuts. True, the House of Representatives as well as the Senate are in Republican hands but not all Republicans are dead keen on Trump’s plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump’s promises of 3.5-4.0% economic growth are unrealistic. Productivity growth is weakening and the working population decreased as a percentage of the total population after the credit crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not every economist agrees that this is the right moment to invest in roads, ports, and other infrastructure, as the economy is already performing well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump’s plans are as vague as they are grandiose. US infrastructure is badly in need of improvements, but opinions differ about the question how, when, and at what price it should be improved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump wants the business sector to cough up a large portion of the costs. It remains to be seen whether companies will be prepared to take part as public-private constructions have not proved very successful in the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As there is a fairly high chance that the US stimulus measures will fall short of expectations, the question is whether real fiscal easing is possible in other countries. The UK may envisage an end to years of austerity (although the image of draconic cutbacks by the Cameron/Osborne tandem is not completely accurate) as PM May and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond prepare to loosen the reins somewhat. The UK’s infrastructure could certainly do with some attention since it ranks 24<sup>th</sup> on a list where France’s infrastructure is in tenth position and Germany is number 11. However, we do not expect London to come up with big surprises in terms of fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p>Fiscal stimulus in the Eurozone does not really have the wind in its sails either. Southern euro states would like their governments to boost domestic growth but member states like Germany and the Netherlands continue to block these efforts. Still, change could gradually unfold. German Finance Minister Schauble has already presented voters with tax reductions in the run-up to the elections in the autumn of 2017. The Merkel government may want to give away additional presents, particularly as Merkel and her party are losing popularity due to the migration crisis. As Merkel is not prepared to significantly change her views on migration, tax boons are a viable alternative to keep voters happy.</p>
<p>Dutch elections will take place in March. In the Netherlands, too, the fiscal handbrake has been released somewhat while the Finnish government also seems prepared to marginally loosen its grip on the public purse strings. In Italy, an interim government will have to pave the way for a new electoral law as well as for elections. Consequently, few grand gestures will be possible in terms of reform and stimulus. Conditions in France and Spain are not much different. The presidential elections that are due to take place in France in the spring will probably amount to a ‘duel’ between Marine Le Pen and François Fillon. The latter is believed to have the best chances by far. Fillon is not that enamoured of a large and very active government. Therefore, the chance is low that the French government will take the economy in tow. This also applies to Spain, where the government that took office recently after a lot of commotion is no big fan of fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p>Across the Eurozone few left-wing parties are firmly in the saddle. In that sense we should not have high hopes of the will of national governments to stimulate economic growth. Yet, this is offset by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The general attitude regarding fiscal stimulus is gradually changing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The traditional left/right dichotomy applies less and less whereas right-wing (populist) parties regularly are in favour of large-scale government spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The European authorities are taking a somewhat more flexible stance than before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expectations in Europe are low compared to the prospect of stimulus in the US.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Japanese government is determined to overcome economic stagnation even though deficits are high and the national debt is huge. Abe has announced stimulus packages worth over US$130bn. The Central Bank of Japan is facilitating the stimulus and PM Abe is in a strong position politically. The coalition parties have won a comfortable majority in the Upper House elections in July and the next Lower House elections are not due until December 2018. The story looks relatively positive at first glance but we should point out that stimulus money that was announced in the past never even came close to the sums that were actually spent.</p>
<p>The Chinese leader Xi Jinping is perhaps even more comfortable on this throne than Abe. Xi has greatly consolidated and expanded his power since taking office. However, he may worry about China’s debt (public and private): it stands at 260% of GDP and economists have been warning against financial bubbles for a long time. Yet, the government can continue to pour money into the economy as its capital account is closed, its reserves are enormous and its debt is almost exclusively denominated in yuan and held domestically. Stimulus measures that entail infrastructure investment are relatively easier to implement than in the West. China lags the rich countries to a considerable degree (it ranks 51<sup>st</sup> on a list comprising 144 states) and it has grand plans. There is the One Belt, One Road initiative (OBOR) that involves spending worth dozens of billions of dollars and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which has US$100bn at its disposal; Beijing supplies US$30bn of this. We expect China to extend public spending in 2017.</p>
<p>Next year could see a net increase in economic stimulus in the major economies. Japan and China will likely meet the prevailing expectations whereas day-to-day politics in Washington may well belie the optimism about Trump’s plans. We do not expect any stimulus miracles in Europe although the expectations are extremely modest so there is a possibility that the actual level of spending will positively surprise the markets. The large-scale fiscal stimulus that many international organisations would like to see may not materialise but austerity as a mantra seems done and dusted.</p>
<p>The question is will the governments make use of the time bought by central banks to implement (further) structural reforms? Will fiscal stimulus do more than boost near-term demand? It is worth remembering that the European governments have pursued an austerity policy for a long time (and continue to do so in some cases). 2017 may well be the year when this starts to change while the next trend reversal – back towards belt tightening – may unfold just as slowly. Such a pattern would initially be good news for growth. However, the consequences for public debt and inflation could be very serious in the longer term.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>From Brexit to the Bangladesh Bank heist, 2016 has seen some significant world events which have repercussions for companies around the world. At the same time, the evolving challenges faced by corporate treasurers have been accompanied by some significant technological innovations.</em></p>
<p>The past 12 months have been nothing if not eventful. Against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, treasurers have faced numerous challenges, from cybercrime to continuing low interest rates. Meanwhile, technological developments including blockchain-related milestones and the rise of outsourced applications are providing new opportunities for treasurers to operate more efficiently. This article reviews some of the most significant milestones, innovations and challenges of the last year.</p>
<h3 id=""cybercrime-and-fraud"">Cybercrime and fraud</h3>
<p>Concerns about cybercrime have been mounting in the last couple of years. In February, the scale of potential breaches became apparent with the theft of $81m from Bangladesh Bank – an event which has made corporate treasurers far more conscious of the risks.</p>
<p>Andrew Bateman, President of Treasury Software Solutions at FIS, notes that cyber security is increasingly becoming a greater concern for corporate treasurers. “We are seeing more and more focus on this topic, following several breaches in the marketplace this year,” he comments. “It is interesting to see how people are beginning to understand where the risks are in more detail. Making your environment secure is one thing, but making your application secure – both externally facing and also within your firewall – is becoming increasingly important.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other types of cyber threat are also becoming more sophisticated – such as Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, whereby fraudsters send emails to finance staff, attempting to convince them to make urgent payments to overseas accounts. Fraudsters may go to great lengths to make their emails sound authentic and many such attacks are successful. In June, the FBI reported that BEC scams had cumulatively resulted in losses of over $3bn since 2013.</p>
<p>The rising threat of fraud was also highlighted by Kyriba’s 2016 Treasury Survey, which found that the number of companies which had been the target of attempted fraud had increased by 20% since the previous year. The largest reported loss was $2.5m from a single incident.</p>



<h3 id=""tackling-the-risk-of-fraud"">Tackling the risk of fraud</h3>
<p>George Dessing, SVP, Treasury and Risk at Wolters Kluwer, notes that the company has intensified its focus on cyber risks and incident management as the company’s business model has evolved into digital.</p>
<p>“Our company is becoming more and more digital – 86% of total revenues are digital and services – so you can imagine that the issue of cyber fraud is a relevant risk for us to manage,” he explains. “In the old days, our main risks related to the warehouses which contained all of our print books. Our global risk management and insurance programmes have necessarily evolved to meet traditional and emerging risks, including cyber.”</p>
<p>Where reacting to incidents is concerned, Dessing notes that this may include external as well as internal incidents. “We have locations in New York, so when the bombing took place recently we needed to react and inform our employees as this happened relatively close to our office – the more you inform them, the more you engage them. As the world becomes more interconnected, treasurers, who have long been closely linked to market risks, are now getting more involved in operational risks as well.”</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""brexit-and-beyond"">Brexit and beyond</h3>
<p>The outcome of the UK’s Brexit referendum on 23<sup>rd</sup> June sent shockwaves around the world, but with the terms of the exit yet to be decided, the impact for corporations remains unclear.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is certainly concern about the impact of Brexit. Research published by Greenwich Associates in August found that over a quarter of European companies intend to move away from UK banks once Britain leaves the EU.</p>
<p>These concerns relate to the possibility that banks’ passporting rights will be withdrawn following Brexit. Currently, British banks can use passporting rights to offer financial services across the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) without requiring authorisation in individual countries. Concerns have been raised that if these passporting rights are withdrawn as part of the Brexit negotiations, some financial institutions would move their headquarters to another country within the EEA.</p>
<p>Aside from this issue, Brexit has had wide ranging implications for treasurers. “The implications of Brexit haven’t yet fully unfolded in a legal sense, but there has been quite a profound effect to the capital markets from a UK perspective,” says Chris King, Group Treasurer at Vita Group. “The currency, gilts and swaps movements have certainly tested and validated downside sensitivities in business and covenant scenario modelling. UK defined pension schemes have had a large impact, and the investment approach has been strongly challenged.”</p>
<p>King adds, “whilst the uncertainty will need to be considered in more detail and managed accordingly, particularly in light of ongoing liquidity in ever more febrile markets, it does offer scope for some lateral thinking and reassessment of how best to manage the risks.” He notes that the opportunities are just as significant as the risks, given that most of the downside market impact has – seemingly – now been felt.</p>
<p>Beyond Brexit, other geopolitical events have featured prominently in 2016. “Political instability in the Middle East and Africa has led to the largest involuntary migration since the Second World War,” says Mitko Iankov, Head of Market Development – GTM Europe, Thomson Reuters. “This has unwittingly fuelled the populist politics within developed Europe, further exacerbating the protectionist attitude and popularity of extreme politics. This is not isolated to Europe, but indeed contributed to an anti-globalisation, anti-free trade business environment in which most MNCs thrive.”</p>
<h3 id=""making-the-most-of-cash"">Making the most of cash</h3>
<p>Aside from these challenges, treasurers have continued to grapple with perennial concerns such as effective cash management and good forecasting. This is particularly pressing in the continuing low interest rate environment. Despite the Fed’s decision to increase interest rates at the end of 2015, other monetary authorities have not moved from the low rates introduced following the financial crisis. Interest rates remain at 0.25% in the UK, while Europe’s deposit rate was cut further to a record low of -0.4% in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many companies continue to hold high cash balances. In May, Moody’s reported that non-financial companies in the US were holding $1.7trn on their balance sheets. With interest rates on bank deposits still low, companies with significant excess balances are looking for other uses for their cash.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of surplus cash,” explains George Dessing, SVP, Treasury and Risk at Wolters Kluwer. “Capital allocation has been a high priority for us in 2016. We recently announced our intention to do an acquisition as we are continuously looking for opportunities to support our organic growth strategy, so we are keeping active on this front. In February, we also announced a three-year plan to buy back up to €600m of shares.”</p>
<p>In other cases, the focus is on extracting as much excess cash as possible by optimising working capital management processes. “Companies are not getting the returns on their deposits that they used to, so there’s a real need to try to squeeze cash out anywhere you can,” comments Jennifer Boussuge, Managing Director, Head of Global Transaction Services EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “This has been accompanied by advances in technology which are allowing companies to unlock previously inaccessible working  capital. This can have very real benefits: I know one treasurer who has been able to finance some smaller acquisitions by putting in place more efficient working capital management practices.”</p>
<p>Boussuge says that interest in managing working capital more effectively is on the rise, noting that some companies have appointed working capital management executives who report to the CFO and are at the same level as the treasurer. “These executives will look at all of the supply chains across the company, with the goal of squeezing cash out of the balance sheet,” she explains.</p>


<h3 id=""politicial-pressures"">Politicial pressures</h3>
<p>Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer of Greek food company Chipita, explains that the company has not been significantly affected by the political and macroeconomic pressures which have characterised 2016.</p>
<p>“Our headquarters is based in Greece, so we are conscious that the crisis is continuing to affect the Greek market,” says Polykrati. “But due to the global presence of the Group we haven’t seen any decrease in terms of sales. On the contrary, we have double digit increases in both sales and profitability, being mainly generated by the CEFTA/CEE region. The truth is that our core products – confectionary and croissants – are considered also as an “antidepressant” and even in the crisis it is a product that people always buy even when they are short of money, so we’ve actually seen a slight increase in our sales in the Greek market.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Polykrati has been paying close attention to developments further afield, such as the Brexit referendum and the upcoming elections in the United States. In the past, the company has only had a minor presence in the UK market, which has accounted for only a small percentage of total sales. More recently, however, Chipita opted to open a commercial company in the UK.</p>
<p>“We opened the new company just before the Brexit referendum took place,” Polykrati explains. “We haven’t seen any difference following the referendum – we sell our products from a market that is very competitive in terms of price, so even with the slight devaluation in GBP, the cost was internally absorbed, thus still being well positioned in the UK market.”</p>
<p>Where the US elections are concerned, Polykrati says she expects the outcome to be significant – but at this stage it is difficult to predict what the consequences will be. “We have a co-operation with a commercial company in the United States and we don’t really know what to expect,” she comments, “but we do continue with business as usual.”</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""innovation"">Innovation</h3>
<p>While treasurers have been facing considerable challenges this year, from the increased threat of fraud to choppy political waters, the technology available to meet their needs continues to develop and present new opportunities.</p>
<p>Some treasurers have been watching the arrival of enhanced solutions and improved functionalities with interest. “At the beginning of the year, we were planning to adopt a new treasury management system, but we haven’t yet managed to get all the necessary approvals internally,” says Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer of Chipita. “The delay has turned out to be a good thing though – I’ve noticed that there are new systems coming out offering better solutions and lower costs, so I have been reviewing all the systems that are now available.”</p>
<p>Where specific developments are concerned, FIS’ Bateman says that the last couple of years have seen a move to outsourcing the operation of applications. “The software as a service (SaaS) model has become very prevalent at the mid to low end of the market,” he explains. “Customers just want to consume functionality – they don’t want to have to worry about installing it and running it. That works well where you have a more standardised workflow and processes. Meanwhile, larger corporates are saying they want vendors not only to host applications, but also provide application management and managed upgrade services.”</p>
<p>Another topic which has developed over the last year relates to the rise of fintechs and the impact on banks. In the past, the focus of this topic has tended to be on the prospect of competition between banks and fintechs. However, there is some evidence that this has begun to shift, with the focus moving to collaboration.</p>
<p>“I think the discussion has moved on from disruption to how we partner,” comments Boussuge. “Fintechs are not regulated financial institutions and many of them don’t want to be. They realise that if we’re going after the same client sets, the banks already have the clients; they already have the rails, if you will, and they have complied with the regulatory environment. What these guys bring is the innovation. So we’re now figuring out how we come together, and that will increasingly be done through banks investing in this area and acquiring these digital capabilities.”</p>
<h4 id=""virtual-account-management"">Virtual account management</h4>
<p>Another area of development is virtual account management (VAM). “VAM tools enable the reconciliation of multiple accounts,” explains Boussuge. “Companies have a header account, which is the ‘actual’ bank account, with multiple layers of virtual accounts underneath. Different banks approach this in different ways – in our case we use IBANs as unique identifiers, so people can make payments into and out of their accounts.”</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is that each vendor can pay into a separate virtual account, making reconciliation much easier. Boussuge notes, “this was a new concept three years ago, but it’s really taken off – now every RFP that we see includes VAM.”</p>
<h4 id=""blockchain"">Blockchain</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, talk around the possibilities of blockchain has begun to translate into action. While most of the possible applications of blockchain remain unrealised at this point, some progress is starting to happen. Microsoft and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced in September that they are collaborating on a trade finance blockchain initiative designed to standardise processes relating to standby letters of credit. The same month, Barclays and technology start-up Wave also announced that they had become the first organisations to execute a global trade transaction using blockchain technology.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The last year has certainly had its share of difficulties: choppy political waters continue to make for an uncertain environment, while treasurers are increasingly focused on managing risks relating to cybercrime. In addition to these challenges, the pressure of complying with new and existing regulations continues to be a major focus for treasurers around the world. The scope of this issue is explored in more detail in <a href=""/2016/11/interview-matt-cornwall-capita-ttcv"">The Corporate View article</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside these issues, innovation and development continue across a range of treasury activities, providing new ways for treasurers to manage cash more efficiently. As we move into 2017, treasurers will be keeping a close eye on these opportunities – as well as remaining cognisant of the challenges.</p>


<h3 id=""managing-plastic-money"">Managing plastic money</h3>
<p>For Italian tourism company Alpitour, 2016 has seen a major focus on reviewing the technology used for the company’s receivables. With hotel bookings, plane tickets and vacation packages increasingly being sold on the internet, the company has been working to develop a new selling channel which can be used by all of the group’s divisions – namely a tour operating company, an airline charter company and a hotels division.</p>
<p>“Each business unit has its own selling target (B2C/B2B) and different ticket prices,” explains Enrico Rao, Alpitour’s Group Treasurer. “The payment instruments available on the site, the credit card acquirers and the infrastructure have been decided by the central treasury. Because we have different business units and different internet sites, we did not want to use different banking solutions – so the main idea is to manage plastic money in the same manner we manage the central treasury.”</p>
<p>Alpitour Group has therefore adopted an independent Payment Gateway to be used by all the relevant business units, linking group websites to the Payment Gateway for payments. Each company is able to view its real time transactions, upload data for accounting purposes and manage refunds.</p>
<p>“On the other side of the Payment Gateway, we can connect different credit card acquirers chosen by pricing conditions or alternative payment methods, such as MyBank or PayPal,” Rao adds.</p>
<p>Advantages of the solution include having a unique database of all group transactions, as well as a real-time view of the situation for each company. “We can also set a fraud prevention strategy customised by the needs of each entity – for example, specifying how many attempts for each card is fine for our risk standards,” says Rao.</p>
<p>“Finally, for managing plastic money we have sourced from concepts and instruments typically taken from treasury management – such as cash pooling, central payment factory and central treasury systems – in order to get the same advantages and centralisation we have already achieved in treasury.”</p>

<p><em>It is very interesting from a European or a US perspective to follow what the Bank of Japan does with regard to monetary policy, because the Japanese central bank is often a ‘testing ground’ for the Fed and the ECB. This is mainly because Japan has been battling low growth and the risk of deflation for much longer than the US and Europe.</em></p>
<p>In September, the Bank of Japan reversed its strategy with regard to monetary policy. There was every reason for this, because after the last time interest rates were reduced and the central bank had started purchasing more bonds and shares, the yen exchange rate increased and share prices declined. This is exactly the opposite of what the central bank intended to achieve. In addition, this easing of monetary policy has not led to far higher growth and/or inflation.</p>
<h3 id=""change-in-bank-of-japan-policy"">Change in Bank of Japan policy</h3>
<p>On 21<sup>st</sup> September, the Bank of Japan adjusted its policy as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instead of a fixed amount of bond purchases every month, purchases will now be coordinated in such a way that interest rates on ten-year Japanese government bonds will remain around 0% (bonds with a longer maturity should have positive interest rates). The central bank furthermore intends to get the yield curve as steep as possible. This means that the Bank of Japan will allow itself to be entirely led by market circumstances in its decision regarding how many bonds and with what maturity it will purchase. It does foresee that, for the time being, this will mean the total of bonds that will be purchased will not differ significantly from what has been the case so far. In addition, short-term interest rates will remain at -0.1%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inflation target has been increased from 2% to above 2%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To start with the latter, the Bank of Japan aims to push down real long-term interest rates by lifting inflation. Indeed, this should basically be favourable for asset prices and, moreover, negative interest rates ensure that there is a shift in purchasing power from creditors to debtors. In other words, this is a means of reducing the weight of the debt burden for people who have borrowed money. The only problem is that, despite the fact it is a good plan to increase the inflation target, inflation has remained below the 2% target for years on end. Why would it suddenly exceed this level?</p>
<p>The question is also to what extent it helps the Bank of Japan to keep ten-year interest rates around 0% and keep those with an even longer maturity above this level. One can hardly speak of a steep yield curve now, with short-term interest rates at -0.1% and ten-year interest rates at approximately 0%. The central bank could therefore at least have reduced short-term interest rates further. Indeed, the intention of the steeper yield curve is to make it easier for banks to be profitable, resulting in more credit supply. However, the problem is of course that the further short-term interest rates are reduced, the more difficult it will be to keep interest rates with a maturity above ten years above 0%. This is necessary to ensure matters are not made too difficult for pension funds and insurers.</p>
<h3 id=""ineffective-monetary-policy-needs-help-from-governments"">Ineffective monetary policy needs help from governments</h3>
<p>So at first sight the change in policy does not seem to amount to much. This will change drastically once the government applied further fiscal stimulus on a large scale. The government would then have to issue far more bonds to fund this, which would normally push up all interest rates. However, the central bank currently promises it will keep short-term interest rates negative and ten-year interest rates at approximately 0%. This would then require far more extensive purchases by the central bank. Moreover, increasing the public deficit means that the additional money creation ends up almost directly with consumers. It is not a pure form of ‘helicopter money’, but it does come close. Hence, it would also become realistic in this case to assume higher inflation (expectations). The economy would then immediately also receive an extra boost in the form of lower real interest rates.</p>
<p>It is nevertheless only a short while ago that the government presented a fiscal stimulus package. At first sight, this seemed to involve massive amounts, but further inspection of the details revealed the package was actually very disappointing. This is why the financial markets only reacted to this briefly, subsequently dismissing it. Upon the announcement of this package, it was already known that monetary stimulus had lost a great deal of its strength. It was hoped at the time the government would present a robust programme in order to finally drag the economy out of the doldrums. But this ultimately turned out to be very disappointing. This is why the markets are now wondering to what extent the situation has changed in the meantime. That fiscal stimulus was disappointing last time because there was insufficient support to do more (in Japan there are great concerns about public finances spinning out of control, and many economist would prefer to see structural reforms). Are things different now? So far there are only few signs policymakers who have a different view in this regard. So as long as this remains the case, the change in strategy by the Bank of Japan does not exactly represent a sea change.</p>
<p>It is therefore understandable that, for example, USD/JPY initially increased significantly but at the same day fell back even faster. This immediately demonstrates that the initiative should now lie with policymakers. The central bank has made it clear that the old route of monetary stimulus can no longer be used to stimulate the economy. However, if substantial fiscal stimulus were to be applied, monetary policy would be able to add to this. This would enable the central bank to prevent interest rates from increasing, with inflation actually increasing. The resulting lower real interest rates would give the economy an additional boost. So it remains to be seen for the time being whether Japanese policymakers ‘pick up the ball and score’.</p>
<h3 id=""end-of-low-volatility-period"">End of low volatility period?</h3>
<p>In other words, central banks show they remain determined to push up inflation and pressure down real interest rates. However, they need the help of fiscal policy to succeed and central banks do everything to convince governments to do more fiscally. Until now, interest rates and currency markets have been very stable in the past year as most central banks applied a close to zero percent interest rate policy and quantitative easing. But we expect more volatility once governments increase fiscal stimulus measures, as we foresee that the timing and the scale of fiscal stimulus will vary greatly from country to country.</p>
<p>We expect that the new US president (Trump more so than Hillary) will be the first to increase fiscal stimulus substantially. European governments will struggle, as there are great differences in opinion about the best way to stimulate the economy. Germany and other stronger European Monetary Union (EMU) countries favour structural reforms and more fiscal stimulus in countries which, according to the Growth and Stability Pact, have latitude to do so.</p>
<p>The weaker EMU countries prefer much more fiscal policy, either at the national level or at the European level. But Germany will likely oppose this, as more fiscal stimulus at the national level will increase the already high debt levels in the weaker countries, leading to another euro-crisis, while large-scale and debt financed fiscal stimulus at the European level amount to a de facto fiscal union. Without some guarantees that German taxpayers will not be liable for losses on the debt, Germany will likely not approve this. This is negative for the euro and positive for the US dollar. Furthermore, if indeed the new US government is the first to enact large-scale fiscal stimulus, this would have upward pressure on US interest rates and on US economic growth, further increasing the attractiveness of the US dollar.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>What will be the big issues for corporate treasurers in the year ahead? We examine a number of key economic, regulatory and market trends and consider how each of these might influence treasurers’ decisions around raising finance, risk management and short-term investments in the future.</em></p>
<p>Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s Managing Director, rather succinctly summed up the economic predicament we now find ourselves in during a speech earlier this year in Germany. “The good news,” she told the audience, “is that the recovery continues; we have growth; we are not in a crisis. The not-so-good news is that the recovery remains slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing.”</p>
<p>Some of those risks alluded to by Lagarde certainly became manifest over the summer of 2016. Economic sentiment, which had been on a moderate upward trend earlier in the year, ground to a halt in nearly all regions as concerns over the UK’s vote to leave the European Union (EU) and the slowdown in Asia weighed on international markets. Overall, confidence in the global economic outlook is now at its lowest level in three years, according to an August 2016 survey by the Munich-based Ifo Institute.</p>
<p>One small comfort to corporate treasurers as they begin planning for 2017 might be that not every economist believes the cloudy post-Brexit economic outlook will necessarily prove long-lasting. The US economy, still the world’s largest in nominal terms, continues to grow steadily. Concerns that the US might be nearing a downturn have now abated after a string of positive economic data. “Before the good job numbers came out I was quite worried about the outlook for the global economy,” Mike Bell, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan, tells Treasury Today. “Profits were weak, and typically when there’s weak profit growth companies will look to cut back on hiring. But with the numbers we saw in June, it looks like the US economy is still in a relatively healthy condition. That gives me a lot of confidence that – in the short term – the global economy is not going to be in too bad shape.”</p>
<p>Over the other side of the Atlantic, the consensus is that the UK vote to leave the EU should not derail the Eurozone’s economic recovery. Indeed, it would appear that the slow economic recovery has at least weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, with recent data showing business activity reaching its highest level in seven months. “It is likely to shave up to half a percent off European GDP, which will take growth down to about 1.3%,” says Bell. “That’s pretty weak, but it’s not a recession.”</p>
<p>But the Brexit negotiations will certainly be headwind for the EU economy in the years ahead, even if the near-term and medium-term macroeconomic impacts are largely contained. The UK is the EU’s single largest export market in goods, if we treat the UK as if it were already outside the union. Any post-Brexit downturn in the UK will inevitably have consequences for the EU and UK economic outlook, therefore. But Bell believes the business impact will not be as severe as some commentators fear. “Our view is that the uncertainty around Brexit is going to hit the UK economy quite hard, and that in turn will affect European growth via the trade channel,” says Bell. “It doesn’t necessarily play too bad for large cap corporates however. If you look at the FTSE 100, many of those companies earn a majority of their revenues outside of the UK, and they could even benefit if we see sterling fall further.”</p>
<p>Of course, the revenues those companies are earning outside of the UK might come under pressure too. Brexit has brought a fresh spell of economic turmoil about, not only in Europe, but throughout the world. China, where a downturn raises the prospect of much weaker growth across the world, is no exception. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index fell and the Chinese yuan depreciated against the US dollar in the immediate aftermath of the UK referendum result. But while Brexit certainly presents an additional headwind for an economy already slowing down, treasurers will be relieved to hear that Bell believes the gloom around the prospects for China has been overdone somewhat.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy, he says, has stabilised in 2016. If anything, growth and other economic figures have actually surprised on the upside. “That is the result of the stimulus: the government is spending to support the economy and that, combined with interest rate cuts, has helped to stabilise the economy,” says Bell. “But since that stimulus is likely to be pulled back slightly now, China GDP may be a bit weaker over the next few months. Nevertheless, the growth we expect to see – around 6% – is nowhere near the scare scenarios some would have you believe.”</p>
<h3 id=""lower-for-longer"">Lower for longer</h3>
<p>That the global economy appears to still be recovering at a steady pace does not mean markets are expecting any imminent changes in monetary policy. With the fragility of the recovery and the risks to its durability that Lagarde spoke of, it would appear unlikely the world’s central banks will opt to take a radically new course in the immediate future.</p>
<p>In the US, the benign price pressures that have allowed the Federal Reserve to postpone a further rate rise all year remain unchanged. In July, the Consumer Price Index came in at 0.8% on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, still some way off the level that would precipitate a further rate rise from the Fed. However, Bell’s view is that inflation could pick up sufficiently in the fourth quarter to put a rate hike by the end of the year on the cards, albeit a very cautious rise. “We think inflation is going to start to pick up, almost on a national basis. So long as the dollar doesn’t strengthen dramatically, then the fact that the oil price is up from its $28 should translate into higher inflation. At that point, if the labour market is still looking healthy, then the Fed starts to run out of excuses.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, however, ‘lower for longer’ seems likely. Following its historic decision in August 2016 to lower rates to 0.25%, the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to cut interest rates again this year. Alongside the first interest rate cut in seven years, the BoE also unveiled a package of other stimulus measures, including restarting its quantitative easing programme to buy government and corporate debt. Policymakers at the central bank have signalled that this could be just the beginning. “If the economy proves to have turned down in line with the initial survey signals, I believe that more easing is likely to be required, but that can easily be delivered in the coming months,” Ian McCafferty, an external member of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee wrote in an Op-Ed for The Times newspaper in August 2016.</p>
<p>The BoE’s decision to cut UK interest rates to a record low has put the European Central Bank (ECB) under pressure to follow suit with more monetary easing of its own. Yet many economists are of the view that the ECB has much monetary policy firepower left to bring inflation back to its target level. Although ECB President Mario Draghi has hinted that the bank is ready to ease policy again if needed, the consensus that emerged from a recent Reuters poll of economists is that the negative policy rate will remain unchanged until the end of 2017. Only a handful of the economists surveyed said they were expecting a further cut into negative territory. However, the central bank is widely expected to extend its monthly asset purchases programme beyond its original termination date of March 2017.</p>
<h3 id=""financing-outlook"">Financing outlook</h3>
<p>Given that it is likely to be a very long time before we see interest rates approaching anywhere near the pre-crisis levels, financing conditions for most corporates – especially investment-grade – should remain fairly benign over the course of the medium term at least.</p>
<p>That is perhaps just as well when one considers the size of the maturity wall coming further down the line. In the US, a record $947bn of high-yield debt is scheduled to mature in the next five years, a recent report by Moody’s estimates. Of that total, $400bn is set to come due in 2020 alone, the highest amount of rated debt to ever mature in a single year in the history of the credit markets. The telecommunications, technology and media sectors are currently carrying the heaviest debt burdens. However, the recent collapse in oil prices has damaged the refinancing prospects of companies across the energy sector, especially upstream exploration and production companies. Energy-related issuers in the Baa3 band – just one notch above junk – are of particular concern to the ratings agency, and are said to have around $34bn in debt maturing in the next five years.</p>
<p>European borrowers are facing their own enormous maturity wall. There is currently €345bn worth of European leveraged loans and high-yield bonds up for refinancing between now and 2022. Although much has been made of previous maturity walls which have subsequently been overcome through amend and extend, some market experts believe that is unlikely to happen this time around given the volatility we are seeing in the market. “We still expect some borrowers may end up requiring a more fundamental restructuring given the level of leverage, which has been perpetuated by the benign credit conditions of the last few years,” PwC wrote in a recent research note.</p>
<p>Diverging monetary policy could make the ‘reverse Yankee’ – a US company issuing euro-denominated debt – yet more attractive for companies that require financing. American companies have already flocked to Europe’s bond markets to borrow at rock bottom rates, and with the ECB now engaged in the purchase of corporate bonds, pulling down costs even more, others may yet join them. A stronger dollar does add, of course, some cost to converting euros back to dollars. But companies with significant euro denominated cash flows have a natural hedge against such unfavourable exchange rate movements. No wonder, then, that foreign companies have been the biggest issuers of euro-denominated corporate bonds, with a 21.3% share, according to data from Dealogic.</p>
<p>Corporate bond issuance is also surging in sterling following the BoE’s recent stimulus package. Since the stimulus was unveiled, sterling corporate bond yields have fallen to a record low of 2.06%, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indices. This has led to a flurry of companies – including the likes of Vodafone, BP and BMW – to issue in the currency given the reduction we have seen in the sterling premium over euro-denominated investment grade corporate credit since the EU referendum.</p>
<h3 id=""foreign-exchange-outlook"">Foreign exchange outlook</h3>
<p>Currency strategists drawing up their predictions of the year ahead largely agree on some broad themes – the US dollar will get stronger, emerging market currencies will – despite recent gains – remain fragile, and the sterling exchange rate will continue to be very volatile as the Brexit negotiations proceed.</p>
<p>On the latter, Sam Hewson, MD and Northern Europe Head of Corporate FX sales at CitiFX, notes that amid all the current macroeconomic and political uncertainty, a top priority for corporates will be mitigating the impact of sterling volatility on the predictability of their cash flows. Switching hedging instruments used for sterling exposures might be helpful in that respect.</p>
<p>“We have seen an increasing use of options,” Hewson says. “There is a lot of uncertainty around the future trade deal that the UK is going to negotiate with the EU. That is going to have implications for a lot of corporates cash flows from an export and import perspective. So you are going to have some degree of uncertainty of cash flow and, if you have uncertainty of cash flows, then forwards become less favourable as a hedging tool. Treasurers could end up in a situation – as per 2008 – when they are having to unwind forwards at significant cost against a cash flow that never occurred.”</p>
<p>Hewson says options strategies might also be useful for hedgers at risk of exhausting their maximum available credit lines with their banks as exposures increase. “Options don’t require any credit,” he says. “So for treasurers who are having challenges from a credit line perspective, options are a way they can continue their hedging. We have definitely seen more of that.”</p>

<p>Although CitiFX was engaged in many discussions with clients in the run up to the referendum, FX activity on the actual day of the vote was rather muted. Many treasurers proactively moved settlements so that they would not be executing in an illiquid market close to the date of the referendum. But while that proved a very effective strategy for some, more fundamental changes may need to be made given that market conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“We are talking to our clients about their hedge ratios and asking them to consider whether their risk management policies are fit for purpose in this volatile environment,” Hewson adds. “Liquidity is low right now, so we are also encouraging treasurers to look at their execution methodologies. We regularly have these types of discussions with clients, but they have been brought to the fore more since the referendum, given the magnitude of the move we saw.”</p>
<h3 id=""investment-outlook"">Investment outlook</h3>
<p>Industry experts believe that conditions in liquidity markets will remain challenged in the year ahead, for both regulatory and market reasons. In the US, reforms to Rule 2a-7, approved in 2014, mean that come October 2016 prime institutional MMFs must abandon the practice of fixing share prices to $1 and move to a variable net asset value (VNAV) model, be subject to liquidity gates and redemption fees at the Board’s discretion. Government funds, meanwhile, will be able to continue using a stable net asset value (CNAV) model.</p>
<p>With the new rules due to take effect in October, there has been much speculation on the small matter of whether corporate treasurers – many of whom prefer CNAV MMFs – will opt to abandon prime MMFs in favour of government CNAV MMFs. That is not a baseless claim. Indeed, all the latest survey data, together with what we are already seeing in the market, suggests many treasurers are planning – and indeed doing – exactly that.</p>
<p>A majority of the finance professionals (62%) recently surveyed in the AFP 2016 Liquidity Survey, for instance, said they are anticipating their organisations to make significant changes in their approach to investing as a result of the new rules, with nearly half (47%) expecting their companies to discontinue or reduce holdings in prime funds. The exodus appears to already be underway. In June Moody’s observed signs of a spike in outflows from MMFs driven, it says, by investors “voting with their feet”. It is a trend that they expect to continue between now and the October deadline for funds to comply with the new SEC rules.</p>
<p>But Bob Stark, Vice President of Strategy at treasury software providers Kyriba is not convinced that this shift away from prime to government funds will be especially long-lived. Stark points out that the two most commonly cited priorities for institutional investors in MMFs – security and liquidity – should not be materially affected by the new rules. Although prime MMFs will henceforth be subject to redemption fees and liquidity gates he thinks it is doubtful that we will ever see these implemented.</p>
<p>“Many fund providers argue that gates temporarily halting fund redemptions would not have been required in 2008,” he says. “If there was a time in recent history that one would expect to see such behaviour it would have been during the onset of the credit crisis.”</p>
<p>The security element of the value proposition for prime MMFs will not be diminished as a result of the reforms. Actually, we could see the opposite. “The composition of prime funds won’t suddenly become riskier on 15<sup>th</sup> October than the days leading up to it,” he says. “In fact, an argument could be made that fund companies may choose even more conservative underlying assets to smooth the movement of the fund’s net asset value.”</p>


<blockquote>Uncertainties around Brexit and the lack of comparable investment alternatives have kept investors in money market funds. Lower investor confidence and higher risk aversion could cause corporate investments to be postponed, leading to inflows into low-risk, highly liquid assets such as MMFs.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Though the EU began drafting its new rules at broadly the same time as the SEC, procedural differences between the two regulators has meant that progress in Europe has been less expedient than in the US. In June 2016, the Council of the EU agreed its position on MMF regulation, building upon both the original proposal of European Commission (EC), and the position of the European Parliament (EP). This latest text retained some notable aspects of the EP’s position. The text proposes that CNAV MMFs can continue to operate only by investing in public debt or – as proposed by the EP – by converting to a new, still hypothetical product, called a low volatility (LVNAV) MMF. Whereas the EP’s text included a five-year ‘sunset clause’ for LVNAV MMFs, the Council instead proposed an open-ended review of the product within five years. Also in accordance with the EP, the Council chose not to back the EC’s widely criticised proposal of a 3% capital buffer for CNAV MMFs.</p>
<p>The other tectonic force affecting the MMF industry in Europe at the moment is the rate environment. Accommodative monetary policies pursued by central banks – not least the ECB – have pushed down yields on the short-term debt instruments that MMFs purchase, making it increasingly difficult for fund managers to generate positive returns for their investors. With no directional change in policy at the ECB appearing to be on the cards in the near future, and still more central banks like the BoE now believed to be considering following suit, it would seem that negative yields are here to stay.</p>
<p>The risk of large redemptions by corporate treasurers unwilling to stomach ‘paying’ a fund to hold their assets would appear to be minimal though. “Uncertainties around Brexit and the lack of comparable investment alternatives have kept investors in money market funds,” says Vanessa Robert, Senior Credit Officer at Moody’s. “Lower investor confidence and higher risk aversion could cause corporate investments to be postponed, leading to inflows into low-risk, highly liquid assets such as MMFs.”</p>

<p>Many corporate finance departments are likely to continue to be challenged by the rapidly evolving macroeconomic climate in the year ahead. Beyond the reaction to the Fed’s expected rate decision later this year, there are a host of external developments that will continue to shape the world that treasurers have to operate in over the coming years.</p>
<p>While corporate treasurers can draw some comfort from the fact that the recovery is continuing, they should also be wary of the fact that it remains, as the IMF’s Christine Lagarde highlighted in her speech, in an extremely ‘fragile’ condition. Lagarde spoke that day of how the “risks to [the recovery’s] durability are increasing” and, indeed, since then we have seen just how vulnerable the economic outlook currently is to political shocks such as the Brexit vote.</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers, that most probably means they can expect more of the same in terms of an ultra-low to negative interest rate environment. On the one hand, then, the favourable borrowing conditions treasurers have enjoyed through the post-crisis years will continue. But on the other, a difficult short-term investment climate characterised by a dearth of yield will also persist. “For every snake, there is a ladder,” as Salman Rushdie once wrote, and “for every ladder, a snake.”</p>


","What will be the big issues for corporate treasurers in the year ahead? We examine a number of key economic, regulatory and market trends and consider how each of these might influence treasurers’ decisions around raising finance, risk management and short-term investments in the future.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/market-insight/2016-09-10-tt-16-so__snakes-and-ladders-board-game-459280120__1920x1080.jpg,2016-09-01,Market Insight,False
What’s on the agenda? The big talking points of 2017,"

<p><em>Treasury Foresights has explored some of the dominant issues on the treasurers’ agenda in the year ahead. Here we ask a selection of industry experts to run through what they believe will be the big talking points of 2017 and what will be their primary areas of focus.</em></p>
<h5>Damian Glendinning, Treasurer, Lenovo</h5>
<p>“I actually don’t believe in special focus areas. If you have the right basic structure and approach, your system should be able to deal with most things which life throws at it. But I am concerned that currency hedging will become more difficult and expensive, as some of the new regulations start to have an impact. This can take the form of non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) becoming even more expensive and harder to price, or it can be a lack of liquidity in the deliverable market. I hope we will see progress on pain points such as know your customer (KYC), and some exciting new progress in fintech. I do not expect boredom to be an issue…”</p>
<h5>Guillermo Gualino, Vice President and Treasurer, Agilent</h5>
<p>“Similar to last year, Agilent Treasury will continue aligning its priorities to those of the business to support growth, geography expansion and profitability in 2017. However, our main focus will be on re-positioning the group’s risk management activities for elevated economic and political uncertainty. Specifically, we will improve hedging performance by increasing natural hedges, expand visibility of cash and exposures by achieving further centralisation, and improve our agility to deal with volatility spikes through further team cross-functionality.</p>
<p>Our ultimate objective will be to increase flexibility across functions because it has become increasingly challenging to forecast and quantify risk as the current uncertainties are driven by the breakage of long-established economic and financial relationships. We have been preparing by streamlining treasury operations, upgrading banking technology, reducing exposures, restructuring FX programmes, and training more team members as generalists in multiple treasury disciplines.”</p>
<h5>Simon Jones, Managing Director, Head of Treasury Solutions, Treasury Services EMEA, J.P. Morgan</h5>
<p>“Regulatory, economic and technological drivers are changing the shape of banking. As we move into 2017, traditional foundations will continue to shift. To thrive in this new environment, treasurers should particularly focus on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understanding the regulatory drivers that are necessitating change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaping an investment policy that is adaptable and fit for purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working more closely with internal functions and banking partners to understand the evolving payments landscape and to drive business growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring flexibility and scalability within their bank account and liquidity structures.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>François Masquelier, Senior Vice President, Head of Treasury and Enterprise Risk Management, RTL Group</h5>
<p>“My department has finalised its annual treasury roadmap for next year. The main focuses will be on Treasury Business Intelligence and how to best automate reporting and aggregate (big) treasury data coming from multiple IT (and non IT) sources into usable dashboards and KPI’s to measure our performances. Another objective would be to finalise the review of Transfer Pricing (TP) to comply with BEPS’ new provisions and to assess IFRS 9 impacts and more specifically the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) aspect of this.</p>
<p>Eventually, we will also keep rolling-out our Bank Single Gateway project, including a few major eBAM messages, wallet sizing and new e-payment methods. We still have as major objective to enhance internal controls by further automating tasks and reports, by revisiting processes (eg EMIR, payments and portfolio reconciliations) and fulfilling IT general control reviews on main IT systems. The current economic context and volatile markets, combined with pressure on costs and limited (human) resources make our task even more complicated. On the soft skills side, we have worked on the team agility to be able to cope with the fast coming challenges in the treasury function.”</p>
<h5>Tim de Knegt, Manager Strategic Finance &amp; Treasury, Havenbedrijf Rotterdam</h5>
<p>“The treasury function in general should become more aligned with business operations and objectives; given the current climate around financing, interest rates, other economic indicators and monetary policies, this is even more apparent than it was just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Our view of risk has fundamentally shifted. From being focused on transaction and counterparty credit risk, we must now also consider how long an industry will last, in particular, sectors based on traditional energy sources. This is something that has not been on the radar until now. In general, the lifespan of markets has become less predictable and, given the current speed of technological development, are expected to be rather shorter going forward. This has an effect on risk appetite. Until recently we were able to predict quite well for at least the next two or three decades. But now, with changing government policies, volatile markets and the commitments of last year’s UN Climate Change Conference and the recent G20 summit in Hangzhou, the outlook is continuously changing.</p>
<p>The Port of Rotterdam is still expanding and as the type of parties interested in the port area is necessarily changing, so too is the type of financial support clients are looking for, both from our side as well as from financial institutions. Treasury will play an important role here as we have a good overview and appreciation of port activities from an economic perspective enabling us to help financial institutions understand the risks involved. We can also use our knowledge of financial products to help enhance the commercial proposition.</p>
<p>The focus on energy transition, innovation – and the digitisation of industries – means we are adopting new business models too. As a port, our current business is fully dependent on volume-driven supply chains, but we are moving towards a more value-driven business model. Today, we have a pilot project, running to the end of this year, based on transparent, holistic trade finance. If the entire trade cycle is financed as a single project, not as individual components, and all parties in the chain have access to each other’s data, it could make huge savings for our clients. If we get the right results from the pilot, we hope to open it up to overseas trade in the coming year.”</p>
<h5>Kate Smedley, Group Treasurer, 2 Sisters Food Group</h5>
<p>“The main focus for 2017 is where the debt capital markets are post Brexit and continued focus on cash flow forecasting as a key tool for the Board and developing staff within the team.”</p>
<h5>Jean-François Denis, Deputy Head of Cash Management, BNP Paribas</h5>
<p>“The ever-more intertwined relationship between finance and technology will be the top focus area for the corporate treasurer in 2017. Having made a disruptive entry in the retail space, fintechs are all set to enter the complex, transactional banking market, albeit in collaborations with banks. Transaction banks themselves are cooperating with each other in initiatives like SWIFT Global Payments Initiative (GPI), which in 2017 is likely to focus on business-to-business payments. Increasing cyber-criminality will likewise require special attention from corporate treasurers. Along with enhanced compliance and staff training regimes, big data and Artificial Intelligence should be seriously considered as deterrence mechanisms against cybercrime.”</p>
<h5>Charley Edwards, Assistant Treasurer, Informa</h5>
<p>“Next year our main focus will be to implement a new TMS. We are currently undergoing a global implementation of a single instance of SAP across the group and when this has gone live we want to implement a new TMS that can support us as we become a more efficient and sophisticated treasury function. A second focus will be to repatriate ‘trapped’ cash from regions such as China and other emerging markets. Our operations in China generate cash flow and we’re keen to access this and bring it back to the centre.”</p>
<h5>Matt Cornwall, Deputy Treasurer, Capita</h5>
<p>“At Capita we have an entrepreneurial philosophy that is focused on developing ideas that will enable us to perform our duties quicker and with more accuracy. As such our focus has been and will continue to be based around driving continuous improvement throughout the treasury department.</p>
<p>This is especially important at Capita as part of the culture within the company is very M&amp;A focussed and growing in size overseas bringing in new complexities and risk. Streamlining processes, standardisation and straight through processing is therefore something that we will continue to place a high emphasis on to ensure that these risks are mitigated and to free up resources within the team to focus on more value-added work.</p>
<p>External help is needed to do this, of course, and we will be continuing to push our banking partners to provide us with the technology and services that we require to meet our objectives..”</p>
<h5>Karen Van den Driessche, Treasury Director EMEA, Avnet</h5>
<p>“The Avnet treasury organisation will continue to partner with our business divisions to support them in their growth targets, efficiency improvement and M&amp;A integration while maintaining our focus on unparalleled execution.</p>
<p>Treasury’s focus will be on stabilising the recently implemented Treasury Management System and Asia Pacific (APAC) in-house bank structure, reaping the benefits from it through centralised execution, increased cash visibility and the publishing and tracking of key metrics to support better business decisions and execution.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will be working on improved risk management, specifically our APAC foreign exchange, further standardisation and centralisation while executing cross regional and functional training to ensure we are a truly, effective global team to support the increased challenges that lay ahead of us brought on by increased globalisation of our business.”</p>
<h5>Royston Da Costa, Group Assistant Treasurer, Treasury Systems and Development, Wolseley</h5>
<p>“Wolseley treasury is committed to supporting its diverse businesses globally, and as part of this service, we are currently rolling out a cloud based treasury management solution (TMS), Bellin. We expect this to not only provide our group with the tools to enhance their treasury processes like regulatory reporting and cash visibility, but also enable us to have greater oversight of the whole group’s treasury activity in one system eg bank accounts, facilities and guarantees.</p>
<p>The focus, as we move into 2017, will be on developing the use of our system to improve cash forecasting, automating payment connectivity, and continuing to increase the support we can offer our group. There are a few areas aside from the TMS, that we will also be focussing on like working capital optimisation, merchant card acquiring, and liquidity management.”</p>

<p><em>The global economy faces an uphill struggle in the months, and years, to come. But, in the words of the late, great Muhammad Ali: “It isn’t the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it’s the pebble in your shoe.”</em></p>
<h3 id=""muhammad-ali"">Muhammad Ali</h3>
<p>The greatest champion of all times passed away in June, following an exhausting fight against Parkinson’s. Considering the recent developments and the obstacles on the road ahead, it looks as if the global economy also faces an epic struggle to keep growth going, let alone boost it. On the long and winding road up the mountain, many countries are not so much hampered by pebbles in their shoes as by huge debt and populist burdens on their backs.</p>
<p>In the US it became clear that Donald Trump will be the presidential candidate representing the Republican party. His opponent will go by the name of Hillary Clinton. Neither candidate is universally popular but we think the prospect of a Trump victory will unnerve the markets more. Now we know the outcome of the EU referendum in Britain, chances of a Trump win will be taken more seriously.</p>
<h3 id=""i-shook-up-the-world"">I shook up the world</h3>
<p>Although we are not sure if the eulogy for the EU can already be written, Brexit is not just a big blow to the UK and the EU but to the whole concept of globalisation and to mainstream politicians everywhere in the West.</p>
<p>The British have shown the world that no matter how many politicians, economists, historians and other experts warn for apocalyptic results of a decision, many voters don’t care about the experts’ opinion anymore. They have made very clear that if anything, a very large part of the electorate views experts not as wise, educated men and women whose advice and insights should be heeded, but as hacks who are part of a cosy establishment just trying to keep in place the order that has given them the opportunity to become to be seen as experts in the first place.</p>
<p>In other words, the so-called experts were painted as self-serving elites who were just trying to scaremonger people into voting Remain. After the world suffered the biggest daily loss of global equity markets ever, the British leave voter could justifiably and rightly repeat Ali’s words: “I shook up the world. I shook up the world.”</p>
<h3 id=""disunited-kingdom"">Disunited Kingdom</h3>
<p>How the divorce will be handled remains to be seen but it will undoubtedly be a tortuous process as the UK is divided to the bone. There are gaping gaps between young and old, poor and rich, London and the rest of the UK. England/Wales and Northern Ireland/Scotland are in opposing camps while voters are increasingly estranged from politics. For example, the generational cleavage is blindingly obvious: 75% of the 18-24 year olds voted Remain while 61% of the 65-year-olds and over opted for Leave. And don’t forget the ocean dividing politicians and the population: two-thirds of the British MPs were in favour of staying inside the EU. Representative democracy has clearly taken a great hit.</p>
<p>The first big casualty of the vote result was Prime Minister David Cameron, who will resign. This doesn’t automatically mean that the British will have to go to the voting booths again to vote for a new government. The Tories will have a leadership election and could continue to govern until the next elections in 2020 if they would like to do so after having named a new PM.</p>
<p>There’s one caveat: elections can be held early if a supermajority (two-thirds) of British Parliament supports a vote of no confidence and parliamentarians don’t succeed in forming a new government. The takeaway here is that there won’t just be lots of uncertainty pertaining to the relation between the UK and the EU, the UK itself will be in for a long period of insecurity too.</p>
<h3 id=""european-dominos"">European dominos?</h3>
<p>This splintering process will not be reversed any time soon. Moreover, the conventional wisdom that people vote with their wallets has been turned upside down. Most people admitted that they believe that a vote to leave would hurt them financially, but they went on to choose the exit anyway. This will make sitting politicians in other countries very nervous. Economics isn’t the only game in town anymore when it comes to political success. But it still is a very important game. The most worrying is that compared to many other EU states, the UK economy has been doing quite well. So if British voters are already angry, it must be even worse in many other parts of the EU. Those political and economic frustrations will translate into pressure on other EU states to hold a referendum.</p>
<p>Although we do not think these will take place in the near term, political discord and uncertainty are rife. In Spain, two elections in the space of six months have shown that the old two-party system is dead and it remains to be seen if the new government can offer stable and coherent guidance through these insecure times. Over in Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s position is at risk following disastrous local elections while a referendum will be held in October on changes to the electoral system. Renzi has thrown in his lot with the outcome.</p>
<h3 id=""glimmers-of-hope-in-sea-of-darkness"">Glimmers of hope in sea of darkness</h3>
<p>How about other parts of the global economy? Will they compensate for Europe’s troubles and the danger of a Trump presidency in the US? At the time you are reading this article, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party has probably succeeded in winning the elections for half of the seats in the Japanese Upper House.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean to say that Abe will run a tight economic ship. His party may gradually unwind the monetary component of the famed three-arrow-policy (Abenomics) due to growing criticism of the Bank of Japan and there is the continuing risk of Abe shifting his attention to his nationalist agenda.</p>
<p>There are some political glimmers of hope in Latin America where ‘super populism’ appears to be making way for ‘normal populism’. Developments in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba could be beneficial to the markets. Yet, we do not see the continent making quick progress on reforming their political and economic systems, which means that economic growth could pick up as confidence in Brazil, Argentina and others gradually return, but it will not be enough to compensate for troubles elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id=""what-does-not-kill-you"">What does not kill you...</h3>
<p>Coming back to Europe, the response to the Brexit vote will probably not be of one Europe pulling itself together and strengthening Europe in areas that can only be tackled jointly. For such a united approach, divisions within Europe are simply too large and there remain too many unknowns.</p>
<p>From a political point of view this means more headwinds for the Eurozone and thus a weaker euro and probably larger spreads between the interest rate spreads between German bonds and those of the euro periphery countries. The other side of this coin is that we can continue to expect a flight to traditional safe haven currencies, particularly the US dollar (notwithstanding the Trump threat) and to a lesser extent the Japanese yen and Swiss franc.</p>
<p>The global economy has been through a lot of change in recent years and grey clouds continue to hang over the markets. Let us take heart from Ali’s words to end with an upbeat perspective: “Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes to win.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Despite mountains of academic literature, clear evidence of corporate performance, and professional investor behaviour, firms are often managed – and employeesrewarded – for accounting results. Why is cash flow so neglected?</em></p>
<p>When I started my career in treasury, my boss at the time had the quote “cash is reality; profit a matter of opinion” on the wall behind his desk. Having recently qualified in audit, I both understood the joke and also the truth of the quote.</p>
<p>As a treasurer, and therefore obsessed with cash, I might be accused of bias in the matter. But reams of academic literature bolstered by extensive research on corporate performance, as well as the behaviour of professional investors, make it very clear that cash really is what matters.</p>
<p>And this has been proven both in practice and theory. Management consultancy firm Stern Stewart, for instance, has conducted studies that show that those firms which use economic value added (EVA) performed almost four times as well as the market in general (EVA uses twenty year total shareholder return, 220% compared to the market’s 67%). To paraphrase SAP, the best firms manage cash flow.</p>
<h3 id=""why-cash-matters"">Why cash matters</h3>
<p>A recent Economist article on the history of business analysis puts it very clearly (emphasis added):</p>
<p>“Valuation, and a few books like it, offered new tools. Cash flow, not easy-to-manipulate accounting profit, mattered. An activity only made sense if capital employed by it made a decent return, judged by its cash flow relative to a hurdle rate (the risk-adjusted return its providers of capital expected).</p>
<p>“Optical changes to accounting profits don’t matter; cash flow does (a lesson WorldCom and Enron ignored). Leverage boosts headline rates of return but, reciprocally, raises risks (as Lehman found). Buy-backs do not create value, just transfer it between shareholders. Takeovers make sense only if the value of synergies exceeds the premium paid (as Valeant discovered). Pay packages that reward boosts to earnings-per-share and short-term share-price pops are silly.”</p>
<p>McKinsey’s base model for valuation analysis and performance management is Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), which like EVA forces a focus on cash flow. Their conclusions are the same as those of the Economist, as a recent article on how share repurchases boost earnings without improving returns highlights (emphasis added):</p>
<p>“The empirical evidence disproves this. For while there appears to be a correlation between total return to shareholders (TRS) and earning per share (EPS) growth, little of that is due to share repurchases. Much of it can be attributed to revenue and total earnings growth – and especially to ROIC, which determines how much cash flow a company generates for a given dollar of income. All else being equal, a company with higher ROIC will generate more cash flow than a similar company with lower ROIC. But without the contribution of growth and ROIC to TRS, there is no relationship between TRS and the intensity of a company’s share repurchases.</p>
<p>“That’s because it’s the generation of cash flow that creates value. Regardless of how that cash is distributed to shareholders. So share repurchases are just a reflection of how much cash flow a company generates. The greater the cash flow, the more of it a company will eventually need to return to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases.”</p>
<p>In my experience, professional investors focus on cash flow. They know that accounting measures like EPS drive short-term share price volatility because of herd reactions to news flashes. But for long-term investing, only cash flow matters. They use tools like Credit Suisse Holt cash flow return on investment (CFROI) rather than accounting measures.</p>

<p>Since the evidence from academics, market data, and professional investors is so overwhelming, why are so many firms managed on accounting numbers?</p>
<p>You don’t need to hire McKinsey to work out that it is much easier to get customers to sign a sales agreement or take delivery of product than it is to get customers to pay. Smart managers will – quite rationally from the perspective of paying for their kids’ education et al – favour performance measures that maximise their bonuses.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the best efforts of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have made accounting data more reliable. As a treasurer (and an ex accountant), I naturally think they should focus on accurate cash flow reporting rather than increasingly complex accruals and adjustments.</p>
<p>It is possible that the increasing complexity of accounting requirements, coupled with the more severe tone on management liability for accurate (accounting) reporting, makes it harder for managers to find bandwidth for cash flow.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-flow-works"">Cash flow works</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, many firms come to a position of cash consciousness only through near death experiences. This can be a brutal way to learn that “cash is reality”. For instance, I have seen great firms lose half of their workforce and suffer 60% dilution. Seeing half your colleagues fired focuses the mind more than academic studies and market research. But it is a very painful way to learn.</p>
<p>Cash consciousness comes in different forms. Integrated performance management models – like McKinsey’s ROIC and Stern Stewart’s EVA (and many others) – provide an attractive and consistent methodology. The minimum required is to elevate cash flow – with metrics like net working capital rotation (NWCR) and the cash conversion cycle (CCC) – to at least equal weight with sales and profits, both in terms of performance communication and remuneration. The exact methodology matters less than taking cash seriously.</p>
<p>There is however, a significant minority of firms who take cash flow seriously. These companies provide clear evidence, built up over decades, that cash consciousness produces better performance. This is not new, not bleeding edge, not in doubt – nor a matter of opinion. It is just a matter of breaking the denial inherent in the accounting mind set.</p>
<h3 id=""treasurers-role"">Treasurer’s role</h3>
<p>Cash consciousness vastly improves the life of the treasurer. Some form of cash flow forecast is the critical basis for all core treasury functions. We cannot fund efficiently without a decent estimate of future needs. We cannot manage cash and position accounts properly without forecasts (though this can be radically simplified in payment factory and in-house bank models). And we certainly cannot hedge properly without forecasts.</p>
<p>In cash conscious firms, treasurers are helping management to meet their cash targets, rather than wasting everybody’s time with obscure cash flow forecast requests. Management needs forecasts to manage their bonuses – if cash flow is a major part of the bonus, management will ensure that cash flow forecasting is an integral part of business planning.</p>
<p>It is a platitude that projects and the like need senior management support. Cash consciousness really must come from the board and the CEO, and it has to permeate the whole firm – which basically means cash must be prominent in everyone’s bonus calculation. This kind of decision is unfortunately not within the treasurer’s remit.</p>
<p>In some cases, cash consciousness can come from the firm’s owner. Here is an enlightened quote from Bill Priestley, partner at PE fund manager Electra Partners (emphasis added):</p>
<p>“If I came to you and asked you what the balance was in your personal bank account, I would expect you to roughly know. I want the management teams of my portfolio investments to roughly know how much cash they have and whether they are broadly on track. That goes for the whole team, including sales, marketing and manufacturing. If the CEO has to ask the CFO and suggests cash flow is a finance problem, then that is a real concern, since the CFO is not responsible for all the levers that drive cash flow.”</p>
<h3 id=""take-it-seriously"">Take it seriously</h3>
<p>Firms that take cash seriously perform better and make much more productive workplaces for treasurers. Unfortunately, they are in the minority. Over decades, as the evidence mounts even higher, and as managers who understand this move around and become more senior, cash consciousness will spread. Hopefully, some of this spread will come from second-hand experience rather than painful near death experiences.</p>

<p><em><img alt=""ECR Research logo"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/ecr-research-logo-2016.svg?la=en&amp;hash=80E9AA31C33B45D7E41A15427224EF2C"" width=""130""/></em></p>
<p><em>There is a state of imbalance in the current climate, and it cannot continue. At some point, keeping the economy afloat by allowing debts to soar (even) higher, meaning that negative interest rates are required to ensure borrowing continues, will not be possible. Here, we take a close look at the sheer complexity and, at times, idiocy of the present situation and why inflation is the preferred solution.</em></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve (Fed) assumes that the neutral level of real interest rates is approximately 0%. This refers to real interest rates (so the difference between nominal interest rates and inflation) with an economy running at full capacity, which neither decelerate growth nor stimulate it. Assuming this is actually 0%, this means that if the US economy needs to be stimulated, real interest rates will have to go back to negative levels again.</p>
<h3 id=""the-reality"">The reality</h3>
<p>This is an important point because historically, the US economy has long been due another recession. Following the credit crunch, there has been an abnormally long period without a recession. Normally speaking, real interest rates are lowered by approximately four percentage points to come out of the recession.</p>
<p>With the current inflation, and assuming it declines in a recession, this would therefore mean that nominal interest rates will have to be lowered to approximately minus 4%. At a practical level, this is probably not possible. Fortunately, it is the case that the Fed has other instruments at its disposal as well – for example quantitative easing and forward guidance – but they have proven to be not too effective in recent years.</p>
<p>This problem will therefore only disappear if there is a degree of inflation again, at least 2%, but preferably more. Nominal interest rates may be lowered to 0% or slightly below this level in that case. This is feasible in practical terms at least. So what Yellen meant to say is that the US cannot afford to take any risk with regard to inflation. It is not allowed to decline, but should actually increase. This is also why the Fed must not initiate a rate hike too soon.</p>
<h3 id=""a-global-view"">A global view</h3>
<p>We would immediately like to view this in a broader perspective. The global economy is being plagued by excessive indebtedness, which is increasingly pushing down economic growth, as a result of which supply is offset by too little demand. In turn, this means the economy has a tendency towards deflation. However, the combination of deflation and excessive indebtedness is disastrous for an economy.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the event of deflation nominal income declines, while interest and repayment obligations usually remain more or less the same. This means that less will remain for expenditure, causing deflationary forces to increase and so on. Deflation will therefore need to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>However, this will only be possible by boosting demand, but this will require even more debts. However, if indebtedness is already very extensive, more will only be borrowed if interest rates for this are very attractive. In other words: in the event of excessively negative real interest rates.</p>
<p>This brings us to the idiocy of the present time. In practice this means that in many countries, negative interest rates will need to be used. Under the current circumstances, this is the only way to push down real interest rates to a level that is low enough to keep credit provision at constant levels. However, it is actually sheer nonsense that if someone wants to borrow money, additional money is received for this. There is no logic that can justify this.</p>
<p>However, this is actually indicative of the extent to which our system is in imbalance. It may therefore be predicted with 100% certainty that this cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>Indeed, what is actually at issue in practice is that the economy can only be kept afloat by allowing debts to soar even higher. This, in turn, means that increasingly negative interest rates will be required to ensure that borrowing continues. At some point, this will no longer be possible.</p>
<h3 id=""a-way-out-of-imbalance"">A way out of imbalance?</h3>
<p>There is only one way out of this situation, namely higher inflation. Not only can old debts be repaid in this case with money that has decreased in value, but it will also be practically possible to significantly lower real interest rates (should this be required). In addition, the greater the indebtedness, the more real interest rates will need to be reduced in order to prevent a collapse in the event of a recession.</p>
<p>This means that, even if quantitative easing and forward guidance are used, an inflation level of approximately 3% at least will be required to accumulate a sufficient buffer. This may even have to be higher because inflation will actually come down again significantly in the event of a recession.</p>
<p>Taking the above into account, it subsequently raises the question of how the various central banks will act in the coming period. We believe they will proceed as follows. If we look at the Fed first, then it has little to fear as far as the US economy is concerned. Against this background, we anticipate the Fed will prefer to postpone a further rate hike until there is a distinct onset of wage increases. However, this also entails a significant risk if this causes inflation expectations to rise too rapidly.</p>
<p>What also plays a part is that we anticipate many of the factors that are currently slowing down the economy and pushing down inflation will gradually diminish in force. Real interest rates will then need to be raised significantly to keep inflation expectations in check again. Share prices will then decline in no time and credit spreads and the dollar exchange rate will then increase so much that this actually provokes a recession. The challenge for the Fed is therefore to let inflation (expectations) rise slowly by increasing interest rates at a very measured pace.</p>
<h3 id=""european-perspective"">European perspective</h3>
<p>In contrast to the US, shortages on the labour market in Europe have not yet reached levels at which there can be an onset of wage increases. As long as this does not happen, it will be almost impossible to boost inflation. The major drawback in Europe is also that its credit provision is impeded too much by the fact the banks usually have too little capital at their disposal. This means they cannot supply many additional loans, even though the central bank creates all manner of conditions that make this attractive for them with a view to profit.</p>
<p>The fact remains that European growth prospects are slowly improving. This year, a growth of approximately 1.5% is forecast and next year a growth of approximately 1.7%. Given the very low productivity increase, this will be just about enough to allow unemployment to slowly decrease further. However, it may easily take two years before this will actually lead to additional wage increases and more upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<h3 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>The conclusion is that the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to continue to stimulate the economy monetarily as far as possible for a long period of time, in order to push down unemployment and drive up inflation. However, all this may well yield results at too slow a pace, as a result of which fiscal stimulus will ultimately be resorted to after all.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Germany will be strongly opposed to this, so that we also foresee a very difficult period for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) by 2017, certainly if the refugee crisis persists. This means that Europe will then remain very vulnerable to economic setbacks and/or will have to create inflation in a forced manner, by having rising public deficits directly funded by the central bank.</p>
<p>In other words, we think the two biggest central banks will continue to do everything to push up inflation. Although this causes downward pressure on long-term interest rates in the short term, at the end central banks will likely succeed and that means much higher long-term interest rates in the coming years than many analysts now think is possible.</p>

<p><em>With the UK referendum on EU membership fast approaching, we take a look at some of the challenges corporate treasurers might be grappling with should there be a vote to leave. Has your treasury team considered what life might be like after Brexit?</em></p>
<p>Imagine, it is the morning of 24<sup>th</sup> June 2016 and, for the second time in just over a year, the polls have called it very wrong. Corporate treasurers around Europe are waking to the news that the UK has voted to leave the European Union (EU). Invoking the so-called ‘exit clause’ of the Lisbon Treaty a short while later, Prime Minister David Cameron meets with the European Commission (EC) to kick off a series of negotiations set to last for many years.</p>
<p>A lot of treasurers hearing the news that morning share something in common: they had not made contingency plans. Research such as Deloitte’s quarterly CFO survey warned, months before the referendum, that most UK corporates had not planned for a Brexit. Only 26% of the CFOs polled by the audit firm a few months before said their company had made or was in the process of making contingency plans for a possible UK exit from the EU. At the Association of Corporate Treasurer’s Cash Management Conference in February, treasurers spoke of how they had made efforts to raise the issue across their organisations – but had not gained much traction.</p>
<p>Treasurers outside the UK are even less likely to have planned for such an outcome. They will wish they had. If the UK was to leave the EU the whole of Europe would be effected and any company doing business in or with Europe will have to cope with the consequences.</p>
<p>Precisely what happens next is a matter of some conjecture, and one should be very cautious of precise numerical estimates of the economic impact of the UK deciding to leave the EU. What we can say with reasonable certainty, however, is that nearly every aspect of the treasurer’s work will be impacted. In those first meetings after the referendum treasurers on both sides of the English Channel will be carefully considering the impact of Brexit on everything from the company’s FX exposures to its banking relationships and long-term borrowing plans.</p>
<h3 id=""hedging-brexit"">Hedging Brexit</h3>
<p>The most pressing concern for treasurers in the near term is likely to be foreign exchange volatility. Some have argued that any pressure on sterling following a vote to leave the EU will not last long. After all, exiting the EU, they say, should not drastically alter the UK’s economic fundamentals over the long term.</p>
<p>But that may be wishful thinking. On the other hand, an exit from the EU would mean (at least) two years of political negotiation throughout which many aspects of the UK’s economic, legal and regulatory relationship with its largest trading partner would be set to change. Corporates may decide to delay investment in the UK as a result. Then, as concerns grow around where the disruption will leave the UK’s large current account deficit, investor flows could begin to dry up. Economists warn that, if this scenario were to play out, a precipitous decline in the currency would be on the cards.</p>
<p>“I’m most concerned about the investment channel,” says James Knightly, Senior Economist, ING. “If you are a foreign business, given this two year period of extreme uncertainty, would you be putting money to work in the UK or would you be thinking about investing in continental Europe instead? If foreign direct investment (FDI) becomes less of a positive story, then that is really going to add to the concerns around the currency. We think sterling could fall quite sharply – against the euro it could be back at the levels last seen during the financial crisis.”</p>
<p>Oxford Economics also thinks the initial decline against the dollar could be quite significant. In a report published in March 2016, the research group presented the results of its modelling, according to which sterling will fall by 15% against the US dollar in the immediate aftermath of a vote to leave. By the time the negotiations conclude, the report forecasts the currency to recover and end 9% lower.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the referendum has been already weighing on the exchange rate, which since the beginning of the year is 6.4% lower on a trade weighted basis (a decline economists say cannot be explained simply by the recent fall in UK rate expectations). The cost of hedging business activities against further depreciation has also spiked to its highest level since 2010. The six-month implied volatility in sterling/dollar, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose to 12.2% in February 2016 – its highest level since late 2011, according to data from Reuters.</p>
<p>The pound is not the only currency likely to be impacted. As markets begin to digest the news that the UK is heading out of Europe, the euro is equally likely to come under pressure as fears mount about what other member states might be about to follow the UK out the door. Amid the mounting risk aversion in the markets, safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen could very well begin to appreciate against other currencies. For that reason, treasurers who failed to carefully consider the impact of a Brexit on their short-term hedging positions in the run-up to the referendum may find themselves in an unenviable position.</p>
<p>At the ACT’s Cash Management Conference, it was this particular scenario that seemed to be the greatest concern for treasurers. Julie Fabris, Treasurer for Britax Childcare Group, a UK-based manufacturer of children’s car seats, said this was one of the main areas she had been discussing with her team ahead of the referendum. “There is a lot of FX volatility out there and we have a lot of FX exposures,” she explained. “So the first thing in my mind is how to manage that. I think that’s only going to get worse, and you can already see it in the sterling/euro rates at the moment.”</p>

<h3 id=""uncertainty-costs-money"">Uncertainty costs money</h3>
<p>Were the pound to become chronically weak, the Bank of England (BoE) might be encouraged to hike the UK benchmark borrowing rate to ward off inflation. But that is not the only reason why the pricing of credit could become a headache for UK corporate treasurers in a post-Brexit world.</p>
<p>First, there is a possibility that sterling debt is seen as riskier in the wake of a Brexit, prompting an increase in the price banks can borrow at relative to the BoE’s policy rate. Such an increase would most probably be passed on to non-financial corporate borrowers through higher risk weightings and higher margins.</p>
<p>Second, intercompany financing and the ability to borrow on European debt capital markets would be unaffected. The EU’s open investment approach is guaranteed by legislation that states all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States are prohibited. However, borrowing in foreign currency may be unattractive if sterling comes under pressure.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Thirdly, UK companies could face a credit downgrade. In a research note published in March, credit ratings agency Moody’s said that Brexit would create heightened uncertainty that would be credit negative for non-financial corporate issuers, a view shared by the other two major ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch. Meanwhile, Moody’s believes there will be little significant credit impact for EU-based issuers. It does note, however, that the uncertainty from Brexit would be felt across the EU, and especially in countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.</p>
<p>The pressure on ratings for UK issuers is not likely to be distributed evenly across the UK economy since the impact of a Brexit will not be the same for any two businesses. “It depends which sector you are thinking about,” says Colin Ellis, Managing Director – Chief Credit Officer, EMEA at Moody’s. “Each have their own issues in terms of possible regulatory change, the trade impact, investment impact and migration impact. For example, in the corporate world, the companies that might be most exposed in terms of the migration issue are food producers. Whereas if you are thinking about the trade question, then it is most probably manufacturers that are impacted.”</p>
<p>The small ray of hope for the corporate treasurers at this point is that all the questions Brexit raises around future access to markets and movement of labour are resolved quickly. Dorothy Livingston, Consultant at Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who says she has been receiving more enquiries from corporate clients about Brexit in recent months, summarises the problem succinctly. It is uncertainty that is the real challenge. “This carries the risks that, as in other situations of uncertainty, money may cost more and it may become more difficult to borrow on good terms on a long-term basis“.</p>
<p>This is before even getting to the more specific issue of what happens to the financing arrangements of companies currently benefiting from some form of EU subsidy or financing programme. “Businesses may, depending on the terms agreed if the UK leaves the EU, lose access to European Investment Bank (EIB) funding once we actually leave the EU,” Livingston adds. “That would remove a source of funding that has been heavily used by our infrastructure companies – there is not any equivalent UK institution to replace that. According to its website, the EIB has lent some €29bn to the UK in the last five years, with over 75% of this total going to energy, transport, telecommunications and water/sewerage/urban development.”</p>
<p>A strategic review of the composition of funding policies will therefore be essential for treasurers of UK companies in the event of a Brexit. And that is even before we take into account the impact of a Brexit on the principle source of funding for most European corporates: the banks.</p>
<h3 id=""in-the-city"">In The City</h3>
<p>The City of London is blessed with many competitive advantages lacked by other European financial centres such as Frankfurt and Paris. Neither of these cities has the same depth of labour market in financial services that London enjoys; nor does either possess the same scale of support services – lawyers, accountants, and consultants. These advantages will not disappear overnight if the UK leaves the EU.</p>
<p>That means treasurers will probably be spared a costly wholesale disruption of their banking activities from foreign banks deciding, in a post-Brexit world, to move their European headquarters or close their London operations altogether. That does not mean, however, that corporate banking relationships will be left entirely unaffected by the UK’s changing relationship with Europe.</p>
<p>Once again, uncertainty is the problem. What will the loss of EU passporting rights from London mean for the treasurer’s relationship banks’ commitment to various lines of business? What will the UK leaving the EU mean for the UK’s participation in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)? Will companies still be able to collect euro payments from the UK post-Brexit and, if so, might these be subject to additional charges from the recipient banks?</p>
<p>The payments question is particularly significant because banks have been advising corporate clients that it is in their interests to open accounts in London. Since the volume of transactions flowing via London into Europe is so great, the banks have long argued that centralisation of this sort makes a lot of sense from an operational efficiency perspective.</p>
<p>Whether it would continue to make sense in a post-Brexit world is uncertain. Although the UK is not a member of the euro it is as a member of the EU, of course, included in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Inclusion in SEPA is not conditional on membership of the EU: non-EU states such as Switzerland, Norway and Monaco are, indeed, part of the scheme. But until the point at which the political leaders of the UK and the EU come together and iron out the details of the UK’s new relationship with Europe, there would be some uncertainty around the UK’s continuing participation in the scheme. A matter of this sort would, most probably, need to be addressed in a trade deal. In the absence of such a deal, some industry sources have even speculated payments sent from the UK to the EU might be subject to deductions from the beneficiary bank.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“The SEPA uncertainty is one of the ways this could impact clients,” a source inside the transaction banking industry told Treasury Today. “It could be bad news for companies who have centralised accounts in London for the purpose of pooling liquidity. We have been receiving quite a lot of questions from corporates with liquidity pooling structures based in London.”</p>
<p>Cash pooling is far from the only financial service that could face disruption were Brexit to lead some UK-headquartered banks into structural reviews of their businesses. The loss of passporting rights, which permit banks access to European Economic Area (EEA) markets from London, could push some banks to move selected areas of their business to an EU financial centre like Frankfurt or Paris. The statement from HSBC’s CEO Stuart Gulliver earlier this year indicating that the lender plans to move 1,000 of its investment bankers to Paris if the UK withdraws from the EU could be taken as a sign of what is to come should the UK vote to leave.</p>
<p>Not every bank will be impacted in this way though; only those UK regulated entities, like HSBC, that use the UK to passport into Europe. A US headquartered bank with a footprint in Europe, for instance, could in addition to relying on the EU passport also have US branches operating in Europe that are negotiated locally in each particular country.</p>
<p>Treasurers will therefore need to understand what a Brexit means for their banking partners and that some banks will be more affected than others. Those with one of the large UK banks might find that, operating from the UK, the bank can no longer offer services into the European market. The bank may need to move part of their business into Europe to keep servicing the markets locally.</p>
<p>The loss of passporting rights could be an equally significant issue for money market funds too. In the event of a Brexit, asset managers could find that their ability to sell funds across Europe from the UK is hampered. At the present time, the right to do this is guaranteed under the EU’s Undertaking for Collective Investments in Transferrable Securities (UCITS) Directive. But there is a very real possibility that the EU will seek to change these arrangements if the UK leaves the EU. If that were to happen some funds would have to either withdraw from marketing on the continent or re-domicile their assets. This too could become an issue for treasurers of European companies using UK domiciled sterling MMFs post-Brexit.</p>
<h3 id=""exit-emergency"">Exit emergency</h3>
<p>Looking across the spectrum of treasury activities that could be affected by the UK exiting the EU – from banking and money funds to financing – there appears to be one major recurring theme: uncertainty. Perhaps this is the reason why so many corporate treasurers and CFOs have indicated that, as the referendum approaches, they have yet to make contingency plans.</p>
<p>Despite all the grave predictions made by commentators on both sides of the debate, the truth of the matter is that nothing actually fundamental changes on the morning of 24<sup>th</sup> June even if the UK votes in favour of leaving the EU. The much talked about two-year countdown clock that is Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty will not even begin ticking until the UK Prime Minister David Cameron goes to the EC to convey his government’s desire to exit. In the absence of any immediate impact, it is quite understandable that treasurers feel reluctant to begin planning for a new world that will only become clear as the post-Brexit negotiations progress.</p>
<p>Predictions of an economic meltdown – as some in the ‘Remain Camp’ have indulged in – may be overstating the ramifications of the vote somewhat. But the potential market volatility most economists expect to follow, together with all the political uncertainties, should be more than enough to give Europe’s treasurers jitters as the big day approaches.</p>

<p><em>The European Union (EU) is facing some strong headwinds, as geopolitical forces globally appear to be pushing it in the direction of disintegration. With borders being closed across the continent, the lack of a comprehensive, and unanimously agreed upon, strong foreign and security policy threatens EU economic revival, as countries across Europe have seen.</em></p>
<p>It is almost a dead cert that the Syrian civil war, and its spill over into Iraq, will continue raging on for the foreseeable future. There are too many factions, militias, and parties that are fighting each other, while several of the major external players have conflicting interests.</p>
<p>A durable truce is therefore unlikely in the near to medium term: Russia and Iran are not prepared to drop Assad, Saudi Arabia is more worried about Iran than about ISIS, Turkey wants Assad to go but is even more fearful of the Kurds, and so on.</p>


<blockquote>In other words, violence, war, and refugee flows will continue to be the order of the day while external great powers – with the US and Russia in leading roles – will continue to jostle for position.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Persistent civil war in Syria and Iraq, as well as more violence in Afghanistan imply that the refugee flows will grow, especially when the weather improves in the spring and summer. This will ratchet up the pressure in Europe and greatly undermine the remaining solidarity between the member states and with refugees. Borders are being closed all over the continent while the rules imposed on migrants are tightened – to an antisocial degree in some countries. And as the populist parties become more popular, cohesion continues to crumble inside the EU.</p>
<p>Extremism, as well as the other conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), poses risks to the markets and the underlying causes of the unrest in the region will not disappear anytime soon. In other words, violence, war, and refugee flows will continue to be the order of the day while external great powers – with the US and Russia in leading roles – will continue to jostle for position.</p>
<h3 id=""no-relief-in-sight"">No relief in sight</h3>
<p>This is bad news for Europe, where the ongoing refugee crisis has added a distressing dimension to the tensions that are already undermining unity. As well as a rift between North and South, the gap is widening between East and West.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Greek pressure cooker is nearing boiling point. The country’s economy was already in the doldrums and the refugee crisis is very expensive, sending shockwaves through society, and weakening the Tsipras government. The Grexit debate could flare up again at any moment. Tsipras and his team are at loggerheads with Europe regarding the treatment and dispatch of refugees and also – not for the first time – about structural reform. The Prime Minister is caught between a rock and a hard place; a new Grexit discussion would not just revolve around a departure from the Eurozone but also from Schengen and even the EU.</p>
<h3 id=""rebellious-renzi-versus-vulnerable-chancellor"">Rebellious Renzi versus vulnerable chancellor</h3>
<p>From the most fragile to the strongest member state: Germany. Chancellor Merkel’s hand has already weakened and her working life has lately become even more difficult. Politicians, including those in her own coalition, are attacking her and she is rapidly losing popularity among voters as the right-wing populist party, Alternative fur Deutschland, makes headway in the polls. The pressure on Merkel will only increase as the refugee flows continue to swell over the course of the year.</p>
<p>And the pressure isn’t only domestic. The Italian Prime Minister Renzi is increasingly setting himself up as a rival European leader in hopes of filling the vacuum that will be left if Merkel is ousted. Maybe not coincidentally, his domestic reforms are materialising at a sluggish pace. Renzi will take an even more assertive stance if the situation in Libya spirals further out of control and once refugees again try to reach Italy by sea (the vast majority of migrants are now entering Europe via Greece).</p>
<p>Internal frictions, such as these, are hampering the badly needed progress in the euro area – the bank union is far from complete and the monetary union should be strengthened, for instance. However, increased integration appears an ever more distant prospect. National borders are slammed shut as a Brexit looms alongside a Dutch referendum on a treaty with Ukraine (which is just a thinly disguised vote on the EU itself) and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Apart from the concrete risks that Europe faces and the factors that could potentially act as a drag on growth – a French think tank estimates that disintegrating Schengen would cost €110bn over the coming decade – a miasma of misery could descend on Europe.</p>
<h3 id=""boundless-malaise"">Boundless malaise</h3>
<p>Whilst the Eurozone economy is not doing that badly, many people feel despondent. Citizens feel defenceless; many have abruptly realised that Europe’s borders are porous and susceptible to a multitude of threats.</p>


<blockquote>Although the disintegration of the Eurozone is not yet on the cards, the global geopolitical forces seem to be pushing the EU and Eurozone in this direction.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When scanning the panorama from West to East we see a variety of risks, including: a possible Brexit, which would be fuel to the fire of the separatist movement in Scotland (and perhaps even Northern Ireland); a deeply divided Libya that could be overrun by ISIS; countries such as Syria and Iraq that are torn apart by civil wars and foreign interference; Islamisation and authoritarian governance in Turkey; corruption and Russian meddling that are destabilising Ukraine. Clearly, Russia will relentlessly continue to play the European countries against each other.</p>
<p>Add to this the uncertainty about the slowdown in China and the notion that the United States’ power and status on the global stage are waning and it will be obvious that the outside world holds few attractions for the Europeans. But there is scant evidence – if any – of concerted action.</p>
<p>Addressing the refugee crisis would go a long way to easing the pressure on Europe. The problem is that Europe can do very little in this respect as – regardless of various grandiose plans – it has not managed to pursue a strong foreign and security policy. The continent is dependent on other actors when it comes to restoring calm in the MENA (which would help to reinstate a sense of order at Europe’s boundaries). However, the chances of the latter are minimal.</p>
<p>The US is wary of getting in too deep, Russia is doing its utmost to make the situation worse, China does not (yet) aspire to play a pivotal role, while Iran and Saudi Arabia seem to be obsessed with tripping each other up. Finally, Turkey is preoccupied with shoring up Erdogan’s authoritarian regime and suppressing the Kurds. We also do not have high hopes of the effectiveness of supranational organisations such as the UN and NATO.</p>
<h3 id=""fragile-foundation"">Fragile foundation</h3>
<p>To sum up, the main geopolitical risks threatening US interests are identical to the forces that could trigger an existential crisis in the EU and (by extension) the Eurozone. This leads us to believe that the euro will be in trouble again later this year. Levels near 0.90 in EUR/USD are possible while we could see widening yield spreads between the (supposedly) strong Eurozone countries and those in the southern part of the monetary union.</p>
<p>Yields rising in tandem could signal a burgeoning confidence in economic growth or (in a pessimistic scenario) mounting doubts about the durability of the EU and the euro. There is no denying that the (political) trends around the world and in Europe are restrictive rather than stimulative.</p>

<p><em>Nearly a decade after the financial crisis, it is pertinent to reflect on how far global markets have come. In doing so, however, one thing is clear: although economies across the world, developed and emerging, all heavily influence one another, they are increasingly out of step.</em></p>
<p>After the credit crisis, central banks needed to ‘go all out’ across the world in order to stave off depression and return the economy to a normal growth path. Short-term interest rates were cut to almost zero whilst more and more central banks started to create liquidity in one way or another. Often they launched large-scale bond-buying programmes and paid for this with money seemingly plucked out of thin air. Liquidity supply expanded and bond yields fell.</p>

<p>The credit crisis erupted due to high indebtedness (in the public and private sectors) in many places around the world. A lot of state, business, and household debts were offset by assets such as property and equities. Once the crisis exploded, such assets depreciated in value as the entire credit system threatened to collapse like a house of cards. Central banks tried to increase the value of the assets that served as collateral in order to improve balance sheets. Jobless rates soared in the aftermath of the crisis and wages barely rose or they continued to drop. Consumers did not have sufficient purchasing power to boost economic growth. Therefore, more borrowing appeared to be the only solution. It became necessary to inflate the prices of assets such as real estate, equities, bonds, and so on. The consequences for the financial markets were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lower interest rates. As a result, investors started to look for returns exceeding government bond yields, which led them to buy risky bonds and similar investments. Credit spreads narrowed and this supported credit growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extremely low interest rates, in combination with massive money creation, continued to push up stock prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many countries were in exactly the same boat so monetary policies did not diverge much; currency fluctuations were few and far between.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""time-for-change-in-the-us"">Time for change in the US</h3>
<p>But the situation has gradually started to change. The US employment rate has fallen on the back of the aforementioned policies and there is mounting upward pressure on pay. This is a historic moment as once wage increases are rising, consumers will have more buying power. On the basis of past experience, we can expect consumer confidence to pick up as well as borrowing. Spending is bound to improve to the extent that jobless rates fall further as wages continue to rise and purchasing power improves. In combination with the humongous money creation of the past years, this carries inflation risks.</p>
<p>The Fed has now made its first move towards fighting inflation risks. For the first time since the credit crisis, the US raised interest rates to 0.5%. A defining aspect of the situation is that the Fed’s rate hikes are supposed to slow economic growth to the rate of potential (= the sum total of the increase in productivity and workforce growth). In the US, this is just 1.5%-2% whereas up until the credit crisis, growth rates near 3.5% were considered normal. The US is heading for a period when tighter monetary policy – ie less money creation – will combine with rising interest rates and decelerating growth. The bond and equity environment will differ dramatically from what investors have grown accustomed to in the past seven years.</p>
<h3 id=""impacts-far-and-wide"">Impacts far and wide</h3>
<p>At a time when huge amounts of dollars were being created, many parties in the emerging markets took out loans that were denominated in the US currency. Most of this money was used to build new production units. Upward pressure on US interest rates makes those dollar loans more expensive, and the dollar itself has strengthened. As a result, the dollar debt burden has substantially increased (expressed in the local currencies), while slowing economic growth around the world has resulted in overcapacity.</p>
<p>It is clear that the situation in the developing world is deteriorating. As many of these countries used to be major commodity consumers, the same applies to the commodity producing nations and western industries which are confronted with falling sales as well as lower prices.</p>
<p>The question is how the change will affect the US and other western countries. It shall certainly have a negative impact on manufacturing and especially on trade with the emerging markets. Yet, import prices are falling (lower oil prices are particularly important), which is boosting consumer spending power and thereby the services sector. Such developments could outshine the factors that act as a drag on the economy in the slightly longer term.</p>

<p>Europe faces a different set of circumstances. Although the central bank has applied large-scale monetary stimulus, lending conditions have tightened. The European banks were far more leveraged before the credit crisis than those in the US. Therefore the latter were quick to sell off or write down bad debts. Particularly compared to banks in Europe, which are still focused on improving their balance sheets so are less able to supply credit. Europe has little room to apply fiscal stimulus and jobless rates have risen so much that wage increases are low. Therefore, domestic economic growth is sluggish (specifically, relative to the US) while deflation fears have not disappeared. The ECB has eased its policy from the start of the year – when it expanded its bond-buying programme and imposed negative interest rates – to counter these effects.</p>
<p>What’s more, Europe is increasingly out of step with the US in terms of monetary policy. Such policy divergence has an impact on the exchange rates. This suits Europe well. A cheaper euro is one of very few ways to provide new impulses to the European economy (through improving foreign trade and higher employment).</p>
<h3 id=""global-intertwinement"">Global intertwinement</h3>
<p>It is impossible to provide a detailed forecast for the monetary situation in each individual country; what happens in one area tends to influence developments elsewhere. We have already seen that the Fed’s tightening bias has serious consequences for the emerging markets. In turn, this will have repercussions for the US economy, which is sensitive to share price movement. Sharp stock market pullbacks will hit the economy hard. Monetary policy divergence between different countries leads to currency fluctuations. This does not matter greatly in good economic times but now that growth is subdued, currency weakness may be a bonus in many places whereas a strong currency can do a lot of damage.</p>
<p>This defines the global economic outlook. US consumers are borrowing and spending more, which has prompted the aforementioned positive economic spiral. The Fed is gearing up for further rate hikes. To paraphrase Ms Yellen, the most fascinating question is the timing of the subsequent rate rises. Yet, tighter Fed policy will set up counterforces that will act as a drag on US economic growth.</p>
<p>Normally, this would provide the central bank with plenty of reason not to raise its key interest rate for the foreseeable future – or at least to limit the rate hikes. Even more so as the listed developments are bound to contain inflation. The irony is that a low rate of inflation will provide consumers with more purchasing power and prevent a growth slowdown. The central bank will have to tread cautiously in any case when tightening its policy. For currency and interest rates markets, this all means 2016 will see more volatility than we saw in the last quarters of 2015.</p>

<p><em>Treasurers will be watching developments in China closely in 2016; it is ASEAN, however, where we may yet see the greatest, most enduring changes. Treasury Today Asia asks industry experts what is in store for the year ahead and what treasurers should be doing now to prepare.</em></p>
<p>There should be no prizes for guessing which Asian economy the rest of the region – and indeed the world – will be watching most anxiously in the year ahead.</p>
<p>The slowdown in China has been on corporates’ minds for some time now; in the first quarter of 2015, 13% of respondents to J.P. Morgan’s survey of more than 80 treasurers in Asia Pacific cited the China slowdown as the biggest macroeconomic issue affecting their business outlook today. Two quarters later, and 48% rated it as their most significant macroeconomic issue. “It has affected a lot of the plans that corporates might have to achieve in terms of what numbers they have committed or budgeted. Clearly, it’s a pressure that many companies are feeling,” says Gourang Shah, Treasury Services APAC, J.P. Morgan.</p>
<h3 id=""the-asian-century"">The Asian century</h3>
<p>Indeed, the difference between emerging market (EM) growth and developed market growth is narrowing. When you compare China and the US in terms of growth rate, Shah explains, there used to be a difference of around 6-7% between their GDPs. Now that is more like 4-5%.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, any business that is supplying commodities to China – whether it is in Brazil, Russia, South Africa, Canada, Australia and so on – will be feeling the effects of the China slow down.</p>
<p>“A lot of components are also made in Asia so you will naturally see the effects here as well as in the big commodity producing countries,” says Shah. FX volatility is also an effect of the growth compression between EMs and developed markets. “There has been more money moving into dollars and at the same time, the Asian economies are not able to decrease their interest rates to spur growth because of the currency impact that is happening on the other side.” As a result, we are seeing more volatility.</p>
<p>According to Shah, however, this combination of factors will not affect the region’s domination. “We still believe that the 21<sup>st</sup> century is going to be the Asian century. All economies go through a cycle; China is no different.”</p>
<p>If China’s continuing growth story over the long term still looks assured, neither is its prospects in the immediate term quite as bad as some feared last autumn. The country’s frothy real-estate sector is a perennial risk, of course, but experts like Alessandro Theiss, a researcher and analyst at Oxford Economics, believe that most other areas of the economy are in relatively robust shape, a reality which is reflected in the markets. “We feel that the risk of a hard landing market participants have priced in following the August rout is relatively modest,” says Theiss. “This is because there is quite a lot of scope for policy still to be eased in China, especially fiscal policy. Overall we expect growth to slow, but in a relatively gentle, managed fashion.”</p>
<p>With all this in mind, perhaps we should consider what corporates should have on their ‘to do’ lists for the upcoming year. Shah highlights a few potential areas for consideration.</p>
<h3 id=""a-bumpy-ride"">A bumpy ride</h3>
<p>First and foremost, treasurers need to insulate their companies against the heightened volatility we have been seeing of late in global financial markets. “We are entering a volatile phase for the next year or so,” says Shah. “Essentially, it is similar to driving on a bumpy road, you have got to take control of the vehicle. In the same way, you need to have good infrastructure to manage cash funding risk and be prepared for the worst case scenario.”</p>
<p>For instance, if a company’s free cash flow generation is lower than expected, the treasurer must be able to manage the liquidity needs of the business accordingly. What’s more, he suggests, because it is possible that the environment will become still more turbulent, treasurers need to ensure they take a close look at risk management policies.</p>
<p>They will need to be especially watchful following the recent change to US interest rates. “There will be a lot of volatility,” says Priyanka Kishore, Senior Economist, Oxford Economics. “I don’t think any emerging market will be spared, but Malaysia tops the list not least because of its trade linkages to China, but also because of its foreign investors in terms of its bond holdings. We all saw what happened to Brazil, Turkey, and even India (an economy with very modest linkages with China) when the CNY was devalued last August. This is pretty much in line with what happens when market tensions increase – asset managers tend to stop differentiating on domestic fundamentals and they treat EM as an asset class.”</p>
<p>It isn’t all doom and gloom, however. China is opening up and is now beginning to allow corporates the freedom to convert and send funds cross-border (still subject in certain instances to regulatory approval). This of course opens the door to a whole new range of liquidity management possibilities for corporates in China. “There are now opportunities for companies to embed China in their global treasury infrastructure when looking at cash pooling,” says Shah. “Those that haven’t done so should prioritise this in 2016.” Corporates can now: start billing in RMB cross-border, hedge offshore because there is enough liquidity in the Hong Kong markets for RMB and move money between China and the global cash pool, whether it’s located in Singapore or London.</p>
<p>In the instance that sales no longer met expectations – as has been the case in China – corporates need to ensure they have some other source of liquidity to manage the short-term fall which this creates on the cash flow expectations. As a result of uncertainty, there is a tendency to build up cash on the balance sheet – particularly in EMs. “I think they will continue to do so for the next year, maybe longer,” says Shah. “But alternative funding sources needs to be lined up in case.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Shah explains, shareholders are expecting this cash to be deployed. “If you look at the more developed markets, there will be increasing activity on M&amp;A as well as some investment in the business itself.” Sixty seven percent of respondents to J.P. Morgan’s recent survey agreed that they will be considering strategic uses of surplus liquidity such as share buy-backs, special dividends and M&amp;A.</p>


<blockquote>We are entering a volatile phase for the next year or so. Essentially, it is similar to driving on a bumpy road, you have got to take control of the vehicle. In the same way, you need to have good infrastructure to manage cash funding risk and be prepared for the worst case scenario.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The past two decades have seen phenomenal growth in China; it is now a $10trn economy and, according to Shah, the economy will continue on its upward trajectory. It is just that it will be propelled by a different engine. “China is now going through a change where the service economy has overtaken the manufacturing economy for the first time.” As China goes more towards service and consumption, corporates need to be prepared to adapt their strategies.</p>
<h3 id=""better-together"">Better together</h3>
<p>A similar degree of flexibility is required by corporate treasuries operating in South East Asia, albeit for slightly different reasons.</p>
<p>The Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN) is made up of ten countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Ten countries which by no means present a uniform picture. “For corporates, there is fragmentation in terms of differences in capital market depth and banking sector scale which add a layer of complexity to the social, cultural and economic divergence,” explains Carli Renzi, Director, Financial Institutions at ANZ. Change has been on the cards for some time, however.</p>
<p>Envisioned to transform ASEAN into a region with free movement of goods, services, investment, skilled labour and freer flow of capital, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) progress has been ongoing for a while. The charter, signed by all members of ASEAN in 2007, set out the goal of achieving regional economic integration by the 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015, a date brought forward from the original 2020 aim. While China is endeavouring to integrate more with the global economy, then, ASEAN is endeavouring to integrate more with itself.</p>
<p>Despite some doubts circulating about ASEAN’s patchy history with the deadlines of such inter-country agreements, interest is certainly stirring prior to the AEC initiative. “Up until recently, ASEAN has been more of an insider term. When I’m talking at conferences or to banks from outside of Asia, I’m still defining what countries make up ASEAN,” says Renzi. “But I think it’s going to emerge prominently in its own right, especially now that AEC is ready to go.”</p>
<p>To illustrate what integration could mean for the region, Renzi compares Singapore and Laos. Whilst Singapore has been one of ASEAN’s success stories, Laos is a landlocked country, geographically disadvantaged when it comes to industrial growth, says Renzi. It is without a doubt that Laos differs considerably in terms of development when compared to Singapore. Singapore’s banking sector, for instance, has substantial regional presence whereas Laos is ASEAN’s smallest banking sector (less than $9bn).</p>
<p>“But when Laos is integrated into the ASEAN region, its location becomes strategically important; Laos is conveniently on the train line between China and Thailand, for instance.” With freer movement of goods and services, development – including in the country’s banking sector – would reach a faster pace than could be expected by Laos on its own.</p>


<blockquote>With the ten countries all comprising different levels of development, as well as having different languages, cultures, currencies and so on, it’s really important that banks can equip their clients with local insights. Particularly around entry and exit strategies, supply risk, trade partnerships, distributor risk, and FX and interest rate risk.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Carli Renzi, Director, Financial Institutions, ANZ</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>This kind of disparity is currently spread across the whole region, and the benefits of integration therefore could be felt far and wide. But whilst waiting for the benefits of AEC to fully materialise, what can corporates operating in, or looking to invest in, the region expect?</p>
<h3 id=""a-partnership-approach"">A partnership approach</h3>
<p>“With the ten countries all comprising different levels of development, as well as having different languages, cultures, currencies and so on, it’s really important that banks can equip their clients with local insights. Particularly around entry and exit strategies, supply risk, trade partnerships, distributor risk, and FX and interest rate risk,” says Renzi. ANZ predict that there will be an increasing demand for services that seamlessly connect to and within the region. The extent and complexity of service requirements, however, will depend on the customer’s stage of growth in the region, as well as their strategic goals. For this purpose, ANZ, in the bank’s annual whitepaper taken to SIBOS titled ‘Shaping the Future of ASEAN Banking’, identified how banks can approach the three sub-regions rising in line with ASEAN trade and financial integration: the high income economies (Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia), the mid manufacturing competitors (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines) and the Mekong frontier (Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos).</p>
<p>“For both MNCs and banks, these sub-regions are a way to cluster strategic objectives. A degree of local customisation, of course, is always going to be necessary but to be efficient, some economies of scale and categorisation are needed,” says Renzi. And it is without a doubt that corporates are keeping a close eye on where banks are investing and whether, and how, they are going to be in their present countries going forward.</p>
<p>Time and time again, ANZ’s Renzi explains, ‘reach’ comes up as a critical success driver for banks to be relevant in the relationship decisions of ASEAN’s MNCs. “This doesn’t necessarily mean banks need to have a full service franchise, however. There are selective ways of building a highly connected bank.” And according to ANZ, three broad banking approaches have emerged in the region. Firstly, the regional approach boasts substantial commitment and onshore investment to provide end-to-end services.</p>
<p>Next, there is the network approach which leverages key corridors, maintaining more flexibility to use other banks’ services when they don’t have the reach or capital onshore. There is also a partnership approach that has emerged. “This is the most common method where banks collaborate with other banks to support their customers’ offshore strategies,” says Renzi. Categorising banks isn’t to say that one strategy is better than another, however. “It also doesn’t mean the existence of rigid policies that don’t adapt. Rather, that banks having a core value proposition should be able to see out the differentiated impact of integration and the rapid financial development of ASEAN,” Renzi clarifies.</p>
<h3 id=""a-bright-future"">A bright future?</h3>
<p>ANZ predicts that the creation of AEC will put regional growth at around 6-8% and, by 2025, ASEAN will emerge as a $4.5trn economy. Making the most of this opportunity, corporates investing and trading in the region will be looking to be provided with a complete suite of trade and hedging solutions in G10 currencies, as well as local currencies. “This means that banks need to align their infrastructure now and build those capabilities or move to partnerships so that they can accommodate these greater local currency volumes in the future,” Renzi explains.</p>
<p>The increasing demand for seamless connection to and within the region must be met – whichever approach is taken by a bank. Currently, cross-border banking in the region is a long way from seamless, but greater banking integration could enhance the service capability regionally, deepen inter-regional currency liquidity and improve economies of scale for banks. “For example, if you implement a regional structure, it results in better deals for customers.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, ASEAN certainly seems to be a good bet. The true measure of success, however, will be how well treasurers deal with the present complexities in ASEAN rather than waiting for a dramatic change that is unlikely to occur overnight. And with more market volatility expected in the coming months as US interest rates rise and China continues to progressively open its economy to market forces, rising to that challenge is becoming ever more important.</p>

<p><em>Following the Grexit dilemma and increasing worries over Russian aggression, Europe now has another contentious issue to tackle: the migrant crisis. Given its threat to EU relations and integration, amongst serious moral concerns, the continent is certainly feeling the strain.</em></p>
<p>The character of Jessup, played by Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, proclaimed: “You can’t handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who’s going to do it?” The famous lines regarding the need for military support might just as easily have been referring to the manner in which the EU has been dealing with the refugee crisis. The difference however is that if it was a script, the majority surely would have expected Europe to be coping better.</p>
<p>Many a politician and voter argue that Europe should face the reality that the continent can’t handle the stream of migrants arriving on its shores and close the borders to asylum seekers. German leader Angela Merkel disputed this, but did so in an arguably un-convincing manner: “It cannot be that Europe says, ‘We can’t handle this’.” Many others agree with her, however.</p>
<h3 id=""european-chasms"">European chasms</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that it will be very hard to remedy the situation within a short time frame – in spite of the justifiable moral outrage. Europe has attempted to get a grip of the situation, but the agreements reached so far are just the first steps in what will be a problem for politicians to deal with for years to come. And with European nations still very much divided as to how best to address these concerns, it is likely that we will witness many highly-strung summits during which it may appear that Europe is coming apart at the seams.</p>
<p>Indeed, frictions are already there for all to see. The decision during September’s European Union (EU) summit to overrule opponents by a method called qualified majority voting (QMV) on the contentious issue of the forced relocation of refugees was unprecedented. By the four countries that voted against, the move was perceived as an assault on their sovereignty.</p>
<p>ECR Research predict that a dangerous rift could appear between the east and west of the EU. It’s very easy to depict the central and eastern European nations as xenophobes – and that is exactly the assumption we are seeing many in western parts of Europe making. However, this is about far more than mere fear and, as a result of many in the west failing to understand that, tensions could well increase further still.</p>
<h3 id=""a-problematic-history"">A problematic history</h3>
<p>To understand where the eastern Europeans are coming from, this quote, reported by Politico, from a senior EU official who has spent years living in Eastern Europe, offers some insight: “It’s taken countries like the UK 40 years to adjust to a diverse society. Football fans were throwing bananas at black players in the 1970s. These countries [in the east] have had to transition from communism, try to catch up with the west and now in the space of a few months compress 40 years of inclusion into their societies.”</p>


<blockquote>Europe has attempted to get a grip of the situation, but the agreements reached so far are just the first steps in what will be a problem for politicians to deal with for years to come.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Amongst all of this, one thing is guaranteed: the EU has come under great additional strain as it is still haunted by two other major crises from the past couple of years – the Grexit drama and mounting Russian aggression. These three crises have, in turn, threatened the three founding pillars of the European integration project: the Eurozone, the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU and the passport free Schengen Zone. In the words of Cornelius Adebahr, a researcher for Carnegie, these three encompass the very core of nation states: “Taxes, armies, and residence.”</p>
<p>Europe will not be able to sweep these daunting challenges under the rug. The Eurozone may be out of the darkest and most dangerous woods, but it’s not on peaceful pastures. Creditors still need to agree on debt restructuring for Greece and how to deal with the worryingly high unemployment numbers in many countries.</p>
<p>Concerning the foreign policy and security challenges, things have quietened down quite a bit in the eastern parts of Ukraine, but this shouldn’t be mistaken for Putin throwing in the towel. The Russian leader will try to profit from Europe’s divided nature of late and the chances are that he will succeed (some analysts even suggest that Putin may be upping the ante in Syria in order to drive even more Syrian refugees to Europe and destabilise the continent). When it comes to the most urgent challenge to the EU – the refugee crisis – Europe had better be well-prepared as the conflicts in the Middle East and Africa show no signs of abating anytime soon.</p>
<h3 id=""what-does-the-future-hold"">What does the future hold?</h3>
<p>It isn’t all bad news, however. In reading and analysing leading research from European experts, we get the sense that Europe should not be written off too soon. All of the doom and gloom about the region unravelling is premature. It is most likely that Europe will get a grip of the refugee crisis – eventually. But not before it has seriously damaged relations between EU members and complicated the matter of addressing other issues like deepening Eurozone integration and countering Putin’s actions.</p>
<p>To end with another famous line from Jack Nicholson, this time from the great crime thriller The Departed: “I don’t want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.” The EU would very much like to be in the same position. But it still is a long, long way from that enviable spot and, whilst it may seem like the plot for a thrilling film, it is a reality that the continent and its political leaders must now face head on.</p>

<p>Uncertainty continues to permeate the macroeconomic landscape as we move into 4Q15. The question on everyone’s mind: when will the Fed raise interest rates? However, beyond that, the areas of uncertainty extend quite extensively, particularly for treasurers in the APAC region. These include uncertainty over the direction of China’s growth and reforms, the challenges of RMB internationalisation, where we are in the commodities cycle, the outlook for large emerging economies like India and Indonesia, implications pertaining to ASEAN and the new Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.</p>
<p>APAC treasurers planning for 2016 should prepare for uncertainty, build resiliency and maintain flexibility. The landscape is already fraught with multiple known ‘unknowns’ and this will continue with those understood less. Priorities centre around being prepared for bumps along the way. Some key items on the to do list include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cash (visibility) is king. This is crucial, especially for businesses spanning different countries and juggling multiple internal systems. Already a critical priority in business-as-usual times, visibility is of paramount importance when treasurers need to act quickly. Given that stress could emanate from a localised, country-specific cause or a macroeconomic development, treasurers should ensure visibility across the spectrum, be it at a country or market, regional or firm-wide level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test, test and test again. While this includes typical contingency planning around systems and business continuity plans, do not stop there. Think and plan for various scenarios and how treasurers could manage and lead through them. For example, if there is a cash-crunch, which projects could be stopped and in what time frame? Which initiatives could help bring in cash on short notice? Who are the stakeholders that need to be consulted today, rather than in the throes of a crisis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and, if need be, hedge exposures. Beyond identifying sensitivities to key external factors, proactively define and articulate the risk management philosophy within the treasury and firm. Drive this agenda together with the CFO and Chief Risk Officer. Be clear on potential exposure risks, as well as what could be done to mitigate them. Avoid being penny-wise and pound-foolish. Hedge if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build up funding resiliency. This is less about securing funding before the end of the ultra-low rate environment and more about putting in place diverse sources of funding to reduce risk. Treasurers should ensure that diverse and resilient funding sources are in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t forget the upside. Amidst planning for downside cases, treasurers would do well to ensure there is flexibility to be opportunistic. There could be a window to play offense, not just defence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Greater clarity could yet come between now and the end of 2015. However, one suspects the only certainty for 2016 is uncertainty.</p>

<p>2016 is likely to be about value: what is the value treasury provides to the business? What is the value of the relationships with the banks? Essentially how to create value in a more volatile environment. The key aspects to creating value are: operational execution and relationships. Starting with operational execution, there are a couple of things happening in the business environment that will impact treasurers and their ability to deliver value to the organisation.</p>
<p>Due to regulatory pressures, banks’ appetite for short term non-operational cash is likely to reduce, potentially making it expensive to put this money on deposit for less than 30 days. This is because banks need to put aside capital to cover these highly liquid deposits in case of a sudden market incident. The key task for treasurers is to create a reliable forecast of their cash and funding needs. They need to be able to make informed decisions about how to best manage their excess cash, and when and where to best attract funding.</p>
<p>Markets have become a bit wobbly of late with the recent RMB devaluation and the US looking to pick the right time to raise the USD interest rates. These developments point to potential further increased FX and interest rate risk. Now would be a good time to review how prepared you are for increased volatility and discuss any required changes in policy settings (risk appetite and financial risk management approaches, for instance) with your board.</p>
<p>The coming year would also be a good time to consider the maturity of the treasury organisation. Are you able to achieve an efficient delivery on the demands placed on treasury? Do you have the right skills and people? Do you have the right tools? Do you have the right level of centralisation considering the business and regulatory environment? Should you be moving to a more integrated treasury model, such as an in-house bank?</p>
<p>This brings us to the second aspect: relationships. To be successful, a treasurer increasingly needs to be a business partner. Treasurers should be thinking about how to proactively engage the business and understand the organisation operationally so it is in a position to provide relevant and timely advice.</p>
<p>The benefits work two ways: treasury is a complex and highly specialised area, and isn’t always understood well by other parts of finance or the wider business. Engaging the business and articulating the value that treasury offers will create understanding and goodwill that can be drawn upon in tougher times.</p>
<p>Moreover, given that banks are increasingly constrained, now would be a great time to review bank relationships and opportunities to strengthen relationships with key banks ahead of the curve. Questions to ask are: which banks do you want to do business with – both on the cash management and funding side? How can you offer preferred banks a bigger share of wallet? How can you communicate this to banks to leverage this position as much as possible when it comes to them prioritising your business as well?</p>

<p>Many companies in the APAC region have been making significant revenue from China, and as the RMB has been appreciating over the last five years, there has been little interest in hedging. However the recent 3% drop in the RMB against the USD has caused many trading companies, which work on tight profit margins, as well as those active in commodities, to re-examine their hedging strategy for the Chinese market. There is likely to be new priorities as companies with RMB revenues and USD costs almost certainly seek better hedging strategies, better hedge accounting and better exposure visibility. Treasurers therefore should examine the benefits of early adopting IFRS 9 to achieve a better accounting outcome especially when hedging commodity risk, cross currency debt or using option strategies.</p>
<p>What’s more, APAC companies have been taking advantage of the lower USD interest rates and the appreciating RMB to borrow in USD. But now, corporates are starting to fund their operations onshore in China, which wasn’t the case before. Next year, APAC treasurers will need to look at the market to determine where it makes sense to locate their funding activities. Related to this, CFO’s will be demanding a reduction in interest expense. Treasurers should look at intercompany lending and evolving in-house bank techniques to better manage interest expense.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we have already seen evidence of corporates moving their regional treasury centres to Shanghai, closer to the revenue source and as The Hong Kong government budget includes a plan to attract more regional treasury centres and as many Chinese corporates as possible, because of its tax efficiency, freely exchangeable currency, and less regulated market. Companies planning to create a centralised treasury next year will be seriously considering Hong Kong as an alternative to Singapore and even Shanghai.</p>
<p>In terms of liquidity and risk management considerations for the upcoming year, the current uncertainties about Chinese growth (2.5% versus 7% officially) will cause companies to take a close look at their liquidity resources, and to consider treasury technology to better identify FX exposures, improve cash forecasting, perform hedging operations and use hedge accounting to protect against greater P&amp;L volatility. Improved risk management tools will be needed to deal with any crisis in China. These include simulations, what-if scenarios, sensitivity analysis and cash flow at risk. Better decisions will require analysis of complex situations, such as the relationship between commodity prices, the USD/RMB and other regional currencies such as AUD or JPY. Many organisations in the region are still cash rich (insurance companies, for instance), and low local interest rates and euro weakness may encourage M&amp;A activity in Europe. Take Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest man, for instance, who started to sell off his China assets last April due to his negative outlook on the China economy and property market and is now redeploying assets to Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, the drivers of TMS projects in APAC are presently liquidity and working capital management, and counterparty exposure management. The renewed volatility will see currency and interest rate risk management as drivers of treasury and risk management projects. As a consequence of organic growth and M&amp;A activity, RFPs are asking for cloud platforms to support geographical growth as historical concerns in the region are now mitigated. Cloud solutions are increasingly seen to have an attractive price point, and add value because they outsource maintenance and disaster recovery, and do not require a big team for support. These factors are also enabling more and more mid-sized companies to seek cloud solutions for their treasury operations.</p>

<p><em>With a spell of tremendous market volatility in the wake of the devaluation of the renminbi (RMB) now behind us, it is perhaps an ideal time to review the new options that have emerged in recent years allowing corporates to transfer exposures offshore. Is this the right time for corporates to look again at bringing RMB into their global cash pools? Citi’s Managing Director, Asia Pacific Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions Munir Nanji believes it is.</em></p>
<p>The People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) decision in August 2015 to allow for a depreciation in the RMB against the dollar serves as a timely reminder of the importance of RMB internationalisation, both for foreign multinationals doing business in the country and domestic Chinese companies alike.</p>
<p>Already, the event is shaping conversations that leading banks are having with their corporate clients around liquidity management strategies. Although, several years ago, when informed of the first new pilot schemes permitting cross-border pooling in RMB or foreign currencies, initial interest from treasurers was somewhat muted (given the very good rates on deposits in China at the time and the fact the currency was appreciating); circumstances are now quite different. Now the PBoC is, albeit very gradually, allowing market forces to assume a greater role in determining the RMB’s value and treasurers should understand that this means the currency may not be as stable in the future as it has been historically.</p>
<p>“The volatility has been significant,” remarks Munir Nanji, Asia Pacific Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, at Citi. “As China liberalises and the currency becomes part of a larger financial system, more volatility is inevitable.” The interest rate environment is in a similar state of flux, as evidenced by an apparent distinction between the onshore and offshore markets. While the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) has fallen (in the past year) from the 3% to 1% range, its offshore counterpart, the CNH Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), has been moving in an opposite and more volatile direction, climbing from the 5% range to 10% immediately following the devaluation.</p>
<p>As such, there are now strong risk management and investment imperatives adding to the funding efficiency case for incorporating RMB into global cash pools. “If you are a treasurer then just a few weeks ago you were probably thinking that you may as well hold on to RMB since it was a strengthening currency,” says Nanji. “But then there is a sudden devaluation taking place and heightened volatility in both the FX and interest rate markets. Now treasurers at head offices outside of China are probably thinking that the time has come to get RMB connected to those global pools, because by doing that they can hedge the excess RMB positions and ensure Chinese entities are supporting the liquidity needs across the group, and vice versa. They know now that they need to act.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-story-so-far"">The story so far</h3>
<p>Given the reforms of recent years, there is really no excuse not to act. Over the past five years, China has consistently demonstrated its commitment to liberalising trade, by promoting the currency and taking numerous other steps to open up the economy.</p>
<p>With the ambition of offering Chinese corporates procuring raw materials abroad to begin using RMB as a settlement currency, the Chinese authorities began easing regulations around convertibility in 2009 with the launch of a milestone pilot scheme for cross-border trade settlement in RMB. Since then, the pace of reform has astonished many seasoned China-watchers. Trade settlement was in due course expanded nationwide; offshore clearing centres were established in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and London; and beginning in 2014, RMB and foreign currency cross-border pooling was introduced through the Nationwide and Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) testbeds.</p>
<p>A more conducive regulatory environment has been matched by infrastructural improvements. “This means that companies that wish to include RMB in their global cash pool that is managed from, say, Europe or the US, are able to pay beneficiaries in China on time,” says Nanji. “If the cash pool is resided in London, for example, the payment would normally route to Hong Kong via the SWIFT network. Hong Kong would utilise its domestic clearing system (CHATS) to route the payment further through the China National Advanced Payment System (CNAPS) to the final beneficiary in China.”</p>
<p>Of course, the various ‘hops’ in this process mean this is not quite as straightforward and streamlined a process as one would like with the current infrastructure not being sufficient to provide cross-border RMB clearing on a real-time basis. “It’s not as simple as one would like, but there is infrastructure there,” says Nanji. “There will be reject rates, obviously, because of the many different systems money must pass through and the information required for a straight through transaction. But, as your pools become centralised, you can use the infrastructure now in place, with the long awaited Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) aiming to provide a seamless clearing infrastructure for cross border RMB payments.”</p>
<h3 id=""sftz-or-nationwide"">SFTZ or nationwide?</h3>
<p>Over the past year, China has been gradually expanding some of the policies tested in the SFTZ nationwide. For treasurers in China this raises the question of whether to leverage the initiatives in the SFTZ or look to the programme being permitted by the regulators at a national level.</p>
<p>Based on an internal survey done by Citi across 250 respondents, over half were still looking for further infrastructure changes before using the SFTZ as a key treasury location. Key reasons for leveraging the SFTZ have been driven by already being located within the zone, especially with the geographic expansion and the significance of China to the overall business growth and strategy.</p>
<p>Nanji expects that it will not be long before we see these minor discrepancies ironed out, as we have seen from the recent regulatory announcements relaxing the borrowing quotas and qualification criteria for the nationwide programme. This is largely driven by the success of the SFTZ which gives the regulatory authorities the confidence they need to take the entire experiment nationwide. “If you are already sitting in the SFTZ then clearly it is very easy to join,” he explains. “It becomes more complicated when you are in another location and you have to decide, do I join the nationwide zone or do I join the SFTZ? For that reason, I think, we are going to gradually see more harmony.”</p>

<h3 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h3>
<p>Interest in both the SFTZ and nationwide amongst Citi’s client base has already been very robust, and the bank expects this to accelerate even further in the coming years. This is a natural consequence of the RMB’s growing acceptance as an international currency for treasury and gradually with trade (in August 2015, for instance, SWIFT revealed RMB had become the fourth most-used currency for international payments, passing the Japanese yen, Canadian and Australian dollars in the last year).</p>
<p>But it is also a reflection of the fact that corporates transacting in RMB are becoming ever more cognisant of the benefits of connecting RMB and foreign currency in China to the group’s global pools when using the currency for trade. First and foremost, there is the matter of reducing complexity around counterparty FX and processing for Chinese entities. “If you are a Chinese subsidiary, you need to think about the simplicity,” Nanji explains. “That is the biggest benefit for them.” The benefits do not end there though. Chinese subsidiaries can use pooling structures to bring money into the country to finance both their own operations and those of their critical suppliers (something which may assume greater importance should economic conditions in China deteriorate and delinquencies begin to increase).</p>
<p>The benefits of unlocking all of that trapped cash that has been building up in China are also felt offshore too. China is now the second largest economy in the world and, as such, any company with business there will have a very large portion of their revenue there. Would it not be much better for corporates to have those revenues sitting inside their global cash pool? Nanji certainly thinks so. “If treasurers have all the other currencies in their cash pool but the second biggest economy in the world is not connected I think that is just sad,” he says. “It’s a pity that some companies are using the Japanese yen and the euro, but not RMB.”</p>
<p>The benefits of integration are every bit as applicable for Chinese corporates offshore too. Big Chinese names – take Huawei and Alibaba as an example – are now increasingly global in their outlook and, as such, are exploring how cash pooling solutions might benefit them. “Knowing that they have got to report back their foreign currency sales in RMB, some of them are considering establishing pools offshore, which would offer them the ability to also set-up treasury centres offshore,” says Nanji.</p>
<h3 id=""leading-the-way"">Leading the way</h3>
<p>As more and more corporates become sold on the idea of incorporating China into their global cash pools, the only difficult decision left for the treasurer to make is in choosing which bank is best placed to help them achieve this. What bank has all the right resources and experience to help them navigate the various bureaucratic requirements?</p>
<p>In attempting to answer this question, treasurers might wish to consider which bank has over the past five years been leading the way with every new regulatory development in China’s FX market over the past five years. “We have a long track record in working with companies getting the necessary approvals from SAFE and PBoC,” says Nanji. “Whether it was the first cross-border lending that took place; the companies that established netting programmes; the companies that want to set-up offshore centres – each time we are proud to say that we have been the first in the market,” says Nanji.</p>
<p>In working so closely with the Chinese regulators, Citi is also now in a unique position amongst the banks to influence how such reforms are implemented on behalf of their clients. “In many ways we have been able to shape the regulatory thinking,” he says. “We assure the regulators. We show them how we actually link platforms together globally, and they come to our offices and through these induction processes gain some level of confidence on how the systems work and, as a result, we can get them to think about setting up infrastructure for these companies.”</p>
<p>Add to the above Citi’s long standing relationship with financial infrastructure providers such as SWIFT, corporate treasurers should be left in no doubt as to who can bring the best support for the enablement of the RMB as an international currency.</p>

<p><em>As loose monetary policy starts to look like part of the problem rather than the solution, lingering sluggish growth and rising debt are a recipe for more volatile financial markets. Since the best solution, to implement rapid far-reaching reforms, is politically unfeasible, ECR Research asks: what is the answer?</em></p>
<p>Lately, share prices have been fluctuating far more than in recent years. We suspect that larger movements are on the horizon, including in most other financial markets such as the currency and commodity markets.</p>
<p>This forecast is partly – but not exclusively – due to the fact that most markets are less liquid than before, because of new regulations, specifically those for the financial sector. Also relevant is the fact that global economies are generally less stable. Moreover, the authorities are running out of options when it comes to taking countermeasures. All of this is intimately connected with the massive debts that have been accumulated over the past few decades. In addition, there is overcapacity in manufacturing; a sector that is very important to the emerging economies but whose significance has paled in the industrialised world.</p>
<p>To keep the situation under control, growth needs to stay high in other sectors in the developed countries, for instance, the services sector. Otherwise, economies are in danger of collapsing under the debt burden. Maintaining growth at an acceptable level and lowering unemployment require loose monetary policy virtually everywhere (fiscal stimulus is out of the question in most cases, due to high public debts). Only in the US and Japan have jobless rates fallen to the extent that growth will soon have to slow to potential (ie the sum of the increase in the workforce plus the increase in productivity).</p>

<p>Ageing populations and insufficient immigration mean that workforce growth is minimal. To lift potential growth to a level where the debt will be sustainable, productivity will need to increase substantially. This can be achieved through structural reforms and higher investment. Unfortunately, loose monetary policy on an ongoing basis is preventing both. Also, because the reforms are very unpopular among voters, politicians prefer to keep the economy ticking over by means of ultra-loose monetary policy instead of implementing reforms that will not pay off until a number of years have passed.</p>
<p>Plus, accommodative monetary policy keeps afloat inefficient and outmoded businesses that produce superseded goods and/or services. For productivity to increase, such companies should make way for modern and efficient businesses.</p>
<h3 id=""monetary-easing-the-paradox"">Monetary easing: the paradox</h3>
<p>Another negative is that monetary easing has sent share prices up well above levels that could be justified by economic developments. However, the downside is that businesses do not invest enough, even if they are sitting on huge stacks of cash. The reason is that very few investments yield sufficiently high returns to justify the share price surge.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, although expansionary monetary policy is necessary to stave off economic collapse, it has a downward effect on long-term growth potential. This is particularly true in Europe, where unemployment is high and wage increases are low. More monetary impulses will be required to underpin the economy.</p>
<p>By now, however, loose monetary policy is beginning to look like part of the problem rather than the solution. Also, the financial regulators are imposing more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions, leading to tighter lending conditions. Yet, from a macro-economic perspective, access to credit must improve, or the economy will implode. Central banks need to ease their policies further and drive up asset prices to compensate for all of this.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream/ECR</em></p>
<p>The situation differs around the world. As explained earlier, before long, US economic growth will have to slow to potential (approximately 1.5%). This rate is too low to sustain the huge debt burden. Therefore, share prices will fall as credit spreads widen but once prices fall by over 20% the economy will be hit hard and monetary easing will have to be on the cards again. And even though equity prices will bounce back and credit spreads will narrow, these effects will be short-lived as potential growth will be declining.</p>
<p>However, it will not stop there. If growth is sluggish in Europe and slows to around 1.5% in the US, it will not be high enough in other countries relative to the debt burdens. Most of all in the Asian emerging markets, so monetary easing will be required in these countries, too, eventually. Consequently, even though debts are already high, the debt mountains will continue to grow.</p>
<h3 id=""time-to-reform"">Time to reform?</h3>
<p>This underlies our forecast that price fluctuations will increase in the future. Share prices will discount the fact that economic growth will continue to be sluggish as the debt burden increases. As a result, credit spreads will widen. However, the economy is too fragile to cope with plunging share prices and widening credit spreads. The best solution would be the rapid implementation of far-reaching structural reforms everywhere. Politically, this is unfeasible.</p>
<p>At best, all we can hope for is a gradual unfolding of this process. This is why (more) monetary easing will be on the cards as soon as share prices plummet and credit spreads widen substantially. In the first week of September, the ECB and several Fed members hinted at this. Following a stimulus, both the stock markets and credit spreads will recover but not for long. They’ll soon change course again. Even more so if monetary policy stays accommodative (because growth is too slow).</p>
<p>These developments will not unfold at the same pace or to the same degree in different areas across the globe. Therefore, currency fluctuations are bound to gain momentum. And this is something which has already started: witness the movements of the euro and the EM currencies against the dollar in the past months, for instance.</p>
<p>In Europe, it will be necessary to pursue very loose monetary policy for quite some time to come. The reasons: high jobless rates, low wage increases, fairly sluggish growth, and minimal inflation. Conditions in the US are different: unemployment has dropped so much that higher wage increases can be expected in the near future. This does not mean that the Fed will be able to really tighten its policy – which would have been better in terms of productivity developments – but at least it can begin to take steps in this direction, long before Europe does the same.</p>
<p>This points to policy divergences between the US and Europe, which will automatically increase the price fluctuations. All the more so if it becomes necessary to apply monetary easing at speed, in case of another stock market rout and/or widening credit spreads and an appreciating dollar. Such a bumpy monetary ride is a recipe for significant gyrations in financial markets.</p>

<p><em>If we are to believe the stock markets, all is well in Europe. But are markets in danger of underestimating looming perils such as populism, a Brexit, German dominance and weakening European power? ECR investigates.</em></p>
<p>The Greek crisis has been gnawing at the foundations of European unity for quite some time now. Negotiations over new aid have been conducted in combination with domestic political developments, Europe-wide trends, external threats and personal clashes. The result is that parties on either side have dug themselves into a hole, suffered from tunnel vision, and frequently ignored emotions and arguments put forward by the opposition. In this polarised climate, the real purpose of the negotiations has largely disappeared from view.</p>
<h3 id=""a-move-away-from-the-centre"">A move away from the centre</h3>
<p>An important implication of the events in Greece is an increase in the popularity of Europe’s left-wing as well as right-wing populist parties. In the weak Eurozone countries, the leftist populist movements are making headway (for example, Podemos in Spain). The right-wing populists, too, have the political wind in their sails (for example, Lega Nord in Italy).</p>

<p>And in the ‘stronger’ Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) countries, the parties that are acting against immigration, European dictates, and the euro are doing well: for instance, the PVV (the Netherlands), the Fins (formerly the True Fins), the DPP (Denmark) and so on. Often, such parties combine a conservative, right-wing bias (sometimes mixed with racism) and left-wing viewpoints on pensions and healthcare.</p>
<p>The aforementioned parties are able to flourish because ‘the masses’ feel disenfranchised; powerless to influence the governance of their own country, for which they blame globalisation and the European integration process, as well as self-serving elites. German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche stated that: “The democratisation of Europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the breeding of tyrants.” Regardless of whether it is justified, this fear is what lies behind the dissatisfaction of many European citizens who believe that a small group of people, backed by powerful business interests are firmly in charge; whereas, ordinary people are left to the mercy of overwhelming global political and economic forces.</p>
<p>In the words of George Will, a US conservative political commentator, “the question we settle in an election is not whether elites shall rule but which elite shall rule.” Numerous voters think that the elites – wherever they are on the political spectrum – have failed and should be ejected from power. This helps politicians who are seen as ‘outsiders’ or who are good at creating the illusion that they do not belong to the political establishment. It lends credibility to their claim that this time, everything will be different.</p>
<h3 id=""brexit-further-disintegration"">Brexit: further disintegration?</h3>
<p>European integration could be undermined further due to the threat of a Brexit. Prime Minister Cameron has promised a referendum regarding Britain’s EU membership – at the latest in 2017, when he hopes to have negotiated new conditions for a renewed British membership. It is feared that Westminster’s demands will compromise a fundamental tenet of the European project: the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. Cameron wants to curb the latter, in particular. He is also opposed to any attempts towards an ‘ever closer union’. In addition, he wants to reduce the EU budget and repatriate powers from Brussels.</p>
<p>The sorry Greek saga has reinforced the British belief that the EU should be overhauled. Bridging loans for Greece are financed by the EU; not the Eurozone. Every attempt is made to ensure that non-EMU states do not run risks in this respect. Yet, the British do not like the direction things are headed.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, British EU-sceptics see Greece’s woes as an opportunity. They hope that Cameron can land several ‘scoops’ for the UK during the negotiations on Eurozone and EU strengthening. His approach will be: “I really want to put the Eurozone on a firmer footing but can you guarantee that it will not steamroller London when taking future decisions and what will you give me in exchange for my support, which is essential?” A fascinating political game, played for high stakes is guaranteed.</p>
<h3 id=""the-paris-berlin-axis"">The Paris-Berlin axis</h3>
<p>But right now, more important than hanging on to the British, is keeping the French-German relationship on track. The European project was built on the Paris-Berlin axis from the start. France’s political and military might and the German economic miracle made for an equilibrium of sorts. German reunification threw the relationship off balance to some degree though and it has continued to deteriorate as Germany has far-exceeded France’s economic performance.</p>
<p>Moreover, the eastward expansion of the EU has put Berlin at the geographical heart of the union, replacing Paris as the central hub. The credit crisis (and its ramifications) has further reinforced Germany’s position as Europe’s dominant power.</p>
<p>It was hoped that European integration would render Germany more ‘European’. Now, many fear that Europe is becoming more German. Berlin is not consciously striving for hegemony, but it is prepared to take the lead, although it does not want to be seen as a ‘bully’. Many think it is already too late and that the euro crisis has poisoned Germany’s attitude towards Europe and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Nationalism, populism, ideological rifts, and economic worries are distracting leaders from other pressing issues, like the chaos at its southern borders and the Russian threat.

In the latter areas, it has incurred heavy damage – internal divides are widening and political unity has declined.</p>
<p>For the moment, Greece may have been saved from the abyss but the underlying weaknesses of the Eurozone and the EU remain in place. Still, we do not think Europe will disintegrate for the foreseeable future. After all, the EU project is of importance to the European leaders.

This is not forgotten and the EU leaders will not easily abandon the project.</p>

<p><em>Slowing growth and rising interest rates in the global economy could be important signals for things to come. ECR takes a look at how diverging monetary policies, amongst other factors, across the world’s various regions are having a knock-on effect on each other’s economies – but not always in the best way.</em></p>
<p>A contracting US economy and weakening Chinese growth over the first quarter of this year have led international institutions to revise down their growth projections for the global economy in the past weeks. The OECD expects 2015 growth of 3.1% (instead of 3.6%) while the World Bank estimates that global growth will be 2.8% (instead of 3%). Simultaneously, bond yields have risen substantially in various countries. This combination of a growth slowdown around the world and rising interest rates bodes ill for equities and corporate bonds, which have seen price drops in recent months.</p>
<h3 id=""addressing-the-contradiction"">Addressing the contradiction</h3>
<p>At first glance, weaker growth and rising long-term interest rates seem to contradict each other but there is an explanation. The growth expectations for the coming quarters to years are good and the US downturn was mostly caused by temporary factors. Over the coming period, higher consumer income and more borrowing (because consumers are growing in confidence and their net wealth has increased) will likely boost US growth. Expanding consumption will prompt businesses to up investment, as jobless rates fall and wage growth increases. This could generate an upward economic spiral in the US.</p>
<p>In Europe and Japan, too, growth prospects are improving. Akin to developments in the US, the Japanese labour market is tightening. This puts upward pressure on wages while incomes are on the rise. Although yen weakness and last year’s sales tax are affecting purchasing power, rising asset prices are good news for consumers. A cheaper currency benefits Japanese exports.</p>

<p>Presently (the delayed effects of) euro weakness, lower oil prices, and accommodative ECB policy and low long-term interest rates are boosting the Eurozone economy. Asset prices rose as consumer confidence picked up. Many purchases are being made that had been deferred in the past years as businesses are more willing to invest. At the same time, a tightening labour market is a distant prospect in Europe. Consequently, the upward pressure on wage increases will be limited for the time being (except in countries such as the UK and Germany). The upside is that this will allow the ECB to continue with loose monetary policy for longer, which will stimulate the economy.</p>
<h3 id=""focus-on-emerging-markets"">Focus on emerging markets</h3>
<p>The Chinese authorities are taking measures to counter the growth slowdown. Recent data suggests that this is successful. However, because it would be dangerous to further inflate the credit bubble, they cannot stimulate the economy to maximum effect. This means China is unlikely to further drag down the global economy whereas the Chinese demand for resources and other import products will not increase considerably for now; it could even decline. This does not bode well for the (commodity-exporting) emerging markets (EMs). On top of this, many businesses in the emerging economies have large (dollar) debts. Presently, economic growth is slowing, the dollar is appreciating, and dollar interest rates are rising (in anticipation of Fed tightening). Therefore, borrowing is stagnant in these countries. This is hampering growth.</p>

<h3 id=""monetary-policy-concerns"">Monetary policy concerns</h3>
<p>For the moment, the EMs are a source of downward pressure on global economic growth, whereas growth prospects are improving in the developed countries. Here, deflation fears have eased while inflation risks are on the increase. This points to less accommodative monetary policy around the world over the long term, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In countries where central banks have immediately pulled out all the stops (the US and the UK), the economies have recovered the most and monetary tightening will start in the not too distant future. By contrast, the authorities in the Eurozone and Japan will wait longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owing to the downward pressure on growth and inflation theoretically, central banks in the EMs are in a position to open the liquidity spigots. However, we expect them to exert caution as monetary easing would weaken their currencies against the dollar. If so, dollar debts would become a bigger burden. As debts have already soared in many emerging economies, many are not keen to step up borrowing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not immediately clear what effect this will have on the financial markets. In any case, a positive is that global monetary policy will continue to be loose. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan will keep the money tap open, while central banks in the EMs will be inclined to ease rather than tighten their policies. As soon as the Fed or the Bank of England (BoE) increases interest rates, the dollar and/or the pound could appreciate substantially. This could act as a drag on growth in these countries. In other words, once the Fed and/or the BoE tighten their policies, they will do so gradually.</p>
<h3 id=""knock-on-effects"">Knock-on effects</h3>
<p>Also relevant is that weaker growth and overcapacity in the EMs could put ‘the right amount’ of downward pressure on US inflation. In that event, the Fed will not need to substantially tighten its policy – initially, at least. In the West, this will be good for growth and it will create more export opportunities to Western countries in the EMs. If so, the global economic growth will improve due to better growth prospects, low inflation, and accommodative monetary policy.</p>

<p>On the downside, ultra loose monetary policy around the world has driven stock prices beyond their equilibrium levels whereas long-term interest rates are far below equilibrium. Under such conditions, a minor deterioration of the monetary climate is often enough to trigger a trend reversal. Especially if further tightening is in the air. Of course, if asset prices plunge and long-term interest rates soar, central banks will refrain from (further) tightening at first. Even if there is upward pressure on inflation. Simultaneously, a large-scale monetary stimulus is unlikely as it would drive up inflation expectations further. In other words, many investors may have unrealistic expectations of future central bank interventions to boost asset prices.</p>
<p>Liquidity also gives cause for concern. Many markets have become more illiquid, due to new regulations. And there is another factor at play. As long as central banks continued to create extra money in order to purchase government bonds – which forced investors to buy more and more risky assets – asset prices kept rising and credit spreads kept dropping. There were always enough investors willing to sell their assets in order to take profit. This will change once one of the most important demand drivers in the asset markets (monetary policy) loses momentum and gradually disappears. Whereas numerous investors will want to sell their overly expensive assets, there will not be enough buyers. As a result, asset prices will plummet and long-term interest rates could spike.</p>

<p>Lastly, the negative implications of less accommodative monetary policy – first in the US and the UK and then in Japan and the EMU – will come to the fore over the coming quarters. The recent bond yield rally is an initial signal. Diverging monetary policies could stir up volatility in the currency markets, too. Further rising long-term interest rates and a stronger dollar are developments to be reckoned with.</p>

Also, what are the implications for free trade and globalisation if China is no longer content to play second fiddle? ECR answers these questions and more.</em></p>
<p>Xi Jinping is the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping. Xi’s strategy has four pillars: economic growth, nationalism, repression, and the control of information. His authoritarian leadership and his role as reformer have a big impact on the world.</p>
<p>China thinks it is completely normal to be the largest show in town. The economic historian Angus Maddison calculated that China has been the biggest global economy for two millennia. In 1820, it accounted for a third of the world’s GDP. Viewed from this angle, China is simply on its way back to the top spot where it feels it belongs. However, the average Chinese citizen will lag the average US consumer for a long time to come with regard to spending power. Whether both countries will ever reach the same height is an open question.</p>
<p>Equally unclear is whether it will be possible for China to continue to advance in the global hierarchy without huge upheavals. Ideally, equilibrium should be reached whereby China adapts to international structures as the international community makes room for Beijing at the table and allows China to help shape global institutions, frameworks, and etiquette.</p>
<p>On the one hand, China is being given more opportunities to leave its mark on the international order. On the other hand, countries are sending out signals that point to distrust and a wall of resistance against China. In some ways, China is trying to act as a responsible partner and stakeholder on the global stage. For instance, it has started to take part in peace missions.</p>
<p>There is also no doubt that Beijing has been successful in launching the new Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AAIB). The membership of the bank has proved very attractive. It already has around 60 (prospective) members including Australia, Russia, South Korea as well as the four largest EU economies.</p>
<p>But this is meant as an alternative to the World Bank. And as such, the Americans have been sceptical about the AIIB initiative and the run of interest in membership clearly took the US by surprise. In political terms, the AIIB has turned out to be a spectacular piece of propaganda. Whether the bank will be equally successful as a driver of investment and projects in Asia is a moot point.</p>
<h3 id=""power-struggles"">Power struggles</h3>
<p>In other areas, the Chinese advance has been far from smooth. The Americans and Chinese are trying to steal a march on each other with their plans for trade blocs: the US with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), while Beijing is putting its money on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Most observers believe that the TPP and the RCEP boil down to macho behaviour and power politics between the US and China.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Understandably, Western media like to depict such power games as a struggle between liberal democracy and authoritarian state capitalism. Up to a point, this may be correct but it is in China’s interests to adhere to, and maintain, the basic rules and elementary conditions for capitalism. No other country has benefited so much from free trade and globalisation. Beijing will not quickly try to impose state capitalism on other countries. At the same time, it is increasingly noticeable that many states are becoming less convinced that the liberal economic model is essential for economic prosperity and other leaders may well study the ways of the Communist Party on the assumption that economic success could go hand in hand with an iron grip on power.</p>
<p>China’s increasing power fuels the rivalry with the US. Leaders on both sides may reiterate that the two powers can collaborate harmoniously at the top of the global pyramid. However, in the past millennia, the ruling hegemony has often found it hard to offer opportunities to – let alone make way for – other emerging superpowers. Meanwhile, the latter do not hesitate to seek confrontation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Beijing will probably continue to play second fiddle for a little while yet as the US continues to keep the time with the baton. The US has many faithful allies, its military superiority is unparalleled in history, and its economic scope is such that it is bound to be the dominant world power for years to come.</p>
<h3 id=""the-bigger-picture"">The bigger picture</h3>
<p>Yet the trend is unmistakable. After all, the baton is not glued to the hand of the conductor – and he will find it increasingly hard to keep the orchestra under control. The US and other Asian countries have responded uncomfortably to China’s tempestuous ‘coming of age’. In combination with the Chinese yearning for recognition and additional growth, this could lead to painful situations, which could divide the West and undermine free trade and globalisation.</p>


<blockquote>In many respects, China will want to conform to the established international order. The shared rules that govern relations between countries (which have evolved since the Peace Treaties of Westphalia in 1648) are useful to China.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Some of the countries bordering on China are worried about the security commitments of the US. The American pivot to Asia was supposed to shift the focus to the area around the Pacific Ocean, away from Europe and the Middle East. However, partly because of the Ukraine crisis and the failure of the Arab Spring, the pivot has not really taken off. As a result, both America’s Pacific allies and its partners in Europe and the Middle East have started to harbour doubts about its preparedness to step into the breach, if necessary.</p>
<p>That said, we think Beijing will shy away from creating too much unrest. Its foreign policy needs to be contained within a domestic framework that entails sufficient economic growth, structural reforms and the consolidation of the CCP’s absolute power. Regional stability is part of the plan to realise these objectives.</p>
<p>In many respects, China will want to conform to the established international order. The shared rules that govern relations between countries (which have evolved since the Peace Treaties of Westphalia in 1648) are useful to China. As are the resulting concepts of sovereignty and the balance of power.</p>


<blockquote>In 1914, the global economy collapsed because the then superpowers declared war; whereas today, it is precisely the aversion of the (Western) countries to war that could lead to the unravelling of the global economy.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>However, down the centuries, the international order has largely been shaped by the West and, since WWII, most of all by the US. Institutions, procedures, and conventions that are embedded in this system are often favourable to the West, whereas emerging economies are put at a disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id=""rethinking-the-system"">Rethinking the system</h3>
<p>But things could get bumpy if China is convinced that the current international order acts as a gigantic bureaucracy that aims to guarantee the dominance of the West. This is where German sociologist and political economist Max Weber comes in. Anthropologist David Graeber paraphrased him, saying: “The only real way to rid oneself of an established bureaucracy, is to simply kill them all, as Alaric the Goth did in Imperial Rome, or Genghis Khan in…the Middle East. Leave any significant number of functionaries alive and, within a few years, they will inevitably end up managing one’s kingdom.”</p>
<p>Whereas we are not predicting a destructive world war, China could gradually become convinced that a complete rearrangement of the international system is required if it is to expand its power and prosperity.</p>
<p>In 1914, the global economy collapsed because the then superpowers declared war; whereas today, it is precisely the aversion of the (Western) countries to war that could lead to the unravelling of the global economy. Western fears could push the world over the edge because there is nothing to stop countries such as China from pushing their luck.</p>
<p>Over the coming years, we expect China to change tack repeatedly. Sometimes it will adapt to international order; other times China will try to adapt it – either internally or externally. Should tensions rise steadily, its focus will increasingly be on the latter.</p>

<p>For all the troubles certain elements of the world’s financial sector have created, the watchful body of men and women in each jurisdiction known collectively as the ‘central bank’ are charged with putting financial matters back on an even keel (and hopefully ensuring it doesn’t happen again). The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is just such a body, directing activities and moving the industry forward in one of the region’s most vibrant economic centres.</p>
<h3 id=""established-by-act"">Established by Act</h3>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore Act of 1970 had set in motion the government’s will “to establish a corporation to be known as the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to provide for the exercise of control over and the resolution of financial institutions and their related entities by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and other authorities, and to establish a framework for the issue of securities by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the regulation of primary dealers of such securities, and for matters incidental thereto and connected therewith.” The passing of the Act saw MAS come into being on 1<sup>st</sup> January 1971, assuming authority to regulate all elements of monetary policy, banking, and finance in Singapore.</p>
<p>Before its establishment, monetary activities generally associated with a central bank were performed by several government departments and agencies. As Singapore’s stature as a commercial centre increased, so too did the complexity of its banking and monetary environment, to the point where the status quo was unsustainable. A more dynamic and coherent policy on monetary matters was essential to take the country forward. From the outset MAS has been about the future of the country, not just the present.</p>
<p>MAS has a number of principal objects and functions as laid out by the Act of 1970 (and subsequent revisions):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To act as the central bank of Singapore, conduct monetary policy, issue currency, oversee payment systems and serve as banker to and financial agent of the Government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To conduct integrated supervision of the financial services sector and financial stability surveillance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To maintain price stability conducive to sustainable growth of the economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster a sound and reputable financial centre and to promote financial stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure prudent and effective management of the official foreign reserves of Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To grow Singapore as an internationally competitive financial centre.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MAS has increased its reach into the financial space since its inception. April 1977 saw regulation of the insurance industry come under its wing. In September 1984, the various regulatory functions that were managed under the Securities Industry Act (1973) were also transferred to MAS. This makes it somewhat unusual in the world of central banks, as it is now also the domestic financial regulatory authority.</p>
<p>Also unlike other central banks, MAS regulates the monetary system not by changing interest rates but via a managed exchange rate model that uses the foreign exchange mechanism and intervention in the Singapore Dollar (SGD) market. Currency issuance is now a function of MAS too. This follows its merger with the Board of Commissioners of Currency on 1<sup>st</sup> October 2002, positioning MAS as the sole issuer of banknotes and coins in Singapore. The actual design of the notes and coins – their dimensions, artwork and denominations – are determined by the MAS Monetary Policy Committee with final approval required from the Government. Singapore is a prolific issuer of ‘plastic’ notes (made from a flexible polymer). These are said to last up to five times longer than their paper counterparts, with obvious ‘green’ benefits.</p>
<h3 id=""organisational-structure"">Organisational structure</h3>
<p>MAS is divided into a number of groups and their departments, each with specific functions and accountabilities. These departments include:</p>
<h5 id=""monetary-policy-and-investment"">Monetary policy and investment</h5>
<p>Economic policy is managed by the Economic Analysis Department, maintaining the macroeconomic model of the Singapore economy. The Economic Surveillance and Forecasting Department undertakes surveillance of the domestic and international economies, providing analysis and forecasts to support monetary policy decisions. Markets and investment are part of the Monetary and Domestic Markets Management Department created to implement Singapore’s monetary policy by managing the exchange rate. The Reserve Management Department takes responsibility for the management of Singapore’s official foreign reserves.</p>
<h5 id=""development-and-international"">Development and international</h5>
<p>The Financial Centre Development Department is tasked with supporting the growth of Singapore as an international financial centre. The Financial Markets Development Department has the goal of promoting financial markets in Singapore (the focus being on developing the capital market, asset management and insurance sectors) and fostering a “sound and innovative” technology, payments and exchange infrastructure. The International Department is charged with shaping the development of MAS’s policies on international monetary and financial issues.</p>
<h5 id=""financial-supervision"">Financial supervision</h5>
<p>This is split two ways: Banking Departments I, II and III collectively supervise licensed and regulated banks, merchant banks, finance companies, money changers and remittance agents in Singapore. Its counterpart is the Insurance Department which supervises and regulates insurance companies operating in its jurisdiction.</p>
<h5 id=""capital-markets"">Capital markets</h5>
<p>Capital Markets Intermediaries (CMI) Departments I, II and III take collective responsibility for the admission and supervision of capital markets intermediaries, including securities and futures brokers, fund managers, real estate investment trust managers, corporate finance advisers, financial advisers, insurance brokers, trust companies and credit rating agencies. Meanwhile the Market Conduct Department assumes responsibility for capital markets activities, supervising through the administration of the Securities and Futures Act, the Business Trusts Act and the Singapore Code on Takeovers and Mergers.</p>
<h5 id=""markets-policy-and-infrastructure"">Markets policy and infrastructure</h5>
<p>The Markets Policy and Infrastructure Department has supervisory responsibility for markets and infrastructures, including central counterparties and trade repositories.</p>
<h5 id=""policy-risk-and-surveillance"">Policy, risk and surveillance</h5>
<p>This is divided three ways: The Prudential Policy Department formulates capital and prudential policies for banks, insurance companies and securities firms, aiming to promote a sound and dynamic financial sector in Singapore. The Specialist Risk Department monitors and assesses the risk management processes and controls of individual financial institutions and designated payment systems. Its counterpart, the Macroeconomic Surveillance Department, seeks to identify emerging trends and potential vulnerabilities, closely monitoring and evaluating developments in G-3 and regional economies, as well as the broader international financial markets.</p>
<h5 id=""finance-risk-and-currency"">Finance, risk and currency</h5>
<p>The Finance Department manages MAS’s financial resources. The Risk Management Department develops policies and strategies to mitigate MAS’s business continuity and enterprise-wide risks, as well as the financial risks of its global investments. The Currency Department, as mentioned above, takes responsibility for the issuance of currency and administration of requirements under Singapore’s Currency Act.</p>
<p>Also part of this office is MAS’s Managing Director’s Office within which is subsumed the Internal Audit Department which is required to conduct financial, operational and information systems audits of all MAS operations. This sub-office also oversees the Legal Department and the Corporate Planning and Communications Department.</p>
<h5 id=""corporate-development"">Corporate Development</h5>
<p>A key part of MAS is its Information Technology Department. This enables strategic use of technology and provides IT services to the organisation. As part of this requirement the department manages two nationwide financial networks: MASNET and the MAS Electronic Payment System (MEPS+).</p>


<blockquote>Before its establishment, monetary activities generally associated with a central bank were performed by several government departments and agencies. As Singapore’s stature as a commercial centre increased, so too did the complexity of its banking and monetary environment, to the point where the status quo was unsustainable.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>MASNET is essentially a communications hub, facilitating the submission of MAS returns and data exchanges between banks, FIs, the Singapore Exchange and government agencies.</p>
<p>MEPS+ is the national interbank payment system (real-time gross and government securities settlement). The technology department also oversees the Singapore Clearing House Association and Automated Clearing House and is keen to promote the adoption of e-payments in Singapore.</p>
<p>Also within the Corporate Development group are International Advisory Panel, which advises MAS on Singapore’s financial sector reforms and strategies, and Singapore Note and Coin Advisory Committee, established to advise on the design, introduction and issue of new currency notes and coins.</p>
<h3 id=""what-mas-offers-the-community"">What MAS offers the community</h3>
<p>In carrying out its work, MAS issues various instruments under Acts, Directions (either Directives or Notices), Guidelines, Codes, Practice Notes, Circulars and Policy Statements. Each type of instrument may cover general or specific requirements and is underpinned by a different degree of legal weight, from a matter of statutory requirement to plain advisory.</p>
<p>Acts are passed and issued as statutory law by Parliament but under the expert guidance of MAS. There may also be subsidiary legislation issued under specific Acts, giving more detailed requirements. Directions are aimed at giving specific instructions and could be issued as a Directive, which are general legally binding requirements, or as a Notice, which is a targeted legally binding requirement.</p>
<p>Guidelines typically refer to best practice as should be (but not mandatorily) adopted by specific institutions. Codes meanwhile, refer to preferred conduct around specified activities. Similarly having no force of law are Practice Notes which guide specified institutions around various administrative procedures such as licensing, reporting and compliance. And whereas Policy Statements broadly outline MAS’s core policies, Circulars are just information documents for public information.</p>
<h3 id=""resource-rich"">Resource-rich</h3>
<p>MAS publishes an extensive range of research materials including market commentary, advice and academic research papers, many of which can be obtained from <a href=""http://asia-studies.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Asia-studies.com</a>.</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Review (FSR) analyses local and global economic risks, assessing their possible impact on the financial system and revealing the views of market participants, analysts and the public. Also of note are the MAS Information Papers which highlight key trends, developments and practices in the financial sector. The aim, says MAS is not to be prescriptive but to help disseminate information and enhance understanding of current issues.</p>


<blockquote>MAS is active in regional forums and initiatives in accordance with Singapore’s general advocacy of regional cooperation and integration within Southeast Asia and the wider continent.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Alongside the release of the twice yearly MAS Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) comes the Macroeconomic Review. This is aimed at providing information on the Economic Policy Department’s analysis and assessment of GDP growth and inflation developments in the Singapore economy which helps to explain policy decisions published in the MPS. MAS Staff Papers also analyse current issues but from individual writers’ perspectives. The quarterly MAS Survey of Professional Forecasters is a useful roundup of forecasts of Singapore’s key economic indicators by economists and analysts, based on economic data for the previous quarter provided by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-singapore"">Beyond Singapore</h3>
<p>MAS is active in regional forums and initiatives in accordance with Singapore’s general advocacy of regional cooperation and integration within Southeast Asia and the wider continent. MAS says it maintains regular economic and policy dialogue and technical exchanges with fellow central banks and financial regulators, “to promote the deepening of regional capital markets, strengthening of financial markets, and further developing safety nets for cross-border flows.”</p>
<p>As part of this co-operative stance it has an active role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN+3, the latter being a forum that promotes cooperation between ASEAN and the Northeast Asian nations of China, Japan, and South Korea. MAS is also an active participant in a number of major regional groupings such as the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) and ASEAN Central Bank Governors Meetings.</p>
<p>These relationships are productive. In March 2015 MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) jointly signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Securities Commission of Malaysia and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand to establish a Streamlined Review Framework for the ASEAN Common Prospectus. The Framework is an initiative under the ASEAN Capital Market Forum (ACMF) and represents a further step towards regional capital markets integration. It is intended to facilitate cross-border offerings of Equity Securities and Plain Debt Securities in the region, making it easier to raise capital across ASEAN countries. The hope is that the Framework will be implemented by Q3 2015. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are the first three jurisdictions to sign the MOU. Securities regulators in other ASEAN jurisdictions are expected to participate in the Framework at a later date.</p>
<p>Beyond Asia, MAS is also a member of global bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB), the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and international standard setting bodies such as the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p>
<p>MAS has developed working relationships not only with its ASEAN and Asia Pacific counterparts but also with the likes of the US Federal Reserve Board, the European Central Bank and a number of key European and Latin American central banks and regulators.</p>
<p>These relationships are beneficial in MAS’s work on Anti-Money Laundering and the countering the financing of terrorism. To this end it is also a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), within which Singapore contributes actively to international AML/CFT standard-setting discussions.</p>

<p><em>Despite many starting the year being sceptical about how effective quantitative easing would be in the Eurozone, more recently, optimism is growing. In this article, ECR explores where Eurozone QE might head next and looks at the possible timeline for a rate hike in the US.</em></p>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is flooding the system with liquidity. The result: negative interest rates on safe sovereign bonds in the Eurozone, euro weakness, rising share prices, and narrowing credit spreads. By contrast, central banks in the UK and the US have a tightening bias. However, the effect has been limited as interest rates in both countries are comparatively high, so their stock and bond markets attract a lot of capital from the rest of the world, where monetary policy is still loose. For this reason, both the dollar and the pound are expensive.</p>
<p>Market conditions are almost ideal for investors. There is upward pressure on prices everywhere – particularly on share and property prices. But how much longer will this situation last and when will the period of ultra-loose monetary policy end? In a sense, the answer seems simple. Namely, as soon as an upward economic spiral starts up and the deflation risks have disappeared or as soon as it becomes clear that the drawbacks of the current monetary policy outweigh the advantages.</p>
<p>An equally relevant question is: what will happen when the money taps are turned off? Many prices are bound to tumble but as long as the economy as a whole continues to grow, such price drops need not continue for too long. Nevertheless, long-term interest rates will rise substantially in such a climate.</p>
<h3 id=""growth-prospects-in-europe-increasingly-positive"">Growth prospects in Europe increasingly positive</h3>
<p>Many economists were sceptical about the effectiveness of quantitative easing (QE) in the Eurozone. However, a few months after the ECB started QE, we are seeing more optimism. To start with, bond yields have dropped further than expected. This is because two important European institutions are pursuing totally opposite policies in terms of credit supply. On the one hand, the financial regulators are forcing the banks to shrink their balance sheets and build up capital buffers. Both requirements imply that the banks can only supply limited credit. In addition, to comply with current regulation banks, insurers and pension funds need or want to have a substantial portion of their assets invested in safe government bonds (even if these are loss-making, due to negative interest rates).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ECB is pulling out all the stops to get credit to ease, as this would be good for growth and ward off deflation. Therefore, the central bank has been pumping huge amounts of money into the financial system to ensure that the banks can lend more – to such an extent that deposit rates have turned negative.</p>
<p>Recent data shows that, by now, minimal interest rates and money creation by the ECB are having a positive effect on lending. On top of this, euro weakness and rising property prices are boosting Eurozone growth (on the back of low interest rates, many investors are buying real estate in anticipation of a handsome profit). In combination with lower oil prices, this explains why the European growth data has recently exceeded expectations. In other words, it appears that the ECB is helping an economy that has already started to improve. This has prompted numerous commentators to recommend an early end to QE. Presently, the ECB maintains that it will stay the course until September 2016, as planned. However, if the data continues to develop positively, this may well be too much of a good thing.</p>
<h3 id=""european-specific-trends"">European-specific trends</h3>
<p>Germany already has full employment and wages are increasing. The current rates of interest are far too low for Germany, whereas the euro is too cheap, which causes growth to accelerate even more. If Germany is to prevent inflation, as well as various other imbalances, it will need a tighter monetary policy in the not too distant future, especially since it will not be possible to offset the disproportionate monetary easing (for Germany) through tight fiscal policy and/or so-called macro prudential measures.</p>

<p>The question is: what will weigh heavier as far as the central bank is concerned? The need to stimulate the weak economies through ultra-loose monetary policy, or the fact that the Eurozone’s strongest economy will weaken unless monetary tightening takes place? It has been said that it would be ‘good news’ for the rest of Europe if the German economy overheats, as this would boost Germany’s export sector. In the short term, this could be true but eventually, imbalances will occur that are bound to undermine the robust German economy. In addition, there is little doubt that rising inflation in Germany will strengthen the anti-Europe movement. If we combine this with the possibility of a Grexit, which could be very costly for Germany – losses of up to €100-€150bn would be conceivable – it is clear that Eurozone tensions could run high.</p>
<p>Considering the pros and cons, our conclusion is that the ECB will probably continue with its current policy but it could yield to German pressure (eg decide to unwind QE earlier) in the autumn. At the same time, we cannot rule out that Eurozone tensions will flare up before that time. Firstly, due to the question whether it is wise to keep Greece in the European Monetary Union (EMU) and subsequently, due to disagreements about adapting the monetary policy to Germany’s needs.</p>
<h3 id=""higher-us-lending-rate-a-matter-of-time"">Higher US lending rate a matter of time</h3>
<p>The prospects for the US economy are bright. As a result of robust job growth and rising wages, aggregate income has increased and so have asset values, while inflation is low, which is boosting purchasing power. The most likely prognosis seems to be that US economic growth will pick up in the near future. If growth improves, it will only be a matter of time before jobless rates drop so much that wage increases start to rise – leading to an upward economic spiral in the US. We predict an initial Fed rate hike would soon follow.</p>
<p>Currently, the markets are discounting very slow and limited rate hikes in the United States. In all likelihood, the thinking is that as indebtedness is still high (while asset prices could show a knee-jerk reaction to monetary tightening), higher interest rates will soon affect credit supply and economic growth. ECR sees this differently: we expect a rate hike once wage increases are on the rise, which will make the economy better able to cope with rising interest rates. Furthermore, it will attract more capital flows to the US, which will compensate for the adverse effect of the Fed rate hikes.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream/ECR</em></p>
<p>Based on the above, we do not think the Fed will be in any real hurry to increase interest rates. In any event, we would expect the Fed to move very slowly at the start of the tightening process. Therefore, initially we do not foresee substantial damage to the financial markets (although a sea change from accommodative to restrictive is too significant to leave the markets cold). Subsequently, conditions in the stock and bond markets could worsen rapidly on rising inflation expectations due to accelerating growth, higher wages, and (overly) loose monetary policy. Higher inflation expectations will put upward pressure on bond yields and fuel speculation on faster Fed rate hikes.</p>
<p>Although, for the coming months, we expect fairly strong downward pressure on long-term interest rates, higher economic growth, rising inflation expectations and tighter Fed policy will result in rising long-term rates later this year. We expect the ten-year EUR swap rate to rise to 1.25% while the ten-year USD swap rate could rise to 2.9% at the end of 2015.</p>

Megatrends revisited: is the West backed into a corner?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>In 2011, ECR Research identified the eight megatrends that defined the markets. Now, as these trends continue to determine both the global politico-economic and geopolitical climates – and with that, movements in the financial markets – it is important to revisit their significance. These megatrends are:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The emergence of new (great) powers and how the ‘old guard’ reacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shortcomings of the international economic system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The West’s unsustainable debt burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ageing populations, which take a heavy toll on public finances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wars as a result of competition over limited resources, food and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New media and technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General distrust of the establishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-state players – such as multinationals, NGOs and popular movements, on the global stage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Four years on, these eight developments are perhaps even more relevant than ever before since the trends in question are making things increasingly difficult for Western countries. Based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), China has overtaken the US as the world’s largest economy. The Eurozone, on the other hand, has not regained the economic strength it demonstrated before the Great Recession. At the global political table, the positions of the US and Europe are being systematically undermined.</p>
<p>China, however, is not excluded from the issues global financial markets face. Failures of the international economic system are yet to be addressed and debts are irresponsibly high in the public and the private sectors. As Martin Wolf, British journalist and influential writer on economics, recently explained, the aggregate debt of Chinese businesses and households has increased by 70% in the period 2007-2014. If indebtedness in the financial sector is added to this figure, the amount increases to 111%; and in combination with public debt, the grand total runs to 124%.</p>
<p>With the exception of Israel, debt as a percentage of GDP has increased in all high income countries. Additionally, the inequality – an inevitable result of the way the system operates – leads to more unrest and dissatisfaction for local populations. French economist, Thomas Piketty, has pushed the topic of inequality high up political agendas but it remains difficult to determine whether the response is purely superficial. In other words, will the politicians really try hard to counter inequality? For now, the answer isn’t clear.</p>
<h3 id=""resources-a-balancing-act"">Resources: a balancing act</h3>
<p>ECR Research predicts that the debt mountains and weaknesses of the international economy will become glaringly evident in the coming years. As more employees retire, the ratio between workers and non-workers will also become increasingly out of kilter – and the result will be increased spending on social security, healthcare, and pensions that is unsustainable for the majority of countries.</p>
<p>It must be noted that although the world has not seen large-scale wars over resources in recent years, in various regions throughout the developing world, tensions often mount during prolonged periods of drought and over the burden of population increases. Researchers have pointed to drought as a major factor in the violent uprising that began in Syria in 2011. Countries across the globe also have to juggle the fight against climate change which is, in some peoples’ view, not addressed often enough. Currently, the shift towards sustainable energy falls short of projections.</p>
<h3 id=""turning-the-volume-up"">Turning the volume up</h3>
<p>A trend that has exceeded all expectations is that of media and communication developments. Whereas the world may have shrunk, the economic opportunities have increased. The result, however, is something of a double-edged sword because, at the same time, such developments have enabled certain regimes with authoritarian tendencies to further suppress their citizens.</p>
<p>In Western countries, the populations are in no mood to keep quiet. They grow increasingly suspicious of those in control and support for populist movements has been accumulating proportionally. As reported in Treasury Today last month, populist parties may be refreshing, but they can also be dangerous. According to journalist and author, Philip Stephens, “it leaves a vacuum of legitimacy, one being filled by the ‘antis’: the anti-elite, the anti-European, the anti-immigrant and the anti-capitalist.” These ‘antis’ are now in power in Greece and the same could potentially happen in other EU states in the course of the year. In fact, ECR Research predicts that the anti-establishment trend will undoubtedly continue as nationalism, populism, and a focus on sovereignty continue to be at the heart of (inter)national politics.</p>
<h3 id=""additional-forces"">Additional forces</h3>
<p>The last megatrend on ECR’s list is the growing importance of non-state actors: ISIS, the rebels in Ukraine, hackers collectives, large multinationals (including banks) are a few examples which bring with them uncertainty and instability. As such, nation states are again coming to the fore as voters force politicians to steer an isolationist course – perhaps, in the idle hope that the dangerous outside world ceases to exist if you close the curtains and hide.</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It is not easy for capitalist democracies to find – and maintain – their place in a tumultuous world. Simultaneously, the aforementioned megatrends cast doubt on the superiority of the Western model of liberal democracy. Countries such as Russia and China are not inclined to impassively wait until the West gives them a more prominent place at the table – quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Western countries are plagued by uncertainty due to doubts about capitalism, the ageing population, and the fact that many believe the political and economic elite have failed to deliver.</p>
<h3 id=""time-for-change"">Time for change?</h3>
<p>The prevailing idea in the West is that every state is inclined towards the capitalist model but ECR suggest this may well be delusional. To quote a Financial Times article, “instead of viewing Putin’s Russia as a democracy in the process of failing, we should view it as an authoritarian project in the process of succeeding.” Indeed, various other countries are moving towards authoritarianism and dictatorship – although some are more successful in this respect than others.</p>
<p>China’s Xi Jinping has become the most powerful leader since Deng and is playing all sorts of power games to safeguard his position. Elsewhere – in countries like Venezuela, Turkey, Ecuador, Thailand, Egypt, and Hungary – democracy is not that important to the leaders (to put it mildly). Occasionally, such countries may talk the democratic talk, so to speak, but only to further their authoritarian goals. Legal systems are used to eliminate or hamper opposition leaders while parliamentary elections tend to be a fig leaf to cover up the propaganda machinery. Likewise, many populist parties in the European democracies claim to champion unfortunate citizens. However, in reality they trample on democracy and accountability.</p>
<h3 id=""the-struggle-isnt-over"">The struggle isn’t over</h3>
<p>Nothing suggests that the undemocratic trends and the advance of the ‘antis’ will be short-lived. The question of concern here is: how will this affect the markets? There are two sides to this story. For years, the West has been doing business and forging ties with nations such as Saudi Arabia, for instance, because of the country’s apparent stability and the fact that it supplies a large amount of fuel that powers the global economy. Naturally, the markets prefer a steady authoritarian regime, which allows foreign companies to enter and embraces market thinking (up to a point) compared to unpredictable, chaotic, and half-baked democracy. In other words – as long as authoritarian leaders have their financial houses in order (and open their doors to Western businesses and capital flows) politicians seem perfectly happy to set morals aside.</p>
<p>Yet, it remains to be seen how long the leaders in question manage to keep their economies on the rails. And in any case, will such countries aim for profitable trade relations with the West or seek confrontation? Russia exemplifies an authoritarian state that is steering a confrontational course and tries to stir up trouble for the West in any way possible.</p>
<p>For the moment, it appears that the West is unable to respond adequately to the authoritarian trends and the advance of the populists. The eight megatrends we described may even strengthen the hand of the authoritarian regimes as well as the populists. The resulting tensions are fuelling expectations that the West will struggle to achieve the growth rates that were customary in the days before the Great Recession. If Western countries have been backed into a corner, as it seems, now is the time to start reversing the negative effects of the eight megatrends – more needs to be done than has been achieved in the last four years.</p>

<p><em>As investors demonstrate unwillingness to finance the social spending of weaker performing Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) countries, those countries who have performed comparatively well and successfully managed their debt deficits are worried they will be left to foot the bill. This article explores the options available and their implications for both strong and weak EMU countries.</em></p>
<p>The rising status of populist parties in Europe is threatening the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Those parties’ demands for more fiscal stimulus and less extensive structural reform measures appeal to many voters who are accustomed to costly social provisions and protection. Whilst such provisions may be socially desirable, they are also very expensive and divert increasing amounts of money away from projects that enhance both competitiveness and the earning capacity of the economy.</p>
<p>Most European countries need to borrow money to finance social spending on a structural basis. Earning capacity, meanwhile, has slowly but surely deteriorated and debts have been piling up. The Eurozone crisis signalled that investors were no longer willing to finance social spending of many weaker EMU countries due to concerns that some countries would not be able to pay back their debts.</p>
<p>An appropriate way to respond to rising concerns is through structural reforms that increase earning capacity and make economies more competitive. This, however, is easier said than done. It would require less spending on the social system (a short-term pain) to free up money for productive investments (a long-term gain) and offer less protection of influential political stake holders because of initial lack of appeal. Most politicians, who campaign for a four year term in office, fail to convince voters of the need to make sacrifices in order to strengthen the economy in the longer term.</p>
<p>Instead, more and more voters are turning to populist parties who promise less painful structural reforms and, instead, more debt-financed government spending.</p>
<h4 id=""structural-change-is-crucial"">Structural change is crucial</h4>
<p>Without structural reforms, credit going into the private sector is bound to stagnate. Already, growth across Europe is sluggish and unemployment is high. Therefore, wages have not been rising enough or sometimes not at all. The only way to quickly boost demand is through wider budget deficits. Germany, however, fears that the politicians in the weaker Eurozone countries will make use of any fiscal stimulus measures to postpone the necessary structural reforms. The experiences with Greece are proving the point. The German government is especially dissatisfied that Paris immediately declared its sympathy for the Greek desire to pursue a less stringent budget policy after Syriza won the Greek elections.</p>

<p>Pivotal in this situation is the European Central Bank (ECB), which can bolster credit supply in the private sector via lower interest rates, more money creation and, if need be, higher asset prices. However, the same proviso applies. As the central bank becomes more active, fewer reforms may be implemented. Since the credit crisis, for example, most member states have not implemented as many structural reforms as they intended and/or promised. This has contributed to the fact that, despite looser monetary policy by the ECB, credit has eased far less than anticipated.</p>
<h4 id=""ecb-action-necessary-but-will-it-help"">ECB action necessary but will it help?</h4>
<p>Given the circumstances, it is undeniable that the weak Eurozone countries are struggling because demand is lower than supply. Widening budget deficits do not offer real solutions (although many governments see this as an essential first step). That is, negative deflationary spirals loom in these member states and, unless something is done, this could lead to a deeply embedded economic crisis. The ECB, therefore, has intervened and announced a large-scale bond-buying programme, in combination with money creation.</p>
<p>Apart from the question whether such a policy will exacerbate the debt problem whilst structural reforms are not forthcoming, the expectation is that ECB’s bond-buying programme will do little to facilitate credit supply. Yes, the value of potential collateral will appreciate but earning capacity will not increase.</p>

<p>In addition, private individuals in Europe (in contrast with the US) own relatively few shares and bonds. Many people are home-owners and consider property price rallies far more important. The problem, therefore, is that most European governments are pursuing policies that aim to prevent the type of housing bubble that triggered the recent credit crisis rather than focusing on those to increase credit supply.</p>
<p>As credit continues to be tight, growth will remain sluggish, and budget deficits will tend to widen. It is a concern that the need to reduce deficits will act as a drag on the economy, potentially slowing down growth further and resulting in deflation looming for longer. Such concerns are prompting governments to ask Brussels for permission to widen their budget deficits.</p>
<h4 id=""germany-becoming-isolated"">Germany becoming isolated</h4>
<p>When it comes to the issues discussed in this article, all of the participating member states in the EU have equal voting rights. Only a few countries within Europe, however, have an economy that is performing reasonably well – first and foremost Germany. Whilst many of the weaker EMU countries find it very hard to implement structural reform, at the present juncture, the stronger ones are boxed into a corner:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasingly, the stronger performing member states find themselves in an isolated position. Germany, for example, thinks that the problem countries should be implementing structural reforms quickly but the debt-laden states are turning the tables on Berlin. They, in contrast, think the ‘well-off’ countries should apply fiscal stimulus in order to help the weaker Eurozone economies. Additionally, they want the EMU to drop the requirement that deficit reduction should be of top priority for them, eliminating its sluggish effect on the economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governments of the weaker Eurozone countries think Berlin is not considering the social misery in their countries that result from the deteriorating economic conditions. It is in this context that they point to rising popularity of populism that could be damaging. On the other hand, the strong member states can see storm clouds gathering. Unless earning capacity improves swiftly, it will only become harder for those under-performing Eurozone countries to pay off their outstanding debts. Eventually, this could spell financial disaster – particularly in combination with an ageing population, which will be demanding on public finances. Gigantic losses could be on the horizon and the countries with stronger performing economies fear that it will be their taxpayers that have to foot most of the bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stronger EMU countries, however, are frequently overruled within the ECB. The weaker Eurozone countries are shouting down the stronger member states. This is why the central bank recently decided to launch a large-scale bond-buying programme even though Germany and the Netherlands, among others, were opposed. It is no surprise that EU membership and management is a contentious political issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of Germany, another factor is also relevant. When the country decided to adopt the euro in 2002, it did so based on a guarantee that budget deficits would remain modest and that high inflation would be out of the question. But now, the deficits threaten to widen too far and the current ECB policy could well be too accommodative in Germany’s eyes. As Germany is the only European country with full employment (give or take), however, it could benefit from tighter monetary policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, it seems that further Eurozone tensions may well be on the cards and in all likelihood, this will have a huge impact on the financial markets. And whilst quantitative easing (QE) by the ECB could send asset prices higher (at least for a while), it will do little to boost economic growth. If advocates of widening budget deficits become more vocal, this is bound to frustrate the stronger EMU countries, which fear that they will have to foot the bill if everything goes wrong.</p>
<p>In other words, although we expect a Grexit will be avoided this year, we do expect the continuation of rising tensions between the weaker and the stronger EMU countries. Such tensions will weaken the euro further and invigorate the battle we expect in interest rate markets in the weaker EMU-countries. QE by the ECB will exert a strong downward pressure on interest rates, whilst rising tensions mean a strong upward pressure. Only time will tell which force will win.</p>

<p><em>With global leaders finding it increasingly tough to keep up with the pace of change, it can be difficult to predict how geopolitics will influence the economic outlook for 2015. Nevertheless there are some key themes that treasurers should keep a keen eye on over the coming months, says ECR.</em></p>
<p>Although 2014 turned out to be, in the main, a year of crises, it was interspersed with encouraging economic news as well. The US economy is now largely on the right track (even though some data remains a little suspect) and the British economy is also growing steadily. In addition, the markets are demonstrating confidence in the economic aspirations of new rulers in Indonesia and India, and China’s growth seems to be on schedule.</p>
<p>The global outlook is far from rosy, though. Many analysts fear, for example, that China has created unsustainable bubbles that will see current growth rates falter. On top of this, the Eurozone is in turmoil; there are question marks about the will (and ability) of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to get the country’s economy back on track; and analysts worry – to a greater or lesser extent – about three of the five BRICS, namely Brazil, South Africa and Russia.</p>


<blockquote>These days a would-be grandmaster, staring at the global chessboard, is liable to find that the pawns have started moving around on their own.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Gideon Rachman, Financial Times</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>As ever, politics will be a very important factor in the economic developments in – and ultimately the prospects for – these countries. Indeed, many of the major crises that broke out in 2014 were connected to (geo)politics. And it is no coincidence that most experts regard poor governance as the biggest threat to global security.</p>
<p>Moreover, leaders find it increasingly difficult to get a grip on national and international politics and economics in what the FT’s Gideon Rachman, describes as the ‘democratic age’. The world seems more complex and obtrusive than ever before. Borders – and not just physical ones – are porous. People, capital flows, criminality, information, weapons, ideas, pollution, and epidemics move around the world at speed. As Rachman writes, “These days a would-be grandmaster, staring at the global chessboard, is liable to find that the pawns have started moving around on their own.”</p>
<h3 id=""gazing-into-the-crystal-ball"">Gazing into the crystal ball</h3>
<p>Although this makes it harder to predict future events, it is still important to understand what the key geostrategic and (geo)economic issues impacting the financial markets will be over the next 12 months. And amidst all the uncertainty, one thing is clear – global instability and unrest will continue into 2015.</p>
<p>First of all, in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, arrangements that were set up in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century continue to come under internal and external pressure. And, there is no reason to think that the reshuffle of borders and power relations will come to an end any time soon.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, since the eruption of the financial crisis in 2007/2008, liberal democracy has been creaking on its foundations in many areas. History professor Mark Mazower wrote that, “by discrediting the more mythical idealisations of the market, it has encouraged the restoration of state power as a goal in itself. This programme is easily harnessed by authoritarian leaders in the name of national sovereignty and democracy.” In some cases, we are seeing transitions from ‘authoritarianism light’ to a totalitarian regime. Conditions have hardened in countries like China, Hungary, and Turkey, but most of all in Russia. Tensions between these areas and the West could become exacerbated (unless strong leaders actively strive to reassure the markets by creating more stability – which may pose a moral conundrum).</p>
<p>Over in Africa, some 20 countries are “failed states” or are heading in this direction. As a result, they are exposed to the dissemination of diseases, extremism and violence. The past shows that instability can easily spread from one African country to another, and with resource-rich areas such as Nigeria, Angola, South Africa, and South Sudan so relevant to the financial markets, this is a concern. Meanwhile, in Asia, the restructuring of national security and economic order continues. This affects the relations between the US and China. Add to this the maritime tensions between China and other Asian countries, such as Japan, and the picture becomes quite cloudy. Nevertheless, Asia continues to benefit from the shift of political and economic power from West to East and from North to South. In a relative sense, the Americans are losing power and this is all the more true of Europe too.</p>
<h3 id=""market-hurdles-in-2015"">Market hurdles in 2015</h3>
<p>Over the past year, the markets have not been overly bothered by geopolitical crises or politico-economic setbacks. However, market sentiment is fickle and it is likely to change as the Fed tightens its belt. In combination with waning confidence in the omnipotence of central banks, the slowdown in Chinese growth, political instability, and growing risk-aversion, this could result in a ‘risk-off’ climate going forward.</p>
<p>In Europe, 2014 was a relatively quiet year, but 2015 could be very different, considering the lack of adequate reform in France and Italy, which is being compounded by the fact that the core Eurozone countries are not doing very well either. Various electoral fireworks are scheduled for 2015 as well. The main question treasurers should be considering is: will Europe opt for a fiscal union (and write down Greek debts) or is a ‘Grexit’ on the cards? If the other euro countries want to hang on to Greece, write-downs are unavoidable.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In recent months, the oil price has been another area for treasurers to watch closely, losing over 40-50%. According to Jessica Tuchman Mathews, the outgoing President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a foreign policy think tank in Washington, “If, as now seems quite possible, oil prices settle at around $60 per barrel…that will be a global game changer. Virtually no economy and few economic relationships will be unaffected.”</p>
<p>Whereas the global economy will benefit if oil prices continue to stay low – unless the pullback triggers geopolitical crises – a number of specific countries will be hard hit. The most vulnerable states are: Venezuela, Nigeria, Russia and Iran. Other countries that should be monitored if the oil price slump continues are Brazil, Iraq, Libya, and the Gulf States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the oil price pullback will help China as it continues its advance. Treasurers would do well to consider three questions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is leader Xi Jinping a true reformer who really intends to tackle corruption and turn China from a mega-exporter into an economy driven by domestic consumption?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is prosperity the primary aim of China’s global infrastructure plans and projects or does it have a hidden geostrategic agenda as it continues to construct (rail) roads and ports on a massive scale?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, will China’s slowdown in growth lead to more conflicts with neighbouring countries?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""the-full-picture"">The full picture</h3>
<p>There are many more themes that will be relevant to the markets in 2015. For example, Japanese Prime Minister Abe should not invest too much political capital, time and effort in his nationalist agenda (as he has done in the past). Instead, he would do well to focus wholeheartedly on the Japanese economy. He may have no choice. Especially since the power base of his ally, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kuroda, is crumbling within the central bank, which continues to strive to boost the economy.</p>
<p>Other important leaders to follow are Prime Minister Modi in India and President Jokowi in Indonesia. Both leaders are viewed as benevolent reformers who are willing (and able) to get rid of bureaucracy, corruption, and other major obstacles to growth. Both have made a decent start. However, it remains to be seen whether they will continue along the same lines once the low-hanging reform fruits have been picked.</p>
<p>In summary, we foresee numerous geopolitical and politico-economic risks for 2015. Despite this, steady growth in the US and the UK, the continuous emergence of countries like China, India, and Indonesia, together with low oil prices could add some sunshine to the grey skies. Yet, all in all, we do not expect much better economic weather.</p>
<p>The global economy is bound to grow at a slower pace than in recent decades and the unsettled climate will destabilise many countries. International and national political problems are hampering economic growth. Is an umbrella to protect against the economic drizzle and political downpour really too much of a luxury?</p>

Lower oil price to boost EUR/USD?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><img alt=""ECR Research logo"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/ecr-research-logo-2016.svg?la=en&amp;hash=80E9AA31C33B45D7E41A15427224EF2C"" width=""130""/></p>
<p><em>Following recent drops in the price of oil, growth expectations in Europe and the US have been impacted. The question now is what will the economic impact of the oil price slump be on these two economies, and how will the EUR/USD exchange rate react as a result?</em></p>
<p>Owing to rising production and lower demand (because of the growth slowdown in Asia and Europe), oil prices have dropped sharply (this article was written in the first week of December). The pullback of the past two months has several implications for EUR/USD. In the immediate future, Europe and the US will be paying less for oil so the trade balance will improve – most of all in Europe, as the United States is itself an oil producer (so will need to import less). This state of affairs will strengthen the euro. In addition, falling oil prices are bound to influence growth expectations. Consumers will end up with more money in their pockets to spend on goods and services that are produced domestically, which will boost both economies. However, there are differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the United States, energy exploitation has been an important growth engine in recent years. As this is a capital-intensive sector with high returns, the dollar has benefitted from foreign capital flowing into the US. Plus, the trade balance did improve on the back of domestic energy production. Now that oil prices have dropped, investment could decline and less capital will flow into the US. Moreover, many (small) oil companies have borrowed money based on the assumption that oil prices would continue to rise. As long as they do not, many experts fear bankruptcies and mounting losses. All of this will have a negative impact on the dollar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flip side of this is that cheaper oil will have a positive effect on US consumption. It will boost consumer confidence. Therefore, people will be inclined to buy other goods and services with the money they save on gasoline. Not unimportantly, the price of petrol will drop relatively faster in the US than in Europe because taxes play a less significant part in the United States.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On balance, we think lower oil prices will directly benefit the US to a somewhat greater extent, particularly as the US economy is already in an upward economic spiral (more jobs, expanding consumption, higher investment, increased employment, etc). Falling oil prices may provide a positive impulse, which could act as a catalyst. If so, the growth differential between both economies will increase, to the advantage of the dollar.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream/ECR</em></p>
<p>Indirectly, the oil price slump will have various consequences. Inflation is bound to ease further. As the central bank is already worried that inflation is minimal and that inflation expectations are falling, it will come under pressure to ease its policy (large-scale QE). Not that the ECB will labour under the illusion that this will drive up oil prices – or inflation – but at least it will create the impression that it is serious about inflation. As a result, inflation expectations will not drop as fast and there will be a lower risk of a prolonged deflationary spiral. Simultaneously, lower oil prices will boost the economy. Specifically the strong EMU countries, which are opposed to massive QE, will use the latter as an argument to block a large-scale bond-buying programme. In our view, the ECB will steer a middle course; it will probably opt for large-scale QE but not as much as the weak Eurozone countries and investors are hoping. The result will be upward pressure on the euro.</p>
<h3 id=""us-inflation-to-ease-up"">US inflation to ease up?</h3>
<p>The relevance of this to the Fed is that the oil price pullback will put downward pressure on inflation. Some policy makers will fear that inflation will ease too much. In combination with the uncertainty about the negative impact on the US oil industry and US growth in general, this could encourage the Fed to postpone its rate increases until the end of 2015 – even if lower oil prices will boost consumption and growth in the near future. At best, the delay will have a neutral effect on the dollar but it could also weaken the greenback. After all, many investors take into account that a rate hike will take place halfway through next year. By and large, we believe that lower oil prices will bolster EUR/USD. This will – temporarily – change the decade-long positive relationship between EUR/USD and oil prices.</p>
<p>A key question in regard to EUR/USD is why have oil prices dropped? Is it because of a rapidly expanding supply? If the answer is ‘yes’, this would:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide oil-importing countries (Europe, the US, China, and Japan) with a positive impulse while growth prospects could improve around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mean that the oil price slump will continue until demand increases or supply decreases. In the short term, demand is not that sensitive to price fluctuations. Therefore, supply will have to decline. US oil companies, in particular, will feel the effects because they face fairly high costs while production has increased strongly in the past period. In many other oil-producing countries, the oil industry is the most lucrative sector. Therefore, these governments will be inclined to subsidise production – more so than the US government, which is dealing with private businesses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This amounts to a relatively negative scenario for the dollar in the coming months. If it holds true, a EUR/USD rally to 1.35 would not be a surprise.</p>
<p>An alternative scenario is that falling oil prices are the result of lower global demand due to decelerating growth. This could be true as the long-term growth prospects for Europe, Japan, and China are mediocre (see ECR’s recent Global Financial Markets reports). On top of this, for quite some time, lower bond yields have indicated that deflation risks are increasing. If this is correct, there will be ongoing downward pressure on inflation and growth in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>The latter would strengthen the dollar as there would be mounting pressure on central banks in the countries where deflation risks are high (Europe, Japan, and China) to ease their policies and depress their currencies. As the US economy is doing better – mainly due to the performance of its domestic sectors – it is well able to cope with a strong currency. The United States will also become a more attractive investment destination.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>For now, it seems that oil prices are falling due to increased production in the US alongside sluggish demand in Asia. In other words, we regard the pullback as a positive ‘shock’ to the economy and expect the euro to benefit more than the dollar in the coming months (= the first scenario). In our view, EUR/USD will, over the coming weeks to months, rise to 1.30-1.35.</p>
<p>However, once the negative impact of lower oil prices on US oil production and the postponement of the Fed rate hikes have been discounted in EUR/USD (somewhere between 1.30-1.35, probably), the pair can resume its downtrend. In the circumstances, the US economy will continue to have the best growth prospects (see also our regular EUR/USD reports). On balance, delayed Fed rate hikes will boost the US economy. Precisely for that reason, the Fed will likely need to increase its key rate faster at a later date. In contrast, we think there will be constant pressure on the ECB to do more – even after the central bank announces QE. Most of all, should the euro appreciate against the dollar in the months ahead, EUR/USD could drop to 1.10 over the coming quarters.</p>


","Following recent drops in the price of oil, growth expectations in Europe and the US have been impacted. The question now is what will the economic impact of the oil price slump be on these two economies, and how will the EUR/USD exchange rate react as a result?",,2015-01-01,Market Insight,True

<p>By the time treasurers read this, the fireworks will have fizzled out, hangovers will have just about cleared and it will be time to get down, once again, to the serious business that is cash management.</p>
<p>What a gloomy backdrop it is for treasurers as they return from the seasonal festivities though. Six years on from the financial crisis and the global economy, once again, is facing some strong headwinds. The Eurozone appears to be lurching towards a third recession, with falling growth and the risk of falling prices too. Emerging markets like China and Brazil, the main drivers of growth since the crisis, are now slowing down as well.</p>
<p>Add to this a geopolitical environment that looks increasingly uncertain – think Putin, Ukraine and ISIS – and it’s not difficult to imagine corporate CFOs and treasurers, ever watchful for signs of heightened volatility in financial markets, heading into the New Year with a slight sense of trepidation.</p>
<p>“I think the macroeconomic issues are the ones that most treasurers will wake up thinking about on 1<sup>st</sup> January,” says Paul Taylor, Regional Sales Head, GTS EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We’ve heard talk in recent weeks about a cooling in the global economy; we’ve seen what’s happened to the price of oil and what that has done to currencies globally, which in turn has had a knock-on impact on currency valuations. I don’t think anybody can ignore what is happening on that level at the moment.”</p>
<p>That may be so, but the worries for the treasurer do not end with the uncertainties we are currently seeing in the markets. On the contrary, treasurers are also likely to be concerned about the changes in market policies as central banks struggle to turn the tide, together with the actions of global and regional regulators tasked with ensuring that there is no repeat of the last financial crisis.</p>

<h3 id=""in-the-negative"">In the negative</h3>
<p>A negative deposit rate, introduced by the ECB in July 2013 to provide stimulus to the Eurozone economy and encourage banks to lend more to businesses, is one example. Following the announcement of the new policy most banks decided not to immediately pass on additional costs to their corporate depositors. No bank, naturally, wanted to be the first mover. However, market participants remained convinced that if rates remained negative for long enough, some would eventually have to go down that route.</p>
<p>In recent months, that has indeed begun to happen, with a handful of custodian and commercial European banks applying negative rates. “I think there is some evidence that charging is happening in the market now,” says Suzanne Janse van Rensburg, EMEA Head of Liquidity at BofA Merrill. It’s not entirely down to monetary policy, however. “I think some banks have been looking at the LCR and the associated cost and taking a view on that,” she explains.</p>
<p>This is not, exactly, an unintended consequence. The ultimate objective of negative rates is, after all, to try and force cash back into the economy – substantial sums of which have been sitting on the balance sheets of large corporates – and the policy gives the banking industry little room for manoeuvre in that respect. Is that how corporates view it though?</p>
<p>“In my own experience, when I talk to clients they have been very understanding of that,” says Taylor. “I think that this further reinforces the need for dialogue between banks and corporates – we are in constant dialogue with our clients helping them to optimise the way their cash is managed. We do everything we can to support them, looking at where they want to hold the cash, whether it should be on- or off-balance sheet, and we put solutions and structures in place to help them get the best possible return on that cash.”</p>
<p>The impact of negative rates is also being felt beyond the banking industry. Sharp inflows could be observed in money market funds (MMFs) shortly after the banks began passing on the costs, which Yaron Ernst, Managing Director of Moody’s Managed Investments Group, believes is no coincidence. “I met with several treasurers recently who were very concerned with what that means, and about where they can place their excess liquidity now,” says Ernst.</p>
<p>That looks set to be one of the big questions treasurers will need to find an answer to in 2015. European MMFs are, at the time of writing, still able to serve as a positive yielding alternative to bank deposits. The yields on offer are marginal, however, and it may only be a matter of time before MMFs head the same way as some bank deposits.</p>
<p>“Yields are declining,” explains Ernst. “Since MMFs are refinancing their assets on a daily or weekly basis – depending on the maturity of their assets – and the assets they are buying into are yielding lower, it is probable that they will turn negative in the next few weeks.” The recent inflows, therefore, are likely only to be temporary and, once funds begin to reach or fall below zero, treasurers wishing to avoid erosion of principle will need new options.</p>
<p>But what are the other options? That will largely depend upon the risk appetite of the corporate. Moody’s expectation is that we are going to see a growing level of interest in alternative investment products such as separately managed accounts (SMAs), cash ETFs, and ultra-short bond funds in the coming months.</p>
<p>“For SMAs, corporates would have to work upon the relationships with the fund managers to devise personalised funds that match their objectives,” says Ernst. Whatever instrument one chooses – SMAs, ultra-short bond funds, or cash ETFs – there are similar trade-offs, he adds. “Either you accept the negative yields in MMFs or you take on slightly longer maturities, more risk, and possibly more fees, but generate higher yields.”</p>

<h3 id=""the-regulatory-black-hole"">The regulatory ‘black hole’</h3>
<p>Without taking their eye off what is happening in the market, treasurers will also need to keep up-to-date with all the latest regulatory developments. Compliance is a word many treasurers have learnt to dread in recent years, with the activity taking up an ever bigger share of the department’s valuable time and resources. According to Treasury Today’s 2014 European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study, for nearly half of the treasurers surveyed the amount of time dedicated to compliance and regulations now ranges between 10-30%, a three-fold increase since the financial crisis, some treasurers commented.</p>
<p>However, after two successive years of managing very practical compliance projects such as the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and derivative position reporting under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the challenges will be different in 2015.</p>
<p>“EMIR was extremely hands-on,” says Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Market and Regulatory Strategy at Citi’s Trade and Treasury Services division. “The regulation we’ve got this year is going to be more indirect in the way it impacts treasurers.” Monitoring developments in the market and making their voices heard by regulators on issues such as banking regulation will continue to be important, but also challenging.”</p>
<p>In the US, corporates might feel the impact of regulation more directly, most notably in the case of the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts regulation (FBAR). This regulation, brought in to help trace funds that might be used for illicit purposes, will require all US domiciled corporate to file annual electronic reports on any foreign bank account that’s average value of or above $10,000. With the compliance deadline for FBAR now set for 30<sup>th</sup> June 2015, affected corporates will be working hard to ensure they can meet the requirements of the regulation in time. But given that corporates often hold a multitude of bank accounts across multiple jurisdictions this is not, by any means, going to be a straightforward task – at least not in a world still lacking a viable multi-bank eBAM solution.</p>

<h3 id=""seizing-the-opportunity"">Seizing the opportunity</h3>
<p>Although regulation is often – and understandably – perceived as a challenge by treasurers, we should not forget that some measures, particularly those that fall into the standardisation and harmonisation bracket, can also offer corporates a chance to review and improve upon departmental processes.</p>
<p>Indeed, if Wandhöfer’s observation that hands on compliance projects are not going to feature so strongly in 2015 holds true, then now may be the perfect time for treasurers to really focus on seizing the opportunities presented by recently completed projects such as migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).</p>
<p>“With every challenge there are always opportunities as well,” says Maha El Dimachki, Head of Cash Product Initiatives for RBS Global Transaction Services. For treasurers, taking the time to look at where there could be potential opportunities to change or enhance a process affected by regulation can be enormously beneficial, but that is not always apparent at the start, she explains. “For example, while what was pure regulatory compliance for many corporates initially, has become an opportunity for treasurers to obtain further business benefits. The treasury agenda continues to be about automation, integration and optimisation, and the economic environment in Europe is pushing treasurers further in that direction.”</p>
<p>Having finally put to bed their SEPA migration projects in 2014, corporates operating in the Eurozone in 2015 are as a result looking excitedly at a range of new possibilities barely imaginable a few years back. Ideas such as pan-continental collections factories, which nobody had previously attempted before now due to the technical difficulty, are becoming a reality. “Corporates will benefit from improved cash conversion cycles and cash allocation,” she adds. “As soon as the SEPA deadline passed, companies were already starting these types of discussions with us.”</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Almost everyone in the industry agrees that SEPA offers corporate treasuries a chance to review current payment processes. Less discussed, but by no means less significant, are the opportunities presented by IFRS 9. The introduction of the new standard might make it a good time for corporates to “dust off” and review old risk management policies as well as seeking more alignment between risk management and the application of hedge accounting, says Sander Van Tol, Partner at treasury consultants Zanders. Under the old regime, some corporates were discouraged from hedging due to the rigid nature of the standard. Once IFRS 9 begins to be applied, however, corporates might want to look again.</p>
<p>“I feel that a lot of corporates are missing opportunities,” Van Tol explains. “They are not hedging certain economic exposures because of the negative accounting effect. Hopefully with IFRS 9 the whole debate about whether to hedge or not will start over again,” he adds. “I think it’s an excellent opportunity.”</p>
<h3 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h3>
<p>With all the recent turmoil in financial markets coupled with the unprecedented plethora of new regulation hitting the statute books, the past few years have not, by any means, been an easy ride for corporate treasurers.</p>
<p>But while the year ahead of us will surely prove every bit as challenging for the profession, many believe that the nature of the challenge in 2015 will be very different. If the past several years have been about merely keeping up with the pace of regulatory change and ensuring a minimal level of compliance with the various diktats coming out across different jurisdictions, this year treasurers have a chance to move on to the next step.</p>
<p>This next step should involve seeking out opportunities to exploit within necessary compliance projects – such as SEPA and IFRS 9 – and using these as an incentive to review and improve existing practises, processes and policies.</p>
<p>Those that seize such opportunities will almost certainly be better placed for riding the ongoing economic storm. Best practice in treasury has always been about greater optimisation, automation and integration. In the environment we find ourselves in now, these can no longer be seen as luxuries, however. They must be priorities.</p>

A political conundrum,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Markets are paying increasing attention to political developments. They seem to have become equally (or even more) sensitive to opinion polls, election results, and other political news than to economic data. Markets can be merciless when out to ‘get’ disappointing politicians. At the same time, they can be over optimistic about leaders who seem to be pushing for reforms.</p>
<p>What the markets crave are leaders with fresh ideas. The growth model – based on high commodity prices, low interest rates, excessive indebtedness, and rising globalisation – has come under pressure in recent years. Unfortunately, politicians are increasingly mired in a web of geopolitical hazard, disappointing economic growth, and domestic political stagnation.</p>
<p>American scientist Thomas Sowell said about politics, “there are no solutions; there are only trade-offs.” It is always a matter of weighing the pros against the cons, negotiating with opponents, pandering to grassroots supporters, and so on. Eventually, the preferred solution morphs into a warped, distorted, and rough-edged outcome of political struggle and strife, a compromise, in other words. Such a trade-off can work reasonably well but the result often falls far short of the original points of departure. It can even exacerbate the existing problems.</p>
<p>In the recent past, the political system of the world’s largest economy (and most powerful country) has produced neither real solutions nor feasible compromises. US Democrats and Republicans seem to have each other in a hold. The consequences can be outright disastrous (see last year’s government shutdown). “There are no solutions; there are only partisan battles,” seems a fitting description of Washington’s status quo.</p>
<h3 id=""political-paralysis"">Political paralysis</h3>
<p>The US is far from the only nation state where democratic processes falter. Many European countries suffer from political paralysis, not least because of the rise of populism since the 1990s, which appears to have accelerated in recent times. Perhaps it is worth remembering that today’s unrest is more ‘normal’ than the relative political stability of recent decades, when a limited number of well-established parties would take turns in office, resulting in respectable but boring predictability within rigid political structures.</p>
<p>Populism gained ground due to major trends which cannot be reversed easily and make it harder for politicians to do what their voters want them to do. Globalisation is one of the root causes. Upcoming generations are no longer assured of higher living standards. Simultaneously, the comfort provided by a secure national identity has been eroded due to immigration, international organisations, and fading borders. According to many experts, globalisation also has a hand in increased inequality. The populist countermovement has focused on issues ranging from ‘unique national identities’ to aversion against (central) government. In Europe, these tendencies are also represented by the Eurosceptic and anti-EU parties.</p>
<p>Populism is not necessarily negative, though. Just as a recession can counteract morbid economic growth, or clean up a business sector, populist outpourings could serve to ‘disinfect’ a corrupt and stilted political system. A major challenge for politicians is to make distinctions between well-founded dissatisfaction and rabble-rousing, deception, and blatant racism. Ideally, they should address justified complaints and passionate populist protests through the implementation of sound reforms.</p>

<p>The problem is that the political elite are mostly incapable of harnessing and channelling populism in a constructive manner. At the same time, a significant number of populist politicians just seem interested in kicking up disturbances and amassing power at the expense of the disenfranchised, based on a dangerous distortion of the facts. An apt term to describe the current situation, coined by the late political scientist Samuel Huntington, is ‘political decay’.</p>
<p>Political institutions need to be securely embedded in society to provide firm foundations for the latter. At the same time, they have to be flexible enough to zero in on and adapt to political, social, and economic trends. This is a delicate equilibrium, which seems to have been upset in the US (and elsewhere). Lobbyists and special interest groups have ‘hijacked’ the political system whereas the common good is woefully underrepresented. On top of this, an overactive legal apparatus has a crippling effect on politics and society as a whole, in the sense that (too) many issues end up in court whereas judges are increasingly inclined to interfere in affairs of state. That is to say, the different branches of government no longer balance each other out. On the contrary; they increasingly overlap and obstruct each other. Francis Fukuyama talks of ‘vetocracies’, which lead to political deadlock.</p>
<p>At the opposite side of the spectrum, we see that governments perform tasks that are not supervised by anybody. This applies, for example, to some intelligence services and military units.</p>
<p>Confused and dismayed by these extremes – impotent politics versus unrestricted powers for the state – the public distrusts politicians progressively more. As a result, it demands rules that hamper efficiency. In addition, people are less and less prepared to pay taxes as they suspect that the money will disappear into a (bureaucratic) black hole. This is all the more dangerous because voters have high expectations of the government.</p>
<p>European politicians, too, have plenty of worries; dangerous types of populism seem firmly entrenched. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. As the EU continues to expand, Europe starts to resemble the United States, where interest groups have a grip on politicians. In Europe, the judiciary has also become more important.</p>
<h3 id=""the-challenge-ahead"">The challenge ahead</h3>
<p>Faltering politics is not something that will change any time soon. Few politicians – if any – will voluntarily say goodbye to the capital flows generated by the lobby groups and of course anyone with a ‘special interest’ will try to keep the system afloat for as long as possible. In addition, both the US and Europe often see further democratisation as the solution to erratic politics. It remains to be seen if this is a valid standpoint. Most ‘normal people’ do not have the time (or the inclination) to study complicated political topics, which works to the advantage of those interest groups that have plenty of time, money, and capabilities to scrutinise and influence political processes.</p>
<p>Democracy is unlikely to function better in the near future. It appears that only an external shock can bring politicians and the electorate to their senses. Yet, it is imperative that Western politicians wake up to reality. Geopolitical challenges and economic shifts are putting pressure on the existing world order. The West faces three major challenges right now: the rise of Asia, an assertive, some would say aggressive Russia, and the violent advance of IS/ISIS and other extremists.</p>

<p>The US is essential to addressing these challenges. However, America seems increasingly unwilling and unable to resume its former role as the world’s policeman while at the same time many other countries still depend too much on Washington for security and leadership. At the same time, the organisations that were thought up and dominated by the West still constitute the global order. Presently, Putin and IS are testing the strength of this order. In this uncertain climate, it would be unrealistic to expect convincing solutions to pervasive political and economic problems. The compromises that evolve are far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>The West will not quickly find an adequate answer to Russia’s attitude and the violent emergence of ISIS. Nor do we expect a great deal from domestic reforms. Over the short term, the actions and words of the central banks may continue to drive the markets. Meanwhile, geopolitical events will pose a constant threat. Nothing suggests that the West will be able to counter these risks in a satisfactory manner.</p>

RMB internationalisation: a new world order,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It is unlikely to have escaped your notice that China is on the verge of becoming the world’s biggest economy. In fact, it may be already. In October International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections showed that China’s GDP for 2014 would marginally exceed that of the US for the first time (at least based on purchasing power parity). And while there is debate as to whether, according to what measure of GDP you use, the US is still the world’s top economy, it is nevertheless indisputable that China has become a veritable economic powerhouse.</p>
<p>However, despite the country’s economic rise, the prevalence of its currency internationally has failed to keep pace with the growth of China’s global influence – as of October 2014, RMB was only the seventh-most traded currency in the world. But of course, things take time. And we cannot expect internationalisation to be meteoric – we must look to the medium-term for redback domination.</p>
<p>What this means is that treasurers must start thinking now about the rise of the renminbi and how they may need to integrate the currency into their treasury risk policies much sooner than they had anticipated if its internationalisation continues at its current pace. After all, RMB volumes across Thomson Reuters’ Matching and FXall in the first quarter of 2014 reached record highs, and the dollar-renminbi entered the top ten traded currency pairs on FXall in March 2014 and is typically one of the top four traded pairs by volume on Matching.</p>
<p>“The renminbi has gone from the 20<sup>th</sup> most traded currency just two years ago to the seventh most traded today – a very substantial improvement,” says Janet Ming, Head of China Desk at RBS. “As China continues to strengthen its position in global trade, RMB will further improve its position.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-steps-to-internationalisation"">The steps to internationalisation</h3>
<p>The RMB’s rise is not a serendipitous occurrence, but part of a concerted plan. Its progress marks one of the early steps on a path that Beijing hopes will result in the RMB becoming widely held in reserve by foreign central banks. In ‘RMB Roadmap’, a whitepaper published in May by Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA), Standard Chartered, and Thomson Reuters, the authors set out five milestones along this path:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Becoming a deposit currency internationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being used increasingly for trade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming an investment currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central banks agreeing bilateral swap agreements with the People’s Bank of China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being accepted globally as a reserve currency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The majority of industry insiders that Treasury Today has spoken to recently believe the renminbi will be a fully convertible currency by 2020, and that the redback has made significant progress in that direction to date. “Although not yet fully convertible, we know that around 40 central banks are already diversifying some of their reserve currency in RMB. If this redenomination continues, and the investment flows keep multiplying, RMB should become a G4 currency, alongside the dollar, euro and sterling, by 2020,” says Carmen Ling, Global Head RMB Solutions for Corporate and Institutional Clients at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>Foreign governments are not standing idly by watching the RMB’s rise to prominence, either. In October, the UK became the first Western government to issue a renminbi-denominated sovereign bond. The RMB three billion bond was the largest ever RMB bond from a non-Chinese issuer, and has been seen as a strong statement of intent by the UK to build up RMB reserves (prior to the issuance of the bond, Britain only held reserves in US dollar, euro, yen and Canadian dollar).</p>
<p>“The UK’s decision to issue a sovereign bond in RMB was certainly a strong symbolic gesture,” says Evan Goldstein, Global Head of RMB Solutions at Deutsche Bank. “When other central banks start to build up RMB deposits and diversify their currency holdings, then Beijing will have achieved its objective. But the currency will only be truly global after major capital account reforms take place, and there is convergence between the off and onshore market in terms of interest rates, FX rates, and pricing mechanisms.”</p>
<p>The renminbi’s progress along this path has been accompanied by a nascent two-way volatility in the USD/CNY exchange rate – earlier this year, after three and a half years of appreciation against the dollar, the RMB experienced a spike, going from 6.05 in January to almost 6.26 in May, before recommencing its path of appreciation once again (see Chart 1). “As the RMB becomes a more international currency, its exchange rate will also be more liberalised and market-driven – it is no longer a one-way bet,” adds Standard Chartered’s Ling.</p>

<p>The internationalisation process is being facilitated by Beijing’s capital account liberalisation plan. China took steps towards large-scale capital account opening in 2002 with its Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, which allows licenced overseas investors to trade in RMB-denominated shares. This was followed up in 2007 with the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme, which allows capital raised from Chinese investors to be invested abroad.</p>
<p>In late 2012, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) took the first steps towards allowing foreign currency, two-way cash pooling, as well as centralised payment and collection on a company’s current account. It also technically allowed netting for trade settlement to take place. This was a huge advance for corporates with operations in China, who had previously experienced problems with trapped cash in the country, although that is not to say that the issue of trapped cash has been eliminated.</p>
<h3 id=""the-role-of-the-pboc"">The role of the PBoC</h3>
<p>One key factor dictating how rapidly internationalisation can progress is Beijing’s ability and willingness to encourage worldwide acceptance of RMB. “It has become increasingly apparent that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) sees the internationalisation of the RMB as unfolding through the creation of a global network of offshore RMB clearing banks, currency swap agreements, integrated e-infrastructure, and related regulatory underpinnings,” says Jim Kwiatkowski, Global Head of Sales, FX, Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are seven official RMB offshore centres, in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, London, Luxembourg, Paris and Frankfurt. These financial hubs are able to concentrate offshore RMB funds in the country itself and in the neighbouring region. The centres can use a clearing bank for RMB activity, although this is not absolutely necessary; for example, ICBC Singapore is the clearing bank in Singapore, while in Luxembourg there is no RMB clearing bank, at the time of writing.</p>
<p>“The use of Chinese banks as designated clearing banks on the part of the PBoC has been the predominant method by which China has been trying to deploy RMB on the international market, as part of its current account reform process,” says Deutsche Bank’s Goldstein. “The appointment of more of these clearing banks in various markets around the world is a positive sign, and illustrates the greater degree of cooperation and coordination between the PBoC and other central banks. It has also allowed for the introduction of a local time frame for RMB clearing.”</p>
<p>Hong Kong was the first such hub to be established, and in May 2013 the daily value of RMB cleared through Hong Kong’s real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system exceeded that of HKD for the first time.</p>
<p>Goldstein says collaboration is key in the process. “China has been very active in working with other countries and market infrastructure organisations to understand how the RMB is being used in the offshore market and also the ways in which it can improve acceptance of the currency for investment,” he says. For example, through this collaboration, The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has started offering banks a RMB repo facility and extended local RMB clearing house times.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ) is a key part of this collaborative development of the currency. Launched in September 2013, the zone has allowed regulators to experiment with initiatives on a small scale before they are implemented more widely. “The FTZ serves as a holistic testing ground for financial reform,” explains RBS’s Ming. “The Government wants a fully market-driven environment with liberalised interest rates and exchange rates, and the Zone gives them some idea of the shape of things to come as the currency gradually becomes fully convertible. Anything being tested inside the FTZ is of strategic importance for companies outside the Zone because things happening there could very soon be happening outside it.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai FTZ is relatively easily replicable, meaning Beijing could expand its experiment before wider implementation. Guangdong and Tianjin, for example, could have their own FTZs before long. And as the implementation of reforms expands, within FTZs and beyond, corporates should be able to do more with the currency.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management-opportunities"">Cash management opportunities</h3>
<p>For corporates, the range of RMB services on offer from banks is increasing in line with the internationalisation of the currency. A number of banks already provide basic onshore and offshore RMB trading solutions; furthermore, the provision of more advanced services is also on the up.</p>
<p>According to data from Thomson Reuters, dim sum bond issuance has grown considerably in 2014, and this looks set to continue to be a useful tool for capital raising. The amount of dim sum bond issuance between January and May this year was RMB 188.5 billion – more than the total for all of 2013 (RMB 186.9 billion). “The renminbi continues to be a strong issuance currency in 2014. As cross-border renminbi trade channels continue to embed further with China’s growing influence on international trade, coupled with tight credit conditions onshore, conditions for dim sum bond growth will remain favourable,” says Thomson Reuters’ Kwiatkowski.</p>
<p>It appears that treasurers are encouraged by the cash management opportunities the process will ultimately give them. “RMB internationalisation gives us comfort that we will be able to utilise the range of treasury products that we are ordinarily able to utilise in markets where there are fewer restrictions,” says Craig Weeks, Regional Treasurer, Asia Pacific at SABMiller. “This will allow us to raise capital more efficiently, with more transparency over the prices we are getting, whether for borrowing or for FX.”</p>
<p>Corporate users of RMB outside of APAC are also likely to experience improved cash management as a result of the aforementioned development of the offshore RMB clearing banks, particularly in Europe. “Having RMB clearing infrastructure in Europe will allow corporates in this part of the world to have more efficient RMB settlement, reduced transaction costs and better risk mitigation,” says Ming of RBS.</p>
<p>Beyond cash management, RMB internationalisation could also be a disruptive influence for good in trade finance for certain corporates. “By introducing an alternative trade settlement currency to the USD or euro, wider RMB use would help some users,” explains Standard Chartered’s Ling. “For example a Brazilian company that has traditionally traded with Chinese partners using USD, could eliminate this third element of currency risk by switching to RMB as the trade currency.” However, this switching would also require the corporate to fully understand the settlement risk and market risk of the RMB, too. “Once corporates start to redenominate their trades in RMB, the next challenge will be to distribute the benefits of the currency throughout the supply chain,” adds Ling.</p>
<p>Internationalisation will also mean a redrafting of treasury risk policies. “For treasurers, full RMB internationalisation would mean that the currency would play a role in corporate treasury policies, influencing their hedging and risk management,” says Deutsche Bank’s Goldstein. He adds that his bank is starting to see shades of this even now. “We have multinational clients in China that have been very successful in growing their onshore business through a subsidiary. The build-up of RMB on their books is significant enough that their head offices now want to manage that currency risk and the position itself offshore, because it has become a significant consideration for them in terms of their total book.”</p>
<h3 id=""escaping-isolation"">Escaping isolation</h3>
<p>Despite Beijing’s grand ambitions for the redback, it has its work cut out in spreading the reach of the renminbi across the globe. While China accounts for more than 10% of global trade, its currency is used for only 2% of trade. “At the moment China is not freely linked to the global financial system, and gaining more exposure and experience will be a gradual process,” says RBS’s Ming. “The pace of financial deregulation in China over the past two years has been the fastest of all APAC countries, but there is still a long way to go. China needs to make sure its financial system is mature and robust enough to face global competition.”</p>
<p>While the offshore RMB market was explicitly created to allow the RMB to internationalise, the onshore market remains separate from the global market. As a result the RMB is essentially fragmented at the moment into three main markets: the onshore RMB (CNY) market, the dollar-settled non-deliverable forward (NDF) market, and the offshore RMB (CNH) market.</p>
<p>“Each of these markets has its own demand and supply dynamics because of capital controls and the partial convertibility of the RMB as between the onshore and offshore markets,” says Thomson Reuters’s Kwiatkowski. “These conditions have resulted in the three separate, but related, markets with differentiated FX and interest rates and securities pricing.” However, he goes on to say that as capital controls ease and linkages grow, the level of difficulty in making cross-border transfers will drop, resulting in offshore/onshore convergence.</p>
<p>Addressing pricing differentials is a key factor here. “It is important to understand the difference in and the application of onshore and offshore pricing,” says SABMiller’s Weeks. “Further, establishing efficient liquidity solutions within the country is a target.”</p>
<p>Despite the remaining hurdles, RBS’s Ming is bullish. “This is a currency you cannot afford to ignore,” she concludes. “The question is how to maximise the benefits from a treasury perspective. While the internationalisation process is ongoing, treasury managers need to stay on top of the challenges, understand the implications for their business, and try their best to integrate their Chinese operation into the regional or global treasury system.”</p>
<p>So as the renminbi continues its march to worldwide adoption, treasurers would do well to start thinking about putting their own RMB plans in place.</p>

<h2>Unpacking the PBoC’s Monetary Policy Toolbox</h2>
<p>China’s emergence as a global business hub has been reflected in the rapid expansion and deepening of its bond markets over the past decade. Growing ranks of investors are drawn to China’s securities markets to put their surplus liquidity to work, as an alternative to local bank deposits. Yet even as China’s debt markets join the global investment mainstream, relatively little is understood about the institution with the biggest impact on their interest rates. Insights into the role and activities of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC or Central Bank) are critical to successfully navigating China’s markets, and maximizing the opportunities in this relatively new investment landscape.</p>
<p>As far as global significance is concerned, central banks do not get much more major than the PBoC. It holds the world’s largest stock of foreign currency reserves at close to USD 4 trillion, much of which is invested in US Treasuries. The PBoC is one of the leading financial authorities in the world’s second-largest economy, to which much of Asia and the broader emerging markets are highly geared. It is charged with supporting growth and maintaining financial stability as China makes a historic transition to a more sustainable economic model, and opens up to global markets. As a result, PBoC policy is not only hugely influential in a global context – it is itself evolving to address the challenges of comprehensive regime change.</p>



<blockquote>As far as global significance is concerned, central banks do not get much more major than the PBoC.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>A good starting point for understanding the PBoC is to consider the key differences between the PBoC and other major central banks. First, at the institutional level, the PBoC’s history as an official central bank is relatively short. Established in 1948 as the consolidation of three banks, the PBoC was not mandated to operate as a central bank until 1983. Second, unlike its Western counterparts, the PBoC is not independent from the government as it reports directly to China’s cabinet, the State Council.</p>
<p>Third, the PBoC is operating in an environment of much greater transition than most of its peers in the developed world. Though the PBoC’s mandate is similar, in terms of supporting the economy and preserving financial and price stability, its policy framework is evolving in the midst of accelerated urbanization, industrialization, interest rate and capital account liberalization. Unlike many major central banks, the PBoC is also responsible for operating a managed float exchange rate regime, where domestic money supply can be driven by developments in the current account. In order to manage the balance of payments, the use of capital account regulations is required to control domestic money and credit growth. Fourth and finally, the PBoC’s framework for providing emergency liquidity is less established than that of its counterparts in the developed world and relatively untested.</p>
<p>The last two points of distinction are significant given an unusual feature of China’s markets, whereby volatility is more pronounced at the short end. That is partly because the PBoC does not use a target rate for overnight lending in the interbank market. This also sets the PBoC apart from many central banks where an overnight target rate is the most conventional policy tool, such as the Fed funds rate in the US or the European Central Bank’s refinancing (refi) rate. The lack of an overnight target means that China’s short-term rates are driven to a greater extent by market forces, including supply and demand imbalances stemming from seasonal factors, currency flows or other drivers of liquidity. In May-June of last year, these risks were on display when a particularly strong bout of turbulence drew global attention and ultimately led the PBoC to intervene with additional liquidity.</p>
<p>The PBoC’s policy is evolving in ways that should reduce the risk of volatility spikes, including adding new provisions for lending to banks in times of stress, similar to the ‘discount window’ facilities offered by other major central banks. The Standing Lending Facility (SLF), introduced last year, offers one- to three-month loans to banks on request, while Pledged Supplementary Lending (PSL) can be initiated by the PBoC, offering funds over a three-month to five-year horizon.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The PBoC’s current benchmark rates are set via strict regulation of interest payable on deposits of various tenors in the commercial and retail banking sector (<a href=""#figure-1"">see Figure 1</a>). Restrictions on competition mean that banks are not permitted to add more than 10% to the regulated deposit rate, so the transmission of PBoC policy to longer-term lending rates is relatively direct.</p>

<p>However, interest rates on regulated deposits have an inconsistent relationship with yields on similar maturity benchmark securities traded in the interbank markets. Market rates on very short-dated securities will vary substantially and average at a level that is multiple higher than deposits rates (please see <a href=""/2014/09/chinas-markets-interpreting-interest-rate-volatility-ttad"">China’s Markets: Interpreting Interest Rate Volatility</a> and <a href=""#figure-2"">Figure 2</a>). Even for tenors of three months and over, though historical experience shows that yields on securities tend to move in line with adjustments to deposit rates, prolonged and/or substantial deviations from deposit levels occur frequently (refer <a href=""#figure-2"">Figures 2 &amp; 3</a>).</p>
<h5 id=""figure-2"">Figures 2 &amp; 3: Deposit Rates Versus Short-end Yields</h5>
<p>Term rate changes can impact yields for similar maturity benchmark securities, but large movements in benchmark yields can occur without affecting term rates.</p>

<p>While deposit rates are important tools for influencing the real economy, they are only part of the policy mix in terms of affecting conditions in the interbank market. In order to have a more direct impact on interest rates in the bond market, the PBoC has traditionally relied on a combination of two policy instruments: the Reserve Ratio Requirement (RRR) and Open Market Operations (OMOs).</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The RRR determines the share of customer deposits banks must set aside as reserves rather than lending. Adjusting this ratio allows the Central Bank to increase or reduce the supply of liquidity available for credit expansion, and generally speaking, each half-point adjustment translates to about RMB 500bn of liquidity, considering the current amount of outstanding deposits. The RRR moves in cycles, but is substantially higher today than it was 15 years ago (<a href=""#figure-4"">see Figure 4</a>). The increase is due partly to higher levels of foreign investment throughout China’s rapid economic expansion, as periodic RRR hikes have been commonly used to reduce surplus liquidity introduced by foreign exchange flows.</p>

</figure>
<p>The PBoC’s use of the RRR has declined somewhat in recent times, in favor of OMOs. These are common policy tools: in countries where there is an official target policy rate, OMOs are typically used to smooth market-driven variations from the target. China’s central bank uses OMOs in the absence of a target, to push market rates closer to the PBoC’s preferred levels. OMOs consist of issuing Central Bank Notes (CBNs) and increasingly, engaging in repurchase (repo) and reverse repo agreements.</p>
<p>As is the case with central banks globally, the PBoC’s policy has evolved substantially in recent years. The aim is twofold. The first is to establish a solid framework for liquidity provision in times of market stress via the introduction of the SLF and PSL as special lending facilities. The second and equally important aim is to broaden the Central Bank’s options for providing stimulus given the slowdown in the economy, without compromising the government’s public commitment to key reforms as it strives for more sustainable growth. As a result, the PBoC’s preferred policy measures have shifted in favor of more refined policy tools to deliver liquidity to desired parts of the banking system. Unlike its major developed market peers, which have embarked on a trend towards more frequent and more explicit communication with the market, the PBoC is less inclined to broadcast its actions and projections in advance.</p>
<p>As part of the trend towards subtler action, the PBoC has scaled back its use of the RRR as conventional rate adjustments tend to get widespread media attention. Policymakers have recently adopted more targeted RRR policy, focused on small or rural banks that meet certain criteria in terms of the amount of outstanding loans and/or their location. The Bank has also expanded its use of OMOs, with the introduction of Short-term Liquidity Operations (SLOs) to transact in the repo and reverse repo markets as needed at terms of up to seven days.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, these new instruments are likely to play a larger role in PBoC policy as the Central Bank hones its toolkit for a maturing market. In the medium term, further easing is likely as economic activity has slowed again and policymakers are keen to defend the official 7.5% growth target. Targeted easing rather than overall rate and RRR cuts is more likely for the remainder of this year, given the PBoC’s recent RMB 500bn injection and the government’s preference for less obtrusive measures. The Central Bank may instead provide further liquidity via targeted cuts, and/or deploy its newer facilities for lending directly to specific banks.</p>
<p>These are all critical elements of the PBoC’s policy response to the historic transitions under way in China’s economy and markets. Given the widespread uncertainty surrounding the range and impact of various policy tools, investors stand to benefit from an understanding of the PBoC’s function. This insight should also better equip investors to navigate the risks and opportunities that may arise from further turbulence at this point in the evolution of China’s markets.</p>

Applying the monetary brakes,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The projections for the coming years suggest that growth will be low around the world. In industrialised countries, this points to growth near 2%. In China, growth should hover around 7.5%. From a Western perspective, such a percentage seems almost unattainable, whereas the authorities in Beijing think that if growth were to decline any further, social unrest would ensue. Moreover, this rate is substantially below what the Chinese have been used to in recent decades. Something similar applies to many other emerging economies.</p>
<h3 id=""deflation-threatens"">Deflation threatens</h3>
<p>At first glance, these conditions do not seem conducive to rising interest rates. Quite the opposite; sluggish growth will likely put downward pressure on wages and inflation. It could even lead to deflation. As debts are sky high, that is a risk these economies cannot afford to take as the result could be a downward deflationary spiral. The way to counter this is through ultra-loose monetary policy and persistently low interest rates. If this is a realistic scenario, the financial market trends of the past years will continue. That is to say: stock market rallies, downward pressure on long-dated government bond yields, and narrowing credit spreads.</p>
<p>It would also point to relatively low volatility in the currency market as most countries appear to be ‘in the same boat’. However, we do not think this analysis is valid, most of all because the reason for weak growth varies among the different countries. In some, demand is stagnating and elsewhere supply threatens to falter. This has a very different impact on market rates and prices.</p>

<p>During the credit crisis, lending froze, income declined and deleveraging took place in the US as well as in many other countries. Overcapacity meant that deflation risks were high. At the same time, preventing deflation was the top priority for the US authorities. Ironically, they could only achieve this by accumulating more debt. To this end, the budget deficit widened. Simultaneously, the Fed lowered interest rates and launched a massive bond-buying programme to create more money. Eventually, asset prices rallied, especially property and share prices. This pushed up asset values in the private and business sectors. While the level of indebtedness continued to be high, it was at least offset by more valuable collateral. In turn, this facilitated new borrowing.</p>
<h3 id=""tipping-point"">Tipping point</h3>
<p>However, the higher debt (taken out following the credit crisis) was viewed as a temporary emergency measure to prevent deflation. In the slightly longer term, the idea was always to boost growth until full employment was achieved and (real) wage increases went up. The moment when real wage increases start to rise is crucial to the economy – a genuine tipping point. Generally, this happens in the case of (almost) full employment.</p>
<p>It is no secret that Fed chairwoman Yellen believes full employment is still some way off in the US. Although the jobless rate has dropped from over 10% to around 6%, she thinks there is a lot of hidden unemployment. In addition, a further fall in unemployment is unlikely to happen any time soon. At first glance, this suggests that it will be possible for the Fed to boost the economy for some time to come – and to postpone its rate hikes. However, many economists (including those who are close to Ms Yellen) are beginning to question the wisdom of such a course of action:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Studies indicate that there is a significant mismatch between what businesses expect of their employees and what job applicants have to offer in terms of skills and/or education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demographic trends suggest the decline in the participation rate (the percentage of people of working age available for the labour market) will decline further. Fed research suggests in 2016 just 45,000 additional workers will enter the labour market each month. To put this in perspective: this year, on average 200,000 new jobs have been created on a monthly basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""the-european-approach"">The European approach</h3>
<p>The surprise ECB rate cut and announcement to buy up various bank loans in early September differs from the actions of the Fed. The latter has focused on purchasing bonds, as most US credit is supplied via the capital market, whereas in Europe almost all of it comes from the banks. It seems an effective way to boost credit. After all, one of the main reasons why growth is sluggish in Europe is that the banks are reluctant to lend; specifically in the weak Eurozone countries.</p>

<p>Many economists fear that regardless of interventions by the ECB, economic growth will remain low in the EMU. They point out that the demand for credit is sluggish in both the business and the private sectors. Based on this, they assume that – eventually – the central bank will have no choice but to purchase government bonds on a large scale. However, some European governments are strongly opposing such large-scale quantitative easing as happened in the US:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They want to avoid growth fuelled by credit that could lead to another crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany and the ECB in particular want more structural reforms to increase the added-value per worker to generate growth. They worry that once easing credit starts to boost growth, structural reforms will never be implemented, which would jeopardise the future of the whole of Europe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, the ECB is proposing a deal. It will keep the money taps open – alongside some fiscal stimulation, as far as the central bank is concerned – on the condition that structural reform takes place. The latter will not happen overnight. So for the moment, Germany and the ECB will only boost the economy to the extent that deflation and a negative spiral can be avoided. In practice, this points to growth rates near 1.5%, barely higher than the productivity increase. In other words, the unemployment rate is unlikely to fall (substantially).</p>
<p>The only other ‘windfall’ that Europe can expect is euro weakness. The US will certainly not object to this: as full employment approaches, a stronger dollar would be helpful.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Global economic growth seems set to slow in the coming years, except, perhaps, in emerging economies that manage to substantially boost domestic demand. The reasons why growth is and will be sluggish vary from country to country. In the US and in the UK, we could see full employment in the not-too-distant future. Subsequently, growth will need to slow in order to prevent higher inflation and unsustainable rises in interest rates. In the EMU, outside Germany there is a lot of slack in the economy. At the same time, it is impossible to rapidly stimulate growth due to sluggish demand.</p>

<p>Whereas the Fed and the Bank of England are approaching the moment when they have to apply the monetary brakes, the euro area will need very loose monetary policy in the years ahead. This means we expect US interest rates to increase by much more than those in the EMU and that EUR/USD will decline to 1.20 and lower in the coming months and quarters.</p>

Dark political clouds are gathering,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Banks and other research houses increasingly agree with our assessment that geopolitics is becoming important. They caution that the markets do not pay enough attention to geopolitical risks. Deutsche Bank warned that the “markets are in general taking far too benign an approach to geopolitical risk.” Other banks – for example, Nomura and BNP Paribas – are also focusing on the abyss between the geopolitical reality and the risks that the markets are pricing in (which are often mispriced to boot). The French bank wrote that it is “concerned that geopolitical risks are slowly but surely on the rise, and that markets have grown complacent about this over the years.”</p>
<p>Hotbeds and minefields are concentrated in three regions: the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Ukraine and Russia, and Asia. With reference to MENA, several experts have drawn parallels with the Thirty Years’ War in Europe (1618-1648). Many states are weak and unable to control or secure their own territories. Meanwhile, a handful of relatively powerful nations with a clearly defined identity – including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey – are competing for primacy. At the same time, militias and terrorist organisations are multiplying and gaining ground, as borders crumble.</p>
<h3 id=""age-of-grievance"">Age of Grievance</h3>
<p>At first glance, there is no direct link between the Middle East and the Ukraine. Professor of National Security Strategy Michael J. Mazarr takes a different view. He refers to “the Age of Grievance”. Many groups and communities that pose major security risks, feel displaced and alienated from the liberal international economic world order. Dissatisfaction, pain and fear can translate into violent action – partly to overcome burning humiliation and regain some pride. This motivates many jihadists but also the rebels in Ukraine. Of course, puppet masters like Putin are good at exploiting such emotions. At the same time, geopolitics is here to stay, as evident from the games that Putin plays.</p>
<p>This creates a dangerous brew of power politics, national interests, and feelings of disenfranchisement and resentment among large sections of the population. Especially relevant is that state borders are not always identical with the boundaries between nations.</p>
<p>The existing disaffection and insecurity are exacerbated by the excrescences of globalisation. The process has pulled the rug from under large groups of people who feel they have no legitimate channels to improve their situation. The sociologist Saskia Sassen speaks of global marginalisation. The root cause is that the interests of political elites and the business sector are increasingly entwined. Politicians see economic growth as the ultimate goal which can be achieved if they get into bed with the global business sector. They are often convinced that what is good for business is good for growth and thereby, implicitly, for the population at large. To some degree this may be true but, increasingly, the situation tends to be one-sided. One could speak of the denationalisation of nation-states.</p>

<p>Someone like Putin is a product of (and uses) the opportunities and changes brought by globalisation, the marginalisation of large groups, and the “Age of Grievance“. He exalts Russia’s past as a major (or even super) power and highlights the evil intentions of the West as he plays them off against Russia’s traditions, patriotic and nationalistic tendencies, and search for a national identity. In addition, he is claiming the right to protect Russian speakers abroad. It is blatantly obvious that he interprets this “right“as he sees fit and is not afraid to stoke geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>The geopolitical risks in Asia are less pressing but could have unsettling implications (the region contains four nuclear powers: China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea). The main risks are connected to old-fashioned power politics. The skirmishes between India and Pakistan are of an ongoing nature and there is always the possibility that the North Korean regime will implode or that it will lash out in petulant anger. However, these risks have existed for decades and the markets have learned to live with them. In the past years, the focus has shifted to Asia’s territorial disputes, which involve countries such as Japan, South Korea, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.</p>
<h3 id=""geopolitical-hydra"">Geopolitical hydra</h3>
<p>Geopolitical tension (and its effect on the financial markets) will likely increase rather than subside. To a large degree, the developments in MENA, Ukraine and Russia, and Asia are symptomatic of deep-seated and wide-ranging trends that cannot easily be reversed – global marginalisation, the “Age of Grievance”, weakening nation states, and so on. In 1975, three renowned academics and advisers (operating under the moniker The Trilateral Commission) reported in “Crisis of Democracy” that citizens had ever-higher expectations of governments whereas the states themselves were less and less equipped to meet these expectations. Western governments, in particular, ignored the existing dangers. Security was no longer a priority and complacency was a real risk. They predicted that it would become harder to tackle social or economic problems and that people would lose confidence in the state.</p>
<p>It seems that the Trilateral Commission got it right all those years ago. Today, the West is weakening and the emerging powers are flexing their muscles. The BRICS are setting up a New Development Bank (NDB) as well as a fund to help countries in emergency situations. This Contingency Reserve Arrangement and the NDB are supposed to challenge the dominance of the World Bank and the IMF. However, the financial scope of the plans is relatively limited, while the BRICS have far more reasons to disagree than to concur. We think the BRICS bank has yet to prove itself and that the impact is unlikely to live up to the hype. On the other hand, the balance of power between the West and the emerging economies is shifting; so much is clear. We seem to have arrived at some sort of “twilight zone“. The West lacks the conviction, capabilities, and desire to bring the world “to heel“. At the same time, it is unwilling to share power and influence with the emerging powers. In turn, the latter still lack the clout to overrule the rest should they so want. Theoretically, in a world without a broadly accepted police force or fire brigade, minor quarrels and smouldering fires can quickly grow into earth-shaking crises.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be an efficient method to fight the flames (instead of fanning them). Real solutions are few and far between. At best, it may be possible to manage the potential emergencies but effective geopolitical crisis managers are rare. In other words, this will be a hell of a job. Therefore we strongly recommend that the markets focus on geopolitical developments. Recently, a French magazine referred to the Somalisation of the world. This may be an exaggeration but we could do worse than heed the warning words of former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brezinski: “We are losing control of our ability at the highest levels of dealing with challenges that many of us recognise are fundamental to our well-being. And yet we cannot muster the forces or generate the leadership to deal with them….there is enormous turmoil and fragmentation and uncertainty – not a single central threat to everybody, but a lot of diversified threats to almost everybody.”</p>
<p>It is high time that investors and businesses become aware of the implications of various geopolitical risks. Many fund managers have been saying that asset prices were priced for perfection. Therefore mounting geopolitical risks could be part of the multilayered trigger causing a new bear market.</p>

The introduction of the euro,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>An important date for the world’s financial markets and for tens of thousands of corporations, 1<sup>st</sup> January 1999 marked the launch of the euro, which became the currency of 300 million people in Europe. The single European currency had originally been set out in the provisions of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, with European Union (EU) member states (or at least those who had not opted out of the single currency – namely Denmark, Sweden and the UK), both initial and subsequent, required to meet stringent membership criteria.</p>
<p>Eleven EU countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) had their currencies irrevocably fixed against each other in January 1999, with Greece, whose economy did not meet the initial convergence criteria, joining later in 2001. Since then, six further countries (Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia) have joined the euro, with 18 of the 28 EU member states now using the currency. Lithuania has been approved by the EU to join this list in January 2015. <a href=""#table-1"">Table 1</a> shows the current Eurozone member states with their fixed euro conversion rates.</p>
<p>Overseas departments, territories and islands which are part of euro area countries also use the currency as legal tender, while the micro-states of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City use the euro on the basis of a formal arrangement with the European Community. Montenegro and Kosovo also use the euro, although this is not based on a formal arrangement with the Community.</p>
<p>For the three years following its launch, the euro was an invisible currency – there was no physical cash, and the currency was used only for accounting purposes and electronic payments. Individuals and companies were able to convert their bank accounts to euro, or to open new euro accounts, during the three-year period following the launch of the currency. Then, in January 2002, banknotes and coins of the national currencies (these currencies ceased to be legal tender in March of the same year), such as the Deutsche mark, French franc, and Italian lire, were switched for euro cash at the previously set fixed conversion rates.</p>

</figure>
<p>The first years of the major new system across Europe were challenging, not least because the changes were political in nature (as well as economic and treasury-related). The introduction of the euro touched the nationalist sentiments of populations – some of which were more willing to embrace the changes than others. In France, for example, there was only a slim majority in favour of joining the euro in a referendum. Despite this resistance, the apparatus was ultimately established, progressing to unity across the Eurozone. It is also important to bear in mind that once entered, there is no official mechanism to exit the system.</p>
<h3 id=""european-central-bank"">European Central Bank</h3>
<p>Administration and management of the euro is handled by the European Central Bank (ECB), whose headquarters are in Frankfurt, Germany. The ECB is an independent central bank and it alone has the authority to set monetary policy (which includes the setting of interest rates) across the Eurozone; the ECB’s stated aim of its monetary policy is to achieve currency price stability over the medium term. Before the introduction of the euro, this was handled by countries’ own central banks.</p>
<p>The difficulty for the ECB is that the existence of a single monetary policy and a single market implies that almost all fields of economic policy are affected by European economic and monetary integration, notably budgetary and structural policy. In a speech made just after the launch of euro notes and coins in March 2002, the then-president of the ECB, Dr Willem F Duisenberg, said the ECB’s challenges “are to maintain sound fiscal policies, foster efficiency in public expenditure and tax systems and improve the functioning of labour and product markets in order to enhance the euro area’s growth potential.”</p>
<p>The ECB is also responsible for the production and distribution of euro notes and coins to member states, operation of payment systems in the zone, and bulk transfers between members to ensure adequate supplies of the currency are available in each member state. However, the ECB has allocated each national central bank of the euro area a share of the total annual production of euro banknotes. In September 2002, the Bank established a cash stock for use in exceptional circumstances, called the Eurosystem Strategic Stock (ESS). This stock is intended to be used when logistical stocks in the Eurosystem are insufficient to cover an unexpected increase in the demand for banknotes or in the event of a sudden interruption in supply.</p>
<p>From a legal perspective, both the ECB and euro area countries’ national central banks have the right to issue euro banknotes. In reality, only countries’ national banks physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes and coins. Indeed, the ECB does not have a cash office and is not officially involved in cash operations. The legal issuers of euro coins are the euro area countries, with the European Commission coordinating all coin matters.</p>
<p>The ECB has overall responsibility for overseeing the activities of individual Eurozone member countries’ national central banks and for initiating further harmonisation of cash services within the euro area, while the national banks have remained responsible for the functioning of their national cash-distribution systems. The national banks put euro banknotes and coins into circulation via the banking system as well as via retail trade. The ECB is unable to perform these operations on behalf of Eurozone countries as it does not have its own technical departments (such as distribution units, banknote processing units, or vaults).</p>
<h3 id=""logistical-challenges"">Logistical challenges</h3>
<p>The changeover to euro notes and coins was a significant logistical problem for the ECB, which carried out an advertising campaign throughout 2001 to improve knowledge and understanding of the process. The campaign focused on the features of the notes and coins, security issues, size denominations and overall changeover modalities.</p>
<p>Beyond raising awareness of the changeover, the introduction of the single European currency also led to a number of other problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Lack of legacy currency in lead-up to changeover.</h5>
<p>With no more notes being printed nor coins minted, there was some concern over whether there would be enough notes and coins in the legacy currencies to last to the end of 2001. The Irish Republic, for example, reported shortages of the smallest denomination coins in 2001.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Lack of access to new currency.</h5>
<p>This was a challenge at the beginning of 2001, and was a particular issue for retail outlets, which saw significant demand for small denomination notes and also coins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Queuing in retail outlets.</h5>
<p>A lack of familiarity with the new notes and coins led in a small number of cases to significant queuing at certain retail outlets, with rail and other travellers being especially impacted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Vending machines.</h5>
<p>These had to be adapted or replaced to handle the new currency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""impact-on-business"">Impact on business</h3>
<p>Many corporates also found euro implementation challenging. The initial hurdle for corporate treasury departments was handling the burden of foreign exchange management. Once their systems, policies and processes had been updated, they shifted their attention to cash management incorporating the new currency.</p>
<p>One key advantage of the euro to corporate treasury departments was that it further enhanced the benefits of cash pooling when carried out on a pan-European basis, thus increasing the value of centralised cash management. The majority of large multinational companies operating in Europe rationalised their European cash management structures once pooling in euro became possible. Some corporates, such as Siemens, changed their internal accounting systems over to euros early on (before 2002). Others also insisted that their suppliers invoice them in euro too. Despite the introduction of physical notes and coin being the final, and most visible, stage in the implementation of the single European currency, the actions of corporates to become euro-compliant at this stage made it clear that the euro already existed as a currency well before the actual cash arrived.</p>
<p>In addition to increased benefits of cash pooling under the euro, the single European currency offered a number of other wider advantages to the business community in the zone, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The marketing of goods and services across Europe became more transparent in that prices and competitors could be more easily compared. However, differing tax rates and other costs still mean that there are some price variations across boundaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency settlements are now easier and more effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency fluctuations have been eliminated across the participating countries and their interest rates aligned (as we have seen, monetary policy is set centrally by the ECB, based in Frankfurt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A larger and more liquid capital market has emerged for raising capital, or investing funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merger and acquisition activity across Europe has accelerated, and a more pan-European view of stock markets is generally taken, replacing the focus on countries’ individual bourses. For example, following the launch of the euro, a FTSE Eurobloc 100 index was created, as was a FTSE Eurotop 100 and a wider 300 index.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""development-and-sepa"">Development and SEPA</h3>
<p>Since its launch, the euro has gone on to become the world’s second reserve currency, accounting for 24% of foreign exchange reserves held by central banks. However, it is still some way behind the USD as the reserve currency of choice, which represents 62% of global foreign exchange reserves. Of course this could all change in the long term if China’s RMB continues its path towards internationalisation. The euro is also the world’s second most-traded currency, again behind the USD.</p>
<p>One of the most significant initiatives to be implemented since the launch of the euro has been the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), a payments integration initiative which forms a step towards the completion of the EU internal market and monetary union. SEPA is supported and promoted by the European Payments Council (EPC), the decision-making and coordination body of the European banking industry in relation to payments. The Council develops the payment schemes and frameworks which help to realise SEPA.</p>

<p>Following migration to SEPA Direct Debits (SDD) and SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs) in August 2014 (which had been extended by six months over fears of unpreparedness in the corporate community), 34 countries, 500 million people and 87.5 billion electronic payment transactions annually will be covered by the scheme, according to the EPC. However, despite the benefits of payments harmonisation SEPA promises, some have questioned whether payments technology has moved on too far in the decade it has taken to implement the initiative.</p>

Rising interest rates as central banks seek higher inflation,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Increasingly, central banks face a dilemma. Typically, when an economy is in the grip of recession, key interest rates are lowered until economic growth picks up. Subsequently, rates need to be hiked as monetary policy is tightened. The idea is that growth will drop to the level of potential growth exactly as the economy reaches full capacity utilisation.</p>
<p>Potential growth is defined as the sum total of the increase in productivity and the increase in the working population. It points to the growth rate that can be achieved – in theory – when the economy is running at full capacity without higher inflation. In reality, this never happens. Instead, an overshoot tends to occur. Next, interest rates need to go up and monetary tightening is required to restore the balance. Often, this leads to a new recession.</p>
<p>Following the credit crisis, the big problem was that even an ultra-loose fiscal policy and minimal interest rates were not enough to kick-start the economy. As a result, central banks started to create more money than the real economy could absorb.</p>
<p>This money had to go somewhere. To a certain degree, it remained stuck in the banking system but a lot ended up in the financial markets, where it put upward pressure on the prices of stocks, bonds, and houses. As the balance sheets of consumers and businesses improved, deleveraging decreased until, at a certain moment, people started to borrow more and they saved less. Easing credit started to boost growth and job creation. Wage income picked up and confidence improved. This will likely result in rising consumption and investments, leading to an upward economic spiral.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is that expanding credit will cause the money multiplier and money velocity to rise. If this happens in a situation of massive money creation, hyperinflation will loom. The only way to stop this is to rapidly remove the surplus liquidity from the economy. There is a chance that prices will plunge just as fast if the extra money is removed. If this scenario unfolds, growth will nosedive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a possibility that an improving economy will offset shrinking money supply. In that case, asset prices will stay reasonably high. The IMF is not optimistic in this respect; at least, in connection with the West. The reason is that, compared with before, investment has been poor for years. As a result, the increase in productivity has dropped while the increase in the working population is declining owing to the ageing population. And as a consequence of this, potential growth has decreased in Europe and the US. As a result, rising interest rates and tighter monetary policy can send asset prices tumbling.</p>
<p>This brings us to the central banks’ dilemma. Seven years since the credit crisis broke out, low interest rates and ultra-loose monetary policy are still paving the way towards full capacity utilisation. Growth will have to be driven down once full capacity utilisation has been reached. A likely implication is that stock markets will collapse. The situation demands very loose monetary policy. However, the sobering fact is that this will result in bubbles that will burst, eventually.</p>
<h3 id=""bank-of-england-changes-tack"">Bank of England changes tack</h3>
<p>Remarkably, last month the Bank of England stated that interest rates could be raised sooner than the markets are discounting. Evidently, a conclusion has been reached that to keep the base rate on hold for a long period of time will increase the risk of bubbles, which are bound to burst once interest rates rise sharply. The question on everyone’s lips is: does the same apply to the Fed?</p>
<h3 id=""deflation-or-inflation"">Deflation or inflation?</h3>
<p>The US central bank faces a complicated situation. Most of all, because of huge uncertainty about the real state of the economy. Various important data has led to doubt. First and foremost, data linked to the job market. Wage increases are still low. At the same time, leading indicators point to gradual upward pressure. The rate at which wages rise depends on the tightness of the US labour market. In the past few years unemployment has dropped faster than expected. It is now close to the rate considered ‘full employment’ (5%-5.5%).</p>
<p>Quite a few economists think that from now on, the jobless rate will not drop as quickly. Other economists disagree. Their argument is that if all existing vacancies were to be filled, unemployment would be around 4%. This is highly unlikely; businesses complain that many jobseekers lack the required skills and/or training. The conclusion is that ‘full employment’ may be realised when the jobless rate is 6%-6.5% instead of 5%-5.5% because many people feel they are unemployable and will no longer be looking for work.</p>

</figure>
<p>Growth is another contentious factor. In Q1, the US economy likely saw a contraction of nearly 3%. This calls into question the underlying strength of the US economy. Remarkably, employment has increased substantially in the first quarter of this year, at a rate that would be compatible with growth rates near 3%. This suggests that either the payroll data or the growth data is out of kilter. Experience shows that the growth data is the most likely ‘culprit’. If so, it would indicate the underlying vigour of the US economy. Of course, this will have implications for interest rate policy.</p>
<h3 id=""monetary-policy-based-on-trial-and-error"">Monetary policy based on trial and error</h3>
<p>Our conclusion is that these uncertainties make it very hard to pinpoint the ‘correct’ monetary policy. A method of trial and error will have to be employed to find out how to prevent plummeting asset prices and deflation, while at the same time limiting the risk of high inflation and (additional) bubbles. At the present juncture, most central banks seemingly prefer an overly loose monetary policy to premature tightening.</p>
<p>This does not offer a favourable outlook for bonds and stock in the United States. What the Fed wants is no secret. First, the US economy should achieve full employment; rapidly or at leisure. Then wages should increase. One thing is clear: consumption cannot be fuelled by easing credit forever. In short, higher disposable incomes are the solution. This could be done by raising wages at the expense of profits. This should be possible, since wages have lagged profits for decades.</p>
<p>How can you achieve this shift from higher profits to rising wage increases? Once wages soar, inflation will rise and can only be contained if interest rates are raised. If this results in plunging asset prices, growth will decelerate and as the slack returns to the labour market, wages will stop rising. A way out would be to allow slowly rising inflation. This could happen as follows: as the job market tightens, wages go up. Subsequently, the central bank raises the short-term interest rate albeit cautiously, so asset prices do not fall sharply and the economy continues to grow at a reasonable pace.</p>

<p>The latter will drive up inflation but as soon as investors become aware of this, long-term interest rates will rise. Although the central bank will need to raise the fund rate, it can stay behind the curve and the rate hikes will not be severe enough to seriously dampen economic growth. Or inflation, for that matter. Not a particularly favourable climate for bonds or equities because nominal interest rates would be rising and wages will rise at the expense of profits.</p>

Cracks in globalisation and EU to break euro,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>European markets have been in a relatively ‘good mood’ for some years. However, the list of political-economic and geopolitical challenges that Europe has to contend with is long and daunting. Opinions differ about the monetary policy the ECB should pursue. Some claim the central bank has done little more than put an artificial and fragile safety net under the Eurozone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is substantial discord on the degree of fiscal consolidation that will be required to restore Europe to health. On top of that, doubts about the robustness of the banking sector have not gone away and there are misgivings about the underlying vigour of quite a few economies. Also, it is feared that a paralysing anti-European storm of protests will sweep through Europe at the same time as ‘Cold War 2.0’ is about to break out.</p>
<h3 id=""naive-faith-in-globalisation"">Naive faith in globalisation?</h3>
<p>Should optimistic views about globalisation like those of American foreign policy academic and author Michael Mandelbaum hold true, Europe may manage to defuse the crisis as new markets open, economic ties strengthen, and member states realise they have a common goal. Namely, to increase prosperity and profit from the ongoing technological innovation.</p>
<p>This unbridled positivism may be too upbeat. Technological advancement is not always a blessing. Increasingly, people find that the “Big Brother is watching you” nightmare is still there when they wake up. Mandelbaum (and others) seems overly optimistic and eager to turn a blind eye to the human talent of turning gold into lead.</p>
<p>The belief that there is a global consensus that a market economy is a prerequisite for the creation of prosperity may be partially true, but the concept is viewed in a variety of ways. Moreover, the credit crisis has highlighted the vulnerabilities of capitalism while soaring inequality undermines societies, as people like French economist Thomas Piketty argue.</p>
<p>The final argument that underpins this unwavering faith in globalisation states that politicians are now solely judged on how prosperous the economy is on their watch, with GDP almost the new god. But to quote Dutch columnist Bas Heijne: “Identity, religion, tribe, flag, nation, tradition, history, group loyalty, simplistic stereotypes of the enemy, dreams of glorious peoples and countries – the time has come to acknowledge that these are not exotic notions that belong in an earlier century. They are frighteningly contemporary. This storm will not subside.”</p>
<p>That geopolitics is rearing its head again shows that economics is not the whole story. The problem is that, so far, the politicians have used economic arguments to sell Europe to voters. One reason why Europe suffers blow after blow is that its foundations are perceived to be purely economic. Therefore its identity is wafer thin, particularly now that EU politicians seem unable to deliver in terms of growth and prosperity. Simultaneously, they are manoeuvred into a corner by a blatantly aggressive – albeit realistic – leader like Vladimir Putin.</p>
<h3 id=""lessons-from-the-past"">Lessons from the past</h3>
<p>Putin has used the Ukraine crisis to return to old-fashioned power politics. Many EU leaders are unnerved and alarmed. “This is no longer the way we interact,” they say. Well, apparently it is. We are witnessing a faltering and fatigued superpower, competing emerging great powers, social unrest, geopolitical tensions, and a Russian ruler who dreams of imperial expansion. Therefore it would be naive to rule out large-scale conflicts on the European continent, with global implications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The belief that there is a global consensus that a market economy is a prerequisite for the creation of prosperity may be partially true, but the concept is viewed in a variety of ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mistake has been made before. Namely, on the eve of the First World War, by some of the brightest minds around. Economic interconnectedness simply is not enough to avert war.</p>
<p>Another lesson we can draw from the First World War is that it was impossible to forecast based on trends in the preceding years and decades. On the contrary, according to Cambridge Professor Christopher Clark, the war resulted from “short, sharp realignments in the system which no one predicted.” As he lucidly explains, a handful of small unforeseen events that might seem mundane at first glance could have far reaching consequences “when politics fails, when conversation stops, and compromise becomes impossible”.</p>
<p>Still, a Cold War 2.0 seems unlikely (also because the appetite is lacking in the West and Russia does not have enough resources). Thankfully, a “Hot War” between West and East is not really on the horizon either. All the same, war is not extinct on the European continent. In fact, in times of economic turmoil, there could be more cause for concern, not less.</p>
<h3 id=""the-ss-officer-and-the-iron-lady"">The SS officer and the Iron Lady</h3>
<p>So far, the Ukraine crisis has done little to bring Europeans to their senses or prompt them to work together. Quite the opposite; the crisis has exposed the chinks in Europe’s armour. This is not surprising if we look at the evolution of the European integration project. On closer examination, geopolitics and power games have never been absent.</p>
<p>In 1945, SS leader Himmler wrote a letter to French leader De Gaulle in which the German laid out the options for France: “So you have won. Now what do you do? Join the Anglo-Saxons? They will treat you as a satellite. The Soviets? They will subjugate France and liquidate you. The only road for you is an entente with vanquished Germany.” De Gaulle saw that, to some degree, this message rang true. He saw the EU as “Greater France”. The Dutch historian Mathieu Segers cites a Dutch official: “The six without the UK (the nations that founded the ECSC, the precursor of the EEC) mainly mirror French egocentric politics… Germany will follow France’s lead but think to itself: later on, Berlin will call the shots in European politics.”</p>
<p>Some say that Margaret Thatcher had the same vision. For instance, she was greatly opposed to German reunification after the Berlin Wall came down. During an impromptu summit it turned out that she greatly mistrusted the Germans. She pointed out that during its first period of unification (1870-1945) Germany had constantly veered between aggression and self-doubt. Ultimately, this wreaked havoc around the world but it was equally traumatic for the Germans themselves. Thatcher believed that this gave rise to dangerous tendencies in Germany. Although the Germans voluntarily agreed to become part of a federal Europe, the British Prime Minister believed that this would provide Germany with the opportunity to grow into the dominant country on the continent. The aftermath of the euro crisis indicates that Mrs Thatcher had a point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cosy get-togethers and intrigues in Brussels have been good for Europe, which has been peaceful and prosperous for decades. However, growing affluence is no longer a given and now that geopolitics has returned to the continent, European citizens are no longer inclined to swallow the rhetoric.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""political-firestorm-to-trash-euro"">Political firestorm to trash euro?</h3>
<p>That brings us back to 2014: Berlin calls the shots as the euro is still going strong and markets appear cheerful. However, socio-economic repercussions of the crisis continue to cause suffering. Politicians, lawmakers and central bankers have their work cut out. They need to come up with credible monetary policy, healthy public finances, a resilient banking system, and sound economic foundations. Simultaneously, Europe is under pressure from geopolitical power games and anti-European populist nationalism, partly because of concerns over the degeneration of the welfare state, plus anxiety triggered by globalisation.</p>
<p>Socio-economic disparity widens into a yawning political abyss and it will be an uphill struggle to implement structural reforms. The cosy get-togethers and intrigues in Brussels have been good for Europe, which has been peaceful and prosperous for decades. However, growing affluence is no longer a given and now that geopolitics has returned to the continent, European citizens are no longer inclined to swallow the rhetoric. A new climate is emerging: less technocratic, more political and thus also less rational and predictable, more intuitive and emotional. The wind is getting up and storms may be about to strike.</p>

US economy improving: but how much?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In all likelihood, Q1 growth in the US has been below rather than above 1.5%. However, this weakness occurred in the months of January and February, precisely when there was a cold snap hindering economic activity. To some degree, destocking may also have played a part. The March US payroll report, however, was encouraging. Around 190,000 jobs were created while the number of working hours rose substantially. This amounts to approximately one million extra jobs. Of course, job creation had declined sharply in previous months but this development is evidence that the economy is resilient and shows growth accelerated markedly in March.</p>
<p>On top of this, several indicators point to significantly higher job creation in April than in March. We think this shows that little has changed, relative to the second half of last year. During that period, growth was slightly below 3.5%, notwithstanding the government shutdown and the bad weather in December (without these factors, it might have been higher than 4%). At the time, analysts took a sceptical view because incomes were not rising much and consumers were deleveraging.</p>
<p>For the coming year, most economists assume that growth will be close to 3%. Conversely, we believe there is a fairly high chance it will be (substantially) higher, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The easing off of fiscal drag will add around 1.5% to growth in the course of 2014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monetary stimulus tends to have an effect on growth after an extensive delay. We think that will be the case this time too. After all, the process unfolds in different stages. Firstly, asset prices need to go up. Secondly, balance sheets need to improve until consumers and businesses feel sufficiently secure to borrow and spend more. Based on various confidence gauges, by now this has finally started to happen. Not to mention that many consumer balance sheets have strengthened so much that deleveraging may be coming to an end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various signals point to rising wage increases. In combination with higher employment, this is boosting purchasing power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expanding oil and gas exploitation is boosting US economic growth and US competitiveness has improved markedly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surveys in the business sector indicate that many companies may be about to invest. In the recent past, businesses have often been hesitant, largely because of the turbulent political situation in the US and the uncertain economic prospects. In some ways, these factors have changed for the better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""spotlight-on-policy"">Spotlight on policy</h3>
<p>The next question is what does this mean for Fed policy? The central bank is not against higher growth as long as inflation risks are contained. If we consider the low rate of inflation of the past period, at first glance this threat seems minimal. Some Fed members are even worried about deflation. However, in our view, the risk of inflation should be taken more seriously.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Fed has created massive amounts of money. Normally, hyperinflation would have loomed a long time ago but not this time. The reason is that the money multiplier and money velocity were much lower because credit was tight, as result of the financial crisis. Presently (underlying) economic growth has exceeded 3% for a number of quarters whereas incomes are only increasing marginally. This has to mean that borrowing is picking up. In that case, the money multiplier and the rate of money circulation are on their way up.</p>

</figure>
<p>Furthermore, US banks, businesses, and consumers have seen considerable improvements to their balance sheets. In addition, nominal economic growth is around 5% while the short-term interest rate is zero. The implication is that, for the moment, borrowing is attractive and very profitable indeed. All the more so as credit spreads are very narrow.</p>
<p>How quickly inflation will become a threat (as credit continues to ease) depends on the degree of spare capacity in the economy. As it increases, inflation risks ease. This reserve capacity is connected to the capacity utilisation in the business sector and the tightness of the labour market. If economic growth is just below 3% – and many economists are assuming this will be the case in the near future – capacity will remain underutilised. Especially as it is hoped that higher investment will increase productivity. On the other hand, the outlook will change dramatically if growth is well above 3%. Next, business capacity utilisation will rise rapidly as the labour market continues to tighten.</p>
<h3 id=""rate-expectations"">Rate expectations</h3>
<p>With this in mind, the Fed’s forecasts are fascinating (but let’s not forget that the central bank’s projections have often been off the mark). For 2014, the central bank anticipates growth of around 3% which is supposed to accelerate to 3.4% in 2015. On top of this, the Fed does not expect any labour market tightness for the foreseeable future and it maintains that the neutral interest rate is around 4%. (That is to say, a level where interest rates will neither boost nor hamper the economy). The Fed expects to implement a quarter-point rate hike every three months, starting from mid-2015. If so, its key interest rate will be neutral in 2019. Until then, the central bank thinks it can hold its benchmark rate at a level where it will continue to boost economic growth, albeit to a decreasing extent.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Fed has to contain interest rate expectations. As long as it thinks that inflation is not a threat, the central bank has every reason to keep interest rates as low as possible as this will ensure maximum economic growth. Everyone benefits if spare capacity disappears as soon as possible (first of all from the labour market).</p>
<p>Many economists think that inflation will be minimal for some time. As a result, analysts assume that bond yields will only rise by a few percentage points as economic growth picks up. If long-term interest rates rose by more, they would soon act as a drag on the economy. This is also reflected in the interest rate forecasts of the Fed and Bank of England members.</p>
<p>In some ways, this situation is reminiscent of the early 1980s. However, at that time, after decades of rising inflation, virtually no one believed the rate would drop sharply. It was considered a success if inflation did not rise further. In our view, the opposite applies now. We expect more, not fewer, rate hikes in the future. And not just because we believe growth will exceed 3%. In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The US job market appears to be fairly tight already. There is a substantial mismatch between the education and skills that businesses need and the actual competencies of many jobseekers. An ageing population aggravates this problem. Admittedly, so far wage increases do not point to a tightening job market as they are comparatively low. We expect major changes in the coming months, as it becomes clear that growth will be considerably higher than 3%. In the course of the year the labour market could tighten rapidly and wages will rise faster; especially for highly educated employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the nominal US growth rate is now rising to 5%, an unchanged Fed funds rate of near 0% will provide extra monetary stimulus for the economy in the year ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fed hopes that more investment will increase productivity. This would contain unit labour costs and thereby inflation. If experience is a guide, such developments cannot be predicted with any accuracy. The real outcome could be very different.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In our view, the yield on ten-year US Treasury Bonds could climb to 3.5%-4% by the end of the year as economic growth and inflation risks will rise more than most economists currently expect. In its wake, the yield on ten-year German government bonds may rise to 2%-2.25%.</p>

<p>Since Russia sent armed forces into the Crimean peninsula, one thing has become clear, the West is weaker than it was. In itself, this is understandable. After the Cold War ended, defence spending in the West – especially in Europe – has decreased steadily. Furthermore there was no obvious enemy. The Soviet Union had disintegrated, many eastern European countries came under the umbrella of NATO and China was not expected to show aggression to the outside world.</p>
<p>As globalisation took off, the focus shifted from military to economic power. On top of this, the US was getting fed up with having to act as the world’s policeman, not least because the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan turned out to be far too expensive, even for the wealthy Americans.</p>
<p>Obviously, Moscow and Beijing saw things differently. The collapse of the Soviet Union made Russia much weaker – and poorer – but it still had a trump card. Namely, oil and gas exports. This ramped up earnings to such an extent that the country had plenty of money to rebuild its army. The expectation is that a few years from now the Russian army will (hypothetically) be a formidable adversary. The Chinese are also very active. Like the Russian defence forces, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army is building up its strength.</p>

<p>At the same time, it has nuclear weapons to deter would-be belligerents. However, the country has another weak spot. Mass migration in the early years of the Soviet Union meant that populations with different religions, ethnic backgrounds, and historic affiliations were thrown together. The mix of different people did not gel; often they were sworn enemies to start with. In other words, Russia and the former Soviet states are very exposed to external infiltration. Moscow therefore wants a strong conventional army in order to keep various ethnic minorities under control.</p>
<p>Another advantage of having an army is that it could – if the opportunity presents itself – regain lost ground in countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union but have become autonomous. Ukraine is a prime example. Sections of its population would prefer to link up with the West rather than be dependent on Russia. Should these citizens get their way, suddenly there will no longer be a buffer zone between Russia and the West.</p>
<p>China faces a different situation as it needs to import many commodities. As the country develops economically, it is increasingly vulnerable to blackmail by commodity-exporting countries and/or by countries threatening to stem the flow of commodities into China. For this reason, China is looking suspiciously at Japan, which is also a commodity importer. In that sense, Japan and China are rivals. Based on these considerations, it is no surprise that China has made use of its growing prosperity to build a large army; an important aim is to safeguard the inflow of commodities.</p>
<h3 id=""european-strength-increasingly-necessary"">European strength increasingly necessary</h3>
<p>Currently, the Americans are shifting their attention eastward. They, too, have plenty of commodities at home, unlike the European countries that have to import numerous raw materials. Inevitably, this pitches them against the awakening giants, China and Russia. The only solution is a closer collaboration within Europe, in military and economic areas. Individually, each European country is too weak to rival China or Russia. In recent decades, Europe’s global standing has declined. Undoubtedly, this process will accelerate in the context of the ‘new world order’ that is shaping up, unless the European countries manage to join forces.</p>
<p>An ever larger portion of the European population does not want this to happen. They blame Brussels and the euro for the fact that their household finances have deteriorated, particularly in comparison with the promises that many politicians have made in the past. In our view, this blame game is unjustified. The aforementioned decline has everything to do with poor or unsuitable education/training and inflexible job and product markets.</p>
<p>In this respect, the European parliamentary elections in May will be crucial. From our perspective, the current developments in Ukraine should alert voters to the fact that the European countries will become insignificant in the not too distant future – unless they work together. Failing to do so would gravely undermine the European project. One can only hope that this ‘wake-up call’ will translate into electoral losses for the anti-Europe parties.</p>
<p>However, for the time being the opinion polls point in the opposite direction. The election outcome could be a very important signal for the longer-term investors in Europe and determine the fate of the euro.</p>

<p>Experts agree that if the EMU and the euro are to survive, a banking and fiscal union is necessary. The latter would imply that if one of the member states goes under, the other states will have to foot the bills. In practice, Germany will carry the heaviest burden. Therefore the richer Eurozone states – led by Germany – will only be prepared to move in this direction if the chance of a sovereign default is minimal in real terms. To achieve this, two developments are essential.</p>
<p>Countries such as Italy and France need to do more to restructure on a large scale in order to boost potential growth to a similar level as in Germany. Reforms are the only way to overcome the current economic misery, prevent public finances spiraling out of control and to free up money to increase defence spending.</p>
<h3 id=""money-illusion"">Money illusion</h3>
<p>In that sense, we are not impressed that bond yields in the distressed Eurozone member states – for example, Italy and Spain – have dropped sharply. As far as ECR Research is concerned, this should be filed under money illusion. Because of the massive money creation around the world, investors are hunting for higher returns. When the ECB promised to buy unlimited quantities of short-term government debt, everyone chased after the high yielding bonds issued by the weak Eurozone countries. As bond yields dropped, in a cyclical sense these member states were better off. Therefore they attracted more capital, and so on. The downside is that all of this eases the pressure on politicians to push through structural reforms. Especially in the longer term, the outlook is getting worse, not better.</p>
<p>In addition, Eurozone countries will need to work closely together or they will be steamrollered by superpowers like China, the US and India as their economies lag behind. Under such conditions, it would be very risky for the European countries to guarantee each others’ finances.</p>
<p>If the opinion polls are correct, the anti-Europe parties will gain a lot of seats. In all likelihood, this will make it very hard for Europe to achieve the degree of integration and collaboration that is needed to offer the member states a healthy financial future. In the longer term, this will certainly affect the euro and the performance of the European stock markets.</p>

Perestroika,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Perestroika is a Russian word which entered dialects around the globe in the late 1980s when the Soviet Union began its transformation from a socialist state into a free market capitalist country. Literally meaning ‘restructuring,’ Perestroika first fell from the lips of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 alongside its partner ‘Glasnost’, which means openness. Together, Perestroika and Glasnost laid down the platform for reform which would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union already faced many challenges when Gorbachev assumed the Soviet leadership. The centrally planned Soviet economy was in decline. Military spending was high – equating to circa 25% of Soviet GDP and 70% of industrial output. Soviet society was suffering from a decline in living standards with a general shortage of basic supplies. Civil unrest was the natural by-product of this decline and was further fuelled by nationalism and the advancement of technology which allowed Soviet people a glimpse of the prosperous capitalist world beyond the iron curtain.</p>
<h3 id=""the-soviet-economy"">The Soviet economy</h3>
<p>The story of Perestroika actually begins decades prior to Gorbachev’s tenure, in the infancy of the Soviet Union. Officially formed in 1922 by the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, the Soviet economy began to take its true shape following the rise to power of Joseph Stalin. Heavily influenced by the vision of both Lenin and the economist Karl Marx, Stalin implemented an ideology which committed the Soviet Union to a centrally planned top down economy. The Soviet government owned and controlled all aspects of the economy. Private ownership was prohibited and all goods manufactured were utilised by the government. Five year plans implemented by Gosplan, the State Planning Commission, directed the economy – setting targets for Soviet enterprises. Supplemented by an annual plan, the Soviet government allocated materials and funding to each sector of the economy and determined what, when and how much of a product would be created and its value.</p>
<p>Under Stalin the Soviet economy underwent a dramatic transformation, industrialising at an unprecedented level. For Stalin the Soviet Union was 50 to 100 years behind the rest of the world and needed to catch up in ten years or face extinction. To achieve this, Stalin implemented a ‘big push’ for the economy, driven by heavy industry, collectivised agriculture and the production of capital goods.</p>
<p>Stalin’s push worked. The economy boomed, transforming the Soviet Union into an industrial giant. And even though the devastation of World War II put a temporary halt to Soviet economic growth, in the wake of the conflict, recovery was swift. Driven by the centrally-planned economy and continued industrialisation, output soared and the Soviet Union posted average yearly growth of around 10% between 1950 and 1960 which, according to Soviet statistics at the time, outpaced that of the United States.</p>
<h3 id=""cracks-under-the-surface"">Cracks under the surface</h3>
<p>From the outside looking in, the 1970s Soviet Union appeared to be a political, economic and militaristic powerhouse. In some respects this assessment was true, but cracks were beginning to appear. In reality, the Soviet Union had reached its economic zenith in the late 1960s, and in the following decade it began to stagnate.</p>
<p>“There was always a problem with the state run economy,” states Mike Bowker, Senior Lecturer in Russian History at the University of East Anglia (UEA), “and at this time it could not cope with the changes internally and internationally.” Soviet central planners were beginning to struggle with the vastness and complexity of the country’s economic system, which had already reached its peak, and action was needed to maintain the levels of production and growth.</p>
<p>Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev however, assumed the premiership promising to retain the status quo. Only limited economic reforms were therefore introduced early in his tenure which were often mismanaged and underfunded. “The commitment to the reforms was always doubted,” says Bowker, “and because of this they faded out and failed to reinvigorate the economy.” As a result Soviet industry was unable to modernise and intensify production, output stalled from 1979-82 and the economy began to cripple.</p>
<p>Brezhnev’s New Social Contract also played a role in the stagnating economy. Promising Soviet society employment, wages, accommodation and social security, the Contract killed social mobility. Therefore, Soviet people no longer had any incentive to work hard, other than to hit the targets set by Gosplan. As a result, productivity and quality were reinforced as secondary objectives for the Soviet workforce and begun to decline, causing further economic trouble for the country.</p>
<h3 id=""enter-gorbachev"">Enter Gorbachev</h3>
<p>On 11<sup>th</sup> March 1985, 54 year old Mikhail Gorbachev assumed the role of General Secretary of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev was the first leader of the Soviet Union born after the revolution and was regarded by many as a leader with the potential to bring change. Facing a tidal wave of problems, Gorbachev quickly realised that the old policies were not working. He soon denounced the policies which had gone before him and laid out his own roadmap for restructuring.</p>
<p>Perestroika was first mentioned in Mikhail Gorbachev’s economic report just a few days into his tenure. However his initial attempts at reforms sought to accelerate the economy through investment in industry. These produced little results as they repeated the fatal error of previous measures – failing to address the structural problems at the heart of the faltering economy. As a result, his policies became more radical throughout his tenure.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the January 1987 Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee that Perestroika was announced as an official state policy. Together with Glasnost, Perestroika outlined Gorbachev’s third way in which he sought “resolute and radical elimination of obstacles hindering social and economic development of outdated methods of managing the economy and of dogmatic stereotype mentality.” He believed this would “resolutely reverse the unfavourable tendencies in the developing of the economy, to impart to it the due dynamism and to give scope to the initiative and creativity of the masses to truly revolutionise change.”</p>
<p>UEA’s Bowker sees Gorbachev’s policies at this time as an “attempt to reform the system, not overthrow it. His main idea was to introduce the efficiency of a market based system which had the social conscience of socialism. It was a last chance saloon for Soviet style socialism.”</p>
<p>Perestroika is often attacked as a vague term which promised a lot but offered few elements of practical policy. To a certain degree, this may be true. The Soviet government often changed and adapted the meaning of Perestroika as conditions in the Soviet Union shifted. There were, however, a number of quantifiable policies which were introduced – these, Bowker says, “in hindsight may seem insignificant but at the time were fairly revolutionary.” The first of these was the Law of State Enterprises; passed in 1987, which was introduced to remove the grip of central planners over the productive elements of the Soviet economy. It allowed enterprises to adopt free market methods and adjust their levels of output according to supply and demand. State orders however still needed to be fulfilled and inexperience of private management led to a number of issues such as inter-enterprise debt and the failure to pay taxes, which ultimately caused more harm than good.</p>
<p>A year later, the Law on Co-operatives was passed, expanding the co-operative sector to include privately owned ventures which were treated under the laws as state owned businesses. Privately owned restaurants, shops and salons soon began to flourish under the new policies, lining the streets of the major Soviet cities and offering a better service than their state-run counterparts. Furthermore, foreign trade was no longer monopolised by the government and limited foreign investment was granted in the form of joint ventures. Red tape however often made this problematic.</p>
<h3 id=""shortcomings"">Shortcomings</h3>
<p>The decentralisation that these policies created ultimately failed to have the desired effect on the economy and may in fact have attributed to its eventual collapse. One of the key issues was that Soviet bureaucracy and industry at all levels were so deeply entrenched in the centrally planned Soviet structure that the transformation was mismanaged. Gorbachev later highlighted this shortcoming in his memoirs stating that there was “confusion caused by the haphazard transition of industry to a system of cost accounting, self-financing and self-management.” Furthermore, the policies created new problems for the Soviet Union as the government had to rescue enterprises which it could not allow to fail. In addition, the lack of basic supplies worsened as co-operatives poached the best workers away from state run enterprises and began charging higher prices than the average Soviet could afford for their products. This saw growing resentment build towards Gorbachev and Perestroika as living standards fell.</p>
<p>Perestroika was also played out in the shadow of the Cold War which limited the effects it could have. The inability of the Soviet leadership to escape the Cold War paradox meant that the economy remained strained due to high defence spending and a fear of losing parity with the United States. Reforms therefore still had to maintain the military status quo which underpinned the system and although Gorbachev ultimately brought an end to the Cold War, it was too late for the Soviet economy to escape the paradox.</p>
<h3 id=""the-curtain-collapses"">The curtain collapses</h3>
<p>A year into Gorbachev’s Perestroika programme, the Soviet Union was showing little sign of improvement. Nationalist demonstrations and conflicts swept through the Union in 1989 as Soviet satellite nations buoyed by policies of Perestroika and Glasnost established their own regimes. Conditions for Soviet citizens continued to decline, with large queues for basic supplies becoming a regular feature across the Soviet landscape. Conditions reached unprecedented levels in 1990 which saw rationing introduced for the first time since World War Two. The same year also played host to one of the most iconic moments of the 20<sup>th</sup> century as German citizens from both the East and West reunited when the Berlin wall was torn down and the country was brought together under one flag. This event metaphorically signalled the collapse of the iron curtain and the Soviet Empire which was formally disbanded on the 26<sup>th</sup> December 1991.</p>
<p>The extent to which Perestroika caused this collapse is a point still debated today by historians. Some suggest that the Soviet system was doomed to fail from its conception and eventually collapsed under its own weight. The other school of thought suggests that the collapse may have been unavoidable but that Gorbachev’s policies turned the tide and ultimately triggered its collapse. Bowker believes that ultimately “the Soviet economic system was unsuitable for the modern era which it was entering. Gorbachev’s reforms failed primarily in the economic sphere and this proved a catalyst for the collapse. It’s his policy of Perestroika, therefore, which explains why the collapse happened when it happened.”</p>
<p>Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia became the successor state. Led by Boris Yeltsin, Russia continued with the reforms which began under Gorbachev, especially in the political sphere, with the further establishment of democracy and integration into the world system. Economically, however, Yeltsin moved beyond the restructuring brought on by Perestroika and abandoned the Soviet system all together replacing it with a capitalist market based system. This was pursued under the title of ‘shock therapy’ which had three main pillars; liberalisation, stabilisation and privatisation.</p>
<p>Rather than bringing Russia to life, ‘shock therapy’ had adverse effects on the economy. The liberalisation of the economy saw Russia begin to suffer from hyperinflation in 1992, reaching 2,520% at its peak. The economy also shrank dramatically and by the end of 1995 Russian GDP had declined by 50% since 1990, a greater decline than that experienced by the United States during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Exchange between the ruble and the US dollar was legalised which caused further economic instability. The rate of exchange initially sat at 144 rubles per $1 but this rose significantly over the following years to around 500 rubles per $1 in 1993. Despite all the problems the Russian economy was facing, the West, led by the United States and IMF, urged Russia to continue its rapid transition.</p>
<p>The detrimental effects which ‘shock therapy’ had on the economy played out in Russian society during the early 1990s and conditions were far from those first envisaged when Gorbachev introduced Perestroika. Unemployment swept across Russia as state run factories closed. Poverty in the country increased from 1.5% of the population in the late Soviet era to around 45% in 1993. With inflation and the lowering value of the ruble, the average Russian’s purchasing power had decreased meaning that they could afford very little, despite the shelves now being full, unlike in the late Soviet era.</p>
<p>Diseases and addiction ravaged the population, who could no longer afford basic medicine. Violent crime and ethnic conflict also began to spread. It was a dire time for the Russian population and is widely recognised as not only one of the most devastating peacetime economic collapses but also a human tragedy. Gorbachev, the father of the reforms, stated in a 2010 New York Times op-ed that ultimately “shock therapy was much worse than the disease.” For the Russians who lived through the fall of the Soviet Union and the 1990s, the promise of Perestroika had not delivered and shock therapy caused further pain to the nation. Many longed for a return to the Soviet era.</p>
<h3 id=""in-retrospect"">In retrospect</h3>
<p>Domestically, Perestroika remains a polarising concept. Despite all the successes which Gorbachev achieved, such as bringing the Cold War to an end, democratic reforms across the Soviet Union and liberalising the country, economic failure still resonates in the mind of Russian citizens. As Alexei Makarikin, political analyst at the Centre for Political Technologies states in an article published on the World Security Network: “all hope was placed on him [Gorbachev], and all failures are being blamed on him.”</p>
<p>Speaking in his own defence, Gorbachev focuses on the political success of Perestroika believing, in hindsight, that these offered freedoms unlike ever before. He does however admit mistakes including the collapse of the Union, losing sight of the economy and causing the people of the Soviet Union to suffer because of the shortages of basic supplies. For Bowker, “Gorbachev would see the collapse of the Soviet Union as his biggest failure. He never wanted that to happen. It was his aim to build a social democratic union with a free market and high living standards. He failed to deliver this.”</p>
<p>Russia has since recovered from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disastrous 1990s. As one of the BRICS, it is now considered one of the most important emerging economies in the world and is fully integrated into the global political and economic system. Therefore, despite all the hardship Gorbachev believes that Perestroika was a success in the end because it “brought the country to a point from which there could be no return to the past.”</p>

Bright spots or black hole?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The euro crisis continues to fester. Nevertheless, those with an optimistic mindset can see some glimmers of hope. For instance, at the beginning of 2014 the Eurozone private sector registered seven successive months of expansion. On the other hand, French economic activity continues to contract and the Spanish jobless rate continues to soar. Italy, too, is ailing and the Greek economy has contracted by 25% compared with 2007. Overall, the Eurozone economy has shrunk by 3% over five years.</p>
<p>The key question facing the markets is, do bright spots signal better news ahead or do they gloss over a widening black hole that will eventually devour the economy?</p>
<h3 id=""quartet-of-challenges"">Quartet of challenges</h3>
<p>According to Loukas Tsoukalis, Professor of European Integration at the University of Athens and President of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP), Europe faces four challenges: growth; cohesion; governance; and legitimacy.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that growth is a problem. Two factors that act as a drag on growth are debt mountains and zombie banks. Axel Weber, Chairman of UBS and former President of the Bundesbank, recently said, “I expect some of the banks not to pass this (asset review) test.” The CEO of Total added, “I think Europe should be reclassified as an emerging country.”</p>
<p>The debts can be tackled in three ways: growth, inflation, and/or debt write-downs. As indicated, growth is anything but buoyant. Alleviating the debt burden through higher inflation is not really an option as Eurozone inflation is at an all time low. So what about the third method: writing off bad debts? This has been done to some degree, however, not sufficiently to allow economies to breathe a sigh of relief. In any case, this is almost a political taboo in the Eurozone ‘core’.</p>
<h3 id=""how-big-is-the-problem"">How big is the problem?</h3>
<p>Equally moribund is the cohesion that will be necessary if Europe is to overcome its problems. Take the widening gap between Europeans who benefit from globalisation (and Europeanisation) and those who feel left out. In the first group, we find well-educated professionals who are unafraid of open borders. The second group largely consists of the squeezed middle classes, who see jobs disappearing and who are unwilling or unable to leave hearth and home in search of new challenges abroad.</p>
<p>In a very different position are those with little or no education; people who can work all over the world – as cleaners or labourers for example – and who hope to find a better life in richer countries. While they avail themselves of the opportunities of a globalised world, they are mainly driven by despair. The abyss between these disparate groups is growing ever larger.</p>
<p>European member states are also growing apart. ‘Anger’ is a word that people use more and more when they express their feelings about Europe. A large majority of Europeans have lost all faith in the European Union (EU) and national politicians.</p>
<p>Another obstacle to defusing the crisis is the current lack of institutions, structures, and instruments needed for an effective approach. A banking union is needed and, over the longer term, a fiscal and political union. This requires robust organisations, which do not currently exist. At the moment, Europe relies on rickety constructions that are reactive instead of proactive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Anger’ is a word that people use more and more when they express their feelings about Europe. A large majority of Europeans have lost all faith in the European Union (EU) and national politicians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Combined with mutual distrust and a reluctance to change existing treaties, this has led to a perception of Europe as complex and obscure. The risk is that the EU could become an undemocratic institution with little focus or prestige – its constituent parts all wanting to go in different directions. As it attempts to avoid democratic interference and legal wrangling, Europe is becoming more complicated and less democratic.</p>
<h3 id=""negativity-surrounds-brussels"">Negativity surrounds Brussels</h3>
<p>The legitimacy crisis may well be Europe’s biggest headache. Many picture the EU as an undemocratic and bureaucratic ‘ogre’ that meddles in affairs that are not its business and does too little when it should take action.</p>
<p>Until a few years ago, a ‘permissive consensus’ existed. Citizens were willing to accept European integration, not so much because they thought that the project was worth pursuing in itself but because everyone seemed better off. Now it is no longer a matter of dividing up the spoils but of spreading the financial pain. This has shown up the weaknesses of the “permissive consensus” as a foundation for a united Europe. Presently, the EU no longer serves to bring countries closer together. Instead, it creates discord. The gap between winners and losers is growing.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the winners, eg the elite, have a much higher opinion of the EU. Every survey on the advantages of EU membership indicates that the elite takes a more positive view of this issue than the masses. Increasingly, extreme left-wing and right-wing parties appear to represent what the mainstream thinks. In such a climate, it is very difficult to strike a ‘grand bargain’ between the member states, with the aim of making the EU profitable for the men and women in the street and to reinforce Brussels’ legitimacy.</p>
<h3 id=""reform-not-forthcoming"">Reform not forthcoming</h3>
<p>Europe is nowhere close to achieving its lofty aims of sustainable growth, strong cohesion, sound governance, and broadly supported legitimacy. Promising data that pops up here and there is subsequently quashed with negative news. Northern and southern Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) states are still suspicious of each other. They do not see eye-to-eye on who will foot which bills. Governments can no longer boost their economies. Insiders fear the outcome of the asset reviews and stress tests at the banks. Meanwhile, populist parties seem headed for massive gains at the European elections.</p>
<p>In short, Europe has weakened in many respects compared with 2007, owing to economic pressures and political constraints. It has become more introverted, inequality is increasing and reforms are erratic.</p>
<p>Europe is unlikely to recover strongly in 2014. This would require many reforms at national and European level, which is not (yet) feasible, for political as well as social reasons. For the moment, Europe will have to make do with a patchwork of stopgaps, adjusted gradually, in incremental steps. Admittedly, this approach has kept the Eurozone afloat in recent years. Other positives are that a lot of political capital has been invested in the European project and that its underlying goal is to further peace. In addition, two other factors lead us to believe that Europe may manage to keep its head above water, via reforms on the back of new crises.</p>
<p>First, many Europeans are sceptical about Brussels but a large majority are even more fearful of the alternative – no euro or EU. Anxiety could be the glue that keeps Europe together. This is how political scientist Gary Marks sees the referendums of 2005 in the Netherlands and France on the European Constitution. At the time, voters could easily reject the Treaty because this did not have any direct negative implications; nothing really happened. Yet, should a referendum take place on the very survival of the euro or on EU membership, something tangible is at stake. Voting will no longer be non-committal, so fewer people will be prepared to take such high risks. Fear may well win the day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Europe is nowhere close to achieving its lofty aims of sustainable growth, strong cohesion, sound governance, and broadly supported legitimacy. Promising data that pops up here and there is subsequently quashed with negative news.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, a demographic trend could contribute to Europe’s long-term continued existence: young people are considerably more pro-European than their elders.</p>
<p>The biggest danger is that the European elite will not pay heed to the electorate and will simply push through reforms, then present them as a fait accompli to the public. If governments ignore voters instead of involving them, sooner or later the European project will run aground.</p>
<p>Most people know what is required to create a strong united Europe that flourishes economically. Famously, singers such as Peter Tosh, Loretta Lynn and Albert King also had an inkling: “Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.” Europe is unlikely to give up the ghost, but equally there will be a lot of water under the bridge before it implements the necessary reforms under pressure from the markets.</p>

Accelerating US growth will affect long-term interest rates worldwide,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There are reasons to believe that US growth will accelerate to 3.5% or higher in the coming quarters. Firstly, the fiscal drag that hampered the economy during much of 2013 is easing. In addition, signs are increasing that businesses are becoming more confident about the future; they may well be willing to employ more staff and increase investment. In recent years, consumer balance sheets have also improved markedly. This is boosting purchasing power and consumer confidence.</p>
<p>However, at the end of 2013, the Fed assumed that growth in the second half of 2013 would reach levels between 2% and 2.5% and that it would speed up to 2.8% throughout 2014. If so, US unemployment would be high for the foreseeable future and capacity utilisation in the business sector would be low.</p>
<p>This is why the Fed was determined not to put obstacles in the way of growth until the jobless rate had dropped to levels where pay increases soar and capacity utilisation does not create bottlenecks for production (that is when inflation hovers into view). The Fed believed this would not happen until 2016 although it was keenly aware of the growing risks attached to quantitative easing (QE).</p>

</figure>
<p>Moreover, the Fed itself has admitted – through its vice chairman William C. Dudley – that it does not really know what the impact of QE is on the economy. This is quite a predicament; seeing as the central bank has by now poured around $3,000 billion into the system. As widely publicised, the Fed announced it would start to taper in December 2013. In fact, this boils down to the start of monetary tightening.</p>
<p>The central bank is offsetting this move with the policy of forward guidance; it has ‘promised’ not to raise the short-term interest rate in the years to come. The central bank hoped that this would suffice to keep short rates – and also long rates – as low as possible until inflation risks appear on the horizon. However, as inflation is minimal, currently the Fed is more wary of deflation.</p>
<h3 id=""high-growth-queers-the-pitch"">High growth queers the pitch</h3>
<p>However, this approach is quickly being superseded. Once growth exceeds 3.5%, combined with short-term interest rates near zero and a ten-year yield around 3%, borrowing becomes very attractive. Under these conditions, an upward spiral of more lending and higher growth begins. If interest rates are low, this will stimulate credit supply, and so on. Such a ‘virtuous cycle’ will cause the money multiplier and money velocity to accelerate. If this happens, as the jobless rate and reserve capacity decline, before long, inflation risks would rise sharply.</p>
<h3 id=""too-little-too-late"">Too little, too late</h3>
<p>In theory, the Fed should be well able to control rising inflation. It only needs to remove the money from the system that it has created in the past years. Yet, this time such an operation will involve stupendous amounts of money. If we consider the enormous price rises (in the stock, bond and property markets) that have resulted from the recent liquidity creation of the past period, we dread to think what could happen if money is removed abruptly. There is a high chance that asset prices will plunge until – as in 2007 – a credit crisis erupts and a deep economic recession sets in.</p>

<p>In view of this risk, investors will fear that the Fed will do too little, too late. If so, they will price in rising inflation. We think this is the most pressing risk in 2014 once the US economy begins to grow faster than expected. Hypothetically, the Fed could respond by firmly keeping its foot on the gas (some economists believe that higher inflation is desirable as it would become easier to tackle the debt mountains).</p>
<p>Yet the result would be that first the bond market and later the other financial markets would go haywire as they discount swiftly rising inflation. This would be very dangerous to the economy. Interest rates would spiral out of control – an extremely unpleasant prospect when debts are sky high.</p>
<p>A likelier option is that the Fed will take its foot off the accelerator at a very early stage. It could even apply the monetary brakes. Hopefully, this will result in a gradual ‘brake path’ and limited price drops. Nonetheless, in this case too we could see a period of substantial market pullbacks.</p>
<h3 id=""inflation-expectations-the-driving-factor"">Inflation expectations the driving factor</h3>
<p>Of course, it is imperative that the Fed responds in a timely and proportional manner. If growth exceeds projections, the central bank will take its cues from the inflation expectations and financial market signals such as the difference between the nominal yields on ten-year US Treasury Bonds and ten-year TIPS. At the time of writing, the scope of this gap is around 2.25%-2.3%. As soon as it tops 2.5% – which could occur sooner rather than later and will probably go hand in hand with additional indications that inflation expectations are rising – the Fed will have to intervene. To clamp down on inflation expectations, it will need to tighten its policy until economic growth slows to 2%. Around this rate the risk of inflation will disappear.</p>
<h3 id=""outlook-for-long-term-interest-rates"">Outlook for long-term interest rates</h3>
<p>In the coming period, we expect bond yields to consolidate on weaker US data. We expect the yield on ten-year US Treasury Bonds to climb to 3.25% by the end of Q1 and at the end of Q2 to 3.5%. Subsequently, it could even reach levels near 4%. We suspect that the markets will too easily assume that the short-term interest rate will stay low for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the yields on many European ten-year government bonds will follow a similar pattern. Bond markets are a system of communicating vessels and a rise in US yields pushes up bond yields in many other markets outside the US.</p>
<p>For the yield on ten-year German government bonds we expect at the same time downward pressure as the ECB must consider further monetary easing as a result of slow growth and mounting debt in the weaker EMU-countries. Furthermore, we anticipate rising tensions in the EMU in the course of this year (see also our regular reports on European interest rates). All in all, the yield on ten-year German government bonds could climb to 2.25% and eventually to 2.5% later this year.</p>
<p>The Bank of England is already facing the same dilemma that we expect for the Fed later this year. The growth outlook for the British economy is being continually adjusted upward, in response to surprisingly good figures. The British growth outlook has now improved so far that virtually no-one believes in the Bank of England’s forward guidance any more. As British inflation is already fairly high, we expect upward pressure on the yield on ten-year British government bonds as well.</p>
<p>We should bear in mind, though, that there are negative aspects to the higher growth of the British economy. After all, growth is chiefly being generated by extra consumer spending based on more loans. In view of the already high debt positions of many of the British, this is not necessarily a good thing. Moreover, as UK growth remains dependent on growing debts, the upward pressure on British interest rates will soon start to affect growth to some extent. This is why we think ten-year British interest rates will not rise much further than 3.75% this year.</p>

Don’t fear the taper,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In early 2013, UK cable operator Virgin Media prepared an issue of two bonds in sterling and dollars for a total of £2.3 billion as part of its merger with Liberty Global. It was the biggest single bond sale of high yield debt since late 2010 and, thanks to strong investor appetite for high yielding assets, secured on extremely favourable terms.</p>
<p>“At the time we were facing some robust refinancing challenges given the scale of what we were doing,” says Rick Martin, Group Director, Treasury and Investor Relations. But with all that extra liquidity flooding into fixed-income capital markets as a result of accommodative monetary policies, the company not only obtained a lower rate of interest but also dramatically extended their maturities. “That is a very rare thing,” enthuses Martin. “It is not every day an issuer is able to take both coupon and tenor at the same time.”</p>
<p>Companies like Virgin Media benefited enormously as the Federal Reserve bought up US Treasuries in the years that followed the financial crisis. Investors who were put off by the rising price of the bonds that the Fed was purchasing – by QE3 at a rate of $85 billion a month – turned to other assets like corporate bonds, and this in turn helped to push down yields and made it cheaper for corporates to borrow. As spreads narrowed, issuance soared. By 2012, it had hit record levels. During that year, $5.4 trillion worth of bonds were issued worldwide – a 13.1% increase on the year before according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<h3 id=""stop-the-press"">Stop the press</h3>
<p>However, looking ahead to 2014, there is no certainty that corporates will continue to enjoy such advantageous borrowing conditions. Now, with the Federal Reserve considering exit strategies from accommodative monetary policies, corporates, and particularly those below investment-grade, such as Virgin Media, have begun to brace themselves for rising long-term borrowing costs in the years ahead.</p>

<p>“When Bernanke begins to hint at tapering the bond vigilantes begin to take over. Naturally, nobody wants to be last out of a burning room, so they all rush out at once.”</p>
<p><cite>Tom Byrne, Director of Fixed Income, Wealth Strategies and Management</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get an idea of what might happen in the bond markets when QE begins to be unwound we don’t have to look any further than the events of the past year. As talk of a taper intensified last summer US Treasury notes rose to 2.90%. It was their highest level for two years, and the rise had an immediate impact on US sales of investment grade corporate debt. By early June, Dialogic data shows weekly sales of investment-grade corporate debt had fallen to $4.1 billion, down from an average that year of $23.2 billion. High yield offers also dwindled. Until the middle of May, weekly issuance was averaging around the $8.8 billion mark. By the following month it had fallen to $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>“I think investors were lulled into a sense of security that the Fed wouldn’t let rates rise rapidly in their faces,” says Tom Byrne, Director of Fixed Income at Wealth Strategies and Management and author of capital markets newsletter BondSquad. “But when Bernanke begins to hint at tapering the bond vigilantes begin to take over. Naturally, nobody wants to be last out of a burning room, so they all rush out at once.”</p>
<p>But the panic which gripped markets proved short-lived. By mid-September the Fed, fearful perhaps of the turmoil that might ensue when tapering eventually began, backed away from the guidance it had given earlier in the year. Citing continued uncertainty surrounding the strength of the US economic recovery, Ben Bernanke, the bank’s outgoing chairman delivered a speech casting doubt on the likelihood of tapering beginning before the year’s end.</p>
<p>US Treasuries once again began to drop-off. Yield appetite didn’t quite return to its former levels, however. The lowest the ten-year note fell to during this period was 2.478%; still much higher than its level at the beginning of the year and a full 1% above the record low of 1.4% set in July 2012. For corporate issuers in fixed-income capital markets the implication is that investors don’t have to stretch so far for yield as they did before. For this reason, Byrne doesn’t think credit spreads have room to tighten on the upper-end of investment-grade credits (A+ to AAA) because they are already very tight. “I think that credit spreads will not tighten and could even widen in lower-rated high yield credits because investors will not have to reach down to that risky area of the market to find attractive yield,” he says. “The best performing area of the corporate bond market – relatively speaking – should be the BB and BBB areas.”</p>
<p>If such turmoil can result from the Fed merely broaching possibility of an end point to quantitative easing, corporates will surely be wondering what will result when tapering begins for real. A fall in treasury yields of any significance would, of course, affect the interest paid on fixed-income debt, including that issued by corporates. Byrne’s assessment is that the market has already built in a $10 billion, if not a $20 billion reduction in asset purchases. Since perception of the risks associated with a tapering is already reflected, to some degree, in asset prices now, it would seem an exaggeration to suggest bond markets will evaporate the moment tapering begins.</p>
<p>There appears to be an interesting dynamic at play here, however. In a normal economy, high yield debt tends to have a very low correlation with interest rates; this is a trend which is visible in almost every single economic cycle since the mid-twentieth century. But these are far from normal economic times. Ever since interest rates began to be artificially compressed through quantitative easing, rates have begun to correlate more closely. Byrne thinks this is a trend which will persist until the Fed has withdrawn completely from the market, with the asset classes – such as high yield – that enjoyed the most credit spread tightening during the QE years seeing the most closely related movements in relation to treasuries.</p>
<h3 id=""the-danger-for-the-brics"">The danger for the BRICs</h3>
<p>In emerging markets, companies might be forgiven for feeling a strong sense of trepidation as the end of QE approaches. These markets after all, have been one of the principle beneficiaries of the extra liquidity injected into the global economy over the past five years. This is because the liquidity the Fed created through asset purchases did not remain exclusively in the US, where interest rates and growth were close to zero. Instead, a good deal of it flooded into the emerging markets where the potential returns were much greater for investors. This surge in capital inflows pushed down on emerging market currencies – much to the ire of export focused nations such as Brazil – and, as in developed economies, triggered a rapid growth in dollar denominated debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every time we hear a rumour or a new forecast about what the Fed is going to do we see very high volatility.”</p>
<p><cite>Mikko Sopanen, Director of Treasury, Light-On Mobile</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any tightening of US monetary policy would, it follows, create some uncertainty around the outlook of capital flows to emerging market (EM) economies. “We had a taste of that over the summer,” says Colin Ellis, analyst at the ratings agency Moody’s. “In that world you would expect capital flows to partly reverse and that was exactly what we saw.” Of course, despite sharing some common characteristics EMs are not homogenous entities, and the extent to which corporates in a particular economy will be impacted when tapering begins will depend largely on the policy regime. “India is a good example,” says Ellis. If a company is operating in a country with a floating exchange rate regime, such as India, but borrows in foreign currency terms then clearly tapering will have material credit implications. “If I am an Indian company and I have borrowed in dollars then, clearly, that is going to be credit negative. But on the flip side, for a company in a fixed exchange rate regime that borrows in dollars its costs may not have moved much at all.”</p>
<p>As the events of last summer showed, corporates in those EMs with floating exchange rate regimes will be faced with heightened levels of currency risk. For Lite-On Mobile (LOM), a corporate that specialises in the design and manufacture of telecommunications products, increasing foreign exchange volatility has been the biggest concern since the prospect of tapering became apparent. Over the past year, the company’s Singapore and Taiwan-based treasury team has had its hands full managing the risk, which is quite substantial given the company’s presence in emerging economies such as India and Brazil, two economies which have exhibited a particularly high degree of sensitivity to rising US Treasury yields.</p>
<p>“Every time we hear a rumour or a new forecast about what the Fed is going to do we see very high volatility,” says Mikko Sopanen, Director of Treasury at LOM. Even day-to-day movements have, at times, been astonishing, he remarks. At the height of the FX volatility last summer, for instance, the Indian rupee or the Brazilian real both experienced swings in the 2-3% range.</p>
<p>Managing this volatility is helped by the fact that the company hedges 100% of its substantial foreign exchange exposure using a mixture of forward and options contracts. In India, these risk management activities are executed locally. It has always been quite costly, says Sopanen, but the expenditure has grown even more substantially over the past year because of the taper expectations.</p>
<p>Like most companies, LOM is also bracing itself for rising borrowing costs in the years ahead. Right now, the company’s main source of funding is a revolving credit facility provided by global and Taiwan-based banks in the Taiwan market, supplemented from time-to-time with term loans. Margins and interest rates in the Taiwan market have been exceptionally low for many years, even at the height of the credit crisis, but as Sopanen points out, that is likely to make the impact of an adjustment to US monetary policy all the more dramatic when it comes. “When you are so close to zero the only way is up,” he quips. Given that even a minor rise could double the company’s interest costs when starting from such a low base, the company has been quite active in the past year in hedging the risk with swaps and forwards.</p>
<p>But Sopanen does not expect credit to suddenly become prohibitively expensive overnight, and he adopts a philosophical tone when asked about the extent of his concern over the direction of that market. “We know that interest rates have been unnaturally low for some time now. It has been nice and we will continue to enjoy it while it lasts, but I think we will soon be getting back to 1-2%, at least.”</p>
<h3 id=""managing-the-change"">Managing the change</h3>
<p>Sopanen is probably right not to overstate the risks. From the very beginning in 2009, the purpose of QE was to restore the fragile US economy to full health following the trauma of the credit crisis. If the Fed does decide the time is right to begin unwinding asset purchases in the next year, then that would imply that the US economy is once again showing signs of life and the unemployment rate has fallen below the 6.5% target.</p>
<p>These developments would, as Moody’s Colin Ellis points out, be “strong credit positives” for a lot of corporates. Normal levels of risk appetite may well return, driving investors out of bonds and in to equities or other riskier assets. But then again, if corporates begin to see revenues starting to grow in the region of 5-6% a year that could well be an offsetting factor to the overall health of balance sheets; particularly when compared to the anaemic GDP growth that has been perhaps the defining characteristic of most western economies for the past five or six years. But the prospect of a strong and sustained recovery for the world’s biggest importer will clearly help more than just the US-based companies. It will also be hugely beneficial for businesses in other corners of the globe by providing a bigger consumer market for companies such as LOM to tap into and sell their goods. And although the prospect of rising borrowing costs may still be concerning for corporates, there is a relatively simple way for them to insulate themselves. The key to this, says Lloyd’s Head of Financial Risk Yuri Polyakov, is to start thinking more long term. His advice to corporates is to begin thinking about locking in cheap fixed interest rates now while market conditions remain favourable. “That is often one of the first questions I ask when I speak to clients about their funding plans,” he says. “If rates in the next three years are going to rise, then wouldn’t it be more prudent to pre-fund and issue some debt today?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The high yield issuers are naturally more leveraged companies, so their sensitivity to interest rate changes is much higher.”</p>
<p><cite>Yuri Polyakov, Head of Financial Risk, Lloyds</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would seem the logical thing to do but, surprisingly, he says that currently there are very few signs in the market of companies taking that approach. Polyakov offers several reasons for why this is the case. On the one hand, it might be that companies do not foresee debt becoming prohibitively expensive in the near future, regardless of when the Fed starts to taper. The other possible reason is that companies, realising monetary tightening will coincide with improving economic conditions, are hoping that their business will be doing better and therefore they will be able to afford more. Other companies are averse to negative carry associated with adding more funding before it is actually needed.</p>
<p>For moderately leveraged companies this might not be a problem. Even if the company has made the wrong judgement and debt costs do rise, the risk to the business is not likely to be critical, but it could prove to be a dangerous strategy for issuers of high yielding debt. The high yield issuers are naturally more leveraged companies, so their sensitivity to interest rate changes is much higher,” he says. These companies definitely need to start thinking about what the impact of the increased interest expense will be in the coming years. It is also imperative to make these calculations in the context of corporate strategy it is going to impact everything from the funding profile to cash flow. “This is why we advise our clients to do a quantitative exercise to understand what the impact of higher rates will be on the business, not just today, but two or three years out,” he says.</p>
<p>Virgin Media’s Rick Martin agrees. Although he thinks every corporation will be impacted somewhat differently, those who have planned ahead are the ones most likely to come out of the other side in good shape. “The more forward looking and proactive a corporate is with regards to managing debt, the better off it will be,” he says. “I think that our activities in the bond market over the past year with our new colleagues at Liberty Global are a hallmark of that.”</p>

Europe – happy but perhaps not such a prosperous new year,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>To start off with the leader in Europe, Angela Merkel will head a Grand Coalition in the coming years which consists of her conservative CDU/CSU (a ‘double act’) and the social-democratic SPD.</p>
<p>A broadly supported agreement is a good thing but it comes at a price. The parties have not so much picked over the bones of the accord as thrown a bone to the putative coalition partners. To placate the CDU, there will be no tax hikes while older mothers gain higher pension benefits for every child. The Bavarian CSU has pushed through a motorway toll for foreign cars and lorries. And the spoils for the SPD are a national minimum wage of €8.50 per hour.</p>
<p>The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, like many other media, was very critical of the agreement, which it described as “overcooked mush” that will be “easy for everyone to digest”.</p>
<p>There is a risk that, to please the electorate, the new government will backtrack on many of the reforms that the previous (SPD) Chancellor Schroeder implemented. For instance, the retirement age will be lowered to 63 (if people have paid pension contributions for 45 years). In addition, the job market threatens to become less flexible because temporary work will be subject to stricter regulations. This could damage Germany’s competitiveness and slow down economic growth.</p>
<p>In regard to the Eurozone, not much has changed: tough reforms and a prudent budget policy continue to be on the cards. Left-wing media were hoping that the SPD could force Ms Merkel to loosen the reins to some degree. At first glance, this does not appear to have happened.</p>
<p>It was slightly surprising that investors welcomed the ‘GroKo agreement’ with open arms. There is little new under the sun and the few changes that have been made do not bode well for the financial markets, it would seem. Among others, the service sector has not opened up and the pro-European stance is not convincing. Perhaps the markets were enthusiastic because they envisage that a broadly supported (and stable) coalition can be expected to rule Germany for four years. (Because the minimum wage will only become unconditional in 2017, there is a low chance that the SPD will leave the coalition early).</p>
<p>Of course it is positive that the most powerful Eurozone member state has announced four years of political stability and remains committed to Europe. But there is a danger that Germany will be too passive when it comes to streamlining its own economy or creatively addressing the still rampant euro crisis.</p>
<p>In Italy, Berlusconi has been thrown out of the Senate because of his fraud conviction. Various other cases are still before the court and the media mogul could end up in prison.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Italians, the papers, and experts are careful not to write off the 77 year old once and for all. Berlusconi’s party has split in half. One part continues to support the Letta government and supports the ministers that are in the cabinet. The other half consists of faithful Berlusconi followers and has relaunched under Berlusconi’s old party name Forza Italia. It can currently expect to gain 20% of the votes, almost the percentage that voted Berlusconi into office in 1994 when he became Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Berlusconi may be barred from public office but that does not mean he will step down as political leader. Beppe Grillo of the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), the party that came second in the most recent elections does not have a seat in parliament either. In any case, the former three-time Prime Minister will not hesitate to trip up the government to serve his personal interests.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Prime Minister Letta will sleep a little easier than before. That Berlusconi’s PDL is in disarray means his cabinet has become less vulnerable. Yet, even without a government crisis Italy is struggling economically. Berlusconi is symptomatic of a rotten political climate. As Barbara Spinelli wrote: “Berlusconism is still here. And it will be not easy to wean ourselves off this drug that has fascinated not only politicians and parties, but the entire society….More fundamentally, though, it is his (Berlusconi’s) cultural and political heritage – his ways of thinking, acting, the ‘disease of the century’ – that will persist. Without a profound look deep into our conscience, this legacy will continue to intoxicate Italy.”</p>

<p>Spinelli’s analysis is tough, razor-sharp and scathing. At the time of the Costa Concordia disaster in January 2012, Italy experienced a bout of self-castigation. The coastguard who tried to order Commander Schettino back on board was seen as a hero whereas the Costa captain stood for everything that was wrong with Italy. In politics, not enough has changed in the two years since then; even if expelling Berlusconi is a big step. Perhaps it would not be realistic to expect Italy to make a clean sweep in the space of a couple of years. The recent economic data is a case in point. The jobless rate is 12.5%. Youth unemployment is at the record level of 42% and rising. The misery will continue as Italian politicians dominate the news for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>The pedestrian German coalition agreement and the struggling Italian republic are but two factors that could whip up tensions in the Eurozone. Other (larger) trends are cause for grave concern. Across Europe many politicians are making populist, isolationist, and protectionist statements or presenting proposals to pander to these sentiments. Some seem to display racist tendencies; for example in France, Italy, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The economic foundations under the European integration project – freedom of movement for goods and services, capital and individuals – seem to be crumbling. Some areas were never that “free” in the first place (Germany, which is supposedly exemplary, jealously guards some segments of its services sector). Now there will be even more pressure on the common market.</p>
<p>Europe’s shortcomings when dealing with the outside world are increasingly evident. The EU is losing clout because it appears divided, inactive and weak. More than ever before, the economic/political crisis causes the Eurozone states to look inward and become suspicious of each other. This has been a contributing factor in the case of the Ukraine that seemed to be slipping out of Europe’s grasp. Through economic blackmail and political pressure, Russian president Putin persuaded the Ukrainian president Yanukovich to strengthen ties with Moscow and turn his back on Europe just when the Ukraine was about to sign an Association Agreement with the EU. In its divided state, Europe was not strong enough to take forceful action.</p>

<p>The chain of events shows that Germany is not all-powerful. Ironically, it was the first time that Germany went out on a limb to champion an EU policy in eastern Europe that was guaranteed to irritate Russia. Whereas Merkel usually gets her way, this time she – and with her the entire EU – came off worst.</p>
<p>A fragmented Europe also means that environmental concerns are being overruled. For instance, the EU limits on CO2 emissions were weakened considerably after intensive lobbying by large manufacturers in Germany. Likewise, one-sided and narrowly defined national interests are hampering progress towards a banking union – a difficult process in any case.</p>
<p>In short, the EU faces major problems at national and European level. This makes it harder to tackle the political and economic crisis. Without a doubt, more of these issues will come to light with further attempts to form a banking union, stress tests on the Eurozone’s largest banks and the looming European elections.</p>

Europe: a safe haven for investors?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Lately, various economists and analysts have suggested that Europe is – or will become – a safe haven for investors. This is most probably premature: the Eurozone is still on shaky ground. Over the coming quarters, the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) countries will have to navigate dangerous quagmires and patches of quicksand.</p>
<p>Along the way, these countries face many dangers that could throttle the fragile recovery in one fell swoop, for example, mainstream politicians who are afraid of reforms, anti-European populists, obstructive judiciary, central banks saddled with impossible tasks, floundering financial sectors, and conflicts between national and international interests. And all these issues are compounded through combination and overlap with the other issues.</p>
<h3 id=""the-political-landscape"">The political landscape</h3>
<p>Beginning with politics, it is clear that populist parties are on the rise and on the march. They make promises that appeal to voters who are disenchanted with the incumbent political elite. There is no denying the pull of populism. All the more so as knee-jerk reactions, such as resentment against immigrants and an aversion to Brussels, often go hand-in-hand with progressive goals, such as the protection of pensions and generous social welfare systems.</p>

<p>Many analysts and mainstream politicians fear that the populist movements will stand a good chance at the upcoming elections to the European Parliament. For example, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) did not make the threshold (5%) during the recent national elections in Germany, but for the European elections the threshold has been lowered to 3%. Other small, populist, and anti-euro parties could also be voted in, while the larger parties (Front National, PVV) will probably sail through.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1<sup>st</sup> December 2009, has increased the power of the European Parliament and many Eurozone decisions and regulations require its approval. This means that following the May elections, the populists could be in a position to scupper any concerted effort to tackle the euro crisis.</p>
<h3 id=""the-courts-of-justice"">The courts of justice</h3>
<p>The judiciary also plays a part in encouraging a piecemeal approach to the euro crisis, particularly in Germany and Portugal.</p>
<p>The German Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe has clamped down on several attempts by the German government to give up sovereignty in favour of European institutions. For example, German judges have reviewed and imposed restrictions on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – aka the Eurozone bailout fund – and on the Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) programme of the European Central Bank (ECB). In the past year, Portugal’s Constitutional Court has struck down various austerity measures, which is hampering the government’s attempts to lower its budget deficit.</p>
<p>This won’t be the last time that national judges rule on European initiatives that are intended to defuse the economic and political crisis. Each time, investors will have to nervously wait and see – especially when it involves the Karlsruhe court – if the judiciary will put obstacles in the way of further fiscal, economic, and political integration. So far, this interference has not been disastrous but who knows what the future will bring as more powers are transferred from the national to the EU level.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, central banks (including the ECB) seem to have become political ‘megapowers’ and the dominant drivers of the financial markets. To date they have managed to prevent a total collapse of the global economy through ultra-loose monetary policy and unconventional instruments such as quantitative easing (QE).</p>

<p>In 2012, ECB President Mario Draghi calmed the markets – and staved off chaos in the Eurozone – by stating that the ECB was fully committed to the euro. However, in reality Draghi – plus Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in the US and Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda – can do little but buy the politicians time to address the structural problems that stymie sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>At the same time, the politicians and the markets seem to expect miracles from central bankers, who are supposed to contain inflation, avert deflation, guarantee the stability of the financial system, and promote growth. Everyone knows that, sooner rather than later, central banks will have to taper their asset purchases. That will not be easy.</p>
<p>Last summer, Bernanke only had to hint at a more neutral monetary policy to trigger market unrest around the world, particularly in the emerging economies. Apparently, both politicians and investors have become so addicted to the monetary ‘drugs’ supplied by the ‘dealers’ behind the increased money supply that nobody can think of a roadmap that would allow the ECB, the Fed and the other central banks to retreat into the shadows as politicians take over the helm.</p>
<p>One reason is that many banks are still reeling from the after effects of the 2007 crisis. In some respects, the banks have grown more vulnerable compared to a few years ago. The Italian and Spanish banks have gorged on domestic government bonds. Across the Eurozone, the percentage of government securities on the bank balance sheets has increased from 4.0% (five years ago) to 5.4% at the time of writing.</p>
<p>In Italy and Spain, 10% and 9% of bank assets respectively consists of government debt. This increases the dangerous interconnection between the governments and the banks. On top of this, many banks are sitting on bad debts. According to a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, Italian and Spanish banks could face €230 billion of losses on credit to businesses in the coming two years.</p>
<h3 id=""waning-appetite-for-a-european-banking-union"">Waning appetite for a European banking union?</h3>
<p>All the problems that plague the Eurozone – ever more popular populist parties, dissatisfied voters, legal impediments, an overly dominant ECB, and faltering banking systems – seem to converge in the debates about the banking union. Not so long ago, it appeared that everyone who was someone in European politics agreed that the only way to solve the euro crisis was monetary, banking, fiscal, economic and political integration.</p>
<p>The banking union was seen as a first essential step. On the agenda for next spring are stress tests and an Asset Quality Review (AQR) for European banks. At the end of 2014, the ECB should be regulating the 130 largest banks. However, the EMU states are already at loggerheads about this proposal, especially now the markets are no longer driving up interest rates to unsustainable levels and the pressure on the politicians has eased.</p>
<p>The fading appetite for the banking union is not an isolated development. Euro scepticism is on the rise across the Eurozone. People want to ‘claw back power’ from Brussels. In this respect, the UK goes farthest, with a referendum about EU membership re-emerging constantly. Even founding members and driving force of the EC, the Netherlands, has issued a report stating that Brussels should do less and national governments should do more.</p>
<p>The Eurozone faces challenging quarters and the euro is unlikely to stay at its current level. Or if it does, the Eurozone will again come under pressure from – or be mocked by – the markets. The political stability premium that has been calculated into the exchange rate of the euro of late (partly because of the US budget battle and the restive emerging markets) will likely slowly disappear. Plus, in a climate of rising Eurozone tensions, the politicians will put pressure on the ECB to ease its policy. This, too, will have a downward effect on the euro.</p>

Is Citi right or wrong about Asia’s economic growth potential?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The rate at which the US is recovering from recession is the slowest since World War II. Meanwhile, the Eurozone and the UK have not yet recovered the economic losses of the past years; the Eurozone is creeping out of recession at a snail’s pace. In Latin America, growth has slowed. In addition, whereas some African economies are growing fast, in economic terms the continent is far too small to lead the way for the global economy.</p>
<p>Theoretically, Asia could act as an economic catalyst. Its population represents 27% of the total world economy. To quote Stephen Bird, CEO for Citi in Asia Pacific: “By the middle of this century we expect Asia to account for close to half of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). By 2030, we are forecasting China and India to be the largest and third-largest economies in the world.”</p>
<p>Citi’s Bird bases his optimistic view on the economic fundamentals. Investors are also looking at the political situation in the region, and the individual countries, and are less sanguine in their outlook.</p>
<h3 id=""explosive-region"">Explosive region</h3>
<p>Thirty years ago, China’s economy was smaller than the economy of the Netherlands. Now it is the second-largest economy on the planet, behind the US. Japan occupies the third place.</p>
<p>As Kevin Rudd – the former Prime Minister of Australia – wrote in Foreign Affairs: “History teaches that where economic power goes, political and strategic power usually follows.” Increasingly, China is positioning itself as a superpower; ‘great power politics’ is the order of the day in Asia. Political (and often economic) developments are strongly influenced by a raft of sub-regional conflicts and contentious issues.</p>
<p>Asian states are not only worried by China. Many have unresolved issues with Japan that are rooted in recent history. Some believe Prime Minister Shinzō Abe to be jingoist and are afraid that he will rewrite Japan’s pacifist constitution, under which the country is only allowed defensive military capabilities.</p>
<p>With an ever more assertive China, nerves in Japan, the strategic involvement of the US, and a raft of smaller countries that need to protect their interests in this geopolitical cauldron – it is clear that stability is not guaranteed.</p>
<h3 id=""chinese-japanese-enmity"">Chinese-Japanese enmity</h3>
<p>First, what do its neighbours think of Beijing’s attitude? Nine out of ten Japanese and Koreans take a negative view of the ascent of China, and so do more than 70% of Australians and two-thirds of Filipinos.</p>
<p>In recent years Beijing has appeared more willing to enter into confrontation. Its military spending increases year-on-year – by more than 10% in 2013 – and the Chinese are busy constructing their first indigenous aircraft carrier. On hearing the news, many regional leaders may have felt shivers running down their spines. Particularly in Japan, even if Tokyo is also making waves with a new military vessel – its largest since World War II. Ominously, it is named after a Japanese cruiser that was used during the invasion of China in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many news articles about tensions over the disputed Diaoyu aka Senkaku islands. At the same time, large-scale protests erupted in China and Japan. Chinese rulers started to refer to the islands as “China’s core interest”, thereby placing them in the same category as Taiwan and Tibet.</p>
<p>The political fallout was just the half of it. Chinese riots and protests caused $120m worth of damage to Japanese companies in China, and Japanese auto exports to China dropped by approximately 40-50% as a result of a boycott.</p>
<h3 id=""will-they-or-wont-they"">Will they or won’t they?</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, surveys show more than 90% of the Chinese dislike Japan, while 90% of Japanese respondents have an unfavourable impression of China. The thorniest issues are territorial conflicts and unhealed World War II wounds.</p>
<p>Some experts think military budgets of both Japan and China give cause for concern. In the past 23 years, China’s (official) defence budget has increased thirty-fold, while Japan’s military spending has risen for the first time in 11 years. The billion-dollar question is whether there is a real chance that the two countries will lock horns.</p>
<p>The high degree of Chinese-Japanese economic interdependence suggests a large-scale trade war is improbable, while many experts contend that real armed conflict is very unlikely. Not least because the global economy is linked to the Chinese and Japanese economies in myriad ways. This was evident, for example, when Apple suffered product shortages in the aftermath of Japan’s triple disaster in 2011. These days, numerous production chains are global and a country like the US has every reason to go out of its way to prevent escalating Sino-Japanese tensions.</p>
<h3 id=""domestic-preventive-factors"">Domestic preventive factors</h3>
<p>Other factors also indicate that an outright (trade) war between Japan and China does not loom large. China has so many internal problems such as pollution, corruption, protests, inequality and food security that it can do without squabbles with its neighbours. Before it can afford to take a more assertive stance on the global stage, China needs to tackle some of these obstacles, which are impeding political, economic and social progress.</p>
<p>Japan, too, struggles with various domestic issues: excessively high farming subsidies and an overly powerful agriculture lobby; overregulation; a low participation of women in the economic process; an immigration policy that needs to be reformed; rigid job markets. Prime Minister Abe must know that Japan’s geopolitical standing will deteriorate unless it enacts structural reforms.</p>
<p>Also relevant is that Japan is not automatically inclined to impose its ideology on the world, unlike many Western countries, including the US with its Manifest Destiny in the 19<sup>th</sup> century or the attempts to export democracy under George W. Bush. Mostly, Japan has been exclusively interested in its own survival.</p>
<h3 id=""irrational-war-could-still-happen"">Irrational war could still happen</h3>
<p>Counter to these arguments – which suggest that geopolitical fireworks are unlikely – other developments could give investors pause for thought. Research into wars that occurred during the past few centuries shows that many wars break out for emotive reasons. Often, economic standing was the dominant motive; revenge frequently played a part.</p>
<p>World War I, a major disaster, showed that nationalist sentiments can be stronger than economic self-interest and rational financial arguments, a matter of heart over mind, even in the highest political circles.</p>
<p>In addition, nations regularly underestimate the costs of war. The Americans, for example, were too optimistic about the efforts and funds needed to win the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and the second Gulf War in Iraq. Should Japan or China too fail to look realistically at the outcome of a potential armed conflict, they will more easily engage in war.</p>
<p>Equally, China could misread the US security commitment to Japan. Richard K. Betts of the Council on Foreign Relations says that the US sends ambiguous signals to Beijing. It is unclear whether the US sees China as a “threat to be contained or power to be accommodated. US policy amounts to a yellow light. Yellow lights, however, tempt some drivers to speed up.”</p>
<p>Misunderstandings, miscalculations, insecurity, jingoism, and populism can combine into a dangerous cocktail, causing escalations that nobody actually wants and that make little economic sense.</p>
<h3 id=""will-asia-deviate-from-the-historical-norm"">Will Asia deviate from the historical norm?</h3>
<p>Antagonism between Japan and China is but one of the possible geopolitical dangers in the Far East. Tensions are rife between North and South Korea, and also between Cambodia and Thailand. In these cases too, a level-headed economic analysis would conclude there is no risk of escalation. Yet, smooth relationships are never a given in a shifting political landscape. To quote Prime Minister Rudd again: “History teaches that the rise of new great powers often triggers major global conflict.”</p>
<p>Stability is precarious. Little wonder that the Asian markets have disappointed Citi’s CEO Bird and many others. China and Japan are not expected to unleash tanks, warplanes, and cannons in the immediate future. However, constant geopolitical tension may well distract politicians to such an extent that they fail to implement domestic economic reforms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the existing cross-border suspicions, rampant insecurity and raw nerves are not conducive to economic partnerships and integration. On top of this, there are plenty of economic factors that can fuel tensions in the region.</p>
<p>One example is yen weakness. A substantial depreciation of the Japanese currency was an important element of the Asia crisis at the end of the 1990s. In recent quarters, policymakers in the countries neighbouring Japan may well have watched with growing unease as the yen continued to fall.</p>
<p>As ever the region provides many challenges and it will be interesting to see if Bird’s predictions are right.</p>

Key trends in cash and trade,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Interesting times lay ahead for the transaction services industry and providers have to deliver on many fronts. Without doubt, the quality of the relationship and the insight provided by banks around the converging themes of cash and trade continue to offer a vital lifeline for corporates the world over. Anand Pande, Global Head of Trade, and Steve Everett, Global Head of Cash Management, discuss the depth and breadth of transaction services capabilities at RBS.</p>

<h4 class=""fn"">Anand Pande</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Global Head of Trade</h5>
<img alt=""RBS"" class=""logo org"" height=""19"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/rbs-logo-2012-70x19.png"" width=""70""/>
<p>As the Global Head of Trade, Anand Pande is responsible for driving the development and growth of RBS’s trade finance business globally. This covers all products from traditional trade services and finance to commodity and supply chain financing solutions across more than 35 countries. Pande was recently honoured by the Asset Asian Awards 2013 as the Trade Finance Banker of the Year.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Steve Everett</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Global Head of Cash Management</h5>
<img alt=""RBS"" class=""logo org"" height=""19"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/rbs-logo-2012-70x19.png"" width=""70""/>
<p>As the Global Head of Cash Management, Steve Everett is responsible for developing and promoting RBS’s market-leading, innovative cash management solutions with product specialists across the world. Previously he was Global Head of I-LIM and FX, responsible for delivering the overall Liquidity and FX proposition for the transaction bank.</p>

<p>Regulatory changes and a low-yield environment are just two of the major factors that continue to affect transaction banking in both the cash and trade functions.</p>
<p>From a cash perspective, Steve Everett, RBS’s Global Head of Cash Management, notes that many corporates are long on liquidity and must find ways to safely look after their cash – a topic which has been at the forefront of the agenda throughout the financial crisis – and manage counterparty risk and exposure to financial institutions. He states that “in almost all markets, interest rates have decreased over the last five years – none more so than in euro, dollar and sterling, which are the principal currencies in which our clients hold liquidity.”</p>
<p>This has left many corporates severely challenged in terms of looking for yield but, notes Everett, “few treasurers will trade safety for yield. This is where the large global transaction banks, such as RBS, can help.” With a well-developed product suite, RBS enables treasurers to have access to liquidity as and when they need it in the event of counterparty challenges, whilst benefitting from an improved yield, when they don’t.</p>
<h3 id=""regulation"">Regulation</h3>
<p>Globally, banks are continuing to face increased regulatory pressure. “We’re seeing new regulation from the US, Europe and the UK, as well as from some of the Asian markets,” says Everett. This regulatory influx, he observes, is shaping how banks work with their corporate clients, particularly in terms of helping them to understand precisely what that regulation means to them.</p>
<p>On the global stage, the impact of regulation on banks is clear, but there is a knock-on effect for clients. With Basel III, for example, the liquidity constraints that regulators are placing onto banks may change the dynamic of the deposits a bank can afford to take. “There are some unintended consequences,” admits Everett.</p>
<p>The Single European Payments Area (SEPA) is also front of mind. “We have a large client base that is either based in Europe or doing business in Europe. They all need to ensure that by 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 they are compliant with the regulation,” adds Everett. This is clearly absorbing a lot of corporate time and effort.</p>
<h3 id=""local-knowledge"">Local knowledge</h3>
<p>As many corporates operate in the global arena, they are increasingly looking for banking partners with not only a global perspective, but also local and regional knowledge. Everett observes that, certainly on the cash and liquidity side, many businesses have stepped away from one global partner that does everything. Now, Everett notes, many seek regional expertise and are prepared to use several banks to get it.</p>
<p>“And this is where the strength of RBS can benefit clients; our presence in 37 countries is critical. You cannot get that local knowledge without having people on the ground who understand what is happening in a particular country or hub, whether in South-East Asia, Central and Eastern Europe or the Middle East. Maintaining that local presence is something we are committed to.”</p>
<h3 id=""cash-support-and-sepa"">Cash support and SEPA</h3>
<p>Is the pressure on the modern treasurer too much to bear? “I think they’ve come through all of the uncertainty of the financial crisis in terms of understanding their cash position,” asserts Everett. However, he warns that treasurers should never lose sight of this and “one should never get too comfortable; the last thing you want is to get into new trapped cash scenarios, as market dynamics change.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Everett believes that “visibility of cash remains king.” Corporates are generally sitting on a lot of liquidity, but they need to know where it is, so that they can direct it to safe havens, if needs be. “And that’s where our liquidity management solutions come in to play and why we have extended our pooling, sweeping and investment products into Asia over the last 12 to 18 months,” he explains. Unless they have specific trapped cash issues, RBS’s corporate clients based in the US, Asia or Europe can “pretty much manage to get cash into the right location on a daily basis and that, first and foremost, ensures its preservation.”</p>
<h3 id=""rbs-sepa-accelerator"">RBS SEPA Accelerator</h3>
<p>However, one potential source of concern is the number of corporates still struggling to meet the SEPA deadline. RBS, as a major mover of euros, has developed a solution – the award-winning<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> SEPA Accelerator. With SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs), the payment must be formatted using the ISO 200022 XML format. “A number of corporates still need to change the way that their payment instructions leave their ERP systems, to enable them to get into the clearing systems,” notes Everett. “Success is all about knowing detail such as the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) and International Bank Account Number (IBAN) of the ultimate beneficiary; for a large corporate this can be a huge undertaking but this new solution can do the work for them.”</p>
<p>For SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs), there is a change in the way that mandates are managed and the type of information that the client needs to hold. SEPA Accelerator offers an enrichment service of the legacy mandate and mandate management that ensures everything is compliant, so clients can continue to collect funds in the usual way. This gives them certainty around their cash management and cash flow forecasting. “It’s very much a backstop solution for clients that are not ready to be fully SEPA compliant.”</p>
<p>Through the creation of a new SEPA microsite, RBS has been able to share insight with corporates, that helps them to understand the implications of SEPA, what they need to do and importantly, says Everett, “what RBS can do on their behalf or in partnership with them.”</p>
<h3 id=""globalxchange"">GlobalXChange™</h3>
<p>GlobalXChange™ is an RBS umbrella brand for a number of products that feature a foreign exchange (FX) conversion path. It enables clients to have greater transparency around FX rates that are being applied to their transactions, whilst improving operational efficiency. “Five years ago, the key focus was on managing cash across multiple accounts and how to bring those balances together to leverage that liquidity,” states Everett. “Today, corporates don’t want to have multiple accounts spread across a wide network, because it’s operationally inefficient and results in numerous auditing and accounting challenges.”</p>
<p>Increasingly, he sees treasurers using one account to make multiple payments in multiple currencies. RBS can extend the reach of the high and low value payments that they can make, in up to 140 currencies for corporates and FIs – via one account, in the client’s base currency. Clients can send RBS a batch of payments and the bank will translate them, manage the FX risk and send them out through a single account, without the client having to open up a currency account in each location where it wants to pay a beneficiary.</p>
<h3 id=""trade-finance-trends"">Trade finance trends</h3>
<p>“I think everyone is trying to keep their heads above water,” comments Anand Pande, RBS’s Global Head of Trade. For Pande, the current environment presents quite a different world, where a bank has to look at conflicting objectives, while ensuring it continues to be relevant to its clients. The ideal paradigm is one where businesses can simultaneously increase revenues, reduce costs and optimise capital. But delivering this in a world which is slowing down is a tall order. Indeed, recent global trade figures indicate growth of just 2%, whereas two years ago it was more like 10%. “Clearly there is a big slowdown,” states Pande. The emerging market sector was supposed to be the saviour but even this has been unsettled, as we have seen with recent events. And on top of this, there is the risk to the financial health of overleveraged organisations in an environment where growth is slowing down and margins are compressed. Hence, the profitability of these organisations is under increasing pressure.”</p>
<p>Pande believes that RBS’s dominance in supply chain financing (SCF) “is a key strength” for clients seeking this paradigm. Whilst SCF has “still not reached maturity level”, it is developing in the right direction: RBS’s own SCF book has grown by 42% in recent years. “The traditional attraction,” he says, “is access to cheaper funding options for suppliers, backed by the stronger credit standing of the buyer.” Depending upon the liquidity options required by the buyers, they can also consider extended payment terms from their banks, while ensuring timely payments are made to their suppliers. But the concept is evolving and newer models are being considered where, for example, the discount level is based on the timing of the payment, and also on the alignment of electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) with SCF, helping to streamline the process.</p>
<p>Part of the solution lies in giving customers a choice in terms of how they transact with the bank. Presented with the option of proprietary bank software, SWIFT or third-party systems, clients can choose the most optimal solution for them to gain increased back office efficiencies. Says Pande, “RBS is one of a small number of banks which has an open highway, in terms of connectivity.”</p>
<p>The trade function is no stranger to regulation either. States Pande, “This is where we can play a key advisory role, because everyone is now searching for growth from new markets.</p>
<p>New trade corridors means ensuring growth occurs with adequate advice on risk mitigation tools, as well as with proper regulatory conformance. This is an area where leveraging the scale of the RBS network can be extremely beneficial to our customers.”</p>
<h3 id=""trade-concerns"">Trade concerns</h3>
<p>“One of the main issues for treasurers on the trade side is how to achieve an optimum balance between growth, liquidity and leverage,” says Pande. In achieving this balance, the RBS network plays an important role in helping clients understand local markets. The bank also helps clients with their cross-border growth aspirations, by acting for OECD domiciled corporations as the trade bridge into and out of Asia. “RBS provides a range of tools to help corporate expansion plans, both pre and post acquisition, and works closely with the extended business thereafter, through its local country network”.</p>
<p>RBS draws upon the skill set of its trade asset management and distribution team to help manage risk, so that the bank can give clients more balance sheet and hence become more relevant to them. At the same time, the bank distributes and sells down exposures to investors “who want to have access to high quality trade assets.”</p>
<p>“People often think of trade as simply intermediating cross-border flows, but trade is not only about import/export; it is also about the domestic market. Indeed, more than 50% of the GDP of most significant trade nations is domestic,” Pande says. “Having people on the ground who understand the local market, and can offer solutions to help companies grow and expand their business domestically, becomes an important differentiator.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-effects-of-basel-iii-on-trade"">The effects of Basel III on trade</h3>
<p>“With the current state of play, more capital is now required for the same amount of trade,” notes Pande. “If margins are going south, then clearly trade is going to suffer.” He feels banks have to collectively impress upon the regulators that trade business comprises of short term self liquidating transactions and hence has to receive the right capital treatment. In this respect, some progress has been made.</p>
<p>But banks also have to work with corporates to remove under-used credit lines. Says Pande, “If your credit lines are not utilised there is still a cost in terms of capital; we need to optimise credit lines and get rid of the excess.” The requirements of Basel III will make the world a better place, but it is also vital to achieve the right treatment for trade, otherwise I think the trade finance business is going to be under tremendous stress”.</p>
<h3 id=""forging-the-bpo"">Forging the BPO</h3>
<p>“For some, the Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) is a development that uniquely offers risk mitigation in the otherwise trust-based open accounts space,” explains Pande. “BPO will thus help energise global trade.” RBS, as one of the four banks which helped draft the Uniform Rules for Bank Payment Obligation (URBPO), is committed to the concept. However, Pande believes that BPO has a long way to go before it becomes scalable, as it cannot be a push from the banks, but needs to be a pull from the corporates.</p>
<p>For this to happen, banks will have to invest time in educating corporates – “and then there are practical considerations,” notes Pande. BPO involves the electronic matching of data. Banks should be able to receive data electronically from the corporates and convert it, to enable straight through processing (STP). A plug-and-play format between corporates and banks to send and receive data will help in increasing adoption rates.</p>
<p>Corporates also deal with large and small banks – often across multiple geographies. “There is a need to on board the small banks,” Pande says, “but the cost of implementation for them may not be palatable. I don’t see that happening soon, it’s a medium-term option,” he suggests. “However, if we get these things right, then BPO is going to be a huge success story.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-rise-of-rmb"">The rise of RMB</h3>
<p>“With the progressive internationalisation of renminbi (RMB) in terms of trade settlement, there are certain areas where the currency is gaining much traction, says Pande. “If you look at Hong Kong and China, the settlement in RMB between these markets is dominant. The RMB at the moment has climbed from being ranked 20<sup>th</sup> as an international currency at the end of 2011, to 11 in 2013. The growth in RMB settlements has been fast and accounts for 15% of the China trade. These trends are positive and in time, we would expect to see RMB continuing its journey, to become one of the major trade settlement currencies.”</p>
<p>RBS is investing in its product set around this industry development and in terms of the offshore RMB, the bank is now opening up accounts in Western Europe, explains Everett. The bank is looking to include these accounts in cash concentration liquidity pooling solutions and is also working with other industry players to look at how the UK can establish itself as an offshore clearing hub in a similar way to Hong Kong. “As an international bank, we are aiming to be a leader in this field, particularly in Western Europe, as corporates become more aware of the opportunities around RMB.”</p>
<h3 id=""maximising-corporate-growth-potential-in-asia"">Maximising corporate growth potential in Asia</h3>
<p>Intra-Asia trade accounts for around 60% of all Asian trade flows for which RBS has local currency products. But as additional new trade corridors open up, including those to Latin America and Africa, it is predicted that eight of the top 20 trade partnerships will be ex-Asia. At an estimated value of around $2 trillion by the end of 2030, this will drive the shift in emphasis from West to East. “With excess liquidity within Asian corporates, we are seeing an increase in acquisitive trends, notably with Chinese, Indian, Thai and Indonesian companies – and banks have to facilitate that,” notes Pande, adding that “companies will face a big problem in the future, if they exclude Asia from today’s planning.”</p>
<h3 id=""cash-and-trade-as-one"">Cash and trade as one</h3>
<p>Intuitively, observes Everett, “trade and cash have to come together at some point because companies need to maximise the use and forecasting of their cash” – and a key focus will be around SCF and FX. To this end, RBS is moving to position both elements as a joined-up proposition. He sees niche opportunities opening up already. In the US for example, by using an Earnings Credit Rate product, if a client is willing to place deposits with RBS, the bank can use the nominal interest that it would pay on that to offset some of the client’s banking fees; often these are trade-related. “That can give the client a good offset between revenue and cost in its financial performance”.</p>
<p>The benefits of bringing trade and cash together across multiple localities is abundantly clear. But, says Everett, “if you are going to do it, and do it well, you need to be on the ground; that’s where the RBS network is leading the way”. Many banks talk about partnering but, he states, “nothing beats actually having a physical presence – in terms of the people, buildings and technology, which underpins the ability to link directly into the local market”.</p>
<p>In the end, for Pande, it boils down to “the real old fashioned approach of thinking about how we can make the life of the customer simpler”. And that, he says, is where RBS excels. “A bank may claim the best technology and the best products, but it is equally important to have that softer people side and the ability to form partnerships.”</p>

No free lunches,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In this day and age, it pays to remember Milton Friedman’s famous adage: “There is no such thing as a free lunch”. What he meant, among other things, was that a central bank cannot print money (to boost the economy) with impunity. This figures – creating a wealthy society simply by cranking up the printing presses would be too easy, with Zimbabwe being a case in point.</p>
<p>What Friedman was really saying was that too much money creation eventually leads to inflation, which makes people poorer. This, in particular, is the price that has to be paid.</p>
<p>So why would a central bank pursue such a policy? After all, there is every chance that the drawbacks of liquidity creation will eclipse the benefits in the long run. The problem is that initially, the effects are benign. In almost every situation growth picks up, whereas inflation is nowhere in sight and only starts to bite at a later stage. As a result, politicians are often tempted to head in this direction. They are also encouraged to do so because they have a perfect excuse: the policy provides temporary relief in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>With this in mind, one could wonder what most central banks thought they were doing in the past.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, for example, has quadrupled its balance sheet in just a few years. Equally, the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) have created a lot of money, as well as the Bank of Japan (BoJ).</p>

<p>Regardless of their motives, the main question now is what will the fallout be? The answer will determine prices and rates in the financial markets. This Market View takes a look at the costs of “paying the piper“in the US.</p>
<h3 id=""countering-the-crisis-in-the-us"">Countering the crisis in the US</h3>
<p>During and after the credit crisis in 2007-2008, growth slowed so much that there was downward pressure on asset prices on an ongoing basis. Owing to plunging asset prices, the banks suddenly needed to write down their debts. Consequently, credit seized up, asset prices kept falling, the economy started to contract more and more, and inflation threatened to morph into deflation. In other words, a vicious cycle was taking hold. Many debts could no longer be serviced, let alone repaid. To offset this, the government intervened on a massive scale. One implication was that its deficit mushroomed within a couple of years.</p>
<p>It soon turned out that this wasn’t enough to save the day and that, in any case, high deficits would not be sustainable, due to the ageing population. So the Fed needed to step in. The central bank embarked on a large-scale bond-buying programme, which drove down long-term interest rates and created a lot of “new money”, which boosted asset prices (albeit artificially).</p>
<p>The Fed policy helped to gradually turn the tide. As asset prices rose, consumers became more inclined to borrow and banks started to supply credit again. Instead of a collapsing financial sector and general downturn, the economy saw modest growth and credit picked up. At first glance, this is a fantastic achievement for the central bank, and completely in line with what can be expected during the first stage of a large-scale monetary stimulus.</p>
<h3 id=""free-lunch-today"">Free lunch today?</h3>
<p>However, it would be unwise to ignore Friedman’s comment. In other words, at what cost did all of this happen? This is a very relevant question even if, for the moment, inflation does not loom large – quite the opposite (which is why several Fed members appear more worried about deflation). The following can be expected.</p>
<p>The absence of inflation – so far – is understandable. After the credit crisis erupted, credit stagnated and the money multiplier, as well as money velocity, dropped sharply. The money created by the Fed merely compensated for this.</p>
<p>The problem is that in order to prevent deflation in the US, economic growth needs to be at least 2.5%. And as long as real disposable incomes increase marginally, this can only be attained if credit eases. The Fed accomplished this through asset inflation. Yet, success in this respect is a double-edged sword: as the money multiplier and the rate of money circulation accelerate, deflation risks will disappear but inflation will increase rapidly. Simultaneously, interest rates will spike until inflation is no longer a threat and/or until nominal interest rates exceed the expected rate of inflation considerably.</p>
<p>In the circumstances, interest rates will have a long way to go, the Fed having considerably depressed interest rates. Short rates are below inflation. However, long rates are not. For instance, the yield on ten-year US Treasury bonds is approximately a percentage point higher than the current inflation rate.</p>
<p>Of course, bond investors tend to look ahead. They know that once credit takes off properly, economic growth will reach 3% and inflation will rise to 2%. If so, nominal growth will hover around 5%. As long as the rate of interest remains below that, it will be profitable to borrow money and credit will continue to ease. As a result, the money multiplier and money velocity will increase and so will the risk of future inflation. In other words, whereas long-term interest rates exceed the present rate of inflation they are bound to go up at some point, which makes it even more attractive to borrow money, and so on.</p>
<h3 id=""bond-market-limits-growth-potential"">Bond market limits growth potential</h3>
<p>Owing to the massive money creation of the past years, the bond market will not tolerate a much higher money multiplier/velocity. In practice, this means that once borrowing picks up, bond yields will climb to levels where credit stagnates again.</p>
<p>Therefore, the price for the recent liquidity creation is that it will not be possible to expand credit supply much in the coming years. This could well imply that the US economy faces a prolonged period of low growth as deflation continues to threaten. To counter this, the Fed will have to keep on boosting asset prices artificially, eg. create more money. However, as money supply expands, interest rates will tend to shoot up at an ever earlier stage (and more steeply) as credit eases.</p>

<h3 id=""too-much-market-optimism"">Too much market optimism</h3>
<p>The markets are too sanguine about the long-term growth prospects for the US economy. It is praiseworthy that the Fed has managed to prevent a deep depression after the credit crisis broke out, but that is not the same as returning to the growth percentages of the past decades. The latter would require a functioning credit system but precisely because of the policy the Fed has pursued in recent decades, this may well be impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, many years of sluggish growth is on the cards. If growth threatens to slow too much, the central bank will – again – try to create asset inflation through money creation. But once credit eases, interest rates will skyrocket, until credit starts to tighten again. It seems that the US economy has now arrived at this stage.</p>

Eurocrisis persists due to timid politics,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>At the March session of the Brussels Forum, British historian Timothy Garton Ash said: “The EU today is an experimental laboratory of the future of the world.” Unfortunately, this laboratory is brewing a lethal concoction of isolationism, protectionism, apathy, populism and disillusionment.</p>
<p>Europe appears a prisoner of the past. Often the main argument in defence of further integration and the survival of the euro is that both have brought peace to the EU after two world wars. There are few convincing stories that place the EU in a global context and/or make a case for a starring role for the EU in world politics/economics. The result, as the Dutch professor Paul Scheffer contends, is “piecemeal erosion instead of piecemeal integration”. Will Europe be able to turn this narrative around?</p>
<h3 id=""continuing-european-frictions"">Continuing European frictions</h3>
<p>Owing to the twin political and economic crises, differences within Europe have widened; yet in some ways, trends are converging. This is not a positive development with regards to the latter: northern euro countries are no longer immune to the crisis. Even growth in Germany has been minimal.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the EU becomes stronger and takes concrete steps towards a banking, fiscal, economic and political union. However, in reality, most member states are moving in the opposite direction. They want to limit the powers of Brussels and gain more autonomy. Significantly, in recent years the decision-making process regarding the crisis has shifted from the European Commission, the supranational body governing the EU, to the European Council, consisting of the national leaders.</p>
<p>Friction also exists between the need for rapid intervention (as the crisis can, potentially, spiral out of control at any moment) and numerous rules, laws and procedures that are in the way of decisive action. The cases sitting before the German Constitutional Court are a prime example. Equally controversial is that the interests of global capitalism/the international financial markets and national politics are diverging. In a crisis, markets demand a different approach than the electorate and national (opposition) parties. Politicians are often caught between a rock and a hard place if they want to placate both markets and voters. For now, they are going down a road that makes many voters profoundly unhappy.</p>
<p>All these tensions lead to four schisms between:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Euro countries and the other EU states. Several non-euro countries within the EU have indicated they do not like the fact that small groups of Eurozone members are taking decisions that impact on the rest. One fear is that the sphere of interest of these ‘cliques’ will gradually extend to other areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debtor and creditor countries. Until now, this has largely been a North-South divide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Countries that are happy to take the lead in ‘two-speed Europe’ and states that fear being left behind and marginalised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany and other countries – the abyss between Berlin and the rest of Europe is increasing. Surveys indicate that the Germans are seen as the most arrogant and least compassionate Europeans (albeit extremely reliable).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Presently, Germany is – partly against its will – the undisputed European leader. Yet it is clear that France, in particular, is becoming very nervous about the growing power chasm between Germany and its fellow Europeans.</p>
<h3 id=""will-europe-be-torn-apart"">Will Europe be torn apart?</h3>
<p>Indisputably, the Eurozone has calmed down since the summer of 2012. This could well change before the year is out. Crumbling confidence in the EU will make it very difficult to justify a transfer of power to Brussels. Meanwhile, Brussels can only inspire confidence if it persists with the European integration project.</p>

<p>Plummeting faith in the national politicians and democracies is eroding Europe from the inside and thwarts a successful tackling of the crisis. Signs of this are political instability in Italy, Greece and other European countries, not to mention the corruption and abuse of power scandals, anti-democratic tendencies and government crises in Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovenia, etc.</p>
<p>Another development that threatens to tear Europe apart is the anti-European course of the UK. The British were never big fans of the EU but their antipathy seems to be in the process of becoming endemic. On top of this, a misguided strategy in the domestic EU debate has weakened the Prime Minister. Unless he is very careful, David Cameron could go the way of his predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who were tripped up by inter-party quarrels about Europe. Of course it won’t do Europe any good if Britain becomes rudderless.</p>
<p>Finally, Germany’s increasingly isolated position is ominous. A virtually unbridgeable gap seems to have opened between Paris and Berlin. Not so long ago, little could happen without the approval (and material support) of the solid Paris-Berlin axis. Recently, France has mooted a number of proposals that were meant to tie Germany to a full-fledged union. However, Germany is clearly not sold at all on further integration, which will take a long time and will probably require a lot of political capital.</p>
<h3 id=""to-be-or-not-to-be"">To be or not to be?</h3>
<p>Evidently, the EU and the Eurozone need to make fundamental choices. Either Europe should slow down the process of integration and adjust its procedures accordingly, or it should get squarely behind the EU and the Eurozone. This would imply a full-blown banking union, with a communal deposit guarantee system as well as a shared resolution mechanism, as a stepping stone towards the political and economic union of Jean Monnet’s dreams. However, it is not likely that the latter will happen in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Europe has been sucked into a whirlwind of emotions, tendencies, and developments: fear, uncertainty, fury, introversion, doubt, populism and isolationism. As the experts point out, the ‘old continent’ is still milking its past glory. In addition, the European elite gives the impression that it is (totally) oblivious to how outsiders view the EU. A tentative conclusion is that as long as Europe lacks a critical sense of self-reflection and turns a blind eye to its failures, it cannot recover from its malaise.</p>

<h3 id=""the-move-to-great-politics"">The move to “great politics”</h3>
<p>Will Europe take decisive action in the remainder of 2013? Unlikely. It will probably continue to stumble on, even if events show that this strategy is unsustainable. Shock therapy would be a better solution.</p>
<p>During a symposium about Europe, a professor from China cited a Chinese proverb: “It takes a year to grow rice, ten years to grow a tree and a century to cultivate people.” In short, the EU’s culture should undergo drastic changes but it will take a long time until the European minds (and hearts) are ready for this.</p>
<p>Eventually, there could be some positive surprises. Unfortunately, the trigger that forces Europe to act may well be an erupting crisis. In any case, Eurozone tensions are expected to increase this year because the EU and the EMU will likely remain stuck in a mire. Subsequently, the euro will depreciate against the dollar, as bond yields rise in the periphery and fall in Germany.</p>
<p>Should the Eurozone fail to put a lid on the tensions, in the longer term the markets will realise that the Germans will have to stand guarantor for the financial problems in the rest of the Eurozone. By then, German government bond yields could rise.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, the European continent will keep struggling with a political, economic and social crisis as long as countries, and the EU as a whole, have to make do with – in the words of German sociologist Ulrich Beck – “pusillanimous” (faint-hearted) politics instead of “great politics”.</p>

Are safe haven currencies back in vogue?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the weeks leading up to mid-May, the traditional safe haven currencies – the Swiss franc (CHF) and Japanese yen (JPY) – have declined against the euro (EUR) and the US dollar (USD). This movement was unsurprising for those watching the market. While Eurozone tensions are receding and US growth prospects are improving, the extremely low yields on Swiss and Japanese money products have nothing to offer to yield hungry investors. Yet, these safe haven currencies are expected to regain their appeal, particularly against the euro.</p>
<h3 id=""eur-chf"">EUR/CHF</h3>
<p>With its interest rate cut at the start of May, the European Central Bank (ECB) has begun a monetary easing cycle. Speculation on further rate cuts (including expectation that deposit rates will turn negative) and a predicted rise in Eurozone tensions later this year will cause EUR/CHF to drop towards 1.20.</p>
<p>Many German banks, in particular, have large liquidity surpluses and are presently placing most of this money with the ECB. Once they need to pay for the privilege, the German banks themselves will probably offer lower interest rates on deposits. Recently, many savers shifted their capital from the weak Eurozone countries to the German banks whenever Eurozone tensions took a turn for the worse. This reaction was mainly because these tensions could have triggered a euro collapse, in which case, savings – if left in a peripheral bank – would be denominated in a currency with a much lower value than the euro.</p>
<p>Depositing money with a Swiss bank is a sound alternative to placing it with German banks, even if a number of Swiss banks (intend to) apply a negative interest rate to foreign account holders. Such a disadvantage will become less significant once the ECB cuts its deposit rate below zero. This signals that any rally in EUR/CHF above 1.25 – 1.265 would be a good time to buy francs, particularly for investors who anticipate growing Eurozone tensions in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>And there is a real chance of the latter. Clearly, the Eurozone focus is shifting from reorganising public finances towards less fiscal austerity and more growth-boosting measures. The problem is that fiscal stimulus is no longer an option mainly because it costs too much; whereas a monetary impulse that is strong enough to accelerate growth is unlikely especially as Germany could well oppose this, even though it has reluctantly agreed to gradual monetary easing. In that case, mediocre growth prospects and large (and/or expanding) budget deficits in many weak Eurozone countries is a foreseeable outcome. All of this could whip up Eurozone tensions even further and lead to a drop in EUR/CHF (to 1.20) over the coming months.</p>
<p>The Swiss central bank, Swiss National Bank (SNB), will probably manage to defend the 1.20 floor for some time, which means that EUR/CHF could continue to hover around this level in the near future. Only if Eurozone tensions skyrocket and jeopardise the survival of the euro – which is unlikely to happen in 2013 – will it become too risky for the SNB to hold on to the peg.</p>
<p>Another scenario, although less likely, is also possible. Once deposit rates at the ECB turn negative, savers could abandon the low-yielding deposits in the core Eurozone countries and open deposits with banks in the peripheral Eurozone, where interest rates are higher. Such a capital inflow could even prompt a positive spiral. If so, the banks in the debt-laden member states will have more money at their disposal, which they can lend out or use to purchase government bonds in order to drive down long-term interest rates.</p>

<p class=""source"">Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream/ECR</p>
</figure>
<p>The latter has been happening during the past few months and, if the above scenario unfolds, it could continue for longer. The upshot could be fewer Eurozone tensions. If conditions continue to improve, non-EMU investors could be tempted to purchase euro assets, which would cause the euro to appreciate and drive down demand for safe haven currencies such as the CHF. In that case, an increasing number of investors would withdraw their capital from Switzerland in order to profit from a EUR/CHF rally.</p>
<h3 id=""eur-jpy"">EUR/JPY</h3>
<p>Soon after Shinzo Abe entered the Prime Minister’s office, the JPY weakened considerably against the USD and EUR. Recent figures showing that – for the first time in a long time – Japanese investors have become net buyers of foreign assets has added extra fuel to the rise in EUR/JPY and USD/JPY. If this development persists, a spiral could start whereby the outflow of capital weakens the JPY even further, as existing JPY investors face mounting currency losses. This will spur them on to sell their JPY assets.</p>
<p>Also relevant is the rise of Japanese bond yields. This also suggests that investors are selling Japanese assets (in this case bonds) and moving the proceeds out of Japan. Rapidly rising interest rates could sound the death knell for the Japanese public finances, as the country’s national debt and budget deficits are very large. Owing to higher interest charges, the public finances will spiral out of control, more investors will sell government bonds and bond yields will skyrocket, etc. Before long, the central bank will come under enormous pressure to purchase more government debt (with newly created money) in order to prevent additional interest rate rises, which will weaken the JPY even further.</p>
<p>The risk is low that this will happen in the coming weeks to months. Theoretically, the bond yield rallies and the depreciation of the JPY could set off such a spiral, but there is also the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The authorities have made it clear that a USD/JPY rally beyond 110 would do the Japanese economy more harm than good. Japanese exporters would benefit from a cheaper currency but the downside – higher import prices – would eat into consumer purchasing power. Therefore the authorities aim for an exchange rate near 100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outside Japan, there is growing opposition to the rapid depreciation of the JPY. During the recent G7 meeting, Japan once again received approval to continue with its loose monetary policy. However, by now more central banks around the world are starting to ease their policies to prevent their currencies from appreciating too much.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Owing to the above, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is not expected to pursue a far more accommodative policy than it has announced in the past period. These measures have already been discounted in the exchange rate of the JPY. The same is not true of monetary easing outside Japan.</p>
<p>To give one example, the ECB has cut its rate at the start of May and ECB President Mario Draghi has hinted at more monetary easing. Central banks in, among others, Australia, South Korea and Poland have lowered their key interest rates. Increasingly, this will put upward pressure on the JPY. In combination with an expectation of rising Eurozone tensions in the coming months, EUR/JPY is expected to drop towards 115 over the coming months.</p>

Cash: will it ever die?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Reports of the death of cash are greatly exaggerated. In 2010, $14.4 trillion of consumer payments were made with cash worldwide, compared to consumer payment card transactions valued (excluding commercial payments) at $9.582 trillion, according to ‘The Global Cash Digest’, published by global trade body the ATM Industry Association. A total of 62 billion ATM cash withdrawals worldwide in 2009, says the report, is forecast to rise to 94 billion cash withdrawals in 2015.</p>
<p>While cash is still around, the global volume of non-cash payments continues to show healthy growth, with the largest gain in volumes occurring in developing markets, according to the ‘World Payments Report 2012’ (WPR12). Non-cash transaction volumes grew by 7.1% to reach 283 billion in 2010.</p>
<p>Volumes jumped 16.9% in developing markets, boosted by an increase of more than 30% in both Russia and China. That growth far outpaced the modest increase in volumes in developed markets, which were still suffering the effects of the financial and sovereign debt crisis. Even in developed markets, though, the growth in non-cash payments volumes – at 4.9% – outpaced the rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP), and developed markets still accounted for about 80% of all non-cash payments transactions globally. Debit and credit cards, says the WPR12, are the biggest driver of non-cash payments volumes globally. They accounted for 55.8% of all non-cash payments in 2010, up from 53.4% in 2009 and 35.3% in 2001. Debit cards alone accounted for more than one in three of all payments, partly as the use of cards for smaller-ticket transactions becomes more widespread.</p>
<p>But for many, cash remains king – and even more so since the onset of the global financial crisis. Rodney Gardner, Head of Global Receivables, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill), points out that in the US 43% of the population do not hold any credit cards and 20% have no type of payment card. Moreover, 17 million US citizens do not have a bank account. “For my corporate clients, the cost for accepting and handling cash must be accounted for. But there is opportunity for clients to take advantage of new technologies that can significantly reduce the cost of handling cash.”</p>
<p>There is much discussion about cash dying out, but there are only two or three countries worldwide where less than 50% of payment transactions are made in cash, says Gareth Lodge, Senior Analyst in the Banking Group at financial industry analysts Celent. “By the number of transactions, cash is the dominant payment type in every country in the world. It is, in fact, typically more dominant than all other payment types put together,” he says.</p>
<p>Most payments industry experts interviewed by Treasury Today admit that the demise of cash will be a long, slow burn. Moreover, it is difficult – or too early – to predict which non-cash payments instruments will prevail. However, cash is in the sights of financial institutions and governments as it is deemed to be expensive and vulnerable to criminal usage. Some of the typical reasons cash is being targeted are outlined in the Cashless Lagos Project in Nigeria, for example. Here, the government is supporting a cashless policy as part of a drive to develop and modernise the country’s payments system.</p>
<h3 id=""new-developments-nigeria-leads-the-way"">New developments: Nigeria leads the way</h3>
<p>Under the scheme, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has introduced a cash-handling charge on daily cash withdrawals or deposits, aimed at reducing the amount of physical cash circulating in the economy and to encourage consumers and businesses to switch to electronic payment (e-payments) transactions. The Nigerian government believes an “efficient and modern” payments system is “positively correlated with economic development and is a key enabler for economic growth”.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cashless project is designed to reduce the cost of banking services, including the cost of credit, and to drive financial inclusion by providing more efficient transaction options and greater reach. Finally, it is hoped a reduction in cash transactions will help to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy in managing inflation and driving economic growth.</p>
<p>The negatives of cash, say Nigeria’s authorities, manifest themselves in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A high cost of handling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High risk in terms of robberies and other cash-related crimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A high subsidy – investigation has revealed that the entire banking population subsidises the costs of a tiny minority of cash users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The existence of money outside the formal economy, which limits the effectiveness of monetary policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inefficiency and corruption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Authorities in other countries, including Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands, are also pursuing cash reduction initiatives. For example, Canada’s MintChip, announced by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2012, is a digital currency for digital payment transactions, based on a secure smart card chip that can connect to computers and mobile devices. A survey of Canadians conducted by Leger Marketing in 2011 suggested that a majority of people in the country would be happy using digital forms of payment instead of physical currency. Of the 1512 Canadians surveyed, 56% said they would prefer to use a digital wallet and 34% said they would rather use a smart phone than cash to make a payment.</p>
<p>Additionally, in February Canada removed the copper one penny coin from circulation. Authorities cited the coin’s eroded purchasing power, rising manufacturing costs, hoarding by households and the outlay by retailers in handling the coins as reasons for its removal. Other countries to have removed copper coins from circulation include Australia, Brazil and Sweden.</p>
<p>The Nigerian project is noteworthy because developing markets tend to be more cash-based for the reasons BofA Merrill’s Gardner cites – low penetration of bank accounts, a lack of cards and higher poverty levels. However, in Africa more citizens have mobile phones than bank accounts and many organisations believe mobile payments (m-payments) represent a huge opportunity. This may be true but to date only M-Pesa in Kenya has been successful; a success that has proved difficult to replicate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By the number of transactions, cash is the dominant payment type in every country in the world. It is, in fact, typically more dominant than all other payment types put together.”</p>
<p><cite>Gareth Lodge, Senior Analyst, Celent</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In most emerging markets cash is still very much an integral part of buyer’s behaviour and we do not see markets moving away from cash any time soon,” says Karin Flinspach, EMEA Head of Payments and Receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. In such markets Citi works with companies that have innovative cash handling solutions that may reduce the risk and cost of handling cash.</p>
<p>“These innovative solutions include, for example, the use of terminals for immediate cash deposit after collection from the buyer and thereby removing the need to keep the cash in office premises, which poses risk and also delays the cash crediting process associated with traditional over-the-counter (OTC) deposits or cash pick-up deposits,” she adds.</p>
<p>Generally in developed markets there is a strong trend towards “electronification” and digitisation, says Flinspach. “In retail, growth is mainly seen in online ecommerce, which popularises cards as a method of paying that in essence reduces days sales outstanding (DSO) to real-time confirmation.”</p>
<p>In addition, online retailers are also searching for other instruments to integrate into their online platforms so that they can offer a wider range of payment methods to their customer base. “This is further accelerated by the fact that market infrastructure is changing for electronic transfers, so-called faster payments, and now allows for the instant movement of cash online which is very suitable for the online retail model,” she says.</p>
<p>Celent’s Lodge says in order to replace cash, the payments industry and businesses need to consider what cash does that other payments types don’t do. “Payments behaviour is driven by habit and convenience, which are characteristics of cash. Anyone developing alternative payment systems has to compete with that.” To date, debit cards have done a good job because many consumers regard them as an electronic form of cash. The number of people who switched from using credit cards to debit cards post-financial crisis was “staggering”, says Lodge. “People know that debit cards represent what is in their account and therefore what they can spend.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-corporate-cash-conundrum"">The corporate cash conundrum</h3>
<p>Bank of American Merrill Lynch’s Gardner says corporates at times lack the complete picture of what impact cash payments have on their bottom lines. There are hidden costs with cash – a retailer will typically require reconciliation staff, people who could otherwise be on the floor making sales. Also, there is a high cost associated with the physical handling of cash because specialist security companies have to be paid to pick up and deliver cash.</p>
<p>Cash is trapped in stores until it is delivered to the bank and the corporate has no visibility over its cash position. One of BofA Merrill’s focuses is on reducing cash in the business-to-business (B2B) sector. “Take, for example, a retail distributor – it will employ a driver to deliver goods to a number of small grocery stores, the proprietors of which are likely to pay by either cash or cheque. So the delivery van goes out full of goods and returns full of cash and cheques,” he says. This has generated some interesting business models including companies that have instructed delivery drivers to convert cash into a money order at Western Union whenever a certain level of cash was reached, in order to reduce risk. At the end of the day the money order was then taken to a bank. “People at those companies thought about the risk connected to cash but didn’t think about trying to get away from cash completely.”</p>
<p>To reduce cash in these scenarios, Gardner says banks can set up electronic transfers between the grocery stores and the distribution company. It is important that these solutions enable the information to accompany the transaction, to make reconciliation as straight through as possible, he says.</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-tipped-to-replace-cash"">What is tipped to replace cash?</h3>
<p>While corporates mark time on the demise of cash and use solutions to reduce the pain and costs of cash handling, a debate continues about which non-cash instruments will succeed. At this year’s International Payments Summit (IPS) in London, Niklas Bartelt, Managing Director at DZ Bank, said the question about whether m-payments would replace cash, debit and credit cards hinged on who would “pay to make that happen”. He said m-payments would benefit retailers more than any other players in the payments industry (ie banks). “Retailers will be the winners with m-payments as they can be used to revolutionise and improve the point-of-sale (POS) experience and perhaps even help in the total rethink of how retail works,” he said.</p>
<p>Any innovation in non-cash requires an infrastructure that will enable solutions to work. Marcelino Castrillo, Head of SME for Santander Corporate and Commercial, says cash will be around for a long time as it is perceived by some groups – those on lower incomes, students and the elderly – as a better way of managing their finances and controlling their spend. Any alternative to cash will have to provide the control of finances that is valued by cash users and be more convenient. Like Flinspach, he cites immediate payments, such as the UK’s Faster Payments, as an important move. “Faster Payments in the UK is providing an infrastructure for alternative payments instruments. Plans to link mobile numbers to bank accounts will be a further step towards non-cash payments.”</p>
<p>Chris Dunne, Payment Services Director at UK payments processor VocaLink, which operates Faster Payments, says the mobile proxy database will target friction in the system. At present, anyone wanting to pay someone via Faster Payments has to set them up as a new beneficiary in their bank account, which can be a convoluted process. The main UK banks have committed to the project, which will enable users to give their mobile number, rather than bank details to the person paying them. “People will feel this is a more confidential system. It also has the potential to be a mass market solution that will reduce friction. Cash has very little friction but it does depend on the payer and beneficiary being in the same room.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Retailers will be the winners with m-payments as they can be used to revolutionise and improve the point-of-sale (POS) experience and perhaps even help in the total rethink of how retail works.”</p>
<p><cite>Niklas Bartelt, Managing Director, DZ Bank</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dunne says the mobile database has been built for peer-to-peer (P2P) m-payments; a much broader set of applications will also be developed for corporate applications, enabling request for push payments. “We are building an ecosystem that will allow the biller to send an invoice to a customer on their mobile phone. All of the invoice details will go with the payment, which is important for companies as they need to know which transaction a payment is related to.”</p>
<p>Picking the winners and losers in non-cash instruments is difficult. Marcus Treacher, Global Head of eCommerce for Payments and Cash Management at HSBC, predicts that smartphone contactless payments could quickly reduce cash payments significantly in many parts of the world. “That will have a huge impact in terms of cost reduction on the cash cycle and more efficient receivables handling for bank processing centres and large retailers such as supermarkets.” Today one in seven payment transactions below £20 at Marks &amp; Spencer stores have been made via contactless cards; Pret a Manger, a very early adopter of contactless cards, has seen the use of contactless payments grow from 3% to 20% since they were introduced in 2008.</p>
<p>Contactless card solutions are becoming more integrated with smartphone devices, which will accelerate the mass adoption of m-payments using technologies such as NFC, he adds. “There is a great deal of innovation occurring in the mobile and cloud arenas. Although it is difficult to work out what and who will be successful, the clear trend is towards contactless payments. Mobiles will increasingly displace cash because they will be used to make e-payments, but it will take a while.” </p>

<p>In a recent ‘Finger on the Pulse’ poll on Treasury Today, the majority (61%) of respondents chose foreign exchange (FX) as their biggest cash and risk management concern when operating in emerging markets (EM), followed by cash flow forecasting and visibility and then regulatory complexity. Mark Tweedie, Head of Sales EMEA, Corporates, Treasury and Trade Solutions and Joakim Lidbark, Global Head CitiFX Corporate Solutions, Foreign Exchange, outline Citi’s strategy for helping clients navigate liquidity management challenges in the EM.</p>

<p>Around 70% of world growth over the next few years will come from emerging markets (EM), with China and India accounting for 40% of that growth. In 2005, less than 10% of the global Fortune 500 was headquartered in the emerging markets; last year, that proportion had grown to over 25%. Today multinational corporations (MNCs) are eagerly looking to enter or expand their business operations in these dynamic markets.</p>

<p>As the EM increases in importance within a corporate’s overall growth strategy, treasurers are being called upon to improve visibility and control over the company’s cash within these countries, which in turn is driving the desire for increased treasury centralisation. In order to use liquidity efficiently and rely less on external funding, a treasurer needs to know where the company’s cash is, how much is in each locality and whether there are restrictions on its flows. However, this level of oversight can prove to be quite challenging. Given this importance, Citi has created an EM resource centre which is a single source of information on regulations required and its transactional services.</p>
<p>In addition, as corporates move from a distributor-led G3 currency (US dollar (USD), euro (EUR) and Japanese yen (JPY)) model to a full-fledged permanent local presence, they need to develop a strategy for modifying their working capital practices. Many of these companies are now looking to invoice in local currencies, as a result of becoming more responsive to the end customers’ buying behaviour, funding currency and need to reduce FX volatility.</p>
<h3 id=""fx-risk-management"">FX risk management</h3>
<p>FX risk management in the EM is a hot topic, as shown by Treasury Today’s ‘Finger on the Pulse’ poll. As a result many treasurers are looking to evolve their policies around currency hedging and the management of local currency positions. In doing so a common realisation is that existing G10 currency<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> hedging policies, which may be more than ten years old and written at a time when the corporate was G10-specific only, is not fit for purpose in the EM.</p>
<p>Depending on the sector, a typical corporate would use a hedging tenor of one to two years for its G10 FX exposures. However, as sales and revenue streams alike shift to EM, simply applying a G10 centric hedging policy may not suffice. This is mainly because of the cost of hedging EM currencies, but also in some circumstances due to liquidity and regulatory constraints. As a consequence, we believe that corporates with a global foot print should consider benefits of applying two separate approaches: one pursuing a long-term hedging policy in the G10 currencies; and the other with a much shorter hedging tenor, eg less than one year in the EM.</p>
<p>Before setting up a hedging policy, or rewriting one, corporates should first understand why they are hedging. For those corporates predominately managing G10 currencies, a common objective is to smooth out the peaks and troughs of year-on-year volatility. To achieve this goal, a corporate will need relatively long-term hedges in place such as provided by a layered hedging framework, where hedge ratios are built up gradually over time. However, in the EM smoothing volatility is not as straight forward due to factors such as the absence of mean-reversion, jump-risk and hedging cost; instead many use hedging as a means to lock in margins or achieve a budget rate over a specific period.</p>
<p>Citi helps corporates quantify risk, and then determines which types of derivatives can be used to mitigate the exposure. This advice is not limited to the type of derivative, but also to implementation method. Once a hedging policy is defined it’s important to effectively track exposures and make sure it’s accurately followed. For example, Citi’s FX Pulse product allows subsidiaries to enter their exposures which feed up to central treasury in real time. Treasury can readily access a breakdown of cash flow and balance sheet exposures alongside their existing hedges, and in turn receive a clear instruction on how much more or less to hedge at any time to stay on target. A netted risk view allows users to see total risk in a given currency pair, or indeed single currency, across all subsidiaries, exposures and value dates so that risk on aggregating positions across opposite functional and exposure currencies are quickly highlighted.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study-1"">Case study</h2>
<h3 id=""luxottica-group-spa"">Luxottica Group S.p.A</h3>
<p><em>Luxottica Group is a premium, luxury and sports eyewear company with manufacturing, retail and wholesale operations that span 130 countries worldwide. The company has adopted a regionalised treasury structure with each treasury centre responsible for cash and FX risk management in its own region.</em></p>
<p>In China, Luxottica has two manufacturing facilities plus retail and wholesale operations. The Chinese subsidiaries import and export raw materials and finished products to and from various group entities, the invoice currency primarily in USD, EUR and AUD. In addition, various group entities have trade flows with third-party suppliers in China where the invoice currency is in EUR or USD.</p>
<p>In 2010, the treasury team reviewed its FX flows worldwide with the objective of simplifying the invoicing process to minimise the FX risk in particular regions and concentrate it in Europe, where the company’s main manufacturing facility and HQ are based, and its exports worldwide account for a significant percentage of the groups’ FX exposure.</p>
<p>The internationalisation of the RMB was gaining momentum at the time so Luxottica assessed this in relation to flows with Chinese entities and decided that all inter-company flows with China would be re-invoiced in renminbi (RMB). As part of the review and transition to the new invoicing process, Luxottica mapped out all the relevant flows that would be affected by this change and worked with Citi on solutions to support the initiatives.</p>
<p>This involved its fiscal and tax departments, with a particular emphasis on transfer pricing; the IT department, charged with amending accounting systems and billing/logistics systems; and the treasury team, which co-ordinated with all relevant departments, including local finance teams. In the process, the treasury team in Europe opened a number of offshore RMB accounts with Citi to collect and pay RMB, and manage the FX risk using spot and forward deliverable RMB contracts. The whole project was completed in just six months.</p>
<p>Adopting the RMB has brought significant efficiencies to Luxottica: simplified invoicing for China and reduced currency pairs managed from AUD, EUR and USD to RMB; simplified hedging process, removing FX risk from China and concentrating FX risk in Europe; a greater natural hedge than it had before; lower transactional and operating costs.</p>
<p>With the increased liberalisation of the RMB, Luxottica is considering integrating the RMB into a global cash-pooling solution (such as multi-currency notional pooling) to concentrate its cash.</p>

<h3 id=""cash-management-and-cross-currency-payments"">Cash management and cross-currency payments</h3>
<p>As large multinational corporates (MNCs) move a greater proportion of their business and density of sales into the EM, they are looking at ways to repatriate surplus cash from financing and debt redemption. Corporates are increasingly using inter-company control, netting and sweeping (to the extent that currencies are fungible, or without capital or currency control restrictions).</p>
<p>Corporates need to stay abreast of new developments in global liquidity management, as the EM economies evolve. The most prominent example is the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and State Administration of Foreign Exchange’s (SAFE) recent relaxation of RMB currency controls. Citi is participating in a pilot programme that includes just a handful of banks and corporates. In January, the bank completed its first cross-border lending transaction in RMB, conducted on behalf of a European consumer company. The money was lent to the company’s regional treasury centre (RTC) in Singapore, in order to leverage its China operation’s surplus cash and achieve greater efficiency in its global fund usage and allocation.</p>
<p>As they expand deeper into the EM, corporates are switching from foreign currency to local currency invoicing and searching for a single solution for cross-border payments. Citi’s WorldLink product has continued to evolve for the past 30 years and now supports 2700 clients, processing 36 million payments per year. WorldLink is a multicurrency cross-border payments solution enabling clients to have a single funding currency while making payments in over 130 currencies.</p>
<p>Corporates, in particular those setting up joint ventures (JVs) to support their growth in EM, are using WorldLink as part of a ‘banking lite’ operating model and payment architecture. Common in the oil and gas industry, JVs are usually set up for finite timescales, such as for production and exploration projects. These JVs don’t necessarily have the natural offset between accounts receivable (AR) and payable (AP), as crude oil is denominated in USD and shipped through commodity traders, whereas payments to tax authorities, suppliers, insurers, employees etc are in local currency. In this situation, often companies don’t want to put a lot of expensive plumbing in place, or go down the laborious road of joint signing authorities, account openings and complex liquidity structures, with a new JV partner. Instead they want to fund the JV on an as-needed basis and make their proportionate share of disbursement from a treasury account.</p>
<p>As part of managing end-to-end financial flows, Citi supports corporates’ employee expense management and business-to-business (B2B) purchase cards programmes. Companies usually want to drive more spend through cards to increase their control and leverage (from a procurement standpoint). Citi issues local currency commercial cards in over 65 countries, which means that the cardholder doesn’t suffer from the local currency fluctuations and the corporate gets the benefit of the entire global spend, not just in the US and Western Europe where most issuers have acceptance capabilities. This holistic coverage means that procurement can negotiate with its suppliers based on the company’s global spend and that card holders have a common experience irrespective of territory. To this end, Citi has become the only international bank offering this service in China.</p>
<h3 id=""liquidity-and-trade-finance"">Liquidity and trade finance</h3>
<p>Operating in the EM raises corporate risk levels and many are looking to mitigate risk with early settlement of their pending receivables. Citi has focused its activity in the trade finance space to help clients with their payment terms to free up liquidity early on in the process. Citi also has a Global Concentration Engine providing treasurers with seamless end of day cash mobilisation for an unlimited number of accounts in 25 countries (the bank is currently expanding this), thereby minimising idle cash and consolidating cash in treasury hub locations.</p>
<p>Citi is active in the letters of credit (LC) space, which effectively swaps corporate risk for bank risk. LCs continue to be a common approach when companies enter into agreements with new trading counterparties. They are looking for a single counterparty to help them with their export LCs – not just issuing LCs but also discounting where possible to accelerate the cash conversion cycle.</p>
<p>Therefore, as clients go into new markets, trade services are a highly valued area of the corporate and bank partnership. Citi understands that having teams on the ground, illustratively, in Lagos, Nairobi, Algiers and Dubai is of critical importance especially when aligned to the largest correspondent bank network in the business. Citi has further invested in expanding and mobilising its electronic bank platforms to handle LC issuance and confirmations. Furthermore, the trade processing hubs at Citi are essential tools for the treasurer when navigating new markets.</p>
<p>In addition, and especially common in manufacturing and energy / refining industries, corporates are also looking for import loans and financing to buy equipment, which are most often large dollar-denominated purchases. By linking the asset to a trade transaction banks are able to reduce the risk capital intensity given the low loss given default rates and therefore price such loans attractively for corporates. Citi has further seen a significant expansion of interest in extending its successful supply chain finance programmes for clients to cover EM suppliers. Fundamentally, corporates need banking partners to help them navigate environments successfully and de-risk it. Citi, for example, was one of the first banks to set up LC re-issuances for the Trade Bank of Iraq (TBI), effectively swapping out exposure on Iraq for risk on Citi in UAE.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study-2"">Case study</h2>
<h3 id=""wipro-india"">Wipro India</h3>
<p><em>Wipro, a global IT company, has over 130,000 employees, with clients located in 54 countries. The company has established a shared service centre (SSC) in Bangalore, India, and embarked on a project to automate payments processing, migrating from the use of cheques to electronic payments (e-payments) for payments both in India and in Europe from its enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This project proved highly successful, with a significant number of payments made electronically within the first year, leveraging uniform standards.</em></p>
<p>Since then, Wipro has extended the reach of its SSC across nearly 35 countries, and continued to pursue an active acquisition programme, further increasing the scale and complexity of the SSC’s operations. Consequently, the company has worked closely with Citi to expand and enhance its activities to meet its changing business needs in 22 countries.</p>
<p>Wipro’s SSC now makes payments on behalf of branches and subsidiaries in nearly 35 countries using a full range of payment methods to support the company’s activities across eight countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Latin America and North America. When first establishing the SSC, Wipro used CitiDirect Online Banking for payments and account statements. More recently, the company has been working with Citi to migrate to a host-to-host connection with Wipro’s ERP, enabling full straight through processing within a secure environment.</p>
<p>Wipro had already implemented Citi’s Worldlink solution for making foreign currency payments from a single account. Most recently, the company has been expanded to the US for automating the production of cheques, and testing is in progress for the Canada region. In India, foreign currency payments can be complex because of the documentation requirements, which can make the process slow and labour-intensive. Wipro implemented Intralinks, which exchanges foreign currency payment information electronically with the bank, streamlining the process considerably, and ensuring that Wipro’s team has to deal only with exceptions.</p>
<p>As a company with an ambitious growth strategy, Wipro has made frequent acquisitions in recent years. In order to achieve full visibility and control over cash, both for accounts held with Citi and third-party banks, Wipro chose Citi’sTreasuryVision programme, in order to give visibility over accounts globally. Around 60% of accounts are now accessible through TreasuryVision, which is also increasing rapidly, so Wipro will have full visibility over its cash balances globally, which can be extended to new accounts as the company structure continues to change and expand.</p>

<h3 id=""de-risk-demystify-and-simplify"">De-risk, demystify and simplify</h3>
<p>Citi’s investment and commitment to the EM is absolutely core to its business strategy. Mike Corbat, Citigroup CEO, outlined the bank’s orientation in his 1Q13 speech on 5<sup>th</sup> March: “For Citi, global doesn’t mean packing up a suitcase and travelling to where a client needs to do a transaction. Global means we’re established in the countries where our clients need us to do business, both in developed and emerging markets. They can make payroll in Tanzania. They can purchase raw materials in Indonesia. They can hedge currency risk in Korea. And they can do so knowing that they’re dealing with a strong, well-regulated firm.”</p>
<p>The bank has deep knowledge and experience in the EM, with MNCs as well as EM champions. This means it is well-positioned to comment on evolving trends, such as prudent treasury practices during the impact of the Arab Spring. Citi also enables corporates with centralised treasuries to be guided by the bank’s relationship, sales and product teams as to what is happening from a regulatory change standpoint, whether that is Hungary’s financial transaction tax (FTT) or new depositor insurance regulation in Kenya or Nigeria or the relaxation of RMB currency controls. The bank is effectively configured as an “early warning system” for its clients, with the aim of de-risking, demystifying and simplifying the EM.</p>
<p>MNCs are engaging in a significant amount of capital raising activity in the EM, as indeed are EM companies, given the attractiveness and the low spreads on the high yield debt and some of the EM debt. Clearly what the companies do with that cash once they have raised it and how they manage that cash is of principle concern for the group treasurer, who will be working hand-in-glove with the M&amp;A department and the business development function. In addition, Citi is investing in banking evolution – CitiDirect BE – and has launched a mobile version of its CitiDirect platform, CitiDirect BE Mobile, with an upgraded user experience and new functionality, such as access to Trade Advisor. This enhancement, along with other channel extensions that Citi currently has in the works, is geared towards giving treasurers control and oversight of transactional activity across their business.</p>

<h3 id=""panalpina-latin-america"">Panalpina Latin America</h3>
<p><em>The Panalpina Group, a multi-modal transportation company, has global operations in more than 80 countries. In Colombia, the company faced unique challenges in its efforts to maximise cost efficiency and improve supplier relationships. Because ground transportation is particularly costly in the region with shippers demanding that all costs be paid up front, Panalpina Latin America focused on improving cash flow and meeting working capital goals.</em></p>
<p>In order to improve the company’s working capital, it needed to renegotiate terms and conditions with ground transportation suppliers. With help from Citi the company implemented a supply chain finance (SCF) solution. After securing buy-in from the procurement team, treasury worked closely with the bank to put a customised Citi Supplier Finance programme in place. The programme offers suppliers the opportunity to turn their AR into immediate cash.</p>
<p>This innovative solution provides an electronic disbursement service with Citi acting as Panalpina Latin America’s paying agent, allowing the bank to pay suppliers on their respective due dates. At the same time, Citi offers suppliers the option of accelerating AR payments, either through a true sale or a discount structure.</p>
<p>To initiate a payment, Panalpina Latin America informs Citi via electronic straight through processing (STP). Citi Supplier Finance presents these payments, along with underlying remittance information such as invoices or purchase orders, to the suppliers, who gain critical visibility into future payments. Suppliers may choose to elect early payment on all or some of these payments, or simply be paid at normal maturity. On the AR due date, Citi takes the collection directly from Panalpina Latin America through its debit authority.</p>
<p>The technology put in place by Panalpina Latin America and Citi has delivered a highly efficient host-to-host payment system that achieves low operative costs and reduced manpower requirements. While initially only implemented in Colombia, the corporate treasury team has to come to recognise the value of this structure for the entire organisation and has rolled it out across Latin America.</p>
<p>Further benefits of the SCF programme include supporting suppliers’ working capital needs, which ensures continuity across supply chain sourcing. Suppliers’ AR can be converted into cash more rapidly; and they gain better access to alternative financing options and highly competitive funding rates which reduce their financing costs. By unifying supplier payments through Citi, Panalpina Latin America is also able to achieve greater negotiation control.</p>
<p>For the company, working capital ratios have increased through improved days payable outstanding (DPO), days sales outstanding (DSO), and days inventory outstanding (DIO). By increasing the efficiency of its working capital flows, Panalpina Latin America was able to improve its financial indicators by more than 100% in less than one year, becoming one of the first divisions in the region to achieve this milestone.</p>

<p>Eurosceptic populism is spreading across Europe. It may even be possible to speak of a trend that revolves around everything that is ‘anti’: anti-globalisation, anti-capitalist and anti-European. National governments are stuck for an answer when it comes to endemic problems, for example massive national debt, growing inequality and political polarisation. A systemic trust crisis undermines the legitimacy of national administrations, parliaments and European institutions – and renders them dysfunctional.</p>
<p>Tensions are mounting between advocates of cutbacks/reforms and champions of fiscal and monetary easing, as well as a lower burden of restructuring. For the moment, these points of view are miles apart but maybe not for much longer: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself is changing its tune and a growing number of economists are now coming out in favour of more stimulus. In the meantime, economic problems are on the increase in several core Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) states. The market response is hard to predict.</p>
<p>A positive scenario could unfold as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The core and periphery of the EMU agree on a new method for tackling the crisis. Fewer spending cuts will be implemented in the near term and the approach will make more sense (education, research, etc will be spared) as job market reforms continue and more markets are opened. In addition, Germany would accept higher wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The markets embrace fresh initiatives as the existing policies do not work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new methods for tackling the crisis bear fruit and growth picks up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The markets still appear to believe in a happy ending, yet such optimism could prove reckless. It is not possible to ignore the prospect that a negative scenario for the Eurozone will become reality.</p>
<h3 id=""five-scenarios"">Five scenarios</h3>
<p>In 2012, Thomas Wright of the think tank Brookings wrote a report entitled ‘What if Europe fails?’ In his view, things can go wrong in four different ways; to this list is added a fifth ‘doom scenario’:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Eurozone mistakenly thinks it can survive after ‘shedding’ one or more member states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under duress, the Eurozone continues to muddle on. Economic growth stays very sluggish and reforms are rarely carried out. Finally, markets have had enough. Soaring bond yields bring matters to a head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>European leaders agree on cutbacks and reforms. Subsequently, these are implemented. The effect is negligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At European level, states agree on ways to defuse the crisis but at national level the plans hit a brick wall composed of referendums, parliamentary opposition and rulings by the courts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owing to an economic shock, the entire house of cards collapses – for instance, new large-scale and unforeseen problems in the banking system, which spread like viruses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""trim-down-or-muddle-through"">Trim down or muddle through?</h3>
<p>To start with scenario one, it is not likely that the Eurozone will overestimate its resilience and think the exit of its members is no big deal. In recent years, the Eurozone has been beaten black and blue, and confidence is at a low ebb. In addition to various financial/economic factors, major (geo) political interests are at stake. This will prompt the leaders to make desperate attempts to keep the EMU intact.</p>
<p>Scenario two, or ‘muddling on’, may sound negative but has allowed the Eurozone to keep its head above water for quite some time. The Eurozone is very proficient at muddling through. At the same time, this strategy is fragile at best and may be approaching its sell-by date. It worked when Greece, Portugal and Ireland were about to plunge into the abyss, but now the markets have shifted their focus to the big players. If the market gets wind that Europe will wriggle out of imposing structural reforms on Italy, Spain and France, interest rates will rise quickly.</p>
<h3 id=""new-approach-doomed-to-failure"">New approach doomed to failure?</h3>
<p>Equally, the Eurozone can break apart if political leaders were to agree on new ways to tackle the crisis but these measures do not suffice (scenario three). The core and periphery are slightly more likely to find common ground now that many analysts, the media, economists and (national) politicians argue that cutbacks and reforms should be adapted – in terms of timing, scope and content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, politicians tend to spend political capital in the wrong order. Ideally, the government would start with structural reforms and then follow these up with (sensible) cutbacks. The latter are less desirable than reforms but better than tax increases, eg the third ‘remedy’ that could help the economies regain their health. Politicians are inclined to start with tax rises, which erode public support for cutbacks. Once they embark on structural reforms, the social base for change has all but crumbled.</p>
<p>Now the Eurozone is in such a bad way that only a combination of the aforementioned instruments could still save the day. Can the Eurozone strike a perfect balance between higher taxes, cutbacks and reforms? Particularly in the light of pervasive populism, growing disillusion among electorates, and steadily decreasing authority of the traditional political and European institutions. An effective cure seems unfeasible in a climate of structurally lower growth, ageing populations and increasing energy dependence. So even if the European political leaders finally manage to work out how to counter the euro crisis, the odds are they will fail.</p>
<h3 id=""national-obstructionists"">National obstructionists</h3>
<p>That leaves two other scenarios for a doomed Eurozone. Starting with the ‘national level scenario’ (scenario four), even if the European leaders come up with effective measures, they will need to ‘sell’ this package to their voters. Roughly speaking, three types of obstacles could hamper a solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>National parliaments are blocking progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referendums: ‘the people’ could well reject further European integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The judiciary, which could put a stop to European plans: Germany’s Constitutional Court was the focus of attention last year and recently the Constitutional Court of Portugal voted down austerity measures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""banks-and-lower-authorities-an-explosive-combination"">Banks and lower authorities: an explosive combination</h3>
<p>Finally, there is scenario five: a major economic shock that will shake the Eurozone to its foundations and/or tip it into the abyss. If such a script becomes reality, it will probably start with the financial sector or the lower authorities, which are still knee-deep in complicated derivatives and property that has greatly depreciated in value. As to the financial sector, the problems that started in 2007 have not yet been overcome. The financial sector and authorities are still – perhaps more than ever – intertwined.</p>
<p>Many regional and local governments are in dire straits. Local authorities have invested money hand over fist. Without the benefit of higher knowledge, they bought up complex derivatives and vast pieces of land, on the assumption that prices would go up. Of course, this has turned out to be an illusion.</p>
<p>If skeletons are discovered in the cupboards of regional Italy, at a bank of systemic importance in Spain or in a sizeable German Landesbank, this will have far reaching implications for the Eurozone and market panic could spread quickly.</p>
<h3 id=""success-not-guaranteed"">Success not guaranteed</h3>
<p>The above shows there is no guarantee that the Eurozone will find its feet again and defuse the crisis. Many analysts assume that Europe cannot fail, simply because they cannot imagine such a scenario. Political leaders, most of whom understand that a European bloc is imperative in a globalised world, will pull out all the stops to overcome the political hurdles. They do not want to be held responsible for the collapse of the European integration project, which has brought peace and prosperity for 60 years running.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the history of international relations is riddled with failures. Many of these were deemed unthinkable; the presumption was that the politicians would be too sensible to let things get out of hand. Take the (relatively small-scale) disaster of the US budget sequestration, or the cascade of calamities, unfortunate incidents, mounting tensions and narrow-minded leadership that led to World War I.</p>
<p>History is rife with developments and catastrophes that nobody wanted and that could have been prevented – and yet they still happened. Time has not yet run out for the Eurozone and Europe, but let us not underestimate the likelihood of accidental failure.</p>
<p>For now, markets are fairly sanguine. However, this mood is not compatible with the political-economic developments and prospects for Europe. Extremist parties are gaining in popularity, there has been pressure on the axis Paris-Berlin for quite some time, the UK is obstructing developments that are essential for progress, economic stats continue to disappoint, and nobody seems to have a visionary and inspiring plan for Europe that combines pragmatism, economic common sense and political ingenuity.</p>
<p>If disaster occurs, the reasons will most likely be a combination of the aforementioned scenarios: a major bank that collapses or a central government that needs to bail out an entire region or province. In response, the markets will become jittery as the politicians concoct yet another muddle-on strategy. However, there may well come a time when national parliaments start to revolt (under pressure from dissatisfied voters), or perhaps a Constitutional Court will refuse to play ball. As a result, the Eurozone will grind to a halt and unravel.</p>

Are a weak pound and yen here to stay?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Let’s start with the UK. Like the US, the UK has seen rampant indebtedness in recent decades against soaring asset prices. Once the bubble burst, asset prices plunged right away and a number of British banks needed large-scale government bailouts. This in itself was bad news for the financial sector. On top of this, the economy required fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p>As a result, the public finances did deteriorate so much that the rating institutes threatened to downgrade the UK’s credit rating. (They have done so once). The British government’s response was to tighten its fiscal policy, whereas it was obvious that the weak UK economy could barely cope with this.</p>
<p>To compensate, the central bank has pursued an ultra-loose monetary policy. However, this has not been very successful. Real growth never emerged and stagnation is the order of the day. Especially as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most UK consumers think they have taken out more than enough credit and many want to save up for their old age – not least because UK pension funds have large deficits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UK economy is very open. Wages have soared in the boom years, which is now a big problem, as the country has a large current account deficit. Presently, wages are not rising as fast as inflation, which means consumers are losing purchasing power. Plus the rest of Europe, which is in recession, is the UK’s main export market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UK’s financial sector comprises an important part of the total economy. However, this sector was – and is still being – reorganised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the UK too is caught between a rock and a hard place. To stop the economy from going further down the drain, the authorities are taking the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Bank of England (BoE) has launched a funding for lending programme. This implies that the central bank lends money cheaply to the banks, provided they use this for lending (except to the financial sector). Until now, this scheme has mainly helped to supply more mortgages, so it has not been very effective. Recently, the focus has shifted to other types of loans. This now appears to be working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is constant pressure on the BoE to open the money faucets further, in order to send asset prices higher and drive down sterling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to the latter, the central bank is struggling because inflation is high. This restricts its elbow room when it comes to flooding the system with liquidity (to offset the adverse effects of fiscal austerity and boost growth through asset inflation). It is hoped that a depreciating pound (GBP) will help the export sector. This would boost growth but the problem is that many other countries are also trying to weaken their currencies – for the same reason.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""japan-from-deflation-to-inflation"">Japan: from deflation to inflation?</h3>
<p>In Japan, the elephant in the room is deflation, which increases the debt burden. At first glance it would seem that Japan has plenty of latitude to open the monetary floodgates. This is misleading as its public finances are spiralling out of control, while the country has a large national debt and budget deficit. Nevertheless, the Japanese administration intends to expand its budget deficit in order to kick start the economy. This is a dangerous strategy, especially as the population is ageing rapidly, which will undermine the public finances.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a high risk that the markets will think that Japan is monetising its budget deficits. Such a policy amounts to a deliberate erosion of the purchasing power of the yen (JPY) at home and abroad. As a result, borrowing costs could start to skyrocket, which would be calamitous to the government finances. Fortunately, things have not reached that point yet; lately, interest rates have dropped. In the immediate future, we can expect the following factors to influence Japanese interest rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Bank of Japan (BoJ) will purchase more bonds and, in all likelihood, longer-dated bonds as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The external value of the JPY will not quickly be eroded, as many other countries want cheaper domestic currencies as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same goes for the internal value, due to persistent deflation. The government wants to achieve 2% inflation as rapidly as possible but virtually no one thinks wages in Japan will rise substantially. As a result, higher prices will eat into consumer spending power. Such a drag on the economy will cap inflation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, everything will change if the Japanese start to borrow against rising asset prices. As in the US, it would be much better if Japan would quickly implement structural measures, so growth could improve on a permanent basis. However, this is unlikely in view of the systemic failure of politics in Japan, where a stalemate has been in place for years. Like the UK, Japan is putting all its money on one horse: the depreciation of the JPY. The other side of the coin is that Japan needs to import most of its raw materials – this will become more expensive as the JPY continues to weaken.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, both the JPY and GBP have shown a substantial decline against the dollar (-10% for the JPY; -8% for the GBP). After an upward correction, both currencies are expected to depreciate further against the dollar as a result of more monetary stimulus and subdued growth prospects due to high debt levels. In addition, the dollar should strengthening further.</p>
<p>On a relative basis, US growth prospects are better than those in Europe or Japan. This will attract more capital inflows to the US. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve will face growing pressure to tighten monetary policy to avoid a surge in inflation. This will contribute to an expected rise in USD/JPY toward 120 and a fall in GBP/USD to 1.35.</p>

Will Germany push the ECB to play its role in the currency wars?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In some ways the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), in its current guise, resembles the gold standard between World Wars I and II. Every member state has pegged its (nominal) currency to the euro and cannot print extra money. In theory, this should not pose a problem, provided the economic cycles are in sync. The latter would allow the European Central Bank (ECB) to attune its monetary policy to the EMU as a whole.</p>
<p>In reality, many economic cycles are out of step. And since the introduction of the euro, the imbalances have increased. For example, asset prices and credit supply have barely boomed in several strong EMU countries (particularly in Germany), if at all.</p>
<p>Following the adoption of the single currency, Germany implemented substantial structural reforms (under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder) in order to improve the growth prospects of the economy. When this process started, the country was known as the ‘sick man of Europe’ and German interest rates were low in European terms. The country also managed to avoid credit bubbles. Subsequently, Germany reaped the benefits of this restructuring – it became Europe’s growth engine.</p>
<h3 id=""divergence-within-the-monetary-union"">Divergence within the monetary union</h3>
<p>Between the introduction of the euro and the eruption of the credit crisis, economic growth blossomed in what are now identified as the weak Eurozone countries, where asset prices rose as interest rates fell (towards the level of bond yields in Germany). Here, borrowing mushroomed, especially for consumption purposes. One outcome was that trade deficits widened while the economies started to depend more and more on domestic sectors that were not greatly exposed to international competition (for example construction, the public sector and local consumption). High growth meant that the politicians barely saw the need for structural reforms. As labour costs rose, the countries in question lost competitiveness and their trade balance continued to deteriorate.</p>
<p>After the credit crisis broke out, the debt-based growth in the weak countries collapsed. At the same time, a decline in global trade activity undermined the German economy. More recently however, trade has improved around the world. As a result, things are looking up for Germany. Yet the situation in the peripheral EMU countries is worse than ever. They desperately need to regain competitiveness and can only grow through exports; the domestic economies continue to shrink (due to fiscal consolidation and deleveraging in the private sector).</p>
<h3 id=""easy-way-out-or-the-bitter-pill"">Easy way out or the bitter pill?</h3>
<p>Theoretically and from a macroeconomic standpoint, Europe’s problem countries can boost competitiveness in two ways. The first option is structural reforms, which underpin productivity and drive down labour costs. The second option would be a looser monetary policy, leading to a cheaper currency.</p>
<p>The struggling Eurozone countries place their hopes on the second option – a looser monetary policy, as this would reduce the need to carry out painful reforms; in addition lower wages make the debt burden more unbearable. An additional problem is that other major countries’ central banks are easing their policies. Unless the ECB follows suit, the euro will end up as one of the strongest currencies. This is an anomaly, as the EMU is in an economic quagmire, and it is bad news for competitiveness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Germany wants the debt-laden member states to implement structural reforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It knows from experience that these work well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany envisages the EMU as an integrated union in terms of fiscal policy, banking and politics. In addition, Berlin wants the members of such a (future) union to be financially healthy, competitive and self-sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monetary easing is not the solution. On the one hand, it would take away the incentive for the ailing member states to execute the required structural reforms. On top of this, it would expose Germany to higher inflation risks, which is something the country wants to avoid at any cost.</p>

<h3 id=""germany-in-charge"">Germany in charge</h3>
<p>Germany is Europe’s strongest economy and the main capital provider for the peripheral EMU countries. By and large it rules the roost in the EMU. As a result, its ‘dependents’ meekly swallow the bitter ‘German medicine’ of cutbacks and structural reforms. Mainly under German pressure, the ECB is pursuing a policy that aims to prevent a liquidity crisis and break-up of the EMU. Unlike the Federal Reserve in the US and the Bank of England (BoE), it is not aiming to boost asset prices and/or growth. Yet it remains to be seen how much longer the ECB can adopt this strategy.</p>
<p>Clearly, the peripheral EMU countries are fighting a losing battle. The German remedy focuses on improved competitiveness. However, this aggravates the economic misery (rising unemployment, an ongoing contraction, more poverty, emigration and so on). At the same time, the intended effect – higher economic growth as a result of higher exports – does not materialise because the euro is too expensive.</p>
<p>Another analogy with the gold standard in the 1930s is that those economies that adhere to the standard the longest (ie pursue the least accommodative monetary policy), will suffer the most. A growth slump in peripheral Europe over a prolonged period means that the populations will be more inclined to listen to politicians who advocate an exit from the EMU. One consequence would be that the new currency of the country in question will be much cheaper than the euro, while its national central bank can pursue a much looser monetary policy. At first, the economy will be hit hard but there are various examples of countries that found their feet after a devaluation of their domestic currency (such as Iceland).</p>
<h3 id=""will-ecb-give-in-to-pressure"">Will ECB give in to pressure?</h3>
<p>The strong EMU countries, Germany included, do not think this is a desirable scenario. As soon as one country crosses this bridge, investors will expect the other problem countries to follow suit and remove their capital on a massive scale. This will place huge upward pressure on bond yields; many banks will end up in deep trouble. In the first instance, the ECB can take countermeasures. If so, the struggling states could quickly become ‘addicted to financial heroin’, and it will only be a matter of time before the EMU disintegrates.</p>
<p>This would be very unfortunate. The EMU is much stronger if it acts collectively vis-à-vis the economic blocs that are forming around the US, China and India.</p>
<p>These drawbacks, plus Germany’s wish to proceed with a more united Europe, will put pressure on the ECB to pursue a looser monetary policy. The ECB will not need to say aloud that it uses monetary easing as an instrument to drive down the euro. Also because the ongoing recession in peripheral Europe will put downward pressure on inflation (which has largely risen on the back of higher taxes in any case).</p>
<p>If the recession persists in the weak Eurozone countries, deflation will loom larger. Therefore the ECB has every reason to ease its policy. In combination with better growth perspectives for the US economy (see also ECR’s recent reports on the Global Financial Markets) this could result in more capital flows from the EMU to the US over the coming quarters, which will put downward pressure on EUR/USD.</p>

Doomsday inflation?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>At first glance, this quote from Christine Bogdanowicz-Bindert on the impact of the debt crisis seems very apt. However, the above citation is far from recent. The words were uttered in 1985, when debt crises erupted in Latin America and Africa. Attentive readers may have noticed already that this quote has no bearing on the crisis that started in 2008. So Europe (in particular) has been muddling through for five years already, while the US has lost millions of jobs, instead of a million. That is to say, the present crisis is far worse. In addition, in the 1980s, the major countries (or blocs) – the US, Japan and Europe – could still extend a helping hand to the ‘small fry’, now they themselves are hit. And, unlike Mexico and the other troubled countries 30 years ago, they face a daunting obstacle: demographic ageing.</p>
<h3 id=""fiat-money-fatally-flawed"">Fiat money fatally flawed?</h3>
<p>Doom-mongers believe politicians will choose the easy way out and put pressure on central banks to crank up the printing presses. If so, inflation will rise, ie the size of the debt mountain will decrease in real terms. The inflation scaremongers often point to the weakness of the (international) monetary system, because it is based on fiat (soft) money. The pessimists think a monetary system based on fiat money will rarely, if ever, exist for long because hyperinflation is inevitable.</p>
<p>The first use of fiat money was chronicled as early as the 10<sup>th</sup> Century AD when the Song Dynasty in China issued paper money that remained valid for three years. Subsequently, it could be converted into new money, at a cost of 3%. In the long run, too many notes were issued whereas not enough ‘old money’ was handed in. Inflation hit and the fiat money lost its appeal.</p>

<p>Next, the Yuan Dynasty issued paper money on a large scale in the 13<sup>th</sup> Century. Eventually, the regime printed far too many notes and hyperinflation reared its ugly head. Still, the Yuan money was used for quite a long time and only abolished in 1455 by the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id=""horror-and-success-stories"">Horror and success stories</h3>
<p>Fiat money made its entry into the western societies in the 17<sup>th</sup> Century, first in Sweden and the Netherlands, and then later in America in the 18<sup>th</sup> Century. The so-called Continentals, issued after the start of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), are a case in point for those who believe that fiat money is a nightmare. Owing to a lack of co-ordination between Congress and the individual states, not to mention sabotage by the British (who printed heaps of counterfeit money), within a few years the notes were one-fortieth of their nominal value.</p>
<p>Yet such horror stories are but one side of the coin. At the end of the 17<sup>th</sup> Century in the Netherlands, the Amsterdam Wisselbank (AWB) created a successful fiat money regime that existed for over a century. It slowly bled to death and went under as a result of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in 1780.</p>
<p>In 1862, the US notes, also known as greenbacks, were introduced in order to fund the American Civil War. In its original form, the greenback was a fiat currency that was issued until 1971. The greenback hovered between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ until fiat money became the norm. In other words, the idea that in all cases fiat money is doomed to an early failure should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<h3 id=""hard-money-far-from-perfect"">Hard money far from perfect</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, hard money is also far from plain sailing. Several economists blame the gold standard for both World Wars. The (indirect) gold standard that was introduced after World War II was abolished in 1971, when US President Nixon decided that dollars could no longer be converted into gold.</p>
<p>So monetary systems built around fiat money may not be inherently stable, but gold standards can be fickle too. Whatever the nature of the money, rash political actions and/or waning investors and consumer confidence can prompt a disastrous spiral leading to hyperinflation, recessions and in the worst case, war.</p>
<p>So far, we have not seen such a spiral. However, anxiety is growing that the US, Europe and Japan will crank up the money presses and opt for competitive devaluations. It remains to be seen if holders of dollar debt will continue to believe in the US currency and the creditworthiness of the US government if the Federal Reserve conjures money out of thin air in order to reduce the debt. This is the same story for the Eurozone and Japan.</p>

<h3 id=""imagining-the-unimaginable"">Imagining the unimaginable</h3>
<p>Presently, it is still almost inconceivable that the markets would lose all faith in US, European and Japanese government securities. But that does not mean it couldn’t happen. In 1961, Robert Mundell – one of the most respected and influential monetary economists the world has known – wrote that “it hardly appears within the realm of political feasibility that national currencies would ever be abandoned in favour of any other agreement.” Yet a few decades later the European leaders did precisely that when they decided to introduce the single currency.</p>
<p>So we should think twice before labelling certain developments as “impossible“. Take the run-up to World War I. In 1914, markets were convinced that war was out of the question because countries were interconnected economically and therefore mutually dependent. Panic only broke out after the first shots were fired.</p>
<p>Over the past Century, the international financial system has collapsed twice: in the 1930s and the 1970s. The first time, the outcome was catastrophic. The second time, no world war broke out but the rate of inflation soared until it was contained, around the end of the decade, by Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.</p>
<h3 id=""positivism-will-not-last"">Positivism will not last</h3>
<p>Should politicians decide to drive up inflation in order to tackle the structural problems, and the markets hit the roof, this could result in a long period of high inflation that will eventually be brought under control. This is the more optimistic prognosis. At worst, political tensions will rise quickly as states try to steal a march on each other through devaluations, inflation policies and trade wars. If so, we can only hope that the calamities of the last century are still fresh in the collective memory – otherwise a doom scenario may well occur.</p>
<p>For the moment, the markets are giving the politicians the benefit of the doubt. The US, Japan and the ‘strong’ EMU countries are borrowing at record low interest rates, inflation is still low and there are no currency wars or large-scale protectionism. The Eurozone crisis has, momentarily, calmed down.</p>
<p>The general sense of optimism may persist for another while but eventually we expect mounting Eurozone tensions, a deepening political struggle in the US, more geopolitical unrest in Asia, and continuous instability in the Middle East. In addition, the major players in the global economy will continue to face gigantic fiscal problems that are more difficult to solve because of the impact of aging populations.</p>
<p>We should monitor closely what happens in Japan as Europe and the US may be forced to go down the same road. Japan’s national debt amounts to 230% of GDP; its population is ageing rapidly. Instead of tackling the problems, debts are stacked up to the heavens. It will be increasingly hard to pay these off, as the ratio between the number of workers and the number of retirees (who are living longer than ever) is in decline. Many fear that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to pull Japan from the quicksand through higher inflation and a depreciation of the yen. But how far will he be prepared to go? Are Europe and the US doomed to follow suit? The answers to these questions will determine how the financial markets fare in the medium and long term.</p>

Central banks don’t ‘control’ EUR/USD,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The fact that EUR/USD is, at the time of writing this Market View, still in the 1.30 region is remarkable. After all, purchasing power parity (a yardstick many economists use to determine the equilibrium level for exchange rates) is normally estimated to be in the region of 1.10, so the euro is well above that level. How can that be if there are even doubts as to the survival of the European currency and the European economy is in a recession, while the US economy is growing?</p>
<p>Naturally, the US has a fairly high deficit on the current account, even if it is rather smaller than before. In the past that was often overshadowed by capital influx from abroad, which is something one would expect now, in view of the improved outlook for the US economy. Moreover, the US has the great advantage of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A far more flexible labour market and economy, as well as a more favourable business climate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prospect of oil and gas production increasing enormously in the coming years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Far less of a rise in unit labour costs over the past decade than in Europe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""the-central-banks-approach"">The central bank’s approach</h3>
<p>Taking all this into account, EUR/USD should logically be below, rather than above, 1.10. However, there appears to be one factor that is overshadowing all this: the central bank’s approach. When the credit crisis broke out, Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, immediately realised that, without large-scale government and central bank intervention, the US economy would fall into a deep depression. The Fed therefore initially lowered short-term interest rates to 0%, but when that failed to help sufficiently, it also actively suppressed long-term interest rates.</p>
<p>The central bank had already lowered interest rates so far, however, that investors could only earn a reasonable return by taking increasing risks. That resulted in narrowing credit spreads and rising stock prices. The Fed is now also attempting to boost the housing market and housing prices by lowering mortgage interest rates as far as possible.</p>
<p>The advantage of all this is that consumer balance sheets improve, so consumers can start borrowing more again. However, in view of the enormous debt mountain accumulated in the past, this is proving to be a slow process, particularly now that the government has to reduce budget deficits even before debts in the private sector have been reduced to any great degree. (Moreover, much of the reduction that has taken place so far is the result of bankruptcies. Many of those involved will therefore be unable to borrow any more for the time being.)</p>
<h3 id=""inflation-threatens"">Inflation threatens</h3>
<p>The great risk of this monetary tactic is that the enormous quantity of extra money will cause a high inflation risk as soon as credit activity picks up. That can only be avoided by promptly withdrawing the extra money from the system.</p>

<p>Central banks often have the greatest difficulty in doing this in time, however, but they are also faced with the problem that once they remove money from the system, asset prices start falling. Losses on loans extended in the past then immediately mount, so banks start lending less and growth slows again. In other words: what this tactic amounts to is postponing the problems to the future. There is no point in doing that unless the government uses the time ‘bought’ to take structural measures for increasing the economy’s growth potential. The Fed views this fairly optimistically, though.</p>
<p>Most Fed members feel that if they are too late in withdrawing the money from the system and inflation rises, they are quite capable of fighting inflation. They are far more confident in doing that than in fighting deflation. They are not so concerned about the resulting fall in asset prices.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has other views – particularly when it comes to Germany. The Germans are terrified that once inflation starts rising, it will be almost impossible to stop.</p>

<p>They believe that this will hit asset prices – and therefore the economy – so hard that the central bank will not even begin to fight inflation. This has created the strange situation where, although the US economy is growing more rapidly and is in a better position than the economy in Europe, the Fed is prepared to loosen monetary policy much further than the ECB. The ECB is also far more concerned that if it opens the liquidity taps even further, politicians will only use that as an opportunity to postpone further structural measures that are generally unpopular. The net effect of further monetary loosening then becomes entirely negative. Finally, the fact that governments in Europe are more inclined than the US government to reduce budget deficits by hiking excise and consumer taxes also plays a role – they (temporarily) increase inflation.</p>
<h3 id=""aggressive-fed-policy"">Aggressive Fed policy</h3>
<p>A situation has therefore arisen in which the Fed is following a more aggressive monetary policy than the ECB, while Europe is in a recession and the US is not. Moreover, fiscal policy is being tightened less in the US than in Europe.</p>
<p>That is the main reason why EUR/USD is at around 1.30 rather than below 1.10. It looks as if this situation will continue for the time being. There is one snag, though: if the Fed loosens monetary policy further – and therefore creates more money – that does not necessarily mean that the total money supply in the US will grow more rapidly.</p>
<p>After all, the extra money the central bank creates only represents a small percentage of the total money supply. The rest is created through credit activity. If credit activity declines, then the total money supply can still shrink or grow considerably more slowly despite the fact that the central bank is creating a great deal more money.</p>
<p>This is extremely important, as it is the difference between the growth of the total money supply in the US and Europe, in particular, that affects EUR/USD. In other words, if EUR/USD is still far above its purchasing power parity while the situation is worse in Europe, then that is chiefly because the total money supply is growing more rapidly in the US than in Europe. However, this is only possible when the US economy is picking up and borrowing increases.</p>
<p>There remain a number of major obstacles for US credit activity to expand more rapidly. The effects of ageing, uncertainty regarding future fiscal policy, stagnating real incomes and high unemployment will limit consumers’ and companies’ willingness to borrow more and therefore will remain subdued. If this will be the case and consumers even continue deleveraging, then the central bank can create as much money as its likes, but there will be little or no increase in the total money supply (the central bank cannot continue creating money indefinitely, either, due to the future inflation threat). The economy then remains weak and sentiment is therefore risk off. Stocks and EUR/USD will then fall, something we expect to happen in the course of this year.</p>

Calculated prophecies,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The past decade has seen the evolution of the role of the treasurer from an almost administrative position towards more of a coordinator role, that is expected today. “In the past few years, treasurers have played the role of coordinator, particularly with areas like finance, tax and IT. They have been the centre of expertise and connect back to the lifeblood of the company, which is cash flow and managing liquidity,” says Steve Dwyre, Managing Director, Industrials and TMT at Lloyds Banking Group.</p>
<p>Yet now treasurers are making another transition. From this coordinator stance, the treasurer is being drawn on to play a much more strategic part in the firm – the heart of the business so to speak – deferred to by the CFO and participating in Board meetings more than they have ever done before. As the profile of the treasurer continues to grow, the number of talented professionals from a banking background who are choosing corporate treasury as a career choice is also rising, according to Stuart Ridley, Manager – Treasury at Robert Walters Recruitment.</p>
<p>As a senior figure, and an expert across many fields, the objectives of the treasurer are therefore shaping many of the trends that we can see coming down the road in 2013. As they juggle many balls of responsibility, the treasurer must respond to economic developments and regulatory changes, while also grabbing growth opportunities with both hands. The decisions they make are driving the industry forward.</p>
<h3 id=""a-game-of-risk"">A game of risk</h3>
<p>Risk management is one of the areas in which treasurers have recently proved to be strong coordinators. Now often part of the risk committee, the treasurer may assist the banking partner with stress scenarios and management planning, taking the treasury function to the next strategic level. In this new, more involved approach, treasurers are being asked to present the Board with innovative solutions for counterparty risk analysis that goes beyond credit default swap (CDS) spreads and public ratings.</p>
<p>As they’re the ones liaising with the banks, treasurers understand the ratings and counterparty analysis processes, affirms Rajesh Mehta, EMEA Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi Transaction Services. “They are increasingly being seen as ‘the risk manager’, which in many corporate organisations is not a designated function per se. Whether it is with bank counterparty risk, credit ratings or potential sovereign default – treasurers get involved in all key stages of the risk management process. And investment committees are looking to treasurers to meet their risk management threshold.”</p>
<p>Naturally, scenario planning amid the Eurozone crisis has been employed and analysed on all fronts as market participants look to protect their capital, but Mehta believes that there is also a focus on guaranteeing business continuity. “The more evolved participants are taking prudential measures to ensure there are contingency measures in place – how ready is your bank to provide the necessary service if there’s a disruption?”</p>
<p>From a risk perspective, the way the treasury operates and how it is managed will only continue to rise in importance. This is currently reflected in the upgrade of the risk management capabilities of treasury departments – in both financial institutions and in the larger corporates, according to Rohan Douglas, CEO at Quantifi. “Given the turmoil in the financial marketplace, institutions are subject to a lot more volatility which is driving an increased focus on more accurate valuations and more comprehensive risk management.”</p>
<!-- nextpage -->
<h3 id=""supply-chain-support"">Supply chain support</h3>
<p>In these uncertain times, corporates can face difficulties as regards credit lines and liquidity that they rely upon for the operation of their business. Treasurers, therefore, are aware of the importance of working capital and maximising the internal working capital resources. Treasurers are now much more the arbiters of working capital across the firm, says Mehta. “Most treasurers tend to act as the bank relationship arm of finance within the firm and are now preaching the value and importance of working capital and optimising internal capital.”</p>
<p>As for where the specific impact of working capital can be seen, the corporate treasurer is getting involved with their supply chain on a much more strategic level. “Treasurers know that companies, especially those who are focusing on emerging markets growth, have to optimise their supply chain in order to successfully grow, otherwise any weak link or potential disruption could become a constraining factor,” he says.</p>
<p>But for those corporates that may only have had lukewarm interest in supply chain finance (SCF) programmes previously, Lloyd’s Dwyre reports that the UK government in particular has been ‘encouraging’ companies to employ better strategies which will benefit suppliers and bolster the economy at large. “A lot of CEOs and chairmen are being pressured – especially if they have a portion of sales to the government – to go to their supply chain and help them. This has encouraged a tremendous upsurge in interest in SCF,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""show-me-the-money"">Show me the money</h3>
<p>It’s no revelation that the interest rate environment for treasurers at the moment is extremely low. But the operational benefits of the investment and management of their respective funds is starting to become a challenge, according to Simon Jones, Head of Corporate Sales for Treasury Services EMEA at J.P. Morgan. “Corporates are beginning to wonder if having all their money with different banks, in addition to using money market funds (MMFs), is actually worth the amount of effort they put in, bearing in mind the poor returns. Considering the number of complex instruments employed, not to mention the regulatory changes in the MMF arena too, they are looking for efficiency and yield. This is driving innovation for simple deposit products that generate returns comparable to placing funds out on term deposit on a regular basis.”</p>
<p>Another theme that will continue to be high on the agenda next year, in this instance as a result of pressure under stringent Basel III criteria, is intraday liquidity, according to Ruth Wandhöfer, Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy at Citi Transaction Services. “Solutions to improve corporates’ use of liquidity will help in this respect, but banks themselves will need to find ways to better monitor and allocate liquidity usage. Pricing of intraday liquidity will become a more prominent area of discussion given the fact that liquidity constitutes an increasing cost to banks. This is further accentuated by the fact that Basel aims to discourage access to intraday wholesale liquidity and instead more liquidity is expected to be held by banks at all times.”</p>
<p>Banks are looking at the implications these regulations will have for corporates as regards investment and interest rates, says J.P. Morgan’s Jones. “Operating liquidity balances are becoming more appealing to banks as they are reflected more favourably in their liquidity ratios from a Basel III perspective. This again is really driving banks to look at new products for corporates. The aim is to simplify products for corporates and achieve high yields for them where their balances are operating balances – that is to say daily debits and credits.”</p>
<h3 id=""technology-rules"">Technology rules</h3>
<p>Treasurers’ objectives – driving efficiency in working capital and managing risk – are also driving the technology agenda. The challenge for banks in the current environment therefore, according to Citi’s Mehta, is satisfying this demand for innovation while also adhering to the mandatory regulatory demands, such as SEPA, Dodd-Frank, Basel, reporting, etc.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan is upgrading all of its wholesale clients globally to the next generation of ACCESS Online, its electronic banking portal for treasury operations. The new platform includes integrated payment and reporting capabilities and user administration that will save treasurers’ time, while simultaneously improving their control environment, according to the bank. It will also include a new online user community where corporate clients can interact with their peers to acquire knowledge and leverage their experiences.</p>
<!-- nextpage -->

<h3 id=""sepa-is-coming"">SEPA is coming</h3>
<p>According to Wandhöfer, “the single euro payments area (SEPA) will need to be progressed towards compliance (end-date for migration in Eurozone is February 2014) and corporates are encouraged to get SEPA-ready with their respective banking partners. The Payment Services Directive (PSD) in Europe will be reviewed and a sequel is expected to be proposed by the EU Commission in April 2013.”</p>
<p>Next year is really going to be a critical year for corporates to decide what they are going to do to make the changes in order to be SEPA-compliant. Jones believes that corporates are starting to realise savings already, with pricing changes acknowledged thus far in markets like France, Italy and Spain with the existing legacy systems. Corporates are wondering how to become fully SEPA-compliant in order to realise the full extent of the benefits and cost savings on a pan-European basis before the 2014 deadline. But while a considerable portion of corporates are compliant with the payables side (SEPA Credit Transfers take up is currently at approximately 30%), much of the receivables side has not been converted (SEPA Direct Debit is at approximately 1%). “The biggest challenge to SEPA compliance is that the finance and treasury departments have not fully tackled the receivables side, as this conversion project requires a lot of time and strategy planning. It requires the involvement of the broader business and a change of management process across the entire organisation – a huge task for any business.”</p>
<p>“More and more clients therefore are actually moving towards a payment factory model – centralising all their payables and receivables in one place, so that they adopt a SEPA-compliant process through the one entity.”</p>

<p>Mobile is one area that seems to be going from strength to strength in the corporate arena. Since Citi launched CitiDirect® BE mobile, the mobile extension of its electronic banking system, last year, it has implemented the solution in 87 countries and accumulatively completed $10 billion in transaction value through the mobile channel. The advantage of mobile as an efficiency enabler for treasurers needing to conduct business while on the road is widely known, but there is now a more basic demographic trend that the banks must cater for. Mehta says: “We are seeing a convergence between the personal technology that is used by the average consumer and the expectation that corporate interaction shouldn’t be any less convenient. Treasurers are now expecting the same digital interface in their working environment.”</p>
<p>Corporates are looking for more flexible software that provides high performance and the development of technologies including multicore architectures are helping provide this. According to Quantifi’s Douglas, leveraging Intel’s multicores CPUs allows software to run much faster on what is now industry standard hardware. “To further simplify their IT infrastructure, more companies are also looking to introduce a hosting model and cloud computing. The ability to leverage computational power on demand and rent hardware on an as-needed basis, in addition to running calculations out on a cloud, has a lot of interesting applications in the financial arena where often computational requirements peak during certain times of the day.”</p>
<p>But the world of technology is fast paced. According to Dwyre, the industry has moved on from simply having a web and a cloud into a new world of ‘sensors’, which are becoming smaller and more ubiquitous in everyday life. “Linked to the cloud, sensory data that exists in the real world suddenly becomes available to the consumer and the business world. How sensors react to all the data that is being collected and how that data is used is the important part.” A concrete example of this is Lloyds Bank’s creation of the Arena platform, from which a treasurer can see every balance in every bank account and can even transact its foreign exchange (FX) across this one system that connects everything – no longer do they need to rely on a system that only the bank can access.</p>
<p>Many companies over the past few years have spent vast quantities of money on a treasury management system (TMS) or an enterprise resource planning system (ERP), but this buoyant market naturally tailed off when budgets were cut. Although a corporate might need a TMS or ERP, they could be holding out on implementation until they can spare the funds. But new providers are coming to the market who can actually offer the required system on a bit-by-bit basis, according to Robert Walters’ Ridley. “Two or three segments from the entire system might be absolutely essential to you, and you can pick and choose these to your specification. This is much more attractive to cash-strapped corporates than paying for an all singing, all dancing system that you are only using a fraction of.”</p>
<!-- nextpage -->
<h3 id=""opportunities-and-optimism"">Opportunities and optimism?</h3>
<p>For many corporates, the challenges of expansion into emerging markets can be daunting but the opportunities for growth are significant. Not a decision to be broached lightly because it has fundamental implications for the company’s business strategy and operating model, and risk management capabilities need to be assessed. Firms are nonetheless looking for advice on how best to make this move. Says J.P. Morgan’s Jones: “The scale and growth that corporates are seeing in markets such as China, India, Russia, Brazil, South Africa and Saudi Arabia means that an increasing number of expansion projects are going to be completed by European corporates. Naturally these ambitious firms will require the appropriate assistance as they make this transition, but the scalability of multinationals’ treasury operations in these regions is going to be very important in 2013.”</p>
<p>This invites another trend in the way of recruitment as treasurers for those multinationals will be spending a good deal of time on talent and staffing, according to Citi’s Mehta. While the focus is very much on efficiency and productivity, these companies also need to concentrate on growing their treasury teams. “This agenda can be a bit of a struggle. There are people who understand the corporate philosophy at head office but not the emerging markets, and vice versa. There is a huge amount of connectivity that’s required between the two worlds. And the numbers of candidates that can bridge the two worlds effectively are few.”</p>
<p>Despite the relatively stagnant treasury recruitment market as many professionals prepare to ride out the economic storm before making any sort of move, Ridley believes that many senior treasury professionals are now open to opportunities in the emerging markets and are looking for a new challenge. “Because the exposures in these regions are significant and the potential for market growth is so huge, treasurers are attracted by these potential opportunities. Businesses in these emerging markets will receive the most investment and their treasury teams will expand, which will further entice people to move.”</p>

Internationalisation of the renminbi – challenges and aspirations,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the previous issue of Treasury Today in China, we provided an overview of the renminbi cross-border trade settlement pilot scheme. In this Business Briefing, we take a more in depth look at the issues facing those companies who are considering switching to renminbi as a trade settlement currency. We also look at the role that renminbi trade settlement plays in the larger scheme of internationalising the renminbi.</p>
<h3 id=""introduction"">Introduction</h3>
<p>China’s growing economic integration with the rest of the world is changing the way that companies in China do business, both within the country itself, and internationally. Moreover, significant pressure is being placed on the renminbi through the country’s rapid growth. As a result of this, Chinese importers and exporters are facing increasingly significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility.</p>
<p>“Government policy is therefore to move progressively towards internationalisation of the renminbi, encouraging its adoption as an international trade currency,” says Lisa Robins, Managing Director &amp; Vice Chairman, China, Treasury and Securities Services, J.P. Morgan. “A cautious and phased approach to internationalisation of the renminbi is also consistent with the Chinese government’s habit of careful, measured development.” The pilot programme for cross-border trade settlement in renminbi, is a significant step towards the goal of renminbi internationalisation.</p>

<h4 id=""programme-snapshot"">Programme snapshot</h4>
<p>The Ministry of Commerce officially launched China’s first pilot scheme for RMB cross-border trade settlement in July 2009. The pilot programme originally allowed selected companies, known as mainland designated enterprises or MDEs, in five cities across China (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zuhai, Shenzhen and Dongguan) to invoice and settle trade transactions in RMB. These locations were carefully chosen by the Chinese authorities as these are particularly active cities in terms of imports and exports.</p>
<p>Initially, the programme was only available for trades taking place between those designated cities and Hong Kong, and Macau but this was quickly extended to include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The PBOC has announced a new regulation to expand the pilot scheme to cover 20 provinces and municipalities in China as well as all countries/locations outside of China.</p>
<p>In addition, all eligible enterprises registered in pilot cities will be able to use the renminbi for cross-border settlement of both trade goods and services (previously only goods were permitted). Pilot enterprises approved by the PBoC who use the renminbi in cross-border goods export trading, will also now be able to benefit from an exported goods tax rebate (exemption) policy.</p>

<h3 id=""evolution-of-rmb-cross-border-settlement"">Evolution of RMB cross-border settlement</h3>
<p>Before the pilot programme began, those mainland companies that were large enough to command a certain level of negotiating power were able to price their sales in renminbi. While the sales were priced in local currency however, the overseas buyer would usually settle the transaction in foreign currency, at an agreed exchange rate. Sometimes, even letters of credit were being issued in renminbi, but being settled in foreign currency. So the basis for an official programme was already in existence. The pilot scheme has taken things one step further, providing a formalised framework.</p>
<p>On 22<sup>nd</sup> June 2010, the Chinese government expanded the scope of the RMB cross-border settlement programme, removing many of the initial restrictions. This included expanding the corporate participants list. More corporates are now able to settle their exports in RMB and any corporate in the designated 16 provinces and four municipalities across China can settle their imports, service trades and current account transactions in RMB with counterparties globally.</p>
<p>Similarly, RMB payments from overseas can now be made into China for merchandise trade, service trade and all other current account activities. Removal of such restrictions has already brought benefits to corporates based onshore, such as a reduction in FX risk, since transactions are now settled in local currency, and yet have the same eligibility for export tax rebate incentives.</p>
<p>For those companies considering a switch to settling trade transactions in renminbi, a checklist of points to consider is provided below:</p>

<h4 id=""should-we-switch-to-settling-in-renminbi"">Should we switch to settling in renminbi? A checklist for CEOs and CFOs.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are the transactions concerned intercompany or with third parties? Converting to renminbi settlement will be easier in the former case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do payables and receivables in renminbi roughly match each other? If so, this limits the risk of retaining renminbi on hand with limited investment vehicles, and foreign exchange exposure incurred in buying renminbi to settle future trades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the company expects to receive more renminbi than it needs to pay, might it be more sensible to use USD instead of renminbi to settle the ‘unmatched’ amount?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the company expects to pay more renminbi than it receives, what hedging tools can be used to reduce foreign exchange risk, such as buying renminbi in the future?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could a ‘re-invoicing centre’ based in one of the eligible countries for renminbi settlement be set up to act as the only counterparty for all trades with China?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the banking partner selected for renminbi settlement have the necessary expertise? Can it provide a consistent client experience for renminbi settlement, for example internet banking interface, client service model etc? Can it clear renminbi quickly enough?</p>

<p>Both Robins and Xu agree that further liberalisation of the scheme is the way forward in terms of growing renminbi trade settlement volumes. However, they also believe that the RMB cross-border trade pilot programme should be as a stepping stone on the way to the internationalisation of the renminbi, rather than a complete solution. So, what remains to be done?</p>
<h3 id=""the-liquidity-challenge"">The liquidity challenge</h3>
<p>According to Xu, a key barrier to the development of the renminbi into a genuine international trade currency remains: the issue of liquidity. “At present, there is a very limited international market in the currency, and hardly any investment products or hedging tools exist,” says Xu. “This means, for example, that a supplier into China, persuaded to trade in renminbi by the customer, will face receiving renminbi which he can do little with other than place on deposit with limited return.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since China is such a large scale producer of raw materials including oil and gas, it is possible that these renminbi receipts could amount to several million – so the numbers are by no means insignificant. Xu explains that, “Without adequate renminbi liquidity, most suppliers into China will remain reluctant to accept the currency, except in the lucky – and extremely unlikely – circumstance that they can be recycled one-for-one for Chinese purchases.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the absence of hedging ability is particularly important given that forecasts are predicting a significant appreciation in the renminbi, certainly over the coming years. As such, an overseas customer who commits to a long-term purchase agreement with a supplier in China, such as a programme of major equipment purchases which takes place over three-to-five years, has no way of offsetting the probable increase in their future payment obligations.</p>
<p>“Internationalisation of the Chinese currency therefore faces something of a chicken-and-egg situation,” says Robins. She explains that on the one hand, full development of interbank activity, together with international currency trading, renminbi investment and hedging products cannot take off until the renminbi becomes a true international trade currency. On the other hand, full internationalisation of the renminbi cannot happen until China’s overseas trading partners have alternatives to invest or hedge the currency.</p>
<h3 id=""overcoming-hurdles"">Overcoming hurdles</h3>
<p>In order to promote international renminbi liquidity, the People’s Bank of China has signed over RMB 650 billion worth of bilateral currency swap agreements with seven other central banks – Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Argentina, Belarus and Iceland. It is also hoped that this will support local trading activity with Chinese counterparties. According to Robins, Thailand and Russia are reported to be in discussion with China for the same arrangement and a handful of companies are now authorised to make a market in issuing renminbi bonds.</p>
<h4 id=""the-role-of-international-banks-and-chinese-authorities"">The role of international banks and Chinese authorities</h4>
<p>“Non-deliverable forward contracts can in certain circumstances be an effective alternative to conventional hedging contracts, and J.P. Morgan, along with some other international banks, is offering these,” explains Xu.</p>
<p>While these steps from the banking sector are certainly a move in the right direction, the full internationalisation of the renminbi is still a long way off. If the renminbi is to become a true international trading currency, many more market makers outside China will need to begin offering similar services.</p>
<p>According to Robins, “The Chinese authorities appreciate the constraints imposed by the current lack of renminbi liquidity, and are working constantly with strategic partners to develop balanced, controlled but effective routes forward.”</p>

<h3 id=""looking-to-the-future"">Looking to the future</h3>
<p>For the true internationalisation of the renminbi to take place, it will be necessary for international banks to participate in a global renminbi market and therefore the appropriate settlement structure will also have to be accommodated. As Xu explains, “Only the global banks have the necessary balance sheet strength, global clearing capability, branch networks and correspondent bank relations which full-scale world trade in renminbi will require.”</p>
<p>It is widely understood that the use of renminbi in international trade is going to take time. As such, while steady progress is being made, trusted banking partners of the PBoC can help clients by raising specific issues and devising ad hoc solutions which can point the way towards future developments and also further liberalisation of current regulation.</p>
<p>Beyond the question of trade lies the issue of capital transactions. “Eventually, the Chinese government will have to ease the current prohibitions on free capital inflows and outflows if China is to play a full role in the global financial economy,” says Robins. As yet, however there are no real signs of liberalisation to this extent. It is thought that the broad acceptance of the renminbi as a trade currency will be the first step towards such a shift in policy, with the government becoming more comfortable about the full implications of such a move. These are interesting times for China.</p>
