<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="rising-risks">Rising risks</h3>
<p>Treasury teams hoping for a quiet summer will look out on the political and economic landscape with a sense of trepidation. As this edition goes to press, UK governing politicians are more focused on a leadership contest following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s resignation than the country’s urgent economic travails. All the while rising COVID cases in China threaten more lockdowns and corporates and markets are balancing key unknowns as quantitative tightening ratchets up and Central Banks start to shrink their balance sheets. Elsewhere, Europe’s energy crisis grows, and Japan is coming to terms with the assassination of Shinzo Abe.</p>
<p>Still, these occurrences, tragic and shocking, anticipated or unsurprising, are visible and real. This edition’s Insight and Analysis feature explores how deepfake technology that uses AI to train a computer to speak and act like a person poses a growing security risk for treasurers. Deep fake videos of Barack Obama have gone viral; the UK’s Queen dancing was another. But how this technology is being used to target treasury is no joke as duped treasury teams increasingly report.</p>
<p>In times of uncertainty, liquidity and working capital, the unsung heroes of corporate success, become even more important. We hear how some sectors like shipping are generating huge liquidity but others, especially those with large exposure to China, have worryingly less on hand as sales and revenue dry up. The feature also explores treasurers’ liquidity priorities in a climate of rising rates. Strategies include putting money into current accounts in a short-term approach, not committing on tenor but expecting maximum yield and banks to pass on the benefits of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Our Back to Basics feature explores the potential of digitisation to boost access to trade finance, looking particularly at how digitisation and automation could encourage institutional investors into the asset class, unlocking billions of capital. Sticking with technology, our Regional Focus travels to Canada where payments transformation is gathering momentum as the country phases out an antiquated system dating from the 1970s based on a patchwork of scattered formats. Years in the pipeline, real-time, central payments infrastructure running on a standard model and able to integrate into global jurisdictions and international clearing systems is finally on the way.</p>
<p>Lastly, our Question Answered finds an emphatic response to today’s competitive market for talent: the best way to recruit and retrain treasury expertise is to guarantee WFH and integrate robust career development plans.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="strength-in-adversity">Strength in adversity</h3>
<p>Of all the myriad and complex challenges companies face in the current climate, crisis in their supply chains is up there. Companies have struggled to access the key components that go into their products ever since the pandemic closed borders, but the problem is now exacerbated by China locking down several cities to suppress outbreaks of the virus and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Such is the challenge of shortages, delays and surging costs, a clear split is emerging in corporates’ response that signposts winners and losers ahead.</p>
<p>Focusing on the impact of war in Ukraine on supply chains, our Insight and Analysis feature explores how treasury teams are responding. One solution is early payment and robust supply chain finance solutions while re-shoring – another potential trend – brings benefits and challenges. Perhaps our feature on the Circular Economy offers another solution to the supply chain crisis and rocketing commodity prices: companies prepared to invest in new models around reusing and repurposing the key components in their products could come out the winners.</p>
<p>Staying with the crisis in Ukraine, our Back to Basics feature explores the critical role of treasury around sanctions due diligence, especially when it comes to payments and tracking beneficial ownership given the reputational and financial cost of a breach.</p>
<p>In our Technology feature, we explore how fintechs’ explosion onto the banking scene has challenged incumbents, particularly in consumer banking. Could the same thing happen in transaction banking, where corporate treasurers pick and choose their own solutions without the need of going to a large one-stop-shop bank? Elsewhere this edition explores the pros and cons of MMFs and in our Question Answered we ask three experts what ISO 20022 means for the payments industry, and how treasury should prepare.</p>
<p>And finally, nominations for our Adam Smith Awards 2022 closed with over 230 submissions from 34 countries. Global corporate names populate every one of the 18 categories, with strong nominations across the board. Our expert panel have begun judging ahead of announcing the winners online at 3:30pm BST on 12<sup>th</sup> May. Details on how to <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_a-l7TcJeTU2VWSi3gxvHNg" target="_blank">join the event</a> are on our website.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="strength-in-times-of-crisis">Strength in times of crisis</h3>
<p>As this edition goes to press, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has raged for four weeks. Alongside the tragic human consequences, the war has left companies scrambling to cope with the impact. Commodity prices have surged, impacting supply chains, and sanctions have forced companies to cut ties with Russia where doing business is neither morally, commercially nor politically viable. Some of our best-read stories include the impact of axing Russian banks from SWIFT, and whether this could accelerate China’s rival payments system, CIPS.</p>
<p>Auditing and consultancy firms, which poured into Russia three decades ago to capitalise on the collapse of the Soviet Union, are the latest companies to ditch Russian clients and abandon their Russian operations. This edition looks at another enduring challenge facing the sector: trust. After years of missed red accounting flags and an ever-growing list of corporate collapses, we explore whether reform will strengthen the industry that society relies on to inspect and challenge company accounts, and if treasury is able to support more efficient audits.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we look at the trend of private equity investors buying listed companies, particularly in the UK where valuations are cheap. When private equity investors take the helm, treasury must buckle up. Prioritising value creators, balance sheet efficiency, and cash generation and return are the key focus, guided by a new mantra of “be quick, be good, be gone.”</p>
<p>We look at how treasurers experiencing their first taste of high inflation can take solace from the fact basic treasury management principles still apply – even in the most testing circumstances. And we explore again treasury’s progress in embedding sustainability. From green bonds and sustainable SCF to paperless processes and digital signatures, there’s no shortage of opportunities for treasury to further the sustainability agenda.</p>
<p>We round up this edition’s coverage with insights on how Singapore’s fintech sector will impact corporate treasuries in the region and how they are run in the future. The Question Answered looks at cash pooling, renowned for supporting supply chain disruption and pressure on working capital and the key challenges companies face today.</p>

<h3 id="the-view-on-2022-the-trends-set-to-shape-the-treasury-landscape">The view on 2022: the trends set to shape the treasury landscape</h3>
<p>As 2022 gets under way, this edition explores some of the most important issues set to drive treasury policy in the year ahead, including digitisation and reducing emissions. Our main feature sets the scene, polling a variety of treasury and corporate experts on what they perceive as treasuries’ key challenges in the year ahead. Cybercrime, supply chain issues and the consequences of vaccine inequality make the shortlist. Rising energy prices, accentuated by greenflation as green politics continue to reduce the supply of key raw materials and slow investment in oil and minefields, will also stay front of mind.</p>
<p>This edition also explores the role of treasury in supporting companies to reduce their Scope 3 emissions, an immense task that has left many stuck on how best to proceed. EDF’s Head of Treasury, Bernard Descreux, explains how his team is leading initiatives at the French utility to reduce emissions in its supply chain that include issuing social bonds to finance its SME suppliers and launching a reverse factoring programme. Proof that these policies are beginning to work is evident in the fact EDF reduced its Scope 3 emissions by 11% last year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we look at how digital assets promise opportunity beyond just investing in bitcoin. Digital assets have the potential to transform how treasuries – if not whole businesses – are run. One example we explore is how tokenisation could transform the ownership and access to industrial assets, such as machines, planes or trains.</p>
<p>In our Corporate View, iconic shoemaker Dr. Martens’ Group Treasurer Mark Hirst describes how he is building out the treasury function in support of the newly listed company’s pursuit of revenue and profit. This includes the need for a hedging programme to manage the growing number of currencies used to transact as the company’s direct-to-consumer sales grow – another key trend shaping every treasury landscape.</p>
<p>Finally, now is your moment to shine! The acclaimed Adam Smith Awards, now in its 15th year, opens for nominations on 31st January. Everything you need, including our short nomination form, is available online at treasurytoday.com. Nomination will close at midnight on 11th April and we look forward to receiving your nominations. Good luck!</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="cop26-shareholder-conversations-and-crypto">COP26, shareholder conversations and crypto</h3>
<p>As this edition goes to press, governments from around the world are gathering in Glasgow for the United Nations’ climate change conference COP26. The world is waiting to hear if leaders can act together to introduce the global policy framework needed to wean economies off fossil fuels and achieve net zero by 2050.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury is focused on a few key issues, say respondents in this edition’s Q&amp;A feature: how new rules on carbon trading and emissions could impact treasury, particularly investment decisions and the cost of carbon-intensive imports and exports; the introduction of climate taxes to pay for governments’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); new rules around investing in carbon sinks to offset emissions, and looming regulation to limit emissions in their supply chains.</p>
<p>Despite all the unknowns, one thing is certain. Integrating ESG is costly, and companies need their investors on side. Continuing the theme, in this issue we also explore how corporate boards can improve their conversations between shareholders when it comes to ESG. Novartis’ ESG Director, Madeleine Szeluch, talks about how identifying material risks has helped gain control of the narrative and ensure powerful and effective conversations.</p>
<h4 id="cryptos-bite">Crypto’s bite</h4>
<p>“This ain’t going away; it’s not a flash in the pan,” said one interviewee in our feature on bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain and stablecoins. If companies are going to innovate in this new frontier it will likely start with treasury, and we explore the pros and cons of considering bitcoin as an investment or using digital currencies as a payment method.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we look at the role of a modern treasurer – from taking on a more strategic role within the organisation to stepping up in areas ranging from ESG to M&amp;A, their remit has never been wider. Something that resonates with our Corporate View interviewee, Sayan Mukherjee, VP, Group Treasurer of Nexperia, the global semiconductor manufacturer. He discusses how a philosophy of ‘efficiency wins’ is preparing the company for ambitious growth ahead. Lastly, our Market View reflects on why inflation, and interest rates, are set to rise further in the coming years.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="treasurys-climate-challenge">Treasury’s climate challenge</h3>
<p>The latest message from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released in August, was a dire warning from scientists on the impact of climate change. It has focused attention on the UN’s COP26 conference in November and the urgency to get gathered countries that have adopted the Paris Agreement to collaborate on cutting emissions to sign up to new, tougher cuts in Glasgow to try and decarbonise the world.</p>
<p>As the politicians get ready to wrangle, this edition explores one growing treasury’s role in helping companies meet the challenges of climate change. Corporations are setting increasingly bold environmental goals, yet these promises are rarely mirrored in their financial statements, making it difficult for investors and other stakeholders to see the relationship between a company’s financial and sustainability performance.</p>
<p>New financial reporting standards due to be unveiled at COP26 aim to change this, laying out how companies should report to give as clear a view of corporate sustainability as they currently do financial performance in one, integrated report. Moreover, the different and acronym-heavy measurements and reporting standards surrounding ESG will be replaced with a standard norm. Going forward, treasury and finance will play a growing role, with sustainability teams incorporating these new standards and understanding how changes in corporate strategy and the impact of regulation will translate into the figures they use to prepare their financial statements.</p>
<p>Our Corporate View with Anthony Buchanan, Head of Treasury at Japanese brewer Asahi Europe, illustrates where else treasury can lead on sustainability, like the brewer’s working capital support of a supplier wanting to finance a factory closer to an Asahi brewery to cut logistics costs. Elsewhere, his treasury has signed a ten-year electricity contract in Poland, wholly tied to wind in an offtake deal that helped the renewables farm finance its infrastructure build.</p>
<p>This edition also explores how companies can minimise FX volatility in current market conditions and the frequency with which they should review their hedging strategy. We also take a long look at the latest cyber threats in the wake of the pandemic, and ask a group of experts what impact long-term working trends hold for treasury.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="challenges-in-a-changing-world">Challenges in a changing world</h3>
<p>The message from G7 leaders recently gathered in Cornwall was clear. With many of the discussions, like talk of an international infrastructure drive to rival China’s Belt and Road Initiative, centred on a determination to push back against China’s growing global influence, expect a greater sense of western unity and a tougher stance on China ahead. Another standout message signalled root and branch ambitious reform of global corporation tax following a headline-grabbing commitment to introduce new taxing rights over companies and a new global minimum tax.</p>
<p>In this issue we pick up on both these themes. Alexander Foltin, Treasurer at German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon, talks about his treasury priorities against the backdrop of US China tensions in a strategic industry that depends on open and free trade. Elsewhere, tax and treasury experts flag corporation tax reform will have repercussions on company cashflows and payments, urging treasury to start preparing for tax liabilities in jurisdictions where they don’t have a physical presence.</p>
<p>This edition’s Corporate View comes from Jan Beukes, Group Treasurer at South African entertainment group MultiChoice. He shares his experience overseeing an ambitious digitisation overhaul across MultiChoice’s treasury, a root and branch reform that caught the eye of our judges, with Beukes and his team scooping Overall Winner – Best in Class Treasury Solution in Africa in our Adam Smith Awards 2021, announced at our live ceremony in June.</p>
<p>Lastly, this edition explores progress in racial equity at companies one year on from George Floyd’s murder and the Black Lives Matter protests.  We find consumers, employees and shareholders are increasingly holding corporations to account, but new recruitment and retention practices and tying executive pay to diversity targets are more key than ever. “There is certainly lots of talk about what needs to be done, but in my experience, few have committed to and are doing the multi-year organisational development/cultural work that is required in an intentional way. I don’t think it is always down to lack of will, it is often down to a lack of expertise around what is actually required,” explains leadership expert India Gary-Martin.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="time-to-act">Time to act</h3>
<p>As this edition goes to press, two days of climate discussions close with ambitious new emission pledges from countries including Japan, Canada and South Korea, counterbalanced by foot-dragging from Australia and Brazil.</p>
<p>A new wave of targets is a clear warning sign to public companies that governments’ regulatory and reporting demands around emissions are set to increase. Companies have been producing sustainability reports for years, but as climate risk becomes financially material, sustainability and treasury teams will increasingly have to pool their expertise, processes and rigour to detail corporate emissions as a liability on the balance sheet and provide deep dive analysis of the emissions across their supply chain. It’s a reporting burden that screams the need to act now. “This is the direction of travel,” warns one of our interviewees.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we focus on a more familiar treasury challenge: cash management. Cathy Fields, Assistant Treasurer and Director of Global Risk Management at Hitachi Vantara, recounts how she has transformed banking infrastructure and cash management at the division of the Japanese IT conglomerate. The process depended on clear messaging and communication, education and breaking down silos.</p>
<p>No doubt an interesting lens into transformational change for Matthew Ebersold, Head of Treasury at US photography pioneer Kodak. In our Insight and Analysis feature he talks about how post pandemic treasury strategy at the company will focus on identifying and implementing efficiencies, particularly around cash management, as the company seeks to reduce its “hundreds” of bank accounts around the world and the associated fees.</p>
<p>This edition also gathers expert opinion on the Greensill fallout, reminding readers that Greensill’s risky future receivables financing isn’t a traditional trade finance product. Minna Helppi, Group Treasurer at Finland’s Metso Outotec, espouses the win-win of supply chain finance for suppliers and treasury and predicts regulation and more investment bank involvement ahead.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s that time of the year again! The Adam Smith Awards programme recognises best practice and innovation, regardless of company size, budget or industry sector. Following the success of our 2020 virtual delivery, we will again run the Adam Smith Awards 2021 digitally, announcing the winners on 8<sup>th</sup> June.</p>

<h3 id="liquidity-sustainability-and-the-rush-to-list">Liquidity, sustainability and the rush to list</h3>
<p>As the vaccines roll out and lockdowns begin to lift, the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic are finally preparing to open for business once again. In this edition, we speak to two corporate treasurers working in the travel and tourism sectors to reflect on the challenges of the last year. Darrell Campbell, Head of Treasury for the world’s biggest cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation, recounts how Carnival raised over US$22bn in emergency funding in a sweeping liquidity strategy. He explains how his first priority was simply keeping the company afloat, a white- knuckle ride that included tapping the high-yield market and articulating financial models to a new and unknown investor group.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in our Corporate View, travel operator Kiwi.com’s Adesola Orimalade talks about how he has prioritised cash and cost cutting while aircraft remain grounded, hotels shut and borders around the world largely closed. Orimalade also talks about the importance of treasury resilience during the pandemic, something he learnt in his native Nigeria and an early role at start-up telecoms provider Starcomms.</p>
<p>Neither Carnival Corporation nor Kiwi.com have much cash to spare, but other companies have tapped capital market largesse to build up substantial cash piles. This edition also explores the strategies open to treasury teams with cash on hand, like investment and paying down debt.</p>
<p>Strategic investment to counter the impact of climate change and meet accelerating structural trends is certainly one way to spend it. It’s something Suzano, Brazil’s pulp and paper giant with a celebrated reputation for sustainability is doing. Continuing with our insight into how treasury can guide and integrate sustainability, we talk to Suzano’s Chief Financial Officer on how his team is overseeing investment in sustainability, linking finance to sustainability targets, and engaging with investors.</p>
<p>Finally, and against the backdrop of soaring equity markets, we explore the differences between IPOs, direct listings and SPACs. It’s hardly surprising companies are rushing to list, but experts warn that the US SPAC craze, where companies wanting to list merge with a blank cheque company that has raised money through a public listing, holds real uncertainties. Spotify blazed a trail when it listed directly in 2018, but experts caution that ditching the support of big syndicate banks suits companies with strong brands best.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="all-smooth-transitions-require-early-action">All smooth transitions require early action</h3>
<p>COVID and Brexit aside, our conversations with treasury teams over the last year have revealed an enduring preoccupation with two transitions. On one hand, treasury is having to navigate the transition from LIBOR to new risk-free rates. For corporates who have embarked on the journey, moving every type of bank loan, bond issuance, inter-company loan or derivative exposure to the new benchmarks, working out the cost of borrowing and setting up new treasury systems is proving no mean feat.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, corporates are increasingly focused on transitioning to a low carbon economy as the world weans itself off fossil fuels and gets down to the business of solving climate change. Although the transition to a low carbon economy doesn’t come with a fixed date, like LIBOR’s demise, regulatory pressure to mitigate climate change is growing and November’s COP26 in Glasgow promises an eye opener on the urgency ahead.</p>
<p>Given that the key to any successful transition is planning and early action, this edition urges treasury teams to act now for smooth transitions in both cases. Recounting how the Italian energy giant has become a leader in sustainable financing in just a matter of years, ENEL’s passionate head of finance and insurance Alessandro Canta assures all corporates they too can put sustainability centre stage. Most recently the company has worked with banks to develop a pioneering step-up feature in its bond issuance that attaches a value to sustainability.</p>
<p>As for LIBOR, corporate treasurers at BAT and Associated British Ports share their progress in transitioning to the new benchmarks and the challenges therein. It’s a process that has some experts worried at the slow pace of change in the bank loan market, as well as the prospect of a spike in bank borrowing costs within the new risk-free rates for smaller businesses.</p>
<p>LIBOR reform and pushing sustainability frontiers shows the dynamic and challenging nature of treasury today. Characteristics of the profession Nora Baker, profiled in this month’s Corporate View, has become expert at navigating. VP, Finance at Advantage Solutions, she shares a career path that began with a French major and a stint at the World Bank’s IFC, to later roles at UTC and United Paper. Today her experience touches every part of corporate life from new business growth and managing cash and treasury, to building international teams and overseeing restructuring.</p>
<p>Lastly, we report on how inclusion is now the new battleground in the diversity challenge. The moral imperative and performance benefits of diversity are well known, and recruitment practices, new apprenticeship schemes and targets are helping turn the tide. But if diverse treasury professionals don’t feel able to voice their opinions, miss out on networking opportunities and building their brand – much more difficult in COVID times – even the best diversity statistics won’t change group think.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="purpose-in-a-volatile-world">Purpose in a volatile world</h3>
<p>The idea of corporate purpose is still relatively new, but companies’ ability to combine profits and purpose is increasingly on the radar as corporate stakeholders, particularly employees and ESG-minded investors, demand more than just shareholder primacy. Rather than knock purpose off the agenda, the pandemic has pushed many companies to revisit their social purpose and role in society, encouraging more to act in the interests of all their stakeholders.</p>
<p>In this edition, we speak to multinational food manufacturer Danone about how its purpose to inspire healthier and more sustainable consumption and its core belief that a healthy planet and people are intertwined, has shaped its funding strategy.</p>
<p>Indeed, as companies struggle to navigate unprecedented challenges which most recently include stricter lockdowns in Europe and a spike in political risk following Trump’s refusal to concede Biden’s US election victory (ongoing at the time of writing), corporate purpose could act like a North star on a rough sea.</p>
<p>It is these challenges – and others – we focus on in this month’s Insight &amp; Analysis, offering a deep dive into what 2021 could hold, with insight from Drax’s Group Treasurer Chris King. COVID-19 and Brexit will continue to dominate, while King flags that the transition to a low carbon economy and only a year to go until LIBOR’s demise, should also be high on treasury’s agenda. Elsewhere, we find that relentless regulatory and technological change will continue to drive and shape treasury in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Regulatory and technological change are key factors that should have propelled open banking, the initiative to get banks to share customer data, mainstream. However, in our Back to Basics feature we report that banks, primarily focused on their retail customers, have been slow to offer open banking products to corporates. We urge banks and companies to look afresh at its transformational impact around cash management and liquidity planning, as well as easy onboarding, and to view open banking as an opportunity, allowing them to compete with tech groups and other API driven companies.</p>
<p>In the Corporate View, Flex’s Anita Bubna talks about how today’s heightened risk has pushed treasury centre stage in a coming of age. Reflecting on the importance of data and technology in successful treasury function, she suggests treasury teams develop coding skills to enable simple modelling and better connected data sources. Noting the importance of persuasion when it comes to leading change, she adds that a team effort and strong relationships with colleagues are also key to success.</p>
<p>Finally, this edition explores how volatility is encouraging more companies to hedge their developed market FX risk. However, we also note a reluctance amongst companies to take out long-term FX hedging strategies, such is the enduring volatility. As financial markets continue to swing around in response to news out of the US and the second bout of COVID lockdowns, it is a cautious sentiment that will prevail for a while yet.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="embracing-change">Embracing change</h3>
<p>“When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.” Alexander Graham Bell.</p>
<p>Opportunities may exist even in the most unexpected circumstances. All we have to do is turn our heads to see them, and then act accordingly. It seems simple enough, but as the quote above from prolific scientist and inventor Alexander Graham Bell suggests, we are often too preoccupied with the downsides of change to see the positives that exist within. But exist they often do!</p>
<p>In this edition, we explore some of the potentials for change that treasurers have or can create. In our Banking feature for example, we unravel the notion that nothing lasts forever, not even great banking relationships. We explore what is involved in moving from one institution to another, especially when modern treasury can become so enmeshed in a just a few partners, and what advantages doing so can reveal.</p>
<p>Prompted by current liquidity issues being faced by many businesses, this edition’s Funding article looks at suitable alternative or additional sources, taking a peek behind the scenes at Schuldschein and probing the rising international appeal of Germany’s private placement market.</p>
<p>With cash management fundamentals currently front and centre for most companies, our Insight &amp; Analysis feature this time round focuses on effective cash segmentation, looking at how this seemingly simple process can be enhanced to become a means of optimising current and future cash holdings.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a brace of leading treasurer profiles, demonstrating just how diverse the profession is in terms of its application and yet how singular it is in its goal to deliver positive results.</p>
<p>In the Corporate View, GE’s Linda McGoey – motto: “learn, and then learn more” – tells of her quest to keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. In a special profile inspired by widespread feeling that it’s good to give back to the communities in which we live, we chat to former Expedia Group Treasurer, Ken Bugayong, about his decision to help non-profit educational organisation, Minds Matter, survive and thrive post-pandemic.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: change can be a great thing. Even adversity presents opportunities; you just have to look a little closer.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="there-is-no-new-normal">There is no ‘new normal’</h3>
<p>Over the past few months the phrase ‘new normal’ has surfaced as a way of describing how we now live. But does it really mean anything? We live in a dynamic world where events, and our perceptions of them, are constantly changing. We are in a permanent state of flux so surely a ‘new’ normal exists no more than an ‘old’ normal. As Heraclitus argued millennia ago, the only constant in life is change.</p>
<p>Modern scientists knew that some form of pandemic was coming (and that others will follow) but no one saw precisely how and when COVID-19 would surface. The world has changed as a result, but then that’s what it always does, and humanity has thus far proven adaptable.</p>
<p>Adaptability is an essential survival skill. Ideally in society we help those who cannot reconcile the changes. But in business, at least those subject to the order of capitalism, those that cannot adapt are not carried; it is a case of survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>If a description of the world as it is right now, under varying degrees of lockdown, could arguably include the notion of ‘new normal’, then it should perhaps, at a societal level, be used to express how countless more people have been compelled by the pandemic into reassessing what is most important in their lives. Their decisions now may have a long-lasting effect or they may not.</p>
<p>However, at a business level, where constant change and survival of the fittest remain as true now as they ever did, the idea of a ‘new normal’ really is meaningless. In treasury terms, whilst different disciplines have risen up the agenda – liquidity management being of immediate importance – these activities have always been critical to organisational success. Failure to manage any aspect of treasury will soon be felt across the business.</p>
<p>In this edition, we recognise the dynamic nature of treasury, looking at how investment policies change according to need, and asking how treasurers can be more effective when trying to balance the outcome of the ‘liquidity, security, yield’ mantra.</p>
<p>We also take a closer look at that old foe, KYC, probing those in the know for ways in which treasurers can reduce the pain of this ever-changing burden. In our Question Answered feature this time round, we quiz a trio of experts about their approach to treasury policy revision in an unpredictable world.</p>
<p>Of course, we all recognise that treasury is nothing if not resourceful, adaptable, and innovative. This year’s Adam Smith Awards, conducted in the midst of the pandemic, demonstrates that even in the most challenging of times, here is a profession that delivers.</p>
<p>Having celebrated the winners in our virtual awards announcement on 8th June, we will be talking to the winners about their approach as part of our Adam Smith Awards Season. In doing so, once more it reveals that treasurers and their business partners never take their eyes off the ball. By continuing to proactively provide solutions across a wide commercial spectrum, whatever the circumstances, the idea of ‘new normal’ is indeed redundant: it’s just what treasurers do.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="a-different-way-of-living">A different way of living</h3>
<p>These times are challenging for everyone. But amongst the personal tragedy and heartache, the frustration and anger, every day we can see shining examples of humanity. Those that are on the frontline in the fight against COVID-19 – and there are many – reveal to us that, fundamentally, humans can and will pull together to do whatever is necessary, because of – and yes, also in spite of – each other.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome of this pandemic, we are all part of it. We all have a story to tell, whether we are on the frontline or just keeping out of the way. But the spirit that drives frontline professionals to keep going is entirely human. It is a spirit that is in us all which, if tapped, can drive remarkable results in all walks of life.</p>
<p>Indeed, it does not matter what our calling is; times like these make us reflect on what we do and how we do it. It can bring to the fore that other most positive characteristic of human nature: creativity. And this is an endless proposition that can be applied to every human endeavour, especially as we are compelled into a different way of living for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>As treasurers, the first calling in the current environment is to protect the business from financial harm. Of course, it’s what treasurers always do, but achieving this in a more effective and efficient way is essential now. The thinking that enables this need never stop; it is good for all times.</p>
<p>In this edition we explore the idea of ‘Remote working: the new normal?’, unravelling what it means now and what it might mean when we have emerged from the restrictions of the pandemic. We also look at other practical matters in our feature on ‘How to support business units effectively’, engaging with something that sits at the heart of all modern treasuries, and which will continue to enhance the role as the strategic partner.</p>
<p>There is a sense that we are all involved now in something transformational. As we play our part in tackling an immediate threat, we can perhaps begin to see how sustainability makes sense in the longer term. In ‘A sustainable treasury – is it...sustainable?’, we look at how treasurers can make a real difference when applying an ESG lens to everyday activities. There’s continuity of this theme in our look at the idea of ‘connected trade’ and how digitalisation not only allows trading partners to operate more securely and efficiently but also more sustainably.</p>
<p>Ultimately, few could argue against the debt we owe to those who are saving lives. We can in part honour their remarkable achievements by making sure we all fully engage with, and make the most of, what we do in our lives, both as individuals and as professionals.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="testing-times">Testing times</h3>
<p>Firstly, let’s tackle the Big One. Treasurers across the region will be keeping a close eye on the unfolding events following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, Covid-19. Its economic impact is already being felt, with countries across the globe downgrading their economic growth forecasts. Supply chains are being disrupted, with factory closures in China affecting companies around the world, whilst diverse sectors are seeing a considerable impact, and many businesses take steps to minimise staff travel.</p>
<p>As they navigate these uncharted waters, treasurers will be working to understand the impact of the outbreak on their own organisations, from supply chain interruptions to the implications for FX risk, liquidity management and cash flow. At the same time, they will of course continue to focus on their existing challenges and responsibilities.</p>
<p>These are challenging times and they demand a sympathetic and intelligent response from everyone. Treasurers are known for their creativity, and with Treasury Today’s annual Adam Smith Awards upon us once more (nominations opened on 31<sup>st</sup> January and close at midnight on 14<sup>th</sup> April), it seems fitting to look at one of Adam Smith’s core economic principles of international trade: that of ‘comparative advantage’.</p>
<p>In ‘The Wealth of Nations’, Adam Smith wrote: “If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage”.</p>
<p>At a corporate level, allowing external specialists to take on ‘production’ of the elements less well-served by internal resources enables internal skills to focus on what they do best, for the greater good. The notion of comparative advantage thus underpins the value of outsourcing.</p>
<p>Several years ago, treasury outsourcing to a specialist agency – often a dedicated part of a bank – achieved a reasonable level of popularity. In recent times this course of action seems to have been subdued, perhaps at the hands of increasing corporate appetite for centralisation and consolidation.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps worth recalling another pearl of wisdom from Adam Smith: “Never complain of that of which it is at all times in your power to rid yourself”.</p>
<p>With many treasury functions increasingly overstretched by an ever-expanding remit, escalating demands from senior management to ‘do more with less’, and even treasury’s own push for more strategic involvement, it may be time to reconsider outsourcing.</p>
<p>In this edition, we explore the pros and cons of treasury outsourcing. We look at possible drivers, the latest options, possible outcomes, and how to ensure every agreement continues to align with the strategic needs of the business.</p>
<p>Continuing on the theme of expert guidance from outside the business, we also look at the separately managed accounts (SMAs). With the challenging interest rate environment persisting, we ask if treasurers would be advantaged if, instead of investing in a pooled fund, they took the solo option. Offering flexibility, control and increased yield opportunities, these may be the answer for those seeking a more productive home for their cash.</p>
<p>With a nod to the all-important human element in treasury, we cast a ‘back to basics’ eye over the way bank relationships are managed, probing the most effective ways to handle one of treasury’s most important partners. We ponder too the issues affecting treasurers every time they set up a transaction – identification and authentication, asking how businesses can be kept safe from skilled financial fraudsters.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="welcome-to-2020-its-going-to-be-interesting">Welcome to 2020. It’s going to be… interesting!</h3>
<p>In 2019, political risk-watchers were spoilt for choice. But from the Brexit saga, to drone strikes in Saudi Arabia, the conflict in Syria, the US-China trade war, protests in Hong Kong, the threat of a global recession et al – it all added up to one big headache for treasurers.</p>
<p>Charged with mitigating both macro-level risks – potentially impacting all businesses – and company – or industry-specific micro-level risks, it was evident that the way in which treasurers handled such events could substantially impact financial performance.</p>
<p>With all of the above occurrences as yet unresolved, expect 2020 to deliver risk in much the same vein. And no doubt there will be additional concerns to muddy the waters for those who pilot the finances of the world’s corporates.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of political risk is why we have prepared the first Insight &amp; Analysis piece of the year on this very issue. Of course, treasurers cannot prevent these events from happening but a degree of mitigation is possible. We explore the first steps towards identifying, quantifying and responding to the wide-ranging threats being faced. Tip: Maplecroft’s annual Political Risk Atlas is a very useful starting point for identifying future risk events!</p>
<p>From a multifarious overview of political risk, we take a deep dive into the murky world of sanctions screening. In this article, we offer professional views on how treasurers can ensure their organisations are fully aware and compliant. Shifting the risk stance slightly, we also explore ways in which commodities risk can be managed, assessing the current crop of tools available to treasurers.</p>
<p>We then take a diversion away from risk, towards the latest trends in cross-border payments and correspondent banking, and then explore how treasurers can get the most from their pre-bond issuance, IPO or direct investment roadshows.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, as we leave the volatility of 2019 and move into the New Year, treasurers should remain alert because, globally, we all seem to have fallen foul of the ancient (and apparently mythical) Chinese curse: “may you live in interesting times”!</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="the-game-of-risk">The game of risk</h3>
<p>Life has its risks, without which, arguably, we wouldn’t progress. Think how far we have come in the worlds of medicine and travel, for example, as previous generations have wrestled the odds and overcome life-threatening hurdles, just so we can have life a bit easier.</p>
<p>Of course, the life we live now has its own panoply of risks to which we must all pay attention for the benefit of future generations. Perhaps none is more existential in its potential outcome than climate change.</p>
<p>Transformational cycles in Earth’s climate have existed for millennia, the last great shift taking place over 7,000 years ago with the ice age that heralded the modern climate era. It’s understood that much of the impact of such changes over the last 650,000 years or so have been attributed to small variations in Earth’s orbit subtly altering the amount of solar energy received by our planet.</p>
<p>However, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, the current warming trend has a “greater than 95% probability” of being man-made. Data gathered by NASA indicates that Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by 0.9°C since the late 19th century, the majority of this increase occurring in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010.</p>
<p>We have a number of options when it comes to halting and possibly reversing the damaging effects of climate change. We can run around like headless chickens, panicking about it. We can refute the claims of scientists. We could do nothing because someone else will fix it. Or we can do something to help.</p>
<p>In this edition’s Risk Management feature, ‘Climate change and the treasurer’, we look at the latter option from a treasury perspective, exploring the kind of affirmative actions and preventative measures that the community can take to help make a difference. The options here are greater than you’d perhaps think.</p>
<p>Of course, climate change is the Big One, but risks abound (as they always will). In our Insight &amp; Analysis article, we tap into the fear that is cybercrime, asking ‘where next?’</p>
<p>As digitisation proceeds apace, cyber-security is styling itself as possibly the major concern for corporations around the world. As a threat delivered straight from the hand of humankind, we surely have an earthly chance of combatting those who seek to disrupt (whatever their motivation). Treasurers need to know and understand what types of risk they face, the potential for damage, how the strategies used by cyber-criminals are evolving – and how technology itself is playing a role in helping mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>A major contributor to winning the fight against any significant foe (including climate change and cybercrime) is our capacity to listen and learn. Everyone has an opinion and most are happy to share it. But how many of us truly listen to what’s being said? Indeed, how many of us know how to listen to what’s being said? In this edition’s Treasury Talent article, we explore the noble art of listening, in the company of acknowledged experts.</p>
<p>Finally, Treasury Today is 20 this year! What better way to celebrate this than by looking back over the key issues of the day, before grabbing the crystal ball and predicting where we will be in the next 20 years? And who knows, maybe we will be casting our minds back to the Bad Old Days when climate change and cybercrime dominated our thoughts!</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="the-rise-and-rise-of-the-connected-treasurer">The rise and rise of the connected treasurer</h3>
<p>Treasury once resided in an ivory tower within its own organisation; an inscrutable technical wizard that somehow made sure the bills were paid. Often the only time people knew it was there was when something went wrong.</p>
<p>That has all changed. Today, treasury has become – in the eyes of the rest of the business – the function that keeps the business afloat in a raging financial sea. This makes it very much a part of the gang.</p>
<p>As a vital part of this service, treasuries are becoming much more integrated with core teams such as procurement and sales, using data and knowledge to build an accurate reflection of the company’s financial needs. In making that connection, treasurers are also able to assist diverse functions in building relationships with suppliers, and even helping clients in their own financing needs.</p>
<p>Who’d have thought this was likely a decade or so ago? Few, probably. But treasurers have been busy communicating effectively across the organisation and beyond, forming real partnerships, and often harnessing cutting edge technologies to build closer connections.</p>
<p>You only have to look at the winners of this year’s Adam Smith Awards to see just how inventive individual treasuries are when it comes to building rapport and making digital connections within and without the business. For example, Treasury Today’s Top Treasury Team 2019 overall winner, Honeywell, has been exploiting cloud technology keep its stakeholders up to speed across its vast global enterprise.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the notion of the connected treasurer is one that has gained much credence in recent times. Last year’s ACT report, The Business of Treasury, found that 87% of respondents saw treasury as a strategic business partner in their organisations. PwC followed up with its 2019 Global Treasury Benchmarking Survey, identifying business partnering capabilities as one of the top three characteristics “most sought after in treasurers and their teams, beyond functional treasury expertise”.</p>
<p>In our Insight &amp; Analysis piece in this edition we explore the extent to which collaboration between treasury and the rest of the business helps the entire company to be (as one interviewee put it) “safer, more streamlined, and more efficient”.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s much to be gained by building closer connections between treasury and the rest of the business – and there are many ways in which the function can demonstrate its indispensable nature. Indeed, elsewhere in this edition we look at the role of the treasurer in M&amp;A, the future of bank relationships and treasury’s movements in the capital markets. And for our Back to Basics article we probe the idea of zero-based budgeting, an activity that requires close cooperation and strong connections if ever there was one!</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="an-island-of-cooperation-in-a-sea-of-disquiet">An island of cooperation in a sea of disquiet</h3>
<p>In a recent FT interview, Vladimir Putin said that “the liberal idea” has “outlived its purpose”. With the rise of anti-immigration sentiment, the will to shut down borders and end multiculturalism, it has certainly been tested.</p>
<p>In response, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, “strongly disagreed” with the Russian president, saying that “what I find really obsolete is authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs”. We all know what President Trump says about such matters.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Some of the world’s most powerful voices in polar disagreement, and presumably never the twain shall meet.</p>
<p>Isn’t it good news then that in the world of corporate treasury, we have representatives of some of the world’s largest and most powerful businesses coming together to celebrate the ingenuity and openness of the profession.</p>
<p>The 2019 Treasury Today Adam Smith Awards event is featured in this edition, describing a haven of sense and sensibility, where the incumbents are keen exponents of just getting on with it. In a world where contrariness seems to be the order of the day, feel the positive glow!</p>
<p>We then take a closer look at treasurers ‘getting on with it’, considering the role that this most proactive of professions plays in ensuring organisational growth. We also consider the role of treasury technology, asking if treasurers really need the kind of high-end tools now emerging to do their work.</p>
<p>In our Insight &amp; Analysis piece, the question of borders comes up again, this time with trade finance under scrutiny. Every business knows it’s critical for cross-border trading but, since the financial crisis, the banks have become more risk averse, creating a trade finance gap. We ask how that gap can be plugged.</p>
<p>Global politics can be very wearisome so it’s always interesting to bring things down to a personal level. In our Corporate View this time round we meet LMAX Exchange’s Group Treasurer, Himanshu Kher. Coming at the role from a different angle, he is able to head off challenges with the fast-thinking structured approach of a formally-qualified engineer, inflecting his response with the intuitive mind of the trained Indian percussionist. The meeting of two quite distinct worlds seems to create a natural harmony.</p>
<p>Finally, wherever treasurers are located there will always be regulations with which to contend. The IFRS 16 lease accounting standard may bring transparency to the balance sheet but for most finance functions, it is also a source of a lot of extra work. We look at what can be done to alleviate the pressure. At the very least though it draws the focus away from bickering world leaders for a while!</p>

<p>At this point in 2019, those in the UK who voted to leave the EU should have been cheering as they finally threw off the shackles of EU membership, whilst those who voted remain would be ruing the day former Prime Minister Cameron decided to play political games with the country’s future. It has not happened yet. It might not. The truth is that nobody knows.</p>
<p>The fact that such a relationship, both politically and economically, cannot seemingly be unwound without one side or the other throwing up their arms in dismay, suggests that the modern world is built on stronger ties than anyone dares or, in some cases, wants to imagine.</p>
<p>Arguably, forming deeply-embedded relationships builds strength, if not always providing for unity. By their very nature, whether at a supranational, domestic or organisational level, complex relationships are difficult to unravel. But if they are founded on common purpose and vision, and allow each stakeholder an equal voice, why would it need to be torn apart?</p>
<p>In this issue, we take a long look at the strength that comes from working together.</p>
<p>In our cover feature, we examine how fintechs and banks have dropped their short-lived hostilities and are choosing instead to partner for mutual benefit – and how treasurers are reaping the rewards of this newly cooperative mindset.</p>
<p>The power of interconnectedness of functions and technology over isolation comes under the microscope, in our feature on holistic treasury. We also peer into a crystal ball, considering the nature of future-proofing treasury, asking how, in an age when new technologies are offered with unprecedented frequency, treasurers can leverage such progress whilst avoiding failures (clue: integration).</p>
<p>In this edition’s look at trade in emerging regions, on-the-ground experts offer solutions for treasurers seeking to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities across LatAm and Africa. With more countries in each region now disposed to working together, the positive results are starting to show.</p>
<p>And this is the point. At multiple levels – internally and externally – regions, countries and organisations have many opportunities to work together. When choosing this approach, the outcomes, whilst not always perfect, are often better than expected. But they are always healthier than pulling up the drawbridge and refusing to cooperate.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="the-uncertainty-principle">The uncertainty principle</h3>
<p>The whole Brexit experience for the business community has been characterised by an expanding series of unknowns (both known and unknown, as former US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld would say), playing out at length. The uncertainty that this has foisted upon many sectors across the UK, Europe and beyond has been challenging, to say the least. It is one that many treasurers will have had to manage, despite the lack of hard facts.</p>
<p>With the exit date of 29<sup>th</sup> March falling after the deadline of this edition, by the time you read this it may well be all over bar the shouting. Or complete chaos. Or…well, who knows. We will of course be covering events as they unfold, examining how treasurers will be affected by the decisions taken.</p>
<p>But there is more to life than Brexit (even if for anyone living in the UK it may not feel like it). Whatever happens come the day, treasurers can rest assured that they will continue to be challenged by a host of other ongoing scenarios. In this issue we ask the experts what role artificial intelligence might play in helping companies manage the darker sides of trade such as sanctions compliance and fraud detection. We also take an in-depth view of global transaction banking, questioning its relevance in a world of ever-changing threats and opportunities.</p>
<p>Funding comes under the microscope within these pages too, as we investigate its human side, learning how to manage debt investor relations in the presence of some well-accomplished treasurers. Personal skills, in the context of career progression, also come in for close scrutiny in our exploration of the role of coaching, mentoring and training in professional development.</p>
<p>With the addition of a back to basics take on the once-feared but now ubiquitous cloud technology, this issue acknowledges that life goes on and that treasurers have a vital job to do, come what may.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="time-to-reflect">Time to reflect</h3>
<p>In ‘The Gumball Rally’, a 1970s comedy film about an illegal US coast-to-coast road race, the Ferrari Daytona-driving Italian, Franco Bertollini, rips off his rear-view mirror exclaiming “what’s behind doesn’t matter”.</p>
<p>Entertainment value aside, most racing drivers would disagree. Of course, they need superhuman ‘in-the-moment’ skill to stay ahead of the competition but they also need to know what the other drivers are doing.</p>
<p>To assist, modern racing cars augment mirrors with pit radio and a host of high-tech telemetry, giving the driver a concise but highly accurate and timely picture of the state of their own vehicle and what’s going on around them. From this they can plan their race (if team orders don’t interfere…). This may sound familiar.</p>
<p>Whilst few treasurers, if any, experience quite the same level of sustained adrenalin flow as racing drivers in everyday situations, when things change quickly, the pressure ramps up and the treasurer’s skill and experience must come to the fore.</p>
<p>An almost superhuman awareness of what’s going on, often on an expansive international stage, is vital. Boosting the reflective power of the ‘mirror’ with modern technology allows every situation to become clearer, and the decisions made that bit sharper. Quite simply, more than ever, treasurers need to be the financial ‘all-seeing eye’.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are downgrading their outlooks for the US in 2019, mindful of the escalating trade war, the Fed’s resolve to continue raising interest rates, and a likely sharp increase in oil prices caused by low global spare capacity, sanctions on Iranian exports, and political uncertainty in Saudi Arabia. There is the ongoing Brexit saga between the UK and the EU, and now the UN Economic Analysis and Policy Division has warned that improved economic performance in the global economy “is increasingly being overshadowed by heightened risks and humanitarian concerns”.</p>
<p>For treasurers, managing economic and political uncertainty is now part of the job. Being effective in these arenas demands ever-greater awareness of trading conditions. In this issue, we look at the concept of real-time treasury, asking how it can help both decision-making and operational efficiency in the here-and-now.</p>
<p>Also, given that the world’s governments and authorities are not easing up on their attempts to manage the vagaries of the financial markets, we explore how best to identify, plan for and implement regulatory change.</p>
<p>Of course, all competitive arenas demand that its participants look every which way, including ahead. With the Paris Agreement and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development including a firm commitment to align financial flows with climate-resilience, our investigation of green finance and sustainability is a timely reminder for treasurers that full awareness must include what lies ahead.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="the-five-ps-of-successful-treasury">The five Ps of successful treasury</h3>
<p>Was it by accident or design that this issue has more than a few articles geared to helping treasurers prepare for and overcome adverse situations? The world has been gearing up over the past year with some interesting challenges, so perhaps for the final publication of the year such an editorial schedule was inevitable, however it came about.</p>
<p>The escalation of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing; continued emerging market currency weakness; the increasing risk of yet another global recession; Brexit uncertainty; rising political risk: they’re all hot topics for those who care to speculate on their outcome over coming months, and hotter still for treasurers charged with having to deal with them.</p>
<p>But look at almost any year with the benefit of hindsight and somewhere, something went contrary to planning. For treasurers then, it’s all part of a day’s work. That said, being a treasurer has the potential for a little too much excitement sometimes. That’s why the old adage of ‘proper preparation prevents poor performance’ rings as true now as it ever did.</p>
<p>In corporate financial terms, successful adherence to the aforementioned ‘five Ps’ almost certainly means timely access to accurate and relevant data. In this issue’s technology feature we consider ways of revealing and dealing with new patterns, trends and associations that exist in the vast resource that is big data.</p>
<p>We also contemplate specific actions treasurers can take when a black swan event ensues, considering some of the steps that can be taken to minimise the risk of these unexpected but significant occurrences. Continuing the risk theme, we ask a panel of experts to share their views on how to avoid common hedging mistakes. We follow up with a back to basics look at sanctions compliance, tackling the all-too-pertinent corporate concept of ‘knowing your customers’ customers’ and the importance of understanding the beneficial ownership of the companies with which you deal.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times. Michelle Obama had it about right when she said: “Your experience facing and overcoming adversity is actually one of your biggest advantages”. Well, that and a healthy amount of planning.</p>

<h3 id="towards-an-open-world-economy">Towards an open world economy</h3>
<p>There may be many contenders for “the project of the century”. The worlds of computing, healthcare, automotive and aeronautics for example may all lay claim to the most important missions for the benefit of humanity. And let’s not forget the ‘project’ to save the planet itself from mankind’s best efforts to make it uninhabitable through pollutants.</p>
<p>But the quote referred to above is from China’s President Xi Jinping. What he is referring to is his country’s Belt and Road Initiative. He may have a point.</p>
<p>Some may see this as China’s push to trade along easier land, sea and air corridors for the primary benefit of itself. Not so, says President Xi who says: “we should build an open platform of cooperation and uphold and grow an open world economy”.</p>
<p>Certainly, it is a long and costly journey, measured in decades and trillions of dollars. China must therefore rely upon the cooperation of many countries along the various routes outwards to Asia, Africa and Europe. Some may see Belt and Road as a form of aid, for which China will no doubt be ‘paid back’ handsomely for its investment through trade domination. Others may say it is China showing the world that it is prepared to risk creating vast and perhaps at times unserviceable debt to create a collaborative ecosystem of trade.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, after five active years, its sheer magnitude has seen it still at the stage of infrastructure development. Chinese contractors have naturally been the main beneficiary but many overseas firms in the services and supplies sectors have drawn a decent wage from this too.</p>
<p>And now China is just starting to consider the next phase. This is where trade and services will become the focus. In this, Beijing is seemingly handing an opportunity for many more foreign businesses to join the journey.</p>
<p>Each organisation will have to evaluate what opportunities fit with its own strategy, managing the risks accordingly. This leads us to the unique and vital role of the treasurer.</p>
<p>No company should be heading into new territories without first understanding how best to navigate through a full corporate lifecycle, from entering into a new market, to growing the business, to integrating operations with a regional hub or headquarters.</p>
<p>With treasurers playing an increasingly important role in company growth, as the nexus of much of the necessary information, thinking through these different stages is vital. Treasurers are in a good place to help their organisations become successful players in Belt and Road progress. And if it turns out to be the ‘project of the century’, then the profession can stand taller still.</p>

<h3 id="the-persistence-of-cash">The persistence of cash</h3>
<p>Rumours concerning the death of cash appear to be much exaggerated. Again. For a payment form that has been slated for demise for many years, it seems to be hanging on remarkably well.</p>
<p>In most jurisdictions, cash remains fundamental to many day-to-day transactions. The ‘experts’ may try to convince us that it is waning in influence but the evidence (at least the evidence of the latest World Cash Report from G4S), shows that the demand for cash “is growing in absolute terms and relative to GDP”.</p>
<p>It seems people like cash. They trust it. It’s free to use. It’s readily available for consumers. It can’t be hacked. It doesn’t run out of battery power. Perhaps more of interest to certain elements in society, it is also a rather confidential and untraceable payment mechanism. “These unique qualities continue to hold significant value to people living on all continents,” comments Jesus Rosano, Chief Executive of G4S’ Global Cash Division.</p>
<p>The World Cash Report truth is that people like a range of payment options. Despite the rise of electronic and mobile payments, cash remains hugely important all over the world.</p>
<p>In this issue we look at the cash conundrum through the eyes of treasurers. In trying to manage this awkward beast, what means are available to keep it under control? Turn to our Insight &amp; Analysis article and witness ‘The death of cash...again’.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we consider the technology angle of running treasury on a budget before saluting the rise of the treasurer as the corporate change manager and revealing some of the key methods of unlocking value in the supply chain. As part of our continuing Back to Basics series, in this issue we offer a guide to negotiating with your bank.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="trump-and-the-davos-dream">Trump and the Davos dream</h3>
<p>When President Trump took to the stage to deliver his 16-minute speech on the closing day of the 2018 World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, was there a feeling that his hitherto hard-boiled “America First” manifesto had softened?</p>
<p>More than one pundit commented that his uncontroversial tone sounded like one crafted to be more palatable to foreign leaders.</p>
<p>WEF is of course all about celebrating globalisation. Temporarily deaf to his own criticism of “the false song of globalism”, perhaps President Trump sat up the night before and read the WEF publication, “Strategic Brief on Misconceptions around Trade Balances”, leading him to reason that a more mollifying approach would yield better results.</p>
<p>According to the Washington Post and Reuters, the Strategic Brief argues against the views espoused by certain countries that trade policies developed over the last couple of decades have led to large trade deficits and a decline in manufacturing employment.</p>
<p>These anti-globalisation narratives have, says the Brief’s co-authors, Harvard professor Robert Lawrence and Princeton fellow Yeling Tan, recently emerged in “the United States as well as elsewhere” (it didn’t name the other countries).</p>
<p>President Trump’s constant displeasure with “unfair” and “bad trade deals” has seen him take or seek action on multilateral deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which he has pulled out of) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (in which he has tried to get Canada and Mexico to renegotiate on his terms). It is no secret too that the US’s major trade deficit with China is a constant source of irritation for the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The perceived unfairness to the US of such trade imbalances is viewed by the WEF pair as a “misconception”. They argue that if such a free trade agreement allows a country to meet more of its needs by importing at lower costs from a particular partner, it will benefit, regardless of the imbalance.</p>
<p>President Trump’s America First mantra that trade deficits mean job losses is thus refuted. The authors argue that “rapid import growth and larger trade deficits have been associated with faster employment growth”. Manufacturers can buy in cheap parts to make their goods, which they can sell for less, so people buy more, so more jobs are created. New barriers to trade, on the other hand, “could disrupt production and reduce rather than increase domestic employment in both the protected industries and those that use their outputs”.</p>
<p>With President Trump now considering the imposition of restrictions on the import of steel and aluminium as a measure aimed principally at China (but likely to hit the EU too), ‘America First’ it seems is alive and well. For global businesses, Trump’s stance poses several issues, most notably increasing the risk of a trade war. This could be very disruptive to today’s highly integrated global economy and something businesses will want to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>Whether a trade war materialises or not, Trump’s stance requires all corporates to take a close look at their supply chains and how they are doing business to evaluate if this will still be cost effective going forward. The skills of the treasurer will undoubtedly be called into action here to help manage this process and any undue risk.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="2018-the-year-of-digital-banking">2018: the year of digital banking</h3>
<p>So, farewell then bank branch; the end is nigh. Is that a problem? When NatWest in the UK recently announced the closure of 197 branches as part of a major cost-saver by its parent company, RBS (along with 62 of RBS’s own branches), the hue and cry from those who still see value in bank branches was loud and clear.</p>
<p>In the wake of the announcement, the Financial Times quoted Mike Cherry, Chairman, at the Federation of Small Businesses, who said that many small businesses – particularly those in rural areas with poor broadband access – relied on their local bank branches to seek personal advice as well as to deposit their cash takings. Whilst there are those who find change difficult to manage and people for whom cash and cheque are still viable means of payment, it is clear that the world is going digital.</p>
<p>The statistics make this very clear. RBS, for example, have said that since 2014, the number of customers using its branches across the UK has fallen by 40% as mobile transactions have increased 73% over the same period. The Office for National Statistics also points out that internet banking is now used by 63% of UK adults.</p>
<p>This is by no means a UK phenomenon; the same story is replicated across the world. In the Nordics, for instance, banks have been culling branches since 2010 as part of the region’s drive to go cashless. Most branches that do remain are ‘cashless branches’ – high street offices that are fitted with self-service cash machines.</p>
<p>In the United States – a country that still relies heavily on paper-based forms of payment such as the cheque – branches are also closing at a rapid rate. The Economist notes that since the financial crisis banks have closed over 10,000 branches, an average of three a day. In the first half of last year alone, a net 869 brick-and-mortar entities shut down in the US, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p>Even the developing markets are in on the act. In India, for example, DBS has recently launched digibank – a fully smartphone-based retail banking service. Also, on the institutional side, J.P. Morgan has rolled out its Virtual Branch solution across a variety of Asian markets. This eliminates the need for a corporates finance staff to be physically present at traditional bank branches, allowing them to conduct all manner of financial activities digitally.</p>
<p>Beyond these few examples, the financial sector is reflecting this pattern of digitisation across the spectrum of services. Corporate banking is certainly going digital; that is why it is one of the most ferociously debated topics at every conference. There are many positives to this, but the digitisation of banking goes hand-in-hand with the death of the branch.</p>
<p>The more people use digital, the more branches will be run down. The more branches are run down, the more people will use digital; thus it continues until the branch is no more.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="do-treasurers-dream-of-electric-sheep">Do treasurers dream of electric sheep?</h3>
<p>Is the world speeding up? Here we are, in the last two months of a year that has seemingly passed by in a flash. We know the world is not spinning any faster, but the pace of life has increased exponentially over the past decade. As a result, we have all become time-poor, spending our days feeling rushed and, perhaps as a result, demanding instant gratification.</p>
<p>The change in pace of life is having a big impact on how businesses operate. Where once most businesses could operate within a restricted set of hours, today they must be open and trading 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>The treasury department, which is managing its own increasing workload, has largely been able to avoid the need to be on call 24/7 – calls with colleagues in different time zones excepted. This is all beginning to change though, as the world of finance moves from batch to real-time, and faster payment systems and real-time data exchange become the norm.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the treasury? According to experts that Treasury Today spoke with at EuroFinance, it could mean the arrival of the 24/7 treasury desk, the rationale being that in the batch-world, if things go wrong they go wrong within a certain time. Issues in the real-time world wait for no one.</p>
<p>Of course, treasurers cannot work without sleep. In any case, in an era of belt-tightening, corporations are unlikely to pay an ‘out of hours’ treasury team to operate the department.</p>
<p>So, what might be the answer? One banker suggested that we could see a return of the banks offering outsourcing services, stepping in and playing the role of ‘out of office treasurer’.</p>
<p>With increasingly complex algorithms powering ever-more sophisticated AI and machine learning tools, treasurers could establish the rules under various circumstances and leave the banks to execute these on their behalf. In theory, it seems like a reasonable idea. In practice, this potentially raises more questions than it answers – more importantly, would you trust another institution to run your treasury overnight?</p>
<p>And consider this: if the outsourcing arrangement works that well, then why wouldn’t corporations shift more treasury activities to the banks? The dystopian vision of a single treasurer acting as a mere overseer of the machines will become a reality.</p>
<p>Of course, these ideas are formed through the lens of today. Who knows what consumers, businesses, treasury departments and banks will look like in a decade? But what is certain is that the emergent ‘intelligent’ treasury technology will pose a host of interesting questions, not least about who or what the treasurer of the future will be. It is now time to start thinking about the answers.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="talk-of-the-town">Talk of the town</h3>
<p>The annual EuroFinance jamboree heads to Barcelona this year and one topic that is, without doubt, going to dominate discussions is technology. However, we stand at an interesting point in time where treasury professionals have heard enough about the promise of technology and are beginning to demand solutions that can help them today.</p>
<p>Treasury Today Group’s recent Voice of Corporate Treasury (VoCT) Study, supported by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, highlights this fact. When quizzed on their technology needs, treasurers called for solutions that solved long-standing pain points such as cash visibility and cash flow forecasting.</p>
<p>There is less demand for innovative technologies like blockchain, but there remains plenty of interest. Indeed, our VoCT Study found that many treasurers are keen to explore blockchain in more depth and are hungry for information. The consensus seems to be that the technology has the potential to underpin a whole host of solutions that will solve many treasury pain points. It is just a waiting game for the banks and fintechs to roll out commercialised solutions.</p>
<p>Given the enduring treasury interest, blockchain will continue to receive plenty of airtime at EuroFinance and other conferences this autumn. In preparation for this, we have analysed the technology in this edition, tracing its growth, understanding how it is being used today and looking at where it is heading. One thing is for sure, it is not going away.</p>
<p>Technology is, in fact, a core theme running through this issue and our main feature looks at another ‘hot topic’, eCommerce. Unlike blockchain, eCommerce is having a revolutionary impact on business right now. Indeed, it seems that no company, or department within that company, is immune to the transformative effect it is having. We tell you all you need to know about the impact eCommerce is having and look at how digitally native companies and traditional industries are responding.</p>
<p>One final thought. How can treasury use technology to its fullest when it does not think digitally? Find out in our Q&amp;A feature.</p>

<h3 id="its-ten-years-since-the-crisis-a-lot-has-changed">It’s ten years since the crisis. A lot has changed</h3>
<p>It’s been a decade since the financial crisis transformed the lives of all of us that work in financial markets. Looking back now, few could have imagined the sizeable impact the crisis had and still has on the world today.</p>
<p>Treasury, in particular, has changed markedly since those infamous years. It is a much-clichéd phrase but the profession has, without a doubt, become more strategic. This has seen treasury teams around the world step out of the back office and become much more proactive within the organisation facilitating it to do more business.</p>
<p>Last month, the Treasury Today Adam Smith Awards celebrated their ten-year anniversary. In a lavish Gala Presentation Lunch held at Plaisterers’ Hall in the City of London, treasury professionals from around the world joined together to celebrate each other’s successes.</p>
<p>The event reflects a tremendous transformation seen over the years. Treasurers everywhere are now developing a completely different set of skills to those required a decade ago. In this edition’s Corporate View feature, Miguel Trinidad, Corporate Treasurer at Mexichem, talks about how he has evolved his skillset, allowing him to be the value-adding treasurer that he is today.</p>
<p>For Mexichem and a host of other businesses there is a meaningful move towards becoming more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Green bonds are one way to finance such a shift and in this edition’s financing article we chart the growth of the market and find out why it should be a product that all treasury teams should pay close attention too.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we take a comprehensive look at the new regulation that will govern European money market funds and find out what this will mean for corporate short-term investment policies. We also explore the latest developments in the KYC domain and see if this burdensome task is becoming any easier.</p>
<h4 id="congratulations-to-all-our-winning-corporates">Congratulations to all our winning corporates</h4>
<p>Finally, all of us here at the Treasury Today Group would again like to extend our sincere congratulations to all the winners in our 2017 Adam Smith Awards. More information about the winning solutions are available in our Adam Smith Awards Yearbook and on our website.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="treasury-risky-business">Treasury: risky business</h3>
<p>Risk management is a strong theme throughout this edition of Treasury Today, and with good reason. Risk management is a key concern for treasurers around the world, with many struggling to understand the direction the world is heading and what this means for their operations.</p>
<p>Brexit is a core concern for many corporates, with the recent rhetoric from both the UK government and the European Union doing little to calm the nerves. Some companies are therefore taking proactive steps. HSBC recently told Bloomberg that some of its larger clients were already looking to book more of their trade and foreign exchange activities from mainland Europe rather than London.</p>
<p>The recent announcement by UK Prime Minister Theresa May that there will be another general election on 8<sup>th</sup> June has only fuelled the uncertainty and created more questions. In this edition’s Insight and Analysis, we seek to demystify the Brexit process and answer some of the burning questions treasurers are asking.</p>
<p>Brexit is, however, just one of a plethora of risks that treasurers are currently managing, with global political and economic uncertainty, technological advancements and the accompanying cyber risk all causing headaches. In our Risk Management article, we investigate how treasurers can get a more complete view of risk across their enterprise and use tools and technology to manage such risks more effectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a lot of this risk is now emerging from developed markets, whereas emerging markets were previously perceived as being the riskiest. That being said, treasurers cannot afford to take their eyes off the emerging markets and we explore how best to structure and manage operations in these notoriously tricky markets.</p>
<p>What is clear, be it when managing risk or working with emerging markets, is that treasury cannot stand still. Anticipating changes in markets, challenging assumptions and taking proactive steps to mitigate any risks these changes may create, is a must.</p>
</div></div>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="shaping-up-for-the-future">Shaping up for the future</h3>
<p>The global financial crisis and its fallout are often cited as having enabled treasury departments around the world to become strategic partners to the business. And whilst this may be true to a certain extent – the crisis certainly provided treasury with a platform to shine – the department could have easily fallen out of the spotlight once the crisis abated.</p>
<p>But this hasn’t happened, treasury has gone from strength to strength, despite all the challenges. So yes, the crisis provided the platform, but it is the treasury profession’s work since then that has enabled the function to achieve and maintain a strategic mandate.</p>
<p>It is this evolution that we discuss in this edition of the magazine, particularly in our Treasury Practice feature where we take a renewed look at the role of the treasury in 2017, analysing how the profession has developed and thrived. We also pose the question of what the role needs to further succeed and become a true partner to the CFO?</p>
<p>More innovative technology is unsurprisingly something that many treasury professionals are calling for. The good news is that there are huge advances in this space which we address in this issue. We also investigate the evolution of the payments industry and how multiple market players are working to provide you with a more cost effective, transparent and efficient payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we assess the increasing importance of the user experience offered by banks and treasury technology providers. Indeed, this could be set to become an ever-important area as products are more commoditised and may be the key differentiator for treasurers when selecting providers.</p>
<p>March/April’s Corporate View, Janko Hahn, Head of Treasury Operations at Autoneum, sums up these two themes nicely as he talks about his career and how he has ensured that treasury remains at the forefront of the technology projects happening across the business. He also provides some interesting perspectives on why treasurers should strive to think globally, but act locally.</p>

<h3 id="adam-smith-awards-ten-years-on">Adam Smith Awards, ten years on…</h3>
<p>We have certainly come a long way since our Adam Smith Awards for Best Practice and Innovation was launched in 2008. Not only is this awards programme acknowledged as the industry benchmark for corporate treasury achievement, it is also now synonymous with best practice and innovation.</p>
<p>2017 is a major milestone for the Adam Smith Awards – it is the tenth anniversary. We are expecting record-breaking participation and nominations open on 31<sup>st</sup> January. Breaking records will not be easy given the number of entries we have received year-on-year from companies of all shapes, sizes, treasury structure and location but, so far, we have seen more nominations every year. Our judging panel each year faces the almost impossible task of selecting the winning corporates.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, the Adam Smith Awards has survived, indeed flourished, during a period of dramatic change on the political, regulatory, economic and technological fronts. Can you imagine thinking about something called blockchain, considering the UK not being in the European Union, a businessman called Trump being the US President and investors being charged to deposit funds ten years ago?</p>
<p>That said, the companies which have participated, and there have been hundreds, really have demonstrated some incredible dedication, resilience, intuition, teamwork and innovation. From Antalis, our inaugural Top Treasury Team winner in 2008 to Etihad Airways who were awarded this accolade last year, it has been a truly remarkable journey.</p>
<p>The categories in which nominations are submitted have also kept abreast of the changing times. The core treasury disciplines of cash, liquidity, risk, finance and foreign exchange management have been supplemented with additional categories to recognise the introduction of SEPA, working capital moving up the agenda, the growing importance of SWIFT amongst the corporate universe and the growing focus on diversity and emerging talent with our Woman of the Year and Rising Star categories respectively. Best in Class Treasury Solutions in Africa and the Middle East gave us regional focus, whilst Harnessing the Power of Technology captured the many solutions where technology is the key enabler. One to Watch and Judges’ Choice complete the landscape today.</p>
<p>So, turning to our tenth anniversary programme, we are extremely excited and want it to be our best yet but we can only achieve this with your continued support. Nominating your projects is a simple process. All you need to do is submit your entry via the online nomination forms which are available at <a href="/adamsmith">treasurytoday.com/adamsmith</a></p>
<p>Finally, if you are feeling confident why not pencil in a diary date of Thursday 22<sup>nd</sup> June at Plaisterers’ Hall in the City of London – that’s where our celebratory Gala Presentation Lunch will be held.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="the-end-of-the-madness">The end of the madness?</h3>
<p>As we reach the end of 2016 few would say that it has been a boring year. It may, in fact, go down as one of the most volatile years on record.</p>
<p>Most notably 2016 was the year the UK public voted to leave the European Union. The fallout of this has sent shockwaves around the world and significantly impacted the financial markets. Uncertainty around the UK and the European Union more broadly has become the order of the day and this looks set to continue in 2017 as Article 50 may or may not be triggered by the UK’s Conservative government. There will be challenges ahead, but for now, the prevailing advice for corporates is to ‘keep calm and carry on’.</p>
<p>Away from Europe, the US, whilst perhaps doing better economically, is going through its own crisis of identity. The battle between Clinton and Trump has been one of the most polarising and divisive presidential campaigns in recent times. Whether the aftershock impacts the US, its business environment and its place in the world more broadly remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For corporate treasury departments around the world, these and other issues have created a lot of headaches. But in a year that will probably be judged as volatile by history, there have been some bright spots. The wave of digitisation sweeping across the industry at present has gained momentum and there are promising signs that treasurers may be benefitting from some of these developments.</p>
<p>In this issue, we take an in-depth look at 2016 and the events that have shaped the year for corporate treasurers. We also review the negative (and positive) impacts that financial regulation is having on corporate treasury departments and speak to some industry experts about how to deal with this. In the last “what if” of this year, we speak to a number of corporates about what to do if and when a bank’s strategy no longer includes you.</p>
<h3 id="seasons-greetings">Season’s greetings</h3>
<p>Treasury Today would like to thank you again for your continued support throughout the year. Next year we will continue to deliver independent research, insight, and analysis as well as introducing some new features that are designed to highlight the latest trends impacting the profession.</p>
<p>2017 also marks the ten-year anniversary of the Adam Smith Awards, a tremendous milestone that you might want to celebrate with us. Why not start preparing your nomination now.</p>
<p>We wish all of our readers a most enjoyable festive period.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="think-about-the future-and-then-plan-for-it">Think about the future… and then plan for it</h3>
<p>Treasurers have always played a valuable role in the corporate machine but, as most participants and observers now know, the role has taken on greater operational significance. What’s more, it now bears the kind of strategic importance that once was reserved for the C-suite. In essence, treasurers have far greater responsibility than ever before.</p>
<p>Thinking about and planning for the future comes with the territory of heightened professional responsibility. It is with this understanding that Treasury Today brings this special publication to you. Treasury Foresights is about delivering to readers clear and concise information on core themes for the next year covering technology, operational models, payments, risk management, banking relationships, funding and investments, career development, and sustainability.</p>
<p>We have talked to a stellar line-up of experts, industry main-stays and renowned thinkers. Based on their experience and knowledge we tease out the issues of the moment. You may not agree with everything we have written but you will be better informed – and this is the point.</p>
<p>There can be no guarantees about the precise nature of what lies ahead and all treasurers know that the unexpected can and will happen. But ignoring or failing to recognise this is not an option for a modern forward-looking business. With the treasury and finance function having secured its position at the helm, whilst we would hesitate to say it is your duty to read this special publication from cover to cover, we would certainly urge you to use it to think about the future.</p>

<h3 id="brexit-what-to-do-now">Brexit… what to do now?</h3>
<p>What many people, industry experts, politicians, the media and professional commentators thought would never happen, has. On 24<sup>th</sup> June we all awoke to the news that the British people had voted by a margin of 52% to 48% in favour of leaving the European Union and financial markets around the world went into meltdown. UK Prime Minister David Cameron resigned. There was a coup to oust the leader of the Labour Party and a meeting of the European Union in Brussels came to no real decision as to exactly when the UK will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which would start the divorce process.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean for you, your company and, importantly, the treasury functions you are tasked to manage?</p>
<p>This is a complex issue and we want to invite you to tell us what you are doing and what advice you are receiving. Please let us know on or off the record at <a href="mailto:editorial@treasurytoday.com">editorial@treasurytoday.com</a> We will report back and be your information base for this important topic. You can also start a discussion or ask a question in our LinkedIn Brexit discussion group.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<div class="copy__body"><p>Your immediate focus is probably on managing market volatility but here are some of the issues and questions we are hearing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is my company credit rating likely to be impacted? Might this be linked to the recent downgrade by Moodys of the UK’s credit rating to negative?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does Brexit mean for SEPA?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is my supply chain likely to be impacted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I deploy my UK-based personnel in my EU-based operations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is my UK-domiciled bank likely to move its offices to the EU?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I review my treasury policy in any way?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I delay or bring forward projects?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should we be thinking about alternative suppliers/markets ex-EU?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should we be considering Ireland as an EU base now that the UK has voted to leave the EU?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we are in M&amp;A dialogue, are there any changes to competition law which affect M&amp;As?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we have any legal contracts/documentation which reference EU legislation which may be impacted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the likely approach to renegotiating the UK’s trade arrangements with the EU?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Membership of the EEA (eg Norway)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership of EFTA (eg Switzerland)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customs Union (eg Turkey)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WTO rules, or,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bespoke deal</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the likely impact for my company’s trading arrangements with the EU?</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Our Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Studies have been leading the industry since 2009. Thanks to the 3,500 of you who have taken part, we have built up a very clear picture of the key issues and challenges affecting corporate treasury and, importantly, provided some of the KPI metrics against which you have been able to benchmark yourselves.</p>
<p>We have developed and improved our research with a new, exclusive ‘Voice of Corporate Treasury Study’ for 2016.</p>
<p>We are in a unique position to carry out this research and we sincerely hope you will continue to support us by participating again.</p>
<p>The primary aim is to build up a clear picture of what you are doing now and how you view the outlook for 2017 in the key areas of corporate treasury and finance. This will enable you to see how you compare to your peers and, importantly, deliver clear direction to your banks/service providers on the solutions you need to manage your treasuries more effectively and efficiently in the future.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the study will be to identify the hot issues, key trends, strategies and future solutions you require across the cash, liquidity, working capital management, trade, payments, collections, foreign exchange, funding, investments and cards solutions.</p>
<p>We are conducting the study concurrently across four key regions so we are well-placed to highlight any major regional differences.</p>
<p>So, whether you are based in Bangkok, Brisbane or Beijing and haven’t yet completed the study, please do so now to have your voice heard and to receive your copy of the results when they are published.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support. Your participation will help us to serve you better.</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="a-time-to-reflect">A time to reflect…</h3>
<p>As we start a new year, the global financial crisis seems like a distant memory – or does it? At the beginning of January 2008, The World Bank predicted global economic growth would slow as the credit crunch hit the richest nations. By mid-January, global stock markets had suffered their biggest falls since the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre and the US Fed had slashed rates by three quarters of a percentage point to 3.5% – its biggest cut in 25 years. At the end of the month, major bond insurer, MBIA, announced losses of $2.3bn, blaming its exposure to the US subprime mortgage crisis.</p>
<p>February 2008 also delivered some big-name casualties as news from the US suggested worldwide losses stemming from the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market could reach $400bn. Northern Rock was about to be nationalised and Wall Street’s fifth-largest bank, Bear Stearns, was acquired by its larger rival, J.P. Morgan Chase. As we approached the end of Q1, the IMF warned that potential losses from the credit crunch could reach $1trn, possibly even higher.</p>
<p>RBS soon announced plans to raise money from its shareholders with a £12bn rights issue – the biggest in UK corporate history. This trend was repeated in the following month with Swiss bank UBS, one of the worst affected by the credit crunch, launching a $15.5bn rights issue to cover some of the $37bn it lost on assets linked to US mortgage debt. Barclays announced plans to raise £4.5bn in a share issue and The Qatar Investment Authority, the state-owned investment arm of the Gulf state, announced it was investing £1.7bn in the UK clearer.</p>
<p>In September 2008, Lloyds TSB announced it was taking over HBOS, Washington Mutual closed down and sold to J.P. Morgan Chase, and Fortis was partially nationalised to ensure it survived. As we moved into Q3, Germany announced a €50bn rescue plan to save one of the country’s biggest banks and RBS, Lloyds TSB and HBOS had an injection from the UK government totalling £37bn. But perhaps that’s enough about 2008.</p>
<p>Whilst 2015 hasn’t seen the financial sector change to that extent, the year has certainly been eventful – even without dwelling on the FX fixing and LIBOR rigging scandals. The slowdown in the Chinese economy has been a major headwind. Rolls-Royce, Jaguar Land Rover and luxury brand Burberry are just three companies having to review their contracts with the country as a result.</p>
<p>Volkswagen is the subject of a scandal involving more than 11m vehicles found to be using software which deliberately misreported nitrous oxide emissions. One report has suggested the scandal could cost VW $86bn. TalkTalk and Vtech were victims of cyber-attacks and, as this is written, Paris has just been in the news for very different reasons. The terrorist attacks there, and elsewhere around the globe in 2015, shocked us all and highlighted the continued threat on our lives and businesses.</p>
<p>And as attendees at the UN Climate Change Conference, also in Paris, grapple with the issue and consequences of a two degree rise in temperature, it is only natural to approach the coming year with a slightly sombre outlook. The issues you face every day in your finance and treasury departments are certainly put into perspective.</p>
<p>International relationships around the globe are extremely fragile to say the least and the future is so unpredictable; never before have the stakes been so high on all fronts.</p>
<p>Treasury Today wishes all our readers a happier, more prosperous and safer 2016.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="predicting-the-future-or-is-it-too-late">Predicting the future… or is it too late?</h3>
<p>October 21<sup>st</sup> 2015 has just passed. Those of you who are familiar with the American science-fiction adventure movie ‘Back to the Future’ will appreciate the significance of this date. For those of you who aren’t, it is interesting to observe that some of the predictions in the film have actually come true. Personal drones, tablets and mobile payment technology, biometric devices, hands-free gaming consoles, smart clothing and wearable technology, video phones, waste-fuelled cars, hover-boards and video glasses are all a reality. Wal-Mart Stores is even applying to US regulators for permission to test drones for home delivery, curb-side pickup and checking warehouse inventories, as it goes head-to-head with Amazon in using these aerial devices to fulfil online orders.</p>
<p>There is clearly validity in those predictions dating back 30 years and, although perhaps not as impressive, we can try to predict what might happen in the world of treasury and finance in 2016 and beyond.</p>
<p>In recent months we have witnessed the likes of foreign exchange and LIBOR rigging scandals at the banks, a potentially catastrophic exposé at Volkswagen and various cyberattacks on numerous websites. All of these examples have a potential impact on the corporate treasury function. But what, if anything, could a corporate treasurer have put in place to mitigate the risk of the immense damage to corporate reputation that such events inevitably cause? This is something we will look at in 2016.</p>
<h3>Stay safe</h3>
<p>Cyber security is set to remain a huge topic in 2016, affecting not just reputational risk but the increased threat to data security. This is an area where treasurers have always been careful, even slowing the adoption of mobile solutions in the corporate banking space. Which way will this go in 2016? We’ll keep our eyes open and ears to the ground, reporting on what we find.</p>
<p>The rise of words such as cryptocurrency, cyber-crime, digitisation, bitcoin, blockchain and FinTech has required the corporate treasury function to learn a whole new language and vocabulary. Block chain technology, in particular, which is also being referred to as ‘distributed ledger’, is a very hot topic with bankers. But they still seem to be at the ‘kicking the tyres’ stage with no-one yet taking the plunge. Most corporates can sit back and wait – if you already accept Bitcoin, you are several steps ahead of the rest of us. We hope you’ll tell us your story.</p>
<p>What is abundantly clear, however, is the renewed focus on risk and the many forms in which it manifests itself: currency and commodity price volatility; cyber-attacks; political instability; fraud; counterparties; and your supply chain – all face very real threats that must be managed.</p>
<h3>Equality in the Boardroom? Not quite</h3>
<p>It was reported this week that the FTSE 100 firms in the UK have met a voluntary target of 25% of women board members. Lord Davies, former Trade Minister, has now said this should be replaced by a new target of 33% of women board members at FTSE 350 firms by 2020. The issue of quotas has been fiercely debated through the Treasury Today Women in Treasury initiative. The issue was tabled for a Women in Treasury webinar on 23<sup>rd</sup> November in which we reported the results of the 2015 Global Study. If you would like to hear what was said please see <a href="/webinars">treasurytoday.com/webinars</a>.</p>
<h3>Reader Survey</h3>
<p>Thank you to all our readers who participated in our Reader Survey which recently closed. We have taken on board all you have said and will ensure we address the points you have raised as we build our plans for 2016.</p>

<h3 id="control-the-ball-and-you-control-the-game">Control the ball and you control the game</h3>
<p>Having just returned from the EuroFinance International Cash and Treasury Management conference in Copenhagen, it is perhaps worth reflecting on some of the key themes that emerged. The focus of this year’s event was fitness; keeping your treasury function fit for purpose, fit for growth and fit for the future. These themes were addressed on consecutive days under the banners of flexibility, strength and speed, and sustainability.</p>
<p>A variety of speakers presented on best practices, as well as topics such as the rise of FinTech, coping with volatility, and how to navigate the future against a backdrop of uncertainty, to name but a few. Greece’s near Eurozone exit, the possibility of a ‘Brexit’, the stock market fall and growth downturn in China, commodities and oil price volatility, the migration crisis and low interest rate environment were also hotly debated. On the subject of a possible ‘Brexit’, José Manuel Barroso ex-European Commission President commented: “It’d be very negative if the UK leaves…indeed, it’d be a disaster for Europe. I hope it [UK exit] won’t happen, I have fundamental trust in the wisdom of British people and I believe they won’t vote against their interests. Britain will lose if it does leave the EU as it is the biggest trading bloc in the world – representing 25% of global output.” Perhaps many of you are already running impact analysis scenarios on the possibility of this happening.</p>
<p>Lord Stuart Rose, former CEO and Chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, now at Ocado, spoke about how treasury used to be viewed as a service function but is now regarded as absolutely central to a business. “Finance should be at the centre of initiatives and no CEO worth his (or her) salt should forget this,” he said.</p>
<p>We also heard Rupert Pennant-Rea, former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, share his thoughts on why the view that India will replace China as the next major emerging market is simply not true. India is not as big as China in economic terms (India is $2trn versus China $11trn), India has a smaller percentage of its GDP from the manufacturing sector and India has no immediate infrastructure growth whereas in China such projects “just happen,” he explained.</p>
<p>After the various bank-led client events had concluded on the evening of the opening day, delegates arrived fresh and early on day two to hear about mind-set, nutrition, movement and recovery, again reinforcing the fitness theme. Finally, delegates heard from former Game Changer at global sports brand Nike on the linkages between sports science principles and business leadership. “I believe every organisation needs to learn to look after the ‘ball’. In business the ‘ball’ could be big data,” suggested Dr Erez Morag, CEO and Founder of Acceler8 Performance Ltd.</p>
<p>Treasury fitness, in his view, is all about understanding the details of the game: the processes, the moving parts, the connections. And having worked with some of the most successful sportspeople on the planet, there is clearly a great deal of value in Dr Morag’s beliefs.</p>
<p>Perhaps the big challenge for you is identifying what the ‘ball’ is in your treasury organisation, where it is, and how to keep control of it.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="is-your-treasury-fit-for-purpose">Is your treasury fit for purpose?</h3>
<p>This issue of Treasury Today coincides with our attendance at EuroFinance’s International Cash and Treasury Management Conference 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Indeed, we expect many of you may be attending the conference too. The theme this year is ‘keeping treasury fit for purpose, fit for growth and fit for the future’ – something that many treasurers will be thinking about as they take the time to step away from their desks and look towards 2016.</p>
<p>As we have reported frequently throughout 2015, companies continue to face major challenges with regard to new regulations, compliance and threats to security on a number of levels. Currency, stock market and commodity price volatility only compound these issues. Add to the mix economic and political uncertainty and the role of the treasury function gets harder still.</p>
<p>Despite all the barriers that exist though, we still see remarkable companies doing remarkable things, especially where corporate treasury is concerned. We view the majority of treasury departments we see as striving for continuous improvement and doing the right thing to ensure they remain fit for purpose. Nonetheless, we can all learn from best in class solutions and the best practices being deployed by our peers; corporate treasury is no exception as you will see from many of the articles in this edition.</p>
<p>Our 2015 Adam Smith Awards, now in their eighth year, are always a good barometer of best practice and innovation and this year’s submissions were no exception. A record 210 submissions from 23 different countries were received. Some of the winning entries are being showcased, commencing 30<sup>th</sup> September, as part of our educational Adam Smith webinar series. For more information please visit <a href="/webinars">treasurytoday.com/webinars</a>. The benchmarking studies we have conducted in recent years also help to inform us, and therefore you, about what is happening in the treasury space, what is being measured and the actual metrics being achieved.</p>
<p>If you are attending the Copenhagen event, please do visit the Treasury Today stand and talk to us about the steps you are taking to get your treasury fit for purpose. Also, pick up your copy of our new Digitisation Handbook and take the opportunity to tell us what else we can do to make your professional life easier. Our MD, Richard Parkinson; Group Publisher, Angela Berry; and Research Director, John Nicholas will be pleased to discuss your needs and bring you up-to-date on what we already have planned for 2016. Why not have your say and influence what we will be doing? If you are not planning to be in Copenhagen we would still like to hear from you, so please email <a href="mailto:john.nicholas@treasurytoday.com">john.nicholas@treasurytoday.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="women-in-treasury-not-just-for-girls">Women in Treasury: not just for girls</h3>
<p>It’s a standing joke that the industry needs a ‘Women in Treasury’ initiative because every day at the office is just like a ‘Men in Treasury’ forum. And whilst one of the drivers behind Treasury Today’s pioneering Women in Treasury campaign – which began in 2013 – was, and still is, to give women in the (male-dominated) profession greater recognition and a platform for inspiration, as counterintuitive as it might seem, it’s not all aimed at the fairer sex.</p>
<p>In fact, we recognise that instilling a true gender balance in the treasury community means bringing men and women together to better understand the challenges that stereotyping or biases can give rise to within a corporate treasury environment. Rather than focusing on the negatives of outmoded ways of thinking, however, Women in Treasury is about building the best possible team and working environment by embracing diversity. That’s why we’re encouraging all treasury professionals – regardless of gender or job title – to attend this year’s London Women in Treasury Forum, to be held on 10<sup>th</sup> September.</p>
<p>The event starts at noon with a pre-lunch networking drinks reception during which Angela Berry, Group Publisher of Treasury Today, will present a summary of the findings of our 2015 Women in Treasury Study, supported by RBS. This will be followed by lunch, during which a lively and no doubt controversial panel discussion will take place, focusing on the key issues highlighted by our Women in Treasury Study.</p>
<p>This year’s panellists will include: Christine McCarthy, Senior EVP and Chief Financial Officer of the Walt Disney Company (Christine is also our Adam Smith Awards Woman of the Year 2015), Debra Todd, VP Global Treasury Services, BP and Jennifer Boussuge, Head of Global Transaction Services, EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Everyone attending the Forum will have an opportunity to put their own questions to the panellists, as well as joining in the wider discussion, and networking with their peers. And previous years’ attendees will testify that for just a few hours of your time, the return on investment from this event is significant.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<h3 id="fraud-the-pitfalls-of-growth">Fraud: the pitfalls of growth</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that companies are firmly focusing on growth again. Yet, at a time when market volatility is high, geopolitical stability is being rocked, and international regulatory regimes are growing ever tighter, growth can be tricky to find.</p>
<p>So, as corporate managers are being pushed harder by boards and shareholders to find new revenue streams, concerns are mounting that some companies are not only taking a disproportionate amount of risk, but also encouraging unethical behaviour. UK supermarket Tesco overstating its profits by £263m, as discovered in late 2014, is just one such example. More recently, US bank Wells Fargo has been accused by (and is being sued by) the City of Los Angeles of pressuring employees into committing fraud in order to meet growth goals.</p>
<p>Documents lodged with the court reportedly suggest that the retail bank’s employees felt under so much pressure to perform that they believed their only option was to be fired, or to commit fraudulent acts as a means to reach the over-ambitious sales targets they had been set. Speaking at a news conference in early May, City Attorney Mike Feuer said that “in its push for growth, Wells Fargo often elevated its profits over the legal rights of its customers.”</p>
<p>Wells Fargo has said that a handful of rogue employees are to blame, and that these few have been either disciplined or let go. Nevertheless, the bank’s performance quota system that supposedly led to fraud being committed in the first place apparently remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Just as unattainable growth targets can foster internal fraud, companies moving into high-growth markets (often without doing significant local research) may also be opening up their ranks to an increased risk of fraud, bribery and corruption. According to EY’s Europe, Middle East, India and Africa Fraud Survey 2015, 61% of respondents in so-called rapid-growth markets believe that bribery and corruption are widespread in their country. The five countries with the largest perceived bribery and corruption risk were: Croatia (92%), Kenya (90%), Slovenia (87%), Serbia (84%), and Portugal (82%).</p>
<p>Since organisations across the globe lose approximately 5% of their revenue to internal fraud each year, and among the most common departments for fraud to occur in are finance, accounting and purchasing, employee fraud should be high on the treasurer’s watch list. Granted, the potential for internal fraud comes in many different guises – from straightforward theft through to opportunistic crimes whereby a procedural loophole or a weakness in the company’s systems is exploited – that it can be very hard to guard against. Nevertheless, it is part of the job description of every responsible treasurer to ensure that the risk of internal fraud is managed as effectively as possible.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="we-will-all-pay-for-over-regulation">We will all pay for over-regulation</h3>
<p>You only have to talk to a banker these days and the increasing cost of regulation is the first or second topic of conversation. In fact, it is sometimes the first and the second topic of conversation.</p>
<p>You only have to peruse any of the banks’ recent results and the increasing cost of compliance is not only reported, but also the subject of specific comment. The banks cannot do much about this and one could say they brought it on themselves. But the level of regulation is now becoming overwhelming as each government introduces its own version of the rules. Banks operating in multiple jurisdictions find themselves facing different versions of the same kind of regulation, each with its own local variation.</p>
<p>You only have to go to an industry conference and the issues being discussed are the same. At the recent ICC Banking Commission Annual Meeting in Singapore, the discussion kicked off with commentary on how banks were exiting some areas of trade finance because of the increasing compliance and risk costs. New Basel ratios are requiring more capital for the banks’ trade business. Doing business with low risk-weighted multinationals is becoming more attractive than doing business with other more highly risk-rated companies.</p>
<p>You only have to start looking at the increased capital requirements being imposed on the banking groups and then wonder where the return on this increased capital is going to come from. Global systemically important banks, also referred to as ‘too big to fail’, face even higher capital requirements under the recently clarified TLAC (Total Loss Absorbency Capacity) requirements.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Safer banks taking less risk. But, there is another unfortunate side effect that is beginning to emerge. The regulation is encouraging banks to shrink their balance sheets to meet capital requirements. This may mean exiting or selling existing business streams or passing (selling) portfolios of risk to others, namely, other investors who do not have the same capital constraints, such as investment funds of various sorts. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Yes it does, and the funds are not stupid. They are hesitant and seeking only the best portfolios of risk. So this encourages the banks to adopt business models that create, package and distribute large volumes of the best quality assets – loans and other facilities to the strongest corporate credits. Everyone else will start to have fewer financing options.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new liquidity rules are making short-term deposits from customers much less attractive. Have you been offered 30 day deposits yet? One year deposits will be sought as we move towards 2018. So much for corporate liquidity requirements with money market funds also facing challenging regulation.</p>
<p>Even the most basic functions such as opening a bank account are being affected, as our recent webinar with the Singapore ACTS showed. Just establishing a new banking relationship is fraught with evolving requirements, as KYC (Know Your Customer) is becoming KYCC (Know Your Customer’s Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) is becoming ML/TF (anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing). This is leading banks to exit their relationships with other banks, let alone their corporate customers.</p>
<p>Banks may be safer, but they are being over regulated and their ability to meet customers’ basic banking and financing requirements is being seriously hampered. We will all end up paying for this increased regulation.</p>

<h5>Nominations for the 2015 awards are now closed</h5>
<p>Being good at your job isn’t the only prerequisite for getting ahead in your career. Today, it’s not just what you know that matters; it’s also who you know. Having a good profile at work is essential for your career. It means being trusted with the best projects and being first in line for promotion.</p>
<p>There are many steps that you can take within the company to raise your profile, from volunteering for assignments or representing the team at cross-functional meetings, to finding a good mentor. But nothing quite beats an independent external endorsement of your hard work and ability.</p>
<p>That’s why Treasury Today has introduced a new ‘Rising Star’ category to the Adam Smith Awards 2015 – to help recognise young talent coming through the treasury ranks. Are you a junior within treasury and are people already seeing your potential? Have you excelled in a professional qualification, or in a particular treasury project? You can either nominate yourself, or submit a nomination on behalf of a colleague who you think fits this category.</p>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable promoting yourself for an award (which you shouldn’t – if the decision makers in your organisation don’t know who you are, they also won’t know what you’re capable of), there’s always the opportunity to help raise your whole team’s profile instead by submitting a nomination in one of our subject-led categories. These cover everything from cash and working capital management to bank relationships, technology, foreign exchange and corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>We also have two new geographical categories for 2015: Best in Class Treasury Solution in Africa and Best in Class Treasury Solution in the Middle East. The Treasury Today Woman of the Year and Top Treasury Team awards are also open for nominations.</p>
<p>In addition to raising awareness of individuals and the overall treasury function within the organisation, winning an Adam Smith Award is a great way to evidence innovation and thought leadership, as well as demonstrating excellence to your peers, partners, clients and investors.</p>
<!-- <p>Everything you need, including the nomination form, can be found at <a href="/adamsmith">treasurytoday.com/adamsmith</a> -->

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="on-a-separate-note">On a SEPArate note</h3>
<p>In recent weeks, regulatory talk has understandably turned to the European Parliament’s proposed money market reforms. And with ongoing concerns around the knock-on effect of Basel III, bank ring-fencing measures in the UK, and the US’s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), for example, it is little surprise that the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) has fallen under the radar of late. Yet the next SEPA deadline is now less than 12 months away and some corporates have much to achieve in that time.</p>
<p>As treasurers will remember, the main phase of the migration in the euro area was completed on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2014, after the European authorities agreed to a six month ‘grace period’. But what some treasurers may have overlooked is the fact that there are compliance requirements mandated by the SEPA Regulation applicable as of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2016 as well.</p>
<p>Top of the list here is that, on that date, the ability for payment service providers (PSPs) to offer conversion of legacy in-country payments and/or direct debit formats into a SEPA-compliant ISO 20022 XML format will expire. As such, corporates and public entities in the euro area will have to send XML formatted files to their bank(s) from the beginning of February 2016, in line with the provisions of the SEPA Regulation.</p>
<p>The ‘IBAN only’ rule also comes into effect as of that date, meaning that statement of the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) for cross-border SEPA payments (and national payments in the countries where an extension was granted) will no longer be necessary – only the IBAN will be required. On a related note, PSPs will no longer be able to provide consumers with Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) to International Bank Account Number (IBAN) conversion services for national payment transactions from that date either.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the European Payments Council’s website states that niche products (credit transfer and direct debit instruments with a cumulative market share of less than 10% in any given EU Member State) which have previously been granted an exemption must also be SEPA-compliant as of the 1<sup>st</sup> February 2016.</p>
<p>So, for those corporates in the euro area, the message here is that SEPA migration is not yet over. And, as with all regulatory requirements, expert advice should be sought sooner rather than later around the true impact of this deadline on your company’s treasury function.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="euro-mmfs-under-further-pressure">Euro MMFs under further pressure</h3>
<p>With the prospect of transformative regulation still hanging over the sector, Europe’s money market funds (MMFs) continue to operate against a backdrop of uncertainty. Recent moves by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Swiss National Bank (SNB) are only making matters more complex – for those in the industry, and for corporate treasurers who invest in the funds.</p>
<p>According to a research note released by ratings agency Fitch at the end of January, the yields on Swiss franc-denominated MMFs could turn negative over the coming weeks following the SNB’s decision to cut (already negative) benchmark rates further, as well as ditching the currency’s cap against the euro. Fitch, and its rival Moody’s, also agree that the ECB’s large-scale bond buying programme will likely keep yields on prime euro-denominated MMFs extremely low for a prolonged period, hastening the advent of negative yields for this type of fund. Investors in euro-denominated government MMFs have been experiencing negative yields since the end of 2014.</p>
<p>“The persistent low interest rate environment in the Eurozone, exacerbated by the ECB’s decision to cut its deposit rate to -0.2% in September 2014, has already significantly eroded returns for euro-denominated MMFs. As of 23<sup>rd</sup> January 2015, the average yield for euro prime constant net asset value MMFs was one basis point, and this is despite the fact that managers are already waiving most or all of their management fees,” said Vanessa Robert, Senior Credit Officer at Moody’s, in a recent report.</p>
<p>Of course, negative yields may lead to outflows from MMFs as investors reassess their holdings. But the scale of the impact is uncertain as low-risk alternatives are also likely to offer negative yields, explains Fitch. This puts everyone in a difficult place. The fund managers must weigh up the best mechanisms to maintain a stable unit value, without significantly increasing credit risk or portfolio maturity. Meanwhile, treasurers must decide what to do with the money they have already invested in MMFs, when the options elsewhere are few and far between.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="treasurers-behaving-badly">Treasurers behaving badly</h3>
<p>At the start of a New Year, it’s traditional to review our priorities and path for the future. We often think about what we’d like to achieve and what we can do better over the next 12 months – both in a personal and professional capacity. But to make this review a truly useful process, it’s important to take a ‘warts and all’ approach. Frequently, the biggest mistake people, and companies, make when looking to improve their situation is sugar-coating their current predicament or refusing to fully acknowledge their weaknesses.</p>
<p>These kind of mental biases affect every decision that we make, whether we recognise it or not. And when it comes to financial decision-making, cognitive and emotional influences can be so strong as to distort markets – the study of this effect is called ‘behavioural finance’. Of course, you might not think that, as a trained finance professional, these kinds of biases would affect you, but remember that these are innate tendencies, not conscious behaviours.</p>
<p>Take prospect theory, for instance. This outlines how human beings value gains and losses differently and will take decisions on perceived gains rather than perceived losses. So, if a treasurer is given two equal choices – such as the opportunity to invest in a fund, but one is expressed in terms of possible gains and the other in potential losses – they would most likely choose the former.</p>
<p>Experts in behavioural finance believe there to be over 120 such biases which affect the way we make investment decisions. Herd mentality is a well-known one; where we follow what our peers are doing simply because, well, everyone else is doing it. Many will also be familiar with the dangers of hindsight bias and overconfidence when investing. There are other, less obvious, tendencies that many of us harbour, however, which might make you think twice about whether your investment decisions are truly rational. Take confirmation bias for example. This involves being receptive to information which affirms your ideas and confirms your beliefs, while disregarding or devaluing contradictory information. The best example of this is the Dot-Com Boom – despite repeated warnings from analysts, many investors simply carried on regardless; a mindset that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan memorably described as “irrational exuberance”.</p>
<p>Another interesting psychological quirk is outcome bias. This is the tendency to base your investment decisions on previous outcomes, such as past returns, as opposed to thoroughly examining the reasons why the outcome was positive or negative. Ring any bells?</p>
<p>Of course, behavioural finance is by no means an exact science. But it does provide an interesting complement to traditional financial theory that strategic treasurers may want to bear in mind when planning for the year ahead.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="reflections-and-projections">Reflections and projections</h3>
<p>It’s hard to believe that the end of the year is almost upon us. For those in the corporate treasury profession, 2014 has been another rollercoaster ride. There have been highs; there have been lows; and there has been an overwhelming amount of regulation. Indeed, the beginning of the year was dominated by regulatory change, not least EMIR and SEPA.</p>
<p>Getting ready for the start of trade reporting under EMIR was a major agenda item (some would say ‘headache’) for many corporate treasurers. Rather unsurprisingly, a significant proportion of corporate organisations missed the 12<sup>th</sup> February 2014 deadline for reporting and teething problems also occurred at certain trade repositories (TRs). In short, it was a half-hearted launch, with obvious areas of non-compliance.</p>
<p>But for officials at the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), sticking to their deadline and keeping their pride intact seemed to be a better option than postponing it until 100% compliance could be achieved. Since launch, more and more technology solutions have come to market to help all parties in derivative trades to meet the reporting requirements efficiently. Banks have also stepped in to help out their corporate clients with delegated reporting services.</p>
<p>What isn’t yet clear is quite how and when the sanctions for trade reporting errors or non-compliance will be applied. Any TRs breaking the rules will be sanctioned by ESMA, whereas participants in a trade are subject to fines from national regulators (which could apparently reach up to €5.4m in Sweden). As of the beginning of December 2014, TRs will need to report any trades that they reject due to missing information to ESMA. This could mark the start of the authorities looking to pinpoint – and punish – non-compliance.</p>
<p>While there was no backtracking on EMIR, it was an entirely different scenario for SEPA. With the migration deadline set for 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 – and corporates having been building up to this date for years – the European Commission announced a quite unexpected change of heart. It allowed a so-called ‘grace period’ giving businesses an additional six months to prepare their new systems before legacy payments systems were switched off.</p>
<p>Welcomed by many smaller companies, this rather last minute reprieve frustrated many larger corporates who had dedicated a large amount of time to getting ready for the deadline. Often, this dedication was to the detriment of other treasury projects, and to personal lives too – with holidays (and even weddings!) put on hold – so the frustration was quite understandable. Nevertheless, those that were ready by the February deadline doubtless reaped the benefits of early SEPA compliance.</p>
<p>Although these two significant deadlines are now behind us, both SEPA and EMIR will continue to require attention over the year ahead. Projects that were rushed through can no doubt be optimised. Those outside of the Eurozone must work towards the 31<sup>st</sup> October 2016 SEPA deadline. And mandatory central clearing of OTC derivatives is slated to begin in H1 2015 under EMIR (although the vast majority or corporates will be exempt from this, it is still worth noting what will be on your banks’ to-do lists).</p>
<p>Other regulations to keep a close eye on over the next 12 months include bank resolution measures, Basel III and the Financial Transactions Tax. Of course, regulation is just one piece of the overall treasury landscape, but it is likely that 2015 will be another year that is overshadowed by change.</p>

<h3 id="cybercrime-means-business">Cybercrime means business</h3>
<p>Despite growing investment in measures to counter cyber-attack, an increasing number of banks and corporations are being caught short by fraudsters online. Given the pervasive reach of the internet, no country is immune from the threat of cybercrime. Nigeria, our Country Focus in this edition of Treasury Today, is no exception. A cyber heist on the nation’s banks in September saw criminals get away with more than $35m. Since 2013, Nigeria is now thought to have lost almost $120m to internet-based fraud.</p>
<p>Even the European Central Bank (ECB) has been hit by cybercriminals. In July, hackers stole email addresses and contact details from the bank before sending an anonymous – and audacious – email attempting to extort money from the ECB in return for the stolen information!</p>
<p>But it’s not only banks that are at risk: in September, it emerged that North American home improvement retailer Home Depot had been the victim of a credit card breach. Reports suggest that the breach could be considerably larger than the theft of the card data of 40 million Target customers in late 2013. Home Depot said in a statement that shoppers who have visited its stores from April onwards could be impacted by the breach.</p>
<p>What this incident highlights is the fact that cybercrime is not just about money. It’s about data – and also about reputations. Goodwill and loyalty can be destroyed in an instant by data breaches that undermine customers’ trust.</p>
<h4 id="the-fight-against-cybercrime">The fight against cybercrime</h4>
<p>On the plus side, banks and companies are fighting back with new technologies that should make it harder for the cybercriminals to strike. From next year, for example, UK corporate clients of Barclays Bank will be able to sign in and access online services and portals using a new form of authentication technology – one that uses unique finger vein patterns. Developed in partnership with Hitachi, the new technology will be a first for the UK banking industry.</p>
<p>Law enforcers are also getting tough on cybercrime. The European Police Office, Europol, has launched a cybercrime task force to address the problem in the EU and beyond. The law enforcement agency said the scheme, initially a pilot, would target threats including banking Trojans, Botnets and online fraud.</p>
<p>While cybersecurity and the sophistication of detection and counter measures advance, so do the cybercriminals – the challenge for banks and corporates is to stay one step ahead.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="beginning-of-the-end-of-cnav-funds">Beginning of the end of CNAV funds</h3>
<p>After much prevaricating and political posturing, and with new commissioners making the decisions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US has adopted new rules for regulating money market funds (MMFs) in a 3-2 vote.</p>
<p>Institutional prime MMFs in the US (including institutional municipal MMFs) will be required to maintain a floating net asset value (FNAV, also often referred to as variable net asset value, or VNAV) for sales and redemptions based on the current market value of the securities in their portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place.</p>
<p>The requirement would result in the daily share prices of these MMFs fluctuating with changes in the market-based value of the funds’ investments. The point is that the funds will no longer be allowed to use the special pricing and valuation conventions that currently permit them to maintain a constant share price of $1.00. Effectively this moves the funds from penny, or 1%, rounding, which allows minor fluctuations to be hidden to basis point, 1/100<sup>th</sup> of 1%, rounding.</p>
<p>Fund managers had hoped they would be able to continue to provide constant net asset value (CNAV) funds, providing there was a provision for liquidity fees and the funds were able to impose redemption gates (in other words, the ability to temporarily halt withdrawals) at times of stress. But the SEC has chosen to adopt these requirements in addition to, not instead of, the new VNAV rules outlined above.</p>
<p>So, consultation and debate are over. The new SEC rules are here. The rules have been adopted and will take effect after a two-year transition period.</p>
<p>Legislation being considered in Europe has been pushed back by the recent elections to the European Parliament. But the odds are now heavily stacked in favour of similar legislation being adopted in Europe. Expect to hear lots of talk about level playing fields and congruent regulation.</p>
<h3 id="wait-and-see">Wait and see</h3>
<p>When polled, corporate treasurers say they like CNAV funds and will not use VNAV funds, but alternatives will be limited. Before dismissing the VNAV option, the wiser treasurer will investigate and understand the impact of the new legislation.</p>
<p>Corporates investing in the European-based funds can wait and see what the new EU economic and monetary affairs committee decides whilst keeping an eye on the bigger picture. Particularly important is the effect that the new Basel III rules will have on banks’ appetite for short-term deposits.</p>
<p>Any new money fund legislation must be accompanied by realistic rules on tax and accounting treatment of VNAV funds. This is already happening in the US, with the Internal Revenue Service putting in place simplified tax accounting arrangements as part of the SEC’s reforms.</p>
<p>Providing this happens as new legislation is adopted in Europe, corporates will find VNAV funds are an attractive short-term investment. They will educate their treasury committees and amend their treasury policies accordingly.</p>
<p>Our bet is that the MMF industry we know today will survive and may well, over time, see higher volumes than today. This may the beginning of the end of CNAV funds but it is also the beginning of VNAV funds becoming an investment in which corporates should and will invest.</p>

<h3 id="e-invoicing-gains-momentum">E-invoicing gains momentum</h3>
<p>It’s been a busy few months on the e-invoicing front, with a number of positive and noteworthy developments. In this issue, we’ll highlight some of the most recent statistics and interesting e-invoicing news, but we really would urge treasurers to keep e-invoicing firmly on their radar as 2014 progresses. After all, in an environment where businesses of all sizes continue to focus on finding efficiencies and getting smarter about the way they work, while adding strategic value and easing financial pressures, e-invoicing is a tried and tested solution.</p>
<p>According to a report published in May this year by Billentis and sponsored by Ricoh, businesses across Europe can achieve a 60 to 80% cost saving by adopting e-invoicing, compared to traditional paper-based processes. What is more, e-invoicing projects typically yield payback in as little as six to 18 months from the point of implementation, the report notes.</p>
<p>As a result, an increasing number of companies seem to be picking up on the quick wins and longer-term benefits of e-invoicing. And those already using e-invoicing appear to be extending their programmes, rolling them out to new geographies, or choosing new partners to help them garner even greater benefits through invoice automation.</p>
<p>Indeed, recent data from The European E-invoicing Service Providers Association (EESPA) looking at actual transaction volumes of EESPA members showed a 19% growth rate in processed invoices, rising from 706m in 2012 to 840m in 2013. Constituting the 840m, were 603m invoices categorised as either business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-government (B2G), and 237m business-to-consumer (B2C) invoices.</p>
<p>The Billentis Report predicts ongoing growth in this area, anticipating a 15% increase in the annual volume of B2C electronic bills and invoices processed in Europe during 2014, and a 22% increase in B2B and B2G. The drivers for this growth lay not only with the obvious cost and efficiency benefits for corporates, but also with the significantly increased awareness of e-invoicing in the public sector and the implementation of clearer regulations and guidelines around the subject.</p>
<p>In the last month alone, we have seen the launch of new B2G e-invoicing guidelines by the German authorities. The French government has also issued a decree requiring large companies supplying the public sector to adopt e-invoicing by 2017. This requirement will be extended to SMEs by 2020. In addition, the Ocean Freight industry has recently adopted new sector standards around e-invoicing as a means to improve efficiencies and automation in global shipping.</p>
<p>While this news around growth and stronger e-invoicing initiatives is extremely positive, there is far more potential that can be tapped here. Companies, governments, consumers and solution providers must work harder to change legacy processes. And while the treasurer may not have ultimate responsibility in this area, for those treasury professionals looking to be value creators, educating the business around e-invoicing is surely a no-brainer.</p>

<h3 id="addressing-sepas-shortcomings">Addressing SEPA’s shortcomings</h3>
<p>In mid-May the European Payments Council (EPC) launched a three-month public consultation on possible changes to the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) and SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) Rulebooks. Treasurers, along with other industry stakeholders, now have until 15<sup>th</sup> August 2014 to share their views on the Council’s potential modifications. This date is of course, just a few weeks out from the end of the ‘extended’ SEPA migration period – 1<sup>st</sup> August 2014.</p>
<p>So what changes might take place? Well, according to an April newsletter from the EPC, four common themes are emerging from the SCT and SDD feedback that the Council has already received (28<sup>th</sup> February 2014 was the official deadline for receipt of suggested changes). Here’s what market participants are asking:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SDD Core standard time cycle. Is it possible to make the current option to use a shorter time cycle for the presentation of first, recurrent and one-off direct debit payments mandatory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could SDD sequence types be simplified?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can more flexibility be introduced regarding the use of electronic mandates for SDDs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it possible to introduce longer remittance information for SCTs and SDDs?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With these suggestions gathered from – among others – PayPal, Caterpillar Financial Services, the French Corporate Treasury Association (AFTE) and the European Payment Institutions Federation, it is clear that the needs of all market participants are being taken into consideration here. But while it is all well and good that the EPC is receiving comment from such varied and expert stakeholders, realistically, what is the likelihood of any of the possible changes actually being implemented?</p>
<p>“Proposed changes to the schemes that find broad acceptance in the entire stakeholder community and are technically and legally feasible are taken forward,” explained Javier Santamaría, Chair of the EPC, in a press statement. “Proposed changes that lack such broad support are not – regardless of whether such a change is proposed by a PSP or by a user representative. This ensures that the SCT and SDD schemes evolve in line with requirements of the majority of all market participants.”</p>
<p>Treasurers who would like to participate in the public consultation should visit the EPC website where they will find the relevant change request documents and the related response templates.</p>
<p>Completed documents should be sent by email to: <a href="mailto:change-request.EPC-scheme@epc-cep.eu">change-request.EPC-scheme@epc-cep.eu</a> by 15<sup>th</sup> August 2014.</p>
<p>The next generation Rulebooks (SCT Rulebook version 8.0, SDD Core Rulebook version 8.0 and SDD Business to Business (B2B) Rulebook version 6.0), and associated implementation guidelines will be published in November 2014 and will come into effect in November 2015.</p>
<p>Treasury Today will keep you updated on the results of the public consultation. In the meantime, if you would like to share your views on any of the proposed changes, please email: <a href="mailto:editorial@treasurytoday.com">editorial@treasurytoday.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="unplug-and-play">Unplug and play</h3>
<p>Without doubt, technology has revolutionised the way we work. But it has also altered the way we live. Mobile technology and remote access solutions allow us to work on the go, or work from home, yet in doing so, they have blurred the lines between our personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>For some employers, the ability to have their workers on tap 24/7 is highly desirable. In fact, many corporate cultures operate ‘unwritten rules’ expecting employees to respond to emails after hours, or continue to work on projects at weekends. Of course, there are always exceptional circumstances that demand an extra push, but when the working day is only broken up by eating and sleeping, the risk of burnout is high. And exhausted employees increased risk of error, absenteeism, stress and low morale, all of which will ultimately impact the bottom line.</p>
<p>In the corporate treasury function, where human resources tend to be stretched and accuracy is imperative, it is vital to have a team that is functioning at its best. This means recognising the difference between full capacity and full productivity – a trend which is gradually taking hold among key European multinationals, and even governments.</p>
<p>Volkswagen was one of the first movers here, announcing in 2011 that certain employees’ work emails would be ‘turned off’ 30 minutes after the end of their shift, and only switched on again half an hour before the beginning of their next working day. BMW and Puma have introduced similar initiatives, and the German employment ministry announced in August 2013 that its managers were banned from calling or emailing staff out of hours, except in emergencies.</p>
<p>Similarly, trade unions for the technical and digital sectors in France have recently struck a – legally binding – deal with employers stating that they can no longer pester staff with out-of-hours emails. In fact, employees in those sectors are being ordered to switch off professional mobile devices to sever any communication links in time designated for ‘rest’.</p>
<p>While banning out-of-hours email may be an extreme measure, not to mention totally impractical for treasurers working across time zones, these radical moves are designed to make a point. Namely that working longer doesn’t necessarily mean working harder.</p>
<p>As one of Treasury Today’s favourite forward-thinkers, Adam Smith, wrote in the Wealth of Nations, “The man who works so moderately as to be able to work constantly, not only preserves his health the longest, but in the course of the year, executes the greatest quantity of works.”</p>
<p>In short, it pays to let your employees unplug and play.</p>

<h3 id="knowledge-is-power">Knowledge is power</h3>
<p>Genuine market intelligence on the performance of corporate treasury functions is hard to come by. It is also extremely hard to ignore. That’s why your peers are using the findings of Treasury Today’s Corporate Benchmarking Programme to report to the C-suite and to set their treasury agenda.</p>
<p>During 2014, Treasury Today’s Research Team will again be conducting Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Studies across the Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Our well-rounded data across these geographies puts the performance of your treasury department into context, helping you to showcase your department’s strengths. It can also assist treasury leaders to build the business case for investment in new treasury technology, or to kick off discussions with relationship bank(s) around the depth and breadth of services currently being delivered.</p>
<h3 id="return-on-investment">Return on investment</h3>
<p>In exchange for just 20 minutes of your time, taking part in Treasury Today’s benchmarking programme will allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Access a personalised benchmarking report featuring an in-depth KPI module. This compares the organisation’s treasury KPIs across the key treasury disciplines with those in the confidential respondent universe. An industry sector comparison is also included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop or update performance targets for your treasury team, based on the best in class results in your region or sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discover the issues that are top of the agenda for your peers and sense check your treasury strategy to make sure that you have all bases covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rank your relationship banks across three relevant solution sets, and give your view on their product innovation, customer service and technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make your voice heard by highlighting improvements that you would like to see in the future from service providers and have a real influence on their agenda</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="added-value">Added-value</h3>
<p>Our 2014 Studies will again focus on the key issues affecting corporate treasury but will dig deeper into the areas you have asked us to explore further. We will enhance the KPI module to ensure we continue to provide real value. Many of you have found these metrics extremely valuable as we now benchmark your KPIs against the study universe as well as your particular industry sector. You will be able to monitor improvements since last year’s Studies in a number of important areas.</p>
<p>The Middle East Study launches first so, if you have responsibility for treasury and cash management in the Middle East region, please participate and have your say.</p>
<h3 id="peace-of-mind">Peace of mind</h3>
<p>The cornerstone of our benchmarking surveys is candid input from corporate treasurers, for corporate treasurers. It’s about tapping collective knowledge to build a better treasury function. We guarantee 100% anonymity to all corporates who participate. So, even when your closest competitor or bank relationship manager purchases the findings of the Study (only participants receive complimentary copies), they will not be able to identify that you have participated, or access any confidential information about your company.</p>

<h3 id="regulators-change-their-tune">Regulators change their tune</h3>
<p>While the spectre of financial regulation still looms large, some noteworthy concessions have been announced in recent weeks by various rule makers. This is good news for both banks and corporate treasurers, and suggests that the regulators are perhaps more ‘in touch’ than many had previously thought.</p>
<p>In mid-January, the Basel Committee’s oversight body – the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) – endorsed proposals on a common definition of the Basel III leverage ratio, with the final text including some very interesting amendments. The most significant changes revolve around the leverage ratio’s exposure measure, effectively reducing the size of banks’ balance sheets for calculation of the ratio. The GHOS itself admits that the amendments have been made on the back of comments received from the banking industry about the leverage ratio being too punitive. As a result, the rules no longer require 100% of off-balance sheet assets (including guarantees, letters of credit and the vast majority of derivatives exposures) to be counted when calculating the leverage ratio. This move will be particularly welcome among the trade finance and corporate treasury communities since the amendments finally recognise the intrinsically safe nature of trade finance products and their importance to the real economy.</p>
<p>January also saw the announcement of a six month ‘grace period’ for transition to the Single European Payments Area (SEPA). On the back of very poor SEPA readiness statistics, the European Commission introduced a proposal, which became applicable on 31<sup>st</sup> January, to allow market participants more time to complete their SEPA transition. Businesses and banks in the euro area now have until 1<sup>st</sup> August 2014 before legacy payment instruments are blocked. The formal SEPA deadline still remains 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014, but in reality, many corporates are likely to need the extra time. That said, regulators and industry commentators have made it clear that there is unlikely to be any further movement in the transition period cut-off. Corporates are therefore advised to stick to their original SEPA migration timetables as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Despite these helpful concessions, 12<sup>th</sup> February marked the beginning of another challenging regulatory requirement for corporates, namely the reporting of derivative trades (even internal ones) to a trade repository under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Any company established in Europe that uses derivatives will be impacted by EMIR. In certain cases, non-EU counterparties will also come under the regulation’s scope. To help readers understand their obligations under EMIR, Treasury Today held a ‘Tackling EMIR’ Adam Smith Best Practice Webinar in early February, during which Ahold’s treasury team shared their experiences of complying with the regulation.

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="sepa-ready-or-not">SEPA: ready or not?</h3>
<p>For those operating in the treasury space in Europe SEPA (or the Single Euro Payments Area to give it is unabbreviated name) seems to have been around for years. As we start 2014, one of the finishing lines for this project is now firmly in sight. The SEPA Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 set the final end-date for ‘legacy’ national euro credit transfer and direct debit schemes as 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 in all Eurozone states. This can be deferred until 31<sup>st</sup> October 2016 for non-Eurozone states like the UK. From these dates the existing national euro credit transfer and direct debit schemes will have to be replaced by the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) and SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) Schemes and the politicians’ goal of having ‘no frontier effect for cross-border payments’ will have been largely achieved.</p>
<p>It has been a very slow and painful process getting to where we are. The banking industry in Europe was slow to respond despite the EU politicians’ vision that was expressed throughout the 1990s. This was reiterated by Commissioner Bolkestein in November 2000. “The full benefits of the single market will only be achieved if it is possible for business and individuals to transfer money as rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the community to another as is now the case within most member states,” he said. So, the banking industry was told to build such a system that would also mean that the banks make much less money from transaction fees and effectively eliminate the ‘float’ that often occurs when making cross border payments. Is it any wonder the banking industry was slow to move?</p>
<p>Differing legislation in the various EU countries also made harmonisation difficult but this presented a revenue opportunity for the lawyers and there have been a series of legislative directives that have driven forward the integration of the euro payment market; notably the Payment Services Directive and sections on the SDD Core Rulebook to assist in the transition from legacy mandates.</p>
<p>The result is that fundamental change has now been achieved and cash management in Europe is never going to be the same.</p>
<p>We can reflect on these developments in two ways – tactical and strategic. Tactically companies are having to react and this issue of Treasury Today includes a Problem Solved case study which shows how one company has addressed SEPA and managed to migrate all its direct debit mandates to SEPA ahead of the 1<sup>st</sup> February deadline. Meanwhile, our Question Answered this month poses the question “What will SEPA Phase II look like for your company?” We provide an answer from three corporates. We will report on more in the months to come as corporate treasurers find ways strategically to take advantage of the new payments landscape in Europe.</p>
<p>But there are also more fundamental issues to be considered. How will business change as these major barriers to cross border trade are finally removed? Even quite small businesses may find ways to reach across borders and try to find new customers. But they will also encounter new competition domestically as companies elsewhere in the EU do the same? Will governments open their procurement to EU wide competition or remain country focussed? How else will trade change?</p>
<p>A different issue is that the introduction of SEPA payment schemes makes any break-up of the Euro payment area that much more difficult. Domestic payment systems will have been replaced in the same way that domestic currencies, including notes and coin, have been. But this does not resolve the fundamental economic pressures resulting from individual government and country surpluses and deficits. This issue is not resolved.</p>
<p>The changes we are seeing in Europe are fundamental and game-changing. We are living in interesting and challenging times.</p>

<h3 id="an-inspirational-afternoon">An inspirational afternoon</h3>
<p>The first Treasury Today Women in Treasury Lunch was held in London on Thursday 31<sup>st</sup> October. Our pioneering Women in Treasury initiative was launched in January of this year and continues to grow in ambition. In the project’s first year we have profiled leading women in the industry, launched a study into the professional experiences of these women and now hosted our first Women in Treasury event.</p>
<p>The aim of Women in Treasury is to support, inspire and raise the profile of women in our industry. Now with the Women in Treasury Lunch we have also succeeded in bringing these women together and facilitating networking and a support structure. Only by understanding the challenges women face in our industry and highlighting them can we start to push for change and get rid of some of the barriers. Networking is such a key ingredient for a successful career and it was fantastic to see so many of the women that attended speaking with one another, sharing stories and debating the findings of our Women in Treasury study.</p>
<p>More than 150 women gathered at the Four Seasons Hotel in London for the exclusive release of the Women in Treasury study results. Then our panellists; Maeve Robinson, Assistant Treasurer, Omnicom Group; Marie-Astrid Dubois, Assistant Treasurer, Honeywell; Jenny Knott, CEO, Standard Bank and Pam Walkden, Group Treasurer, Standard Chartered Bank were part of a discussion that focused on four key themes that emerged from the study:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Job satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vive la différence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The panel group and subsequent open question and answer session revealed some galvanising, alarming and inspiring truths and clearly support our feeling that platforms like Women in Treasury are vital if we wish to see equality in our industry.</p>
<p>A summary of the results from the study together with pictures and in-depth commentary from the Lunch will be published in the January 2014 edition of both Treasury Today and Treasury Today Asia.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all those women who took part and attended our inaugural event and would like to invite all other women in the industry who are interested or intrigued by the initiative to take part in our future events.</p>

<h3 id="will-mmfs-make-it-over-the-regulatory-hurdle">Will MMFs make it over the regulatory hurdle?</h3>
<p>The battle over new money market fund (MMF) regulations is coming to a head on both sides of the Atlantic. Early last month the European Commission (EC) put forward its proposals as to how to ensure the stability of the MMF industry and the money markets as a whole whilst, in the US, the three-month consultation regarding the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposals saw a flurry of comments before it closed for consultation on 17<sup>th</sup> September.</p>
<p>The main point of contention in both sets of proposals is the major restrictions proposed for constant net asset value (CNAV) funds and the encouragement regulators are giving to managers converting to variable net asset value (VNAV) MMFs. Most market participants believe it will be to the detriment of investors, issuers and the economy as a whole. The SEC directly proposes MMFs to move to VNAV or continue as CNAV with the use of liquidity gates and fees. The EC proposal, on the other hand, calls for CNAV funds to have a ‘capital buffer’ of 3% which, argues its opponents, is uneconomic for an asset manager to hold in a MMF.</p>
<p>However, even the use of liquidity gates and fees if a fund’s liquidity level falls below a specified threshold is not finding favour in the US. In his comment published on the SEC website, Gregg Murphey, Manager Global Treasury, Novelis Inc., argues that this proposal will “bring into question one of the greatest strengths of a prime MMF – liquidity”.</p>
<p>In addition, given the SEC’s decision to reject the use of capital buffers for US MMFs, the Institutional Money Market Fund Association (IMMFA) believes that there is now a “serious risk that cross-border arbitrage opportunities will be created”. However our analysis is that the opportunity for arbitrage is limited by tax and other regulatory issues.</p>
<p>Secretary General of IMMFA, Susan Hindle Barone, has issued a call to action for all market participants to “make their voices heard, whichever avenue that takes”. But it may be too late.</p>
<p>To help corporate treasurers navigate the complexities of new MMF regulations, Treasury Today is publishing a special article on the subject in this issue.</p>

<h3 id="the-sibos-jamboree-heads-for-dubai">The Sibos jamboree heads for Dubai</h3>
<p>Sibos is the annual banking conference organised by SWIFT, the bank owned provider of secure financial messaging services. Sibos has become the ‘must-attend’ conference for bankers, technology suppliers and consultants who are involved in all aspects of the transactional banking business. The conference is held in different parts of the world each year and there are 6,000+ attendees most years. What do they all do? Well, there are some serious debates at Sibos and informative conference sessions but it is also a big party as banking friends get together and the booze flows from the stands.</p>
<p>The real world also intrudes. Those that attended Sibos in Vienna five years ago will always remember ‘Sibos Monday’ as attendees learnt of the demise of Lehman Brothers. The lasting and stark image of that event is of massive stands empty of content and people, as well as disappearing keynote speakers.</p>
<p>Last year the empty stand spaces at Sibos in Osaka, Japan reflected a different reality. The Chinese banks, who have had a growing presence at Sibos in recent years, all withdrew from the conference in Osaka over the dispute with Japan over the sovereignty of eight uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>Nonetheless SWIFT claims to have had 6,250 attendees in Osaka, the largest ever attendance in Asia Pacific. Those that were there are sceptical as to whether they had all turned up but Asia Pacific is still predicted to supply 45% of this year’s attendees. This is a clear sign of the growing importance of SWIFT in the region and just as importantly of this region to SWIFT. EMEA is next in significance with 42%.</p>
<p>It is the ME bit of EMEA that Sibos is visiting this year, with the conference going to the Middle East for the first time. It will be interesting to see attendance levels in this new location. SWIFT expects more than 6,000 attendees including a few corporate treasurers to descend on Dubai from 16<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> September.</p>
<p>To attract corporates Sibos has, for the sixth consecutive year, included a dedicated two-day Corporate Forum as part of its programme, under the main theme of “accelerating innovation in treasury and trade”. Anita Prasad, General Manager – Treasury at Microsoft and Alawi Al-Shurafa, Treasurer at Saudi Chevron, will join the opening panel to discuss best practice in centralising treasury functions and there are a few other corporate speakers over the following two days. But Sibos is not really a corporate forum and the corporate attendees will typically be from big companies with the larger and more complex transactional banking requirements who use SWIFT messaging to communicate with their banks.</p>
<p>Sibos is as much about the chats outside the formal sessions as it is about the agenda topics. The conference attracts the main decision-makers in banking and payments. In many ways, that is the secret to Sibos’ continuing success – as a networking event for the banking industry, it is unrivalled, allowing participants to meet the people they need to in order to do business.</p>
<p>Treasury Today will be in Dubai, reporting on the conference and uncovering what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="a-canadian-walks-into-the-bank">A Canadian walks into the Bank…</h3>
<p>This may sound like a good start to a joke, but Mark Carney’s first week has shown that he is serious about shaking things up as Governor of the Bank of England (BoE). In an attempt to shed his ‘rock star’ celebrity status for a more ‘man of the people’ image, Carney joined other City commuters in taking the tube to work and agreed to meet a group of protestors to review female representation on bank notes.</p>
<p>More importantly, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Mario Draghi, European Central Bank (ECB) President, to squash any expectations for an early rise in interest rates, a move which sent stock markets soaring and devalued the pound. Carney said that investors were “not warranted” in thinking that interest rates would start rising from the end of next year, as markets currently expect. This statement radically broke with existing protocol by setting out a potential timeframe for rate policy – coined ‘forward guidance’.</p>
<p>Carney also took the unusual step of issuing a statement after his first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. In it, the MPC said: “The significant upward movement in market interest rates would weigh on” growth and that the recent “implied rise in the expected future path of bank rate was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy”. Additionally, Carney left the door open for more quantitative easing (QE), in response to the Chancellor’s request that the BoE examine alternative strategies in time for next month’s meeting.</p>
<p>As the first non-British appointment to the post in the 319 year old institution, Carney is going to have to go the extra mile to prove himself – and the increased level of transparency he is putting in place might go a long way in helping his cause. But he has his work cut out for him: the UK economy is still in a weak state and there are major divisions within the MPC. Sir Mervyn King, Carney’s predecessor, faced many months of opposition to suggestions for expanding the BoE’s policy of QE.</p>
<p>Carney is no stranger to conflict, as evidenced by his very public spat over the implementation of Basel III with J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon in 2011, when Carney was Governor of the Bank of Canada. In one of his many shots across Dimon’s bow, Carney stated: “If some institutions feel pressure today, it is because they have done too little for too long; not because they are being asked to do too much, too soon.”</p>
<p>As one of his fellow Canadians and former government colleague, Scott Reid, said: “He’s going to tear through London like a lion.” And that may not be a bad thing.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="a-tale-of-two-cities">A tale of two cities</h3>
<p>Miami and Singapore: two very different cities in two very different regions. Yet there were a number of common themes running through the EuroFinance conferences held in these cities in May.</p>
<p>First, as the global financial crisis reaches its fifth anniversary (commonly dated from when Lehman Brothers went down for the count), there seems to be no end in sight regardless of which side of the globe you reside. In Miami’s opening plenary, Omar Sharif, US Economist, RBS Securities, raised the spectre of the US federal debt ceiling, pointed to the decreasing estimates of trend growth (currently at 1.9%) and said quite plainly “it doesn’t feel like a boom time”.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the mood was slightly gloomier for a change – in a straw poll of the participants, just over half (54%) felt more confident about their business prospects in the coming year, whereas in Miami the figure was 60%. This may have been the result of a flurry of negative news around economic data turning sour, the risk of a hard landing in China and a downturn in exports, but in his keynote speech Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asian Economic Research and Managing Director, HSBC, was quick to dispel these stories as just “noise”. Yet the Asian markets took another tumble in the last week of May, which has caused more anxiety to creep into market sentiment. An interesting take-away from Neumann’s session was how closely intertwined the growth story in Asia is with the quantitative easing (QE) policies of the West, which begs the question, as the governments in the West begin to unravel their QE packages, will the Eastern economies start to falter?</p>
<p>The second theme is interconnectedness. Despite some economists still floating the idea of a ‘decoupling’ between the emerging and developed markets, the interrelated nature of global finance and business was nowhere more apparent than at the EuroFinance conferences. The global multinational treasury operations are increasingly integrated and ‘joined up’, as illustrated by leading lights in treasury such as AkzoNobel, Microsoft, Yum!, IATA and Omnicom. Presenting in both cities with different treasury team members, their contributions showcased their skill in creating a uniform vision of processes, procedures and technology across the globe.</p>
<p>The third theme is treasury transformation. The vast majority of the conference presentations, as well as the entries from the Adam Smith Awards winners, told impressive transformative stories – whether that was through changing the culture of the organisation, driving rationalisation and centralisation, improving working capital cycles, or implementing innovative supply chain finance programmes. Despite tough times – or maybe because of them – a new breed of treasurer is coming to the fore. Not content to just fight their corner and maintain the status quo, these treasurers are coming out swinging and effectively taking the professional to the next level through a complete re-engineering process.</p>

We are delighted to see such a range which realises our ambition that these Awards are open to all, irrespective of company size.</p>
<p>Over half the submissions were global entries, reinforcing the corporate treasurer’s ever-increasing role and responsibilities. In terms of the benefits cited, process efficiencies, risks removed/mitigated, productivity gains and cost savings were the most popular boxes ticked, with some extremely impressive results.</p>
<p>Our judging panel now has the daunting task of first short-listing and then making their final decisions on the winning entries.</p>
<p>We look forward to celebrating your achievements during our Awards Lunch at a prestigious venue in the City of London on 20<sup>th</sup> June.</p>

<h3 id="final-call-to-action">Final call to action</h3>
<h5 id="nominations-close-at-midnight-on-30th-april">Nominations close at midnight on 30<sup>th</sup> April</h5>
<p>By the time this issue hits your desk, you will have just two weeks left to get your submission(s) in for the 2013 Adam Smith Awards. Our simple ambition is to continue to recognise and showcase the best in corporate treasury practices as demonstrated by you, our readers.</p>
<p>Now in their sixth year, these Awards are firmly regarded as the industry benchmark for corporate treasury best practice and innovation. Previous winners include many of the world’s leading multinational organisations as well as medium and smaller size enterprises from across the globe. They all have one thing in common. It is really quite simple. They have each implemented solutions that have improved their respective treasury functions; in many cases taking them to an entirely new level.</p>
<p>So, if you have recently completed a project that has transformed your business, nominate yourself, your team and your company. There has never been a better time to showcase your accomplishments, to profile the value your treasury function brings to your company and share your achievements with your peers.</p>
<p>We have added some new categories in 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Best Foreign Exchange Solution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asia Pacific Regional Award for Best Practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury Today Woman of the Year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This last category is part of our Women in Treasury initiative. We know from our experience operating in this market there are some truly outstanding women who act as an inspiration for all in the treasury profession. So why not nominate yourself, or nominate another female treasurer who has inspired you in your career.</p>
<p>Wei Shi, VP Head of Treasury and Finance at Toyota Financial Services and winner of the Top Treasury Team 2012 told us:</p>
<p>“It was an honour to receive recognition for the work we have been doing. Treasury is sometimes seen as a ‘black box’ and we were able to use the Award to show not only our Toyota colleagues but also our external investors the value of what we do. It also led to us being asked to make a number of industry presentations which was great for the public profile of Toyota Financial Services while internally the Adam Smith Award has boosted morale within the team.</p>
<p>2013 is shaping up to be another tough year and we’ll be back again to try and win more accolades but the competition will be tough. The Adam Smith Awards shine a spotlight on those treasuries that have had the foresight – and courage – to implement best practice processes and solutions. If you have done something interesting in the last year I encourage you to join us in entering. The more of us that enter the more we can learn from each other and recognise the enormous value that treasury brings to the business.”</p>
<h3 id="enter-now">Enter now</h3>
<p>If you have submitted an entry in previous years please do not be dissuaded from entering again this year. Alternatively, if you are a newcomer to these Awards please view this as an opportunity to showcase the projects you are working on within your treasury department.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your nominations – which can be made by completing the simple entry form at treasurytoday.com/awards. The celebratory lunch for Award winners will be held at Plaisterers’ Hall in the City of London on 20<sup>th</sup> June.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-sepa-countdown">The great SEPA countdown</h3>
<p>The race is on to beat the clock and migrate euro payments to Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) instruments by the deadline of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014. At long last, the Eurozone will give birth to a (relatively) harmonised payments landscape that should be easier and cheaper to navigate, both domestically and cross-border.</p>
<p>The gestation period was a laborious 14 years, beginning with the Lisbon Agenda in 2000. The treaty intended to make the EU ‘the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion’ by 2010. Despite the deadline slipping a few times and the intervention of the global economic crisis, the SEPA train continued to lurch forward.</p>
<p>However, with less than a year to complete migration, all reports point to the fact that there is still a long way to go. With a persistently low adoption rate thus far (as of December 2012, SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs) made up just 34.86% of the total volume of credit transfers, while SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs) made up just 1.91%), every transaction bank and SEPA solution vendor in Europe is ratcheting up their marketing and communications machines into overdrive.</p>
<p>For many of us suffering from SEPA fatigue, this is a welcome burst of excitement and one that will hopefully result in tangible gains for corporates – after the pain, that is.</p>
<p>For those corporate treasuries that are sitting outside the Eurozone, thinking that this has nothing to do with them, then it is time to think again. The EU is a major trading partner for most countries around the world and for those that do trade in euros implementing SEPA will mean faster settlement, simplified processing and lower costs for cross-border payments. In addition, for those companies whose treasury is headquartered outside but still have treasury operations within the Eurozone, this is an opportunity to standardise payments and simplify ERP systems to streamline and centralise to gain further efficiencies. There is a lot to play for.</p>
<p>But in order to take advantage of what SEPA offers, you need to get in the game. Clients are typically requiring between six months and a year to prepare themselves for the switch. The biggest concern being voiced by banks and vendors alike is that many corporates will wait to the final quarter of 2013 to start thinking about a migration programme. If this happens, there will be a crushing (and costly) bottleneck because the banks and vendors will not be able to service all their customers.</p>
<p>An important question still hangs over the scheme: what will happen on 2<sup>nd</sup> February 2014 if a corporate is not compliant? Will its payments be rejected? No one is quite sure – but then again no one really wants to wait and find out.</p>
<p>Our advice? Start now.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h3 id="2013-the-year-of-muted-optimism">2013: the year of ‘muted optimism’</h3>
<p>The Year of the Snake came in with more of a whimper than a hiss, with continuing concern over problems in the Eurozone and the US budget deficit. However, despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF) trimming its growth forecast for the world economy in 2013, after predicting a less vigorous recovery in the US, UK and the leading countries of the Eurozone, the general mood at the recent World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting was moderately buoyant.</p>
<p>The 2,500 movers and shakers gathered in Davos seemed fairly convinced that the collapse of the euro, a hard landing in China and a debt crisis in the US all look much less likely. Axel Weber, the former head of Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, even went as far as to say that the global recovery has passed a turning point. European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi was equally positive, expecting the Eurozone economy to begin recovering in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, corporate treasurers still consider the uncertainty of the economic outlook as their top concern, according to a number of industry surveys.</p>
<p>New regulations are also top of mind for corporates – in particular the impending money market fund (MMF) reforms, which are expected to accelerate significantly in 2013. Both the US Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and International Organisation of Securities Commissioners (IOSCO) are mulling over proposals for further regulation to reduce systemic risk. This month, we take a closer look at the state of play of those proposals and the market in general.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of increasing global regulation, China is bucking the trend and opening up further to corporates. Pilot schemes launched by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which deals with foreign currency controls, and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), which governs renminbi (RMB) liberalisation, have recently come to fruition. Two foreign currency cross-border sweeping pilots, one by Shell China and Standard Chartered China and the other by Intel and HSBC, and a cross-border RMB intracompany lending pilot by Citibank China and an unnamed European food company, may spell the end of trapped cash headaches for corporates operating in the country.</p>
<p>And finally, a quick reminder that the Treasury Today Adam Smith Awards 2013, sponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, are now open and treasurers have until 30<sup>th</sup> April to submit entries. Now in their sixth year, these awards recognise leading solutions and best practice. This year we have created three new categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Best Foreign Exchange Solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asia Pacific Regional Award for Best Practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury Today Woman of the Year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a wonderful opportunity to showcase your and your team’s talent and innovation in the face of difficult market conditions. We wish everyone the best of luck.</p>

<p>As a new calendar year starts we all have plans for 2013. Treasury Today continues to expand and we are working on three new initiatives this year:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are launching Treasury Today Asia; thus responding to the many requests we have received to broaden the coverage of Treasury Today in China to include the rest of Asia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are developing our web content to provide more tools and practical information to corporate treasurers and CFOs/FDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are beginning to offer customised research to banks and other vendors by undertaking specific market surveys and using our extensive benchmarking survey data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have served the treasury community for over 14 years and we remain committed to providing high-quality, independent insight and analysis on all aspects of treasury and finance. We will be developing our flagship publication Treasury Today, our Handbooks and other publications as we do this.</p>
<p>Our awards programme – Treasury Today Adam Smith Awards 2013 – will recognise leading solutions and best practice whilst our new Women in Treasury programme will recognise outstanding female treasury practitioners.</p>
<p>We look forward to serving you in the year ahead and are always keen to hear what else you want us to be doing.</p>
