<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>They could be emission reduction or energy-efficiency targets, goals around waste, sustainable sourcing, biodiversity or human rights and employee engagement objectives. Sustainability KPIs that link the cost of corporate borrowing to sustainable achievement shot to fame in 2017 after Dutch conglomerate Philips signed a Revolving Credit Facility with 16 banks that linked the interest rate to improvements in the company’s sustainability performance tagged to KPIs.</p>
<p>More recently, COP26 and GFANZ [Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero] pledges to clean up and decarbonise bank loan books is accelerating the adoption of KPIs, increasingly supported by important new policy frameworks. EU taxonomy rules are being rolled out, classifying what is and isn’t sustainable and ending subjective sustainability claims. Elsewhere, the ISSB [International Sustainability Standards Board] is preparing new sustainability standards to guide international accounting while in the US, SEC rules on climate disclosures will introduce mandatory non-financial disclosure from corporates.</p>
<p>Treasury, along with the sustainability team, is actively involved when it comes to discussing which sustainability KPIs and targets to embed in debt instruments that can be used (unlike green or social bonds or loans) for any type of corporate purpose. “Treasury is convinced this is something they want to be involved in,” says Agnes Gourc, Head of Sustainable Capital Markets at BNP Paribas who advises treasury teams on integrating KPIs into their borrowing in a bespoke and iterative new process.</p>
<h4 id=""getting-started"">Getting started</h4>
<p>What is material to one business may be less relevant to another: fuel efficiency is significant in the airline industry while clothing groups have most work to do around labour rights. Good starting points to ensure KPIs are relevant and material to the overall business and its future operations include frameworks like the LMA Principles, ICMA’s Sustainability-Linked Bond principles and SASB materiality metrics, which highlight the material issues for 77 industries.</p>
<p>Companies will typically develop internal KPIs which they benchmark to external methodologies, explains Gourc, who highlights a step-by-step procedure that doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time determining if a KPI is material, especially when it’s attached to other companies’ (for example, suppliers and customers) sustainability efforts like Scope 3 emission targets.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, embedding KPIs in a deal with a tight turnaround like acquisition finance risks weak, rushed targets. In deals where time, not sustainability, is the primary driver, syndicates might not have time to undertake proper due diligence to ensure that KPIs are sufficiently robust and material says Gemma Lawrence-Pardew, Head of Sustainability, Director – Legal at the Loan Market Association (LMA).</p>
<p>As for a single, most important KPI? Perhaps one of the most important, and increasingly prevalent, KPIs is one that links director performance to achieving sustainability targets, says Caroline May, Partner and Head of Sustainability, Europe, Middle East and Asia at Norton Rose Fulbright. “We expect that reaching ESG targets and objectives will increasingly become part of a board or director’s KPIs,” she predicts.</p>
<h4 id=""banks"">Banks</h4>
<p>Treasury Today interviewees observe that banks, not corporates, are driving most KPI uptake. “Banks have been given targets internally and are engaging with corporates through relationship teams,” says Nick Merritt, a Partner at Norton Rose Fulbright. When companies go into new rounds of funding, they are increasingly asked to introduce sustainability KPIs, while relationship teams are targeting new industries for the first time. For example, last year Norwegian tanker operator Oddfjell SE became the first shipping group to issue a sustainability linked bond tied to reducing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Merritt believes that banks increasingly linking access to finance to climate KPIs heralds a future whereby lenders will exit the companies in their loan book that have not outlined their targets to net zero. In the medium term, he predicts KPIs may harden into genuine covenants that aren’t just price-linked. Instead, corporates which fail to meet them may be subject to mandatory pre-pays or defaults, and banks will likely exit the relationship. “The non-sustainable company of tomorrow risks being shunned by investors, employees and customers and need to shift their focus from stockholders to stakeholders,” he says. “Non-sustainable companies will see capital constrained.”</p>
<h4 id=""loans-v-debt"">Loans v debt</h4>
<p>In a loan, the interest rate will go up or down according to whether the company reaches its KPIs. In contrast, bond issuance tends not to have a step up, or premium facility: companies only get penalised if they miss their target but if they improve, there is no reward. In another distinction, KPIs embedded into loans tend to be tested annually while KPIs pegged to bond pricing are set for the life of the bond, with every detail published at inception and rarely revisited.</p>
<p>Treasury teams should also bear in mind the different levels of engagement on KPIs attached to either bank finance or bonds. Corporates issuing debt will communicate with their investors about the KPIs primarily during roadshows, and for some via annual engagement thereafter. Banks, on the other hand, regularly discuss companies’ ability to meet targets with conversations focused on “next steps” or target materiality and progress, says Gourc. “We look at KPIs as an engagement tool with the company. Ambitious KPIs require significant corporate transformation, requiring detailed planning and support.”</p>
<h4 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h4>
<p>A number of challenges strew the path ahead. Fear of failure is increasingly crimping robust and ambitious KPIs as corporates, wary of the attention sustainable finance attracts from the broader syndicated and investor market, set deliberately weak goals they can comfortably achieve. “We are trying to educate people not to fear failure,” says Lawrence-Pardew.</p>
<p>It’s a message echoed by others who distinguish between the importance of market scrutiny of KPIs to prevent greenwashing on one hand, and the damaging outing of companies that haven’t met targets on the other. Many corporates may feel trapped in a transparency paradox, explains Merritt. “The more they disclose, the more stones are potentially thrown, yet peers that don’t disclose or set ambitious KPIs may not be subject to the same scrutiny.”</p>
<p>The solution? Market education that identifying and hitting KPIs is an iterative process. Sustainable KPIs set today will be different from those set in the future and old transactions will be refinanced with new KPIs reflective of the energy transition gathering pace. Shared benchmarks and market standards allow for comparison and transparency, but sustainable finance is flexible and depends on understanding companies’ own individual journey because there isn’t a one size fits all when it comes to transition. “Ongoing and significant corporate improvement is the right track,” says Gourc who says few companies are reached where they need to be. New products are also supporting corporate progress. The commercial paper and repo markets are exploring KPIs, and the derivative market is also expanding, driven by the fact KPIs don’t have to be linked to specific projects like social or green bonds.</p>
<p>More robust KPIs will also emerge as efforts to stop greenwashing step up. The LMA is stamping down on declassification, whereby corporates remove the sustainability label of their loan if they don’t reach the KPIs in what Lawrence-Pardew describes as one of the biggest threats to the credibility of the sustainable loan market. “There are examples of ground-breaking transactions that have received lots of publicity but never hit their KPIs. The corporate will then declassify the loan without any public announcement.”</p>
<p>The LMA is also flagging risks in new products. Like so-called sleeping sustainability loans whereby corporate borrowers originate traditional loans that contain dormant sustainability KPIs that can be switched on at a later stage, imply sustainability is not at the heart of the transaction. “This is a growing trend; particularly in the US, and one that needs to be treated with caution,” says Lawrence-Pardew.</p>
<p>In another trend, litigation is also on the rise. The non-profit monitoring group CDP recently reported “a steady increase” in the number of companies at risk of litigation because their green promises don’t match reality on the ground. The trend is most visible in the US, but now European corporates have come under fire, being sued by environmental groups for greenwashing and deceptive marketing. “The risk of scrutiny from NGOs is leading to client demand to better understand governance and reporting structures for ESG issues to ensure that they are not at risk of allegations of greenwashing and challenge from stakeholders, NGOs, investors and their own employees,” says May, signposting a stronger and more robust market ahead as companies come under increased scrutiny from stakeholders.</p>
<h4 id=""measurement"">Measurement</h4>
<p>The biggest and most enduring challenge attached to identifying and meeting robust KPIs and preventing greenwashing is access to data. Banks are encouraging corporates to set KPIs and put sustainability targets into traditional corporate loans in a top down approach, but their existing corporate loan books lack the meaningful sustainability data needed to help set and police targets. “Information needs to be digitised and accessible on an industrial scale to enable banks to measure things like waste, water consumption and GHG emissions to create meaningful targets,” says Merritt. It gets even more complex measuring KPIs around social and governance criteria, and impact.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Treasury Today interviewees note that drawing up KPIs is a big step. Interest, homework, and discussions are vital and meaningful precursors in a long process. “As a company, you should decide when you are ready to do this type of transaction,” concludes Gourc. “Sometimes we recommend to clients to further develop their sustainable plans ahead of launching a sustainable finance transaction – and not to worry if it is for the next funding exercise.”</p>

<p><img alt=""Coats Group plc logo"" class=""org"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/coats-logo-2022__70x70.png?la=en&amp;hash=BA615628CB6293DCE3931704629685F4"" style=""margin-top:1.5em;"" title=""Coats Group plc logo"" width=""70""/></p>

<p>ESG is very much at the heart of what we do and core to our strategy at Coats, so the question is more; how could our refinancing last year not be linked to ESG?</p>
<p>Since signing our RCF, we have added local facilities with an ESG element: our local banking facility in Turkey mirrors the ESG linkage at a Group level while in Vietnam, we place deposits that have a direct contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, our global trade facility, catering for Bank Guarantees and Letters of Credit, is also linked to our ESG metrics. We would highly recommend speaking to your banks and enquiring about ESG, they will increasingly have a variety of solutions that can be embedded into various parts of your banking needs.</p>
<p>At Coats, we are committed to pioneering a sustainable future. We set out our sustainability goals in 2019, focusing on water, energy, effluent, social and materials impacts.</p>
<p>As we report on our progress against our targets in our Annual Sustainability Report, it was an obvious decision to align the RCF with these. We worked closely with our Head of Sustainability to select those metrics which were challenging and, importantly, most measurable to fit with our banks’ requirements. We have since further advanced our ambitions to align with Science Based Targets for 2030.</p>
<p>We are working hard at automating our ESG reporting to the same level as we do financial reporting. At Coats, we see these as equally important and an area that potentially finance can offer a great amount of support to the business. By leveraging our finance teams’ experience, knowledge, and rigour in reporting, we aim to mirror our ESG reporting as it is our believe that ESG reporting will be on a par.</p>
<p>Measuring and reporting on ESG is required as part of our facility, but it is also important to focus the business on our performance and provide insights as to where improvements can be made. Coats uses a web-based tool to track performance across all areas of all our metrics. Being transparent on our operations shows that units really are ‘walking the walk’.</p>
<p>The discount (for meeting all three targets) or premium (if we miss them all) is not huge, but there is far more value in having them embedded in as many places around the organisation as possible. It focuses everyone’s minds on the importance of achieving our sustainability objectives. However, we would encourage treasurers to play a part in advancing the ESG agenda as much as they can or risk being left behind.</p>
<p>Only those businesses that take sustainability seriously and are, in themselves, sustainable, will ultimately survive in the long run so from a lending perspective it would seem a significant step forward for this to be recognised by reducing, or allowances given to, the risk weighting against those companies that are genuinely, or quickly becoming, sustainable, so that it can be reflected in the pricing they are able to offer.</p>
<p>There has been unmitigated support. The banks were equally as keen to add ESG to their facilities as Coats was to incorporate them, and equity investors also see it as another indication of the commitment to our strategy. In addition, it is also fundamental to our customers and suppliers to know that Coats is a leader in sustainability and seen to be delivering on our commitments.</p>
<p>Internally, our board was very supportive of this, and treasury received many positive questions and comments on the facility when we announced the new RCF, which was a great opportunity to raise our profile and to engage with the wider business.</p>
<p>Coats was very focussed on ensuring that this was not a greenwashed facility, as it simply would not have reflected what we are about when it comes to ESG. We deliberately went for three of the more challenging targets, as we do not want to hide from our responsibilities as a corporate. We were also keen to have a diverse selection of metrics that, given our global footprint, touched upon social as well as environmental.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that all individuals and corporates need to take responsibility for, and have a role in, delivering a more sustainable future. We would hope that by now most companies will have sustainability targets, which can help frame an ESG linked facility and can be leveraged for reporting purposes. It seems to us that unless you have existing group KPI’s then it would be difficult for treasury to establish and measure them in isolation.</p>

"Reuse, repair, repurpose and share: the treasury benefits of the circular economy","


<p><em>Companies will struggle to meet their net zero targets unless they adopt a circular approach and reuse, repair and repurpose the components in their supply chains. Elsewhere, new circular models around leasing and subscription could transform sectors from health to fashion.</em></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Industries from food to fashion, electronics and transport, are experimenting with ways to replace the linear take-make-dispose economy into one based on the principles of reuse, repair, repurpose and share. Like brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, turning the barley by-product or spent grain in its brewing processes into a key ingredient for pasta, baked goods and snacks. Car maker Renault now offers battery leasing arrangements for electric vehicles; machinery giant Caterpillar’s Cat Reman programme reduces owning and operating costs by providing same-as-new quality components at a fraction of the cost of a new part, while in Brazil, an initiative by HP is leading to the first circular economy initiative in the Brazilian electronics sector.</p>
<p>In discussions on how best to tackle climate change and ESG integration, the circular economy is often overlooked – or even wrongly viewed as a fancy term for recycling. But treasury teams are increasingly mindful of its potential to offer streamlined and predictable cash flows: companies operating a linear model face commodity price spikes and volatility but in the circular economy raw materials are obtained from reprocessing the product and waste is turned form a cost to an additional source of revenue.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the circular economy offers compelling new growth opportunities and a strategy for reducing Scope 3 emissions, without which companies will never fulfil their net zero pledges. According to research from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in <a href=""https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/financing-the-circular-economy-capturing-the-opportunity"" target=""_blank"">“Financing the Circular Economy”</a> if a circular approach were adopted in just five sectors (steel, aluminium, cement, plastic and food), annual GHG emissions would fall by 9.3 billion tonnes of CO2e in 2050, equivalent to the reduction that could be achieved by eliminating all transport emissions globally. As global trends around digitalisation, resource scarcity and supply chain upheaval gather pace, treasury teams are increasingly mindful of the circular economy’s impact on cash flows and the future business environment.</p>
<h4 id=""green-issuance"">Green issuance</h4>
<p>The amount of money raised in the linear economy dwarfs that raised to fund corporate circular endeavour, but investors and banks are dipping a toe. The annual issuance of corporate bonds linked to the circular economy increased five-fold between December 2019 and December 2021, with at least 40 bonds issued in the last three years by companies including Alphabet, BASF, Daiken Corporation, Henkel and PepsiCo. PepsiCo’s US$1bn green bond will fund key initiatives including reducing its use of virgin plastics and Henkel’s US$70m plastic waste reduction bond has gone to finance projects which contribute to its 100% reusable or recyclable target by 2025. “Plastic is not the enemy,” says Thorsten Leopold, Director Global Packaging Innovation, Laundry &amp; Home Care at Henkel.</p>
<p>Analysis by Bocconi University in Milan links investor appetite for circular economy assets to the circular economy’s direct benefit on corporate health. The University’s analysis of over 200 listed European companies across 14 industries found that circular economy benefits like business model diversification, decoupling economic growth from resource use, better anticipation of stricter regulation and changing customer preferences make for compelling investor stories. The more circular a company is, the lower its risk of defaulting on debt, and the higher the risk-adjusted returns of its stock, says Carlo Messina, CEO, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Europe’s largest banking groups which has pursued circular economy strategies as a value creation opportunity for several years, including through its partnership with Bocconi University, and also partnered with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in its report. “The bank has an interest in evaluating and selecting the most circular companies because there is an awareness of the fact that they are more resilient in the long term.”</p>
<p>Intesa Sanpaolo (where a €5bn credit facility supports companies adopting circular business models) is one of a growing cohort including ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank, all overseeing dedicated circular lending programmes. The China Development Bank has helped finance the Qaidam Circular Economy Pilot Zone, which includes CNY400bn (US$56bn) for the construction of six industrial bases. Circular economy investment also ties with investors integrating the SDGs, particularly SDG 12 – sustainable consumption and production.</p>
<h4 id=""scope-3"">Scope 3</h4>
<p>The need to meet net zero targets is also pushing companies towards circular economy principles. <a href=""/regulation-and-standards/standards/treasury-gets-to-grips-with-scope-3-ttia"">Reducing Scope 3 emissions, the carbon footprint of the components</a> in a company’s product and of those products once in use, is typically the biggest part of a corporate’s carbon footprint and the hardest to unravel and measure. It is also integral to achieving net zero. For example, consultants McKinsey estimate that unless there is further action to improve sustainability in manufacturing, 60% of auto industry emissions will come from the materials used in production by 2040. Roughly half the cost of a vehicle is spent on materials that will not be recycled, according to calculations by the Circular Cars Initiative, a grouping of businesses set up by the World Economic Forum to increase the use of renewable materials.</p>
<p>Recent research from the University of Exeter, in partnership with Dutch medical equipment group Philips, found that the NHS will not meet its net zero target unless it incorporates circular economy principles which involve maintaining and extending the life of medical equipment rather than the current approach of using large volumes of single use products and disposing of machines and devices prematurely. “NHS leaders have outlined their commitments to making health services more sustainable, but the pace of change must swiftly accelerate. Our research has outlined that meeting the NHS’s ambitious net zero targets is only possible with the adoption of circular economy practices,” said co-author Markus Zils, Professor for Circular Economy and Management Science at the University of Exeter.</p>
<h4 id=""leasing-and-subscription"">Leasing and subscription</h4>
<p>Emerging demand for leasing and subscription has put companies like Philips at the vanguard of new circular economy models: rather than making and supplying valuable new medical products, Philips is refurbishing and leasing, aiming to generate 25% of its revenue from circular products, services and solutions by 2025 and where circular solutions accounted for 13% of 2019 revenues. Describing the recent leasing of an MRI scanner to a hospital, Robert Metzke, Global Head of Sustainability at Philips Digital explains: “The product has been refurbished, it is a pre-owned system that has been thoroughly upgraded and quality-tested and we have now leased it to the healthcare provider, who can access the solution’s potentially life-saving functionality without having to make the capital expenditure needed to own the product.” Moreover, modern software means Philips can service the scanner remotely; the company will take it back when needed, refurbish it and lease it again. Similar things are happening in fashion where the clothing resale sector is expected to be bigger than fast fashion by 2029 and data provider Statista estimates the global fashion rental market will reach revenues of US$7bn by 2025. Ralph Lauren is leading the way offering fashionistas the ability to rent the ‘Lauren Look’ if they sign up to a subscription service starting at US$125 a month.</p>
<h4 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h4>
<p>Circular models won’t work for every company. The financial viability of new business models based on leasing and subscription compared to traditional manufacturing varies and requires key logistic support. “Treasury will need to support setting up take-back schemes that require logistics to bring products back into the system for repair and repurpose,” explains Patrick Schröder, Senior Research Fellow, Environment and Society Programme at Chatham House. “The sharing economy has different revenue schemes and treasury will have to think this through.”</p>
<p>And companies like brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev making new products from by-products and upcycling low value ingredients can only do so if they are commercially viable. It’s also essential that circular products are made available to everyone – rather than a sustainable choice for the well off. One area this could work includes repurposing white goods, suggests Susan Evans, Interim Head of Resource Policy at the Green Alliance. “Many white goods get thrown out although they are perfectly functioning. They could go to support people in furniture poverty.”</p>
<p>The circular economy will only take off with enabling conditions like legislative or tax incentives that encourage the use of re-used, refurbished or recycled products and materials. “Customers need to be incentivised and facilitated to return products through deposit and buy-back schemes, and success requires adequate collection and processing networks,” says Philips’ Metzke.</p>
<p>It is possible, witnessed in producer responsibility regulation in the auto sector that makes manufacturers and importers responsible for taking back cars at the end of their life, leading to a high level of recycling and recovery. “Cars are expensive, so it has been easier to introduce this circular model,” notes Evans. “In the past, the economic incentives were right to encourage repair. We need to shift economic incentives to scale up circular solutions.”</p>
<p>Regulation is also growing. Examples include national roadmaps and circular economy legislation in Chile, China, Finland, France and the Netherlands. In 2019, the European Commission presented the European Green Deal, of which the circular economy is a key pillar, and in early 2020 it published the Circular Economy Action Plan, which includes a detailed set of measures to be implemented over the next five years. In 2018, China and the European Commission signed a memorandum of understanding on circular economy collaboration.</p>
<p>The circular economy also requires more transparent and consistent data on circularity performance including dedicated circularity measurement tools that integrate circularity metrics into reporting and disclosure frameworks. A recent study of 7,000 business leaders by software firm SAP found that 26% of companies measure sustainability using in-house metrics, while only 12% adhered to globally proposed measures.</p>
<p>Perhaps the hardest part will be convincing customers to change their purchasing habits – it’s more convenient to buy a new model and the linear economy has been around for many decades. Appealing to altruism only goes so far: companies need to create great products at a lower price than ownership. In its report, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation concludes progress now depends on banks scaling circular economy financial products and services and building on existing proofs of concept.</p>
<p>Treasury can begin by collecting all non-financial data around resource efficiency and waste, beyond what they are currently doing around net zero and carbon, digging down into their supply chain. Treasury can also play a role allocating funds to the long-term investment the circular economy requires, balancing short-term cash needs against the strategic investment needed to create resilience. “Investment now is best way to prevent losses in the future,” concludes Chatham House’s Schröder.</p>


","Companies will struggle to meet their net zero targets unless they adopt a circular approach and reuse, repair and repurpose the components in their supply chains.

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The importance of sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations to multinational corporations continues to grow. Seventy per cent of respondents to <a href=""/supplements/global-sustainability-study-2021"">Treasury Today’s Global Sustainability Study 2021</a> said that sustainability is reflected in their organisations’ core values, while 76% said that sustainability is now a board-level issue. Half of all respondents reported that their companies have a sustainability ‘champion’, and almost a third have committed to net zero.</p>
<p>“In a relatively short period of time, ESG has gone from being something that’s at times been seen as a standalone agenda item to absolutely central, and increasingly embedded as a core part of planning and strategy. It’s increasingly integral to every decision our customers make,” says Andrew Blincoe, Head of Corporates and Institutions at NatWest. “The increasing focus on ESG continues to be driven from across the range of stakeholders: by customers, colleagues, by boards and executives.”</p>
<p>In addition, the expectations of potential future employees represent another driver for focusing on ESG. “We’re all seeing this huge positive shift in mindset around ESG (Environment, Sustainability and Governance),” says Chris Jameson, co-head of product management for GTS EMEA at Bank of America. “The next generation of talent isn’t going to sign up to a company that doesn’t have strong ESG credentials, and live up to those credentials.”</p>
<h4 id=""embedding-sustainability"">Embedding sustainability</h4>
<p>For treasury teams, likewise, ESG is an increasingly central priority. PwC’s 2021 Global Treasury Survey, for example, identified ‘Driving ESG’ as one of five top priorities for corporate treasury, alongside business partnering, raising digital acumen, optimising cash and financial risk.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of ways that treasury teams are working to embed sustainability and ESG considerations. Green and sustainability-linked bonds and loans are becoming increasingly mainstream, as Treasury Today’s Global Sustainability Study illustrated: 27% of respondents had used a sustainability-linked loan or RCF, while 26% had used a green bond. All respondents said they had signed up to ICMA green bond principles.</p>
<p>At the same time, the scope of activities included in sustainability has become much broader. “It’s interesting to look at the evolution of the types of financing included in this topic,” says Blincoe. “If we go back a little while, we primarily saw the ESG financing agenda emerge around raising green bonds. Now the focus is not just on conventional capital raising – it’s much broader, including, for example, driving ESG through all parts of the supply chain.” As Blincoe points out, companies are looking not just at their own carbon footprints and ESG targets, but also at the materials they use, and the carbon footprint of their suppliers.</p>
<h4 id=""rise-of-sustainable-scf"">Rise of sustainable SCF</h4>
<p>The importance of the supply chain to a company’s sustainability was highlighted by Treasury Today’s Global Sustainability Study, with 48% of respondents including supply chain selection and management as a KPI to monitor ESG performance.</p>
<p>With more companies seeking to make their supply chains more sustainable, the use of sustainable supply chain finance (SCF) continues to grow. <a href=""/treasury-practice/sustainability/integrating-esg-into-treasury-ttweb"">In a recent webinar with NatWest</a>, Alex Ashby, Head of Markets, Group Treasury at Tesco, explained how the retail group has integrated sustainability into its supply chain finance programme, with suppliers able to access lower funding costs if they are performing well against their sustainability goals. Other companies, likewise, are turning their attention to the opportunities of sustainable SCF programmes.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“There are a number of ways that you can use supply chain finance in this regard,” comments Duncan Lodge, Head of Traditional Trade, and EMEA Head of Trade &amp; Supply Chain Finance Product Management at Bank of America (BofA). “Yes, you can think about tiered pricing for suppliers that meet certain criteria. But it’s also a very flexible tool, and we’re seeing it used in a number of ways within our client base.”</p>
<p>For example, says Lodge, companies might consider sustainability when deciding which suppliers should be given access to an SCF programme from the outset. “This might mean focusing on suppliers that are meeting ESG criteria – or it might mean isolating a specific flow within your supply chain,” he explains. “An energy company, for example, might choose to empower the suppliers that are part of their wind turbine supply chain.”</p>
<h4 id=""transactions-and-investments"">Transactions and investments</h4>
<p>Beyond finance, other areas may present opportunities for treasurers to embrace sustainability. In the transactions space, for example, digitisation can be harnessed to reduce the prevalence of paper – and, indeed, plastic.</p>
<p>“The most visible place for people to start has always been paper,” says Jameson. “Whether that’s bank statements, cheque processing or physical cash collection, the drive from paper to electronic has really been accelerated by the Covid pandemic.” He explains that the adoption of digital signatures has been a significant shift, alongside the adoption of mobile wallets and online self-service tools. And where plastic is concerned, he notes, companies are increasingly shifting towards virtual card payments.</p>
<p>ESG also has a role to play in investment decisions. As Jameson explains, treasurers are already looking to weave ESG into their investment approach – and in a rising rate environment, “it will be very important not to lose sight of the ESG approach in an investment strategy, and not to give way to yield alone.”</p>
<h4 id=""seeking-consistent-standards"">Seeking consistent standards</h4>
<p>It’s clear that there are numerous opportunities for treasurers to drive sustainability across their activities. But in this rapidly evolving area, there are also a number of obstacles that treasury teams need to consider.</p>
<p>“It can be quite overwhelming,” comments Christian Aue, VP Corporate Finance at Dürr Group. “You have a lot of changing regulation and market demands, and you need to keep on top of those – especially with the taxonomy adding new criteria. It can be challenging for mid-to-small-sized treasuries to address these topics.”</p>
<p>Blincoe says that while there is some progress towards consistent standards from a governance and reporting perspective, “We are very much on the journey.” He notes that most large corporates are evolving their own views about how they can make a difference, and how their activity should be appropriately measured. “Unsurprisingly, though, we continue to see appetite from across the spectrum for consistency in reporting metrics – investors are asking, ‘How can we read across one company’s ESG viability and compare it to another one?’ The criteria they are using to measure themselves are quite different.”</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to address these issues. Blincoe points out that some standardisation is under way across different asset classes, for example among banks working on syndicating loans. “We continue to see progress towards developing a consistent view across customers and sectors, and it’s interesting to see how finance will converge around the transition to net zero. Measuring carbon will be one of the issues at the heart of mobilising finance,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""enabling-change"">Enabling change</h4>
<p>Where transactions and trade are concerned, the speed at which treasurers can enact change is another possible hindrance. “Systems are notoriously costly to change – and if you’re going to bring in new payment mechanisms that are more ESG friendly, there’s a cost to that,” notes BofA’s Jameson. “Processes may be quicker to change, but it can take time to ensure the governance is in place and get buy-in from the team.” In addition, he notes that it takes time and effort to change a consumer’s behaviour – for example, by asking them to make payments using a different channel if they have historically posted cheques.</p>
<p>Addressing the proliferation of paper documents that is still associated with trade transactions has also long been regarded as a challenge. But as Lodge notes, “Fortunately there are a number of key ingredients now coming to the fore that make digitisation increasingly achievable, including the rule of law.”</p>
<p>For one thing, the G7 model law on electronic transferable records (MLETR) is currently being written into country law by some of the G7 members, which is intended to enable the legal use of electronic transferable records domestically and across borders. In addition, last year the International Chamber of Commerce released its Uniform Rules for Digital Trade Transactions (URDTT). “Having a framework for what happens when documents of title move between counterparties is really important, as it gives companies and banks confidence as they start to adopt these digital alternatives,” says Lodge.</p>
<p>Enablers of progress also include the rise of ecosystems such as the Marco Polo network, in which multiple counterparties come together to drive digitalisation and agree on common standards. Blockchain, too, may have a role to play in helping to remove paper from trade processes and drive digitalisation.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the issue of greenwashing, and the question of how to define what does or doesn’t qualify as ESG. “The good news is that there are established ESG consultancies and rating agencies, and many of these have experience of supporting trade finance transactions and facilities,” says Lodge. “There are also a number of second party opinion providers out there that can assess your internally-created ESG criteria, and give you confidence that what you’re doing does indeed achieve the goals that your company is striving for.”</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Achieving excellence in ESG</h2>
<p><img alt=""Dürr Group logo"" class=""org"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/durr-group-logo.svg?la=en&amp;hash=6ECA227A5D220E464197DF7B5897BD47"" title=""Dürr Group logo"" width=""140""/></p>
<p>Global mechanical and plant engineering firm Dürr Group was recognised as the Highly Commended Winner in Best ESG Solution in the 2021 Adam Smith Awards. The winning solution centred around the issuance of the company’s third sustainability-oriented Schuldschein loan, in which the company achieves a lower financing cost once ESG targets have been reached.</p>
<p>Speaking about sustainability more broadly, Christian Aue, VP Corporate Finance, says that sustainability is one of Dürr’s key enablers – “and one of the most important aspects of this is to enable our customers to be sustainable themselves.” Where treasury is concerned, he says the value treasury can bring to the organisation is by putting a spotlight on the topic of sustainability. “Also important is the way that you communicate with your bank, because you need to be credible in what you’re doing with sustainability,” he comments.</p>
<p>In recent years, he says, banks have built up their expertise on this topic. “They are also shifting their product focus to be able to offer treasury solutions which are sustainable or green. And of course, they also now challenge you, because it’s getting more and more important for them to think about how they build up their customers.”</p>
<p>But as Aue notes, this is not a one-way street. “We are reviewing all of the products we use, and also our partners, in terms of how they are engaging with sustainability. So it’s not just the banks asking us about this topic – we also expect our banks to act in a sustainable manner. And we are also reviewing all of our projects to see where we can instil the topic of sustainability.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Aue points out that not every area of treasury should be infused with a sustainability element. “We’ve discussed some products where we’ve decided not to go ahead, because it doesn’t make any sense for us to do it.”</p>

<p>It’s clear that sustainable and ESG investing need to become mainstream if the world’s climate and sustainability goals are to be met. But what does sustainable finance mean for treasury activities, and what sort of workload and risks do treasurers need to be aware of?</p>
<p>“Sustainable finance needs to be differentiated from sustainability,” explains Simon Derrick, Head of Financing Solutions, Europe at Standard Chartered. He adds that while the benefits of more sustainable behaviour are well established across a variety of stakeholders, “sustainable finance refers to the process of taking environmental, social and governance considerations into account when making investment decisions in the financial sector.” This, in turn, leads to more long-term investments in sustainable economic activities and projects.</p>
<p>Where funding is concerned, Derrick notes there are two distinct types of sustainable finance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use of proceeds</strong>, including green, social and sustainable loans and bonds. Sustainable finance structures give investors comfort that funds will be used appropriately, and can potentially result in cheaper financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainability-linked products</strong> that incentivise improvement in ESG performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With increasing amounts of capital allocated towards sustainable finance, it is likely this will result in pricing benefits for compliant usages – and, conversely, a premium for continuing what is considered to be polluting or non-compliant behaviour, explains Robert Newell, Managing Director, Global Corporates, Europe. “This hopefully ensures that businesses and governments – and their stakeholders, such as banks and investors – act in a more beneficial manner.”</p>
<h4 id=""impact-on-treasury-activities"">Impact on treasury activities</h4>
<p>So what does sustainable finance mean for treasury activities? Newell comments that since sustainability is now at the forefront of most strategies, “it is hard to think of areas of treasury that would not be influenced.”</p>
<p>While bond issuance and funding via green or ESG-linked loans are well known, there are other areas in which sustainable financing is being applied more widely across the treasury space. “For example, ESG-linked derivatives and supply chain financing largely follow similar principles of working on a framework of sustainability-linked targets where there are real benefits for positive action, and costs for failing to act,” says Newell. Other examples include green deposits and sustainable repos that ensure excess liquidity is deployed in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>“At Standard Chartered, we continue to develop products that help with the evolution of treasury in ESG,” says Newell. “We have executed sustainable repo trades, and were one of the first banks with sustainable deposit accounts. These are used to fund SDG-compliant businesses, reviewed by our partner Sustainalytics.”</p>
<p>Beyond the activities that are likely to be relevant to all treasuries, some industries and sub-sectors may also be affected by the establishment of carbon markets and carbon trading, which Newell says “will be key to hitting net-zero targets.” Heavy energy users, meanwhile, are investing in their own sustainable energy production.</p>
<h4 id=""risks-and-workload"">Risks and workload</h4>
<p>How much of an additional workload should treasurers expect when embracing sustainable finance? Derrick says this depends both on the product being considered, and on the nature of the business – “again, there is a difference between use of proceeds and sustainability-linked.”</p>
<p>On the funding side, for example, use of proceeds deals require strict monitoring that proceeds are being applied for the intended purpose. Where bonds are concerned, additional work is needed to obtain a Second Party Opinion and a Borrower Sustainability Framework, although Derrick notes that Standard Chartered works closely with clients on these requirements. Sustainability-linked deals, meanwhile, require a more holistic borrower involvement, with targets required across a range of sustainability KPIs.</p>
<p>“For both use of proceeds monitoring and sustainability-linked, once a framework has been established it should be easier to repeat the process – though there is a whole separate point on continuing additional reporting,” comments Newell.</p>
<p>Risks, meanwhile, include the risk of greenwashing – in other words, criticism from NGOs, investors or customers that a particular project should not be eligible, or that the structure of a deal means some funding can be used for non-green purposes.</p>
<h4 id=""variation-across-markets"">Variation across markets</h4>
<p>Where the global picture is concerned, it’s clear that different markets are developing at different speeds. While growth in the sustainable loan market driven by sustainability-linked loans (SLL) was initially a European phenomenon, this growth spread to the US market in 2021. In other regions, however, SLL activity is more limited.</p>
<p>Emerging markets, meanwhile, are characterised by a higher proportion of use of proceeds financing, particularly for specific infrastructure or green buildings. “Financing sustainable assets in the emerging markets can have far more impact than in developed markets,” comments Derrick. “For example, a solar project in India will help avoid more than seven times the CO2 from a similar-sized project in France, given the current sources of power on those countries’ grids.”</p>
<p>Newell comments that as a European bank with the majority of its business in the emerging markets, Standard Chartered “can play a major role in taking ideas and funding between East and West.” And while less than 60% of the funding needed to achieve the SDGs in low and middle-income countries is currently being met, he says Standard Chartered is focused on redressing this: “Of our US$9bn of verified sustainable financing, 70% is in emerging and developing countries.”</p>

<p>I am expecting COP26 to address the carbon markets, loss and damage, and nature-based solutions to absorb CO2, at a more technical level. There is huge public interest in the conference, and I’m hopeful for progress.</p>
<p>One of the tricky issues is Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the stepping-stone to international emissions trading. Article 6 currently provides a loose framework for countries and companies on how to achieve a carbon price, and how trading of carbon credits could happen in the future. Carbon trading and emissions has a potential impact on treasury, particularly corporate investment decisions. For example, if a business is subject to carbon pricing, it may view energy intensive investments differently, factor in a carbon price or seek a different type of financing.</p>
<p>The UK, Europe, and China – as of last July – have emissions trading. There is now a proposal in the EU for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is related to the impact of the EU’s emission trading system and which will have treasury implications. For example, a company needing steel and importing Australian steel (where there is no carbon price on steel) into the EU will have an advantage over an EU business using EU steel that is subject to a carbon price.</p>
<p>There is now a proposal about how to address this with a tax on imported goods so that the delta on the price applied in, say, Australia, versus the carbon price in the EU is then applied to the import. From a treasury perspective, this is important. I expect to see noise and discussion here with treasury teams needing to price in what the CBAM will do to the price of imports, exports and set money aside. The CBAM requires a degree of internal due diligence, especially for companies in energy intensive industries like steel, plastic, and cement. Imports into the EU will likely to be subject to additional carbon pricing. And of course, this all foreshadows a global carbon price and how it might work. People are watching this space closely.</p>
<p>COP26 will also focus on nature-based solutions and there are treasury implications here. Companies that are not subject to carbon pricing often offset their emissions by investing in woodland and other carbon sinks. The rules here are likely to be debated with new technical provisions, given the wide range of varying standards for offsets and the fact that nature- based solutions may offset but in and of themselves do not lower emissions.</p>
<p>COP will also debate the loss and damage side of climate change, essentially the extent to which industrialised nations should pay more for climate change than developing countries because they have polluted more. It could involve a mitigation mechanism and technology transfer that acknowledges industrialised nations’ larger contribution that could have treasury implications. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) may result in a local climate tax or levy on business that treasury will have to manage, this will however depend on the climate change strategy of each individual government.</p>

<p>Five years ago, we only had a handful of conversations a year with our clients about sustainable supply chain finance. Now it is one of the first things they want to talk to us about, and COP26 will accelerate the conversation. I expect more, large corporations will come out with statements about reducing emissions and hitting further ESG goals embedded in their supply chain, triggering a waterfall effect. If world leaders signal support for stronger reporting requirements on indirect emissions it will lead to corporates introducing reduction targets across their value chain, including identifying suppliers which are helping them to deliver their ESG goals, creating a bigger role for supply chain finance by offering better terms linked to cutting emissions to their suppliers.</p>
<p>In regards to visible banking solutions linked to sustainability, transaction bankers have started playing a critical role embedding sustainable standards in working capital solutions. Now, rather than only prioritising large, strategic investments or capital markets deals, I would say treasury’s focus is on how to embed ESG into day-to-day operations in their working capital flows. Companies want to embed sustainability not only into how they buy and sell their goods but across their entire working capital flows and more so when they are sourcing inventory – like reducing electricity usage. COVID has further shaken up operations and turned the focus on sustainable supply chain flows. The just-in-time supply chain and cost is no more the top priority that it used to be. Getting goods on time and sustainability in supply chains have risen to the top of the priority list.</p>
<p>Companies are linking financing tools to sustainability, and deciding their counterparties based on sustainable parameters. One of our aims is to incentivise our clients’ suppliers to conform to ESG standards of certification by offering a lower level of financing, like we did in August, working with McCormick &amp; Company, a global leader in food flavours, and the IFC providing suppliers of McCormick’s herbs and spices with financial incentives linked to ESG improvements. Suppliers qualify for discounted rates on short-term working capital financing when they meet sustainability standards accepted by McCormick – the higher the suppliers’ performance level in meeting these standards, the more they save. We are witnessing multiple requirements by many clients asking us to deliver better terms to suppliers which are compliant to their sustainable goals which are linked to Paris Accords or the UN’s SDGs.</p>
<p>At this stage, companies are not being forced to do this, it is not punitive. Although this could begin to change if COP policymakers encourage the introduction of legislation to make businesses more accountable not only for their own direct emissions, but also their counterparties.</p>

<p>I have high expectations about COP26. If we want to leave a better world for current and future generations, we can no longer delay defining bold, coordinated and effective measures for change. Above all, COP26 must agree on the implementation of an international regulated carbon market linked to the Paris Agreement, establishing an economic instrument that is capable of driving concrete action to remove carbon from the atmosphere on a global scale.</p>
<p>Joining the global Cap and Trade model (which Suzano strongly advocates) will offer a viable alternative for reversing the carbon emissions curve. It will also facilitate a mechanism to honour public commitments, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy. At the same time, it will help drive an agenda of global investments in decarbonisation, with significant implications for sustainable social development worldwide.</p>
<p>At Suzano we hope COP brings immediate action and progress on a carbon market before we reach a point of no return for the environment. The capture of carbon dioxide by trees is part of this equation, and Suzano, as a natural capital company, understands the important role it plays in protecting and generating value from trees. The company also has potential to generate carbon credits and is climate positive – meaning that besides offsetting greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations and its value chain, the company removes more carbon than it emits.</p>
<p>The adoption of an international carbon market could generate diverse opportunities for low-carbon assets and products. It could turn Brazil into a champion in this market, generating income, attracting investments for preservation efforts and creating sustainable development alternatives for local communities, including the people living in the Amazon region.</p>
<p>The expansion of our forest bases, whether for planting or for conserving native forests, plays an important role in the company’s ability to increase carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. At the same time, we are committed to reducing our equivalent emissions: the more Suzano produces, the higher its positive impact on the world will be.</p>
<p>Will COP help change corporate behaviour? I would argue consumers are changing corporate behaviour. Society is increasingly concerned about its role in building a more sustainable future and this is driving changes in corporate behaviour. People are concerned about consuming products from renewable sources, especially recyclable and biodegradable materials which cause less impact on the planet and this is mobilising companies, governments, investors and society as a whole.</p>
<p>Suzano is on the right side of the equation since our products are developed from trees planted for this purpose. In other words, a raw material derived from renewable resources that can replace fossil-based products. We want to offer ten million tons of products from renewable origin by 2030 to help replace petroleum-based products. We are also constantly pursuing new avenues for developing products from planted trees, including textile fibres as alternatives to cotton.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>A recent conversation between executives at asset manager AllianceBernstein and Swiss multinational food and drink group Nestle offers a window into the types of discussion companies now have with their shareholders. Speaking at Bernstein’s Pan European Strategic Decisions Conference, Bruno Monteyne asked Nestle’s CFO François-Xavier Roger how, given some of Nestle’s mainstream food and drinks are still not “healthy enough,” Nestle planned to balance growth and health ahead.</p>
<p>When the conversation turned to Nestle’s recent sale of a US water business to a private equity group, Monteyne suggested it amounted to “passing the moral buck.” Long in the sights of environmentalists who argue water businesses in the region drain natural water supplies to bottle and sell it at a profit, he said “disposing doesn’t really solve the issue for society.”</p>
<p>A growing cohort of investors now believe that climate change and broader sustainability issues are a material risk and can damage returns either through physical or transition risks, such as regulation and carbon pricing. Nestle’s Roger’s insistence that the company was not taking an “easy” route but was facing the “challenge” and “responsibility” of sustainability shows how ESG sits alongside performance and outlook in corporate conversations with their shareholders, prepared to ask tricky questions of boards, vote against directors and file shareholder resolutions.</p>
<p>All the while the conversation often leaves corporate teams frustrated and overwhelmed by the ESG noise and information out there. Anecdotally, corporates say their shareholders often don’t ask the right questions, honing-in on a particular ESG risk that is not as material or relevant as others to seize the narrative and muddy what should be a powerful and effective conversation.</p>
<h4 id="""">Shareholder power</h4>
<p>Shareholders are growing increasingly vocal and emboldened. Companies which don’t engage with investors regarding sustainability risk escalating, collaborative shareholder engagement. Like activist investor Engine 1, which only held a tiny stake in Exxon Mobil but argued that the oil giant has been too slow to recognise the transition, endangered their portfolio and destroyed investor capital, managing to persuade other investors including pension funds and asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors to back their campaign for different leadership at the top. “In the most polluting industries, investors are realising that climate risks pose a short-term, existential threat to the viability of entire business models,” says Simon Rawson, Director of Corporate Engagement at pressure group ShareAction.</p>
<p>Beyond climate, investors have shunned businesses with unsustainable labour practices as employee health and safety, now a key topic for SASB (the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board which identifies the ESG issues most relevant to financial performance across industries) increasingly pushes centre stage because of the pandemic. Fears of a legal challenge regarding gig worker rights contributed to Deliveroo’s IPO performing well below expectations and caused M&amp;G, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Aviva Investors, which collectively oversee more than £1trn in assets to drop out. In another example, fast fashion company Boohoo saw its share price tumble as allegations emerged of exploitative labour practices.</p>
<h4 id="""">Investor benefits</h4>
<p>On the flip side, companies that have strong sustainability stories reap the investor benefits – like a reduction in the cost of capital. Research from ratings agency MSCI shows that across both debt and equities, advanced and emerging economies, companies with higher ESG ratings have a lower cost of capital by up to 40 basis points. “The relationship between ESG scores and the cost of capital was the strongest in the US, where the lowest-ESG-scored companies faced significantly higher cost of capital than the highest-ESG-scored companies,” said Ashish Lodh, Vice President, MSCI Research. “In Europe and Japan, the relationship was not entirely consistent, although the cost of capital for the lowest-rated companies remained significantly higher than for the best-rated ones.” Elsewhere, research by Aegon Asset Management finds that companies in the most polluting industries have shrinking investor bases.</p>
<p>When German logistics giant Deutsche Post DHL Group published its accelerated roadmap to decarbonisation in March this year, it saw a significant rise in its share price, said Adam Pradela, Executive Vice President Corporate Accounting &amp; Controlling and Klaus Hufschlag, Senior Vice President, CREST Finance Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics in an interview with Treasury Today. “Importantly, our stock price went up at the same time as we announced plans to spend €7bn on sustainability by 2030 – the world of investment is going in this direction. Investors appreciate what we are doing.” The company has cut carbon emissions by 37% since it started its CO2 reduction programme, and carbon is now the most relevant KPI for the company’s investors, they said.</p>
<p>“There are a couple of risks posed by not working with investors,” says Madeleine Szeluch,</p>
<p>ESG Director, Investor Relations at Novartis, speaking from the pharmaceutical group’s Basel headquarters. “The first risk is that not engaging with shareholders could be reflected in a lower share price in the long-term for corporates. Secondly, investors could divest in favour of companies that prioritise sustainability, thus resulting in corporates losing out on a growing segment of sustainability-minded investors.”</p>
<h4 id="""">Materiality</h4>
<p>Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to hold an ESG Investor Teleconference in 2014, now grown into an annual ESG Day for investors with the CEO, Vasant Narasimhan. “We wanted to create an opportunity and a platform for engagement between our senior management and investors on issues that have been increasing in importance for a number of years, both for us as a company and our investors,” says Szeluch, one of two full-time ESG directors sitting within the investor relations team.</p>
<p>For treasury and finance teams wondering where to begin improving their ESG dialogue with investors, Szeluch suggests a good place to start. Novartis’s Materiality Analysis is central to its approach to ESG and involves a process that allows all stakeholders, including investors, to contribute to the most material risks that define the company’s value creation potential ahead. “We conduct our Materiality Analysis every four years, engaging with several thousand internal and external stakeholders to identify the most critical areas that we want to focus on from an ESG perspective.” The most recent analysis revealed patient health and safety, access to health care, innovation, and ethical business practices as the most material.</p>
<p>The fruits of the analysis were evident in investor enthusiasm for the company’s first Sustainability Linked Bond last year, structured so that bondholders receive a higher interest if Novartis fails to meet targets around expanding access to innovative medicines. “We were encouraged by the strong investor feedback that we received. Our SLB was recognised as innovative and industry leading.” She adds that Novartis’s commitment to being carbon, plastic, and water neutral by 2030 has also been “very positively received by investors.”</p>
<p>Similarly, corporate finance and treasury teams’ conversation with ESG-focused shareholders will be much easier if they have a firm grip on what ESG issues are most material to their business. By identifying just a couple of the most material around energy use, supply chain management or how a product is made, corporates can get back in control of the narrative, guide investors on what matters most and position the company in the market, allowing the investor story to flow.</p>
<p>The need for materiality is even more important given the debate is set to get more complicated. Investors are increasingly drilling down into companies net zero pledges and commitment to being carbon neutral by 2050. They are honing in particularly on companies that are not decarbonising, opting instead to compensate via carbon offset initiatives. “Leading practice amongst investors is now starting to interrogate the credibility of these plans in the short, medium, and long-term,” says ShareAction’s Rawson. Biodiversity loss and other impacts are also pushing centre stage. “They are asking questions about how companies are taking these related issues into account in their planning and how they measure and account for their impacts.”</p>
<p>Many corporates’ teams expect ESG conversation with their investors to get more discerning as investors hunt down truly compelling green stories in the years to come. Today, most companies are playing on the transition, arguing they are on the path to net zero and greener endeavour, just not wholly green yet. But in the years to come it should only the greenest companies that attract the easiest and cheapest capital.</p>

<p>How can companies integrate ESG criteria into treasury? With many companies currently asking this question, a recent Treasury Today webinar took a closer look at the role treasury can play in moving the sustainability agenda forward, with Andrew Blincoe, Head of Corporates &amp; Institutions at NatWest Group, and Alex Ashby, Head of Markets, Group Treasury at Tesco, sharing their views on this important topic.</p>
<h4>Liquidity, funding and supply chains</h4>
<p>With a recent poll showing that liquidity and funding are of particular interest to treasurers, Blincoe said the bank receives a lot of questions about how companies can access ESG-linked financing. He added that customers that have been most successful in this area “have done it in a way that’s fully embedded with their other strategic priorities, their other funding requirements, and their broader treasury and finance objectives.”</p>
<p>Ashby explained that Tesco’s treasury team came up with the idea of a green financing framework several years ago. The first step was to link a revolving credit facility (RCF) to KPIs set by Tesco in three key areas: greenhouse gas emissions, food waste and renewable energy. The company then issued a sustainability-linked bond in January 2021 – the first such bond to be issued by a retailer, and one that is aligned to a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2025, compared to a 2015 baseline.</p>
<p>A further initiative has been to incorporate sustainability into the company’s supply chain finance programme. Suppliers share details of their progress against sustainability goals and are placed into different tiers, with the top performing suppliers able to reduce financing costs by as much as 20%. While the programme was only launched six months ago, around 250 suppliers are already onboard, and further expansion is planned. Ashby explained that Tesco also collaborates with suppliers in other ways to further the ESG agenda – for example, the company has an incubator for start-ups, many of which have a sustainability focus.</p>
<h4>Monitoring and reporting</h4>
<p>Turning to the challenges associated with monitoring and reporting, Blincoe said it is important not to treat all investors as the same. “The most satisfying outcomes for clients have been when we’ve worked proactively and constructively to engage with individual investors and investor classes to make sure there’s an appropriate framework and set of KPIs,” he explained. He also emphasised the importance of achieving alignment and consistency between ESG reporting and other reporting cycles.</p>
<p>Where Tesco is concerned, the company works with multiple KPIs under the four pillars of People, Products, Planet and Places, with KPIs covering everything from greenhouse gas emissions to packaging. Ashby said that while Tesco has been measuring its performance against KPIs since 2005, a recent initiative has focused on centralising the way that reporting is handled. “We’ve included everything we do in a sustainability report over the last three years – and we’ve started increasing the number of KPIs that are included in the annual report,” he noted.</p>
<h4>Moving forward</h4>
<p>It’s clear that ESG is becoming an increasingly central issue for treasury teams. Ashby said this topic currently accounts for as much as 50% of his time. Blincoe, meanwhile, revealed that helping customers on the ESG journey was possibly the bank’s biggest single area of activities.</p>
<p>When it comes to progressing on this journey, Blincoe pointed out that sustainability is not a race – “It’s not about who’s going to get there first. This is something we have to win together, and the prize is a collective one.” As such, he encouraged people to be both ambitious and collaborative, underlining the importance of seeing the sustainability agenda both across and within organisations, but also with partners and down the supply chain.</p>
<p>Finally, Blincoe said it is important for organisations to focus on where they can have the biggest impact, either collectively or individually, and grow from there: “Everyone’s focus is different, and where we can have the biggest impact is going to be different for everyone as well.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Up until now Marcelo Bacci, Chief Financial Officer at the Brazilian pulp and paper company Suzano, wouldn’t have thought of attending a UN Climate Change Conference. But in a sign of how much time he now spends on sustainability, the scrutiny his department receives from the company’s creditors and investors and his need for fluency in key sustainability concepts, he plans to attend COP26 this November. “It is becoming more important for the company to have access and be exposed to cutting edge global sustainability concepts. We need to bring them into our work,” says Bacci, who oversees a treasury team of 20 (the wider finance department is around 400) at the Salvador-based company that uses sustainably grown wood from eucalyptus plantations to feed global demand for products like toilet tissue, nappies and paper.</p>
<p>For treasury teams navigating the growing importance of sustainability and mindful of increasing pressure from influential investors concerned about the impact of climate change on their portfolios, Bacci’s expertise on the importance of targets, investment, nurturing an ESG investor base and the growing link between sustainability and the cost of capital, offers valuable insight.</p>
<h4 id=""targets-first"">Targets first</h4>
<p>Integrating sustainability begins with targets. Suzanno went public with a raft of far-reaching sustainability targets last year following three years of discussions that included harmonising goals with Fibria, a domestic forestry rival it bought in 2018. Targets include a commitment to remove an additional 40 million tons of net carbon by 2030, hard reductions on water use and nurturing local development, where the company has pledged to lift 200,000 people over the poverty threshold in its areas of influence by 2030. Elsewhere, it has set targets for diversity and inclusion and is developing renewable products, with some pledges linked to management compensation.</p>
<p>“For example, when we say we want to reduce water consumption, we make sure our plant managers are incentivised to effectively reduce water consumption,” says Bacci, who adds that choosing and setting targets was made easier by the fact sustainability lies at the heart of the business and is already central to how the group differentiates itself from competitors. “Our clients value the fact that we have a traceable supply chain and we only work with planted trees. The fact we only produce pulp from planted trees has a value in the pulp market, it is something very much linked to our business and differentiates the company from competitors.”</p>
<p>His most important piece of advice is to set targets in line with broad corporate strategy. Don’t link them to one off or particular financial transactions like, for example, a green bond, he warns. “All our sustainability targets have a business orientation and haven’t been developed to support a financial transaction. This link ensures first that our targets are genuine, and secondly that they make sense for the business.”</p>
<p>Sustainability targets are the vital first step in raising corporate ambition, adds Sanda Ojiambo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact, the voluntary organisation that cajoles and encourages businesses to integrate sustainability and which created a CFO Taskforce to help companies integrate the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals into their operations in 2019. Targets, reporting and accountability are the organisation’s guiding mantra. “We simply cannot reach the SDGs without businesses being on board,” she says. The challenge is certainly daunting. According to UN Global Compact research, only 21% of CEOs feel business is currently playing a critical role in contributing towards the SDGs and only 39% of companies in a recent survey believed they had sufficiently ambitious sustainability targets.</p>
<h4 id=""investors"">Investors</h4>
<p>Once targets are set, treasury and finance departments play a central role communicating them to investors, says Bacci. “We have to explain to investors and creditors how we are going to reach our targets. It’s not just a number; we have to detail what we are going to do to get there.” Most importantly, it is a chance to differentiate Suzano from the pack.</p>
<p>And as more equity and fixed income investors pile into ESG and competition for assets grows, Bacci is convinced Suzano’s sustainability record will give the company an advantage. “We like this trend. We follow high standards and believe that the more attention the financial community pays to sustainable issues the better it is for Suzano – and for the world.” Around 65% of the company’s equity float is international investors of which he says a significant proportion are ESG-savvy European institutions, with whom sustainability is already an important seam of conversation. In the last year he says ESG-minded US and Brazilian investors are increasingly cropping up at investor meetings too.</p>
<p>Suzano’s ability to articulate its sustainability story to investors is particularly important, given the company’s need to distinguish itself from sustainability laggards in Brazil’s wider agribusiness sector. Last year Nordea Asset Management delisted Brazilian meat producer JBS over transparency failings in its supply chain related to deforestation and the sharp rise in Amazon fires. Corporate destruction of the Amazon is an example of how some companies can create a reputational issue for others, or worse still in Bacci’s words, “the whole country.” It shadows the impact of Suzano’s important environmental policies that include setting aside a vast area of Brazil’s natural forest for permanent conservation, and reforesting thousands of hectares more with WWF Brazil.</p>
<p>But rather than calling for more regulation, he calls for better application of Brazil’s existing laws, and more standardisation. “Environmental legislation is good in Brazil. [The problem is] when the government is not clear about its ability to enforce the law. Companies that don’t follow the rules should be punished.” Moreover, he believes change is coming via influential investors allocating capital to best-in-class companies, and the steady evolution of sustainable finance linked to broad corporate targets. “Self-imposed, market forces are working,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""leverage"">Leverage</h4>
<p>Next, treasury teams play leverage off targets and link meeting them to benefits in terms of cost of capital. This happened at Suzano when it became the first emerging market corporate to issue a step-up bond last September, selling a US$750m bond linked to the company’s ability to limit carbon emissions. The issue, which attracted bids of more than US$6bn, is tied to the company cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 15% over ten years. Should the firm fail to reach the target by 2026, it will have to pay an additional 25 basis points on its coupon.</p>
<p>The finance team had to explain to investors how the bond gave the company skin in the game, says Bacci. “It took a long time to explain the strategy and structure,” he says. “Having a sustainability target linked to a financial transaction in a structure where your cost of capital goes up if you don’t reach the target is a good way to say to the world that you are serious about sustainability – to say that you are willing to pay the price financially and reputationally if you don’t achieve the targets. It’s very efficient, and treasury is closely linked to this process.”</p>
<p>The bond issue has also broadened the company’s investor base. “We had a significant number of ESG dedicated investors looking to buy this security in addition to our normal investor base.” That said, although ESG investors were notably present during roadshows, he does note that it is difficult to distinguish the pockets of ESG investors from mainstream investors at the big investment houses like BlackRock.</p>
<p>In a bid to sharpen stakeholder communication, Suzano has created an internal task force comprising the company’s communications and marketing departments with investor relations and treasury. “In the past we didn’t need to consolidate these efforts. But different parts of the company communicate with different stakeholders, and we need to make sure the strategic message is the same.” Other corporates are doing the same. Daniel Weiss, Deputy Group Treasurer at Novartis, says issuing the drug group’s first sustainable bond with a coupon step-up last year required a different kind of communication. A high-level, corporate-wide team helped smooth the process, particularly between the internal and external legal teams regarding language in the bond prospectus around how the coupon step was tied to Novartis’ KPIs around disease prevention. “We had to align the whole organisation to stand behind those KPIs. It’s substantially different from the usual bond and takes time to put in place,” says Weiss.</p>
<h4 id=""investment"">Investment</h4>
<p>Meeting targets involves investment, once again placing treasury at the heart of a company’s ESG integration. “Our finance department is intimately linked because in order to achieve some of our sustainability targets, we need to make investments,” explains Bacci.</p>
<p>Suzano invests around 1% of its annual revenue (equivalent to around US$50-60m) in sustainability under the umbrella of a bio-strategy focused on business development and R&amp;D. It spans investment in new technologies around planting and harvesting, as well as developing cutting-edge products designed from pulp. For example, the company has created a lignin-based product line (a material found in wood that is responsible for supporting and protecting trees) that can also serve the resin, rubber and plastic markets.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Suzano has entered the textile industry with an equity stake in Spinnova, a Finnish company that develops environmentally sustainable technologies for the production of fabrics using wood fibres. “Given the renewable nature of our product, we believe that pulp can be used to produce other things and will be able to substitute plastic and fossil fuels as we bring sustainability as well as product functionality to market. In our case this link is very clear.”</p>
<p>Nestle, the largest food and beverage company in the world, is also investing in sustainability to create value. Speaking at a recent CAGNY virtual conference, François-Xavier Roger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, says the company plans to invest around CHF3.2bn (£2.5bn) over the next five years including spending CHF1.2bn (£0.95bn) on regenerative agriculture. Investment won’t come out of shareholders pockets, insists Roger. “We do not expect our shareholders to pay for increased investment in sustainability,” he told attendees. “Sustainability investments are expected to be earnings neutral through structural efficiencies and growth leverage.”</p>
<p>One such efficiency will come via cutting packaging costs. Nestle plans to reduce packaging by around 30,000 tons, cutting costs by CHF100m (£78m) in a strategy that holds benefits for everyone in the supply chain – apart from packaging suppliers where the company expects 40% fewer on the roster by 2023. Elsewhere, Nestle plans to invest CHF1.5bn in the sustainable packaging market, with plans for a food-grade recycled plastic market alongside investment in paper and compostable packaging materials. In other initiatives, Roger outlined CHF250m investment in a venture fund focused on start-up companies experimenting in packaging innovation, and says the company is also pouring investment into research into plant-based products on the back of striking consumer preferences, and growth. “Sustainability is now a core part of consumer expectations, we increasingly see consumers responding to sustainable brands and products,” he says.</p>
<p>For Ojiambo, the need for business to invest more in sustainability is overwhelming. “CFOs collectively manage US$14trn in global corporate investment annually, including US$7.5trn in emerging markets,” she concludes, calling on finance teams to work with boards to spend on sustainability throughout a company. “Finance teams can turn ambitious commitments and well-articulated sustainability strategies into investments. They can also help to improve the credibility of SDG finance through outcome-based impact measurement and corporate-wide accountability.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Despite the disruption brought by COVID-19 this year, companies and treasury teams are continuing to focus their attention on the sustainability agenda. What this means in practice was the subject of a recent sustainability roundtable, hosted by Treasury Today in partnership with Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>Setting the scene, Michael Harte, Executive Director, Trade Product at Standard Chartered Bank, noted that sustainable financing “is probably the most pressing and important topic and agenda that we have in the bank today.”</p>
<p>Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, shared some of the findings of Treasury Today’s 2020 <a href=""https://treasurytoday.com/supplements/global-sustainability-study-2020"">Global Sustainability Study</a>. She noted that 61% of the survey’s respondents said that sustainability was reflected in their organisations’ core values, while 43% said some of their partners were engaging with them on matters of sustainability. Nevertheless, over half were having no dialogue – or none that they were aware of – with financial institutions and vendors.</p>
<h4 id=""harnessing-opportunities"">Harnessing opportunities</h4>
<p>Deniz Harut, a global leader in sustainable finance and Executive Director, Sustainable Finance at Standard Chartered Bank, outlined the Bank’s sustainable finance activity to support financial inclusion and economic growth. She also spoke about the work she is doing to develop a data science-backed gender-smart investment platform, which aims to unlock capital for female leadership initiatives, entrepreneurs and female-led SMEs.</p>
<p>In addition, Harut talked about the importance sustainability will play post-COVID-19: “What we have observed over the past six months is that sustainability will accelerate in its importance. And as we work towards a global economic recovery, it’s no longer just a compliance or risk discussion – it’s more about the future, and the opportunities that it enables to us,” she commented.</p>
<h4 id=""sustainable-supply-chains"">Sustainable supply chains</h4>
<p>Frank Waechter, Global Director Treasury &amp; Insurance at PUMA, spoke about the importance of sustainability within the company’s supply chain. Noting that sportswear manufacturers typically rely on external suppliers for production, he explained that customers who buy branded sportswear products increasingly expect “that products…are produced in a fair, honest and sustainable way, and also in a safe environment.”</p>
<p>With companies becoming more concerned about the source of their goods and raw materials, Harte noted that organisations are not just looking at their tier one and tier two suppliers – “they’re looking at the suppliers of the suppliers of the suppliers, and they’re really focusing the lens on the deepest raw materials they need to build their own product.”</p>
<p>In the current environment, Harte said there is a lot of interest from clients in this topic, some of which has been triggered by COVID-19. Looking ahead, he said that Basel IV could have the effect of making trade finance more expensive for small suppliers, in addition to the existing trade finance gap. “I think that’s where products like supply chain finance or deep tier financing really come in,” he added.</p>
<h4 id=""financing-the-supply-chain"">Financing the supply chain</h4>
<p>Demonstrating how sustainability initiatives can work in practice, Waechter spoke about PUMA’s ESG-linked supply chain financing arrangement, which has been in place since 2016 and allows suppliers to access cheaper financing based on their sustainability rating. Key to this was setting the ESG-rating methodology used to rate PUMA-suppliers as an acceptable parameter to influence financing costs for this Supply Chain Financing Instrument. Good ESG-performance of suppliers leads to lower financing costs providing financial incentives for those.</p>
<p>Waechter also spoke about PUMA’s initiative to extend financing to its suppliers via purchase order financing, given that suppliers incur costs well before they send out an invoice. As part of this planned extension of the already existing ESG-linked invoice-based Supply Chain Financing instrument, he said there is a need to replace solvency risk with performance risk – “because if a supplier is not providing good products at an appropriate time, to the right location and in a good quality, we have nothing to sell.”</p>
<p>Harte agreed that by taking financing back to the purchase order, there is a greater opportunity for companies to help suppliers, although this can be hindered by difficulties in getting information away from paper.</p>
<p>As Harut noted, “When buyers, the ecosystem and financing partners come together and are able to establish a tool that facilitates that financing, that to me is the future we would like to see.”</p>
<h4 id=""opening-up-the-conversation"">Opening up the conversation</h4>
<p>In a question and answer session, Harut emphasised the importance of commitment from the finance function, as well as the need for KPIs, when it comes to success of sustainability initiatives. She also spoke about the role that regulators are playing in shaping the markets.</p>
<p>Participants were invited to discuss the topic of sustainability in breakout rooms before reconvening. Tarek Tranburg, Head of Public Affairs at the European Association of Corporate Treasurers, shared his insights about the regulatory aspects of sustainability. Participants also discussed the need for KPIs and how these should be structured, given that smaller suppliers may be less able to respond to those KPIs than large, sophisticated suppliers.</p>
<p>In closing, Harte noted the high level of interest in this topic across the industry. “From a bank’s perspective, we’re open to talking and listening,” he concluded. “Either we’re working on something right now – or you’ll bring us an idea that we hadn’t thought of, and we can put a proof of concept together.”</p><br/>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>In a recent webinar, Treasury Today Group spoke with Jörg Wiemer, CEO and co-founder of Treasury Intelligence Solutions (TIS), to find out how treasurers can transform their payment processes.</p>
<p>Payment fraud has always been a hot topic. In the current circumstances, the heat has intensified. Fortunately, so has the opportunity for treasurers to respond, said Jörg Wiemer, CEO and co-founder of TIS in this recent webinar.</p>
<p>“We talk a lot about the benefits of cloud-based platforms for mission-critical processes such as payments. In current times, with treasurers working from home, and payments having to be made outside of the official premises, the remote accessibility aspect has become an even bigger issue than before,” he commented.</p>
<p>Fraud is a threat that comes from many angles. According to the 2019 AFP Payments Fraud and Control Survey, 36% of fraud threats came from inside the company. False payment requests, recording of false credits and stolen credentials from payment systems are just a few examples of how organisations are under attack from within.</p>
<p>But the external threat is mounting under the pandemic. “We’ve seen that during the COVID-19 crisis, more companies have become victims of business email compromise (BEC) attacks,” said Wiemer. “Add to this rising corporate concerns around cash visibility, and it’s no wonder that now, more than ever, treasurers are having to deliver ever more timely cash position reports.”</p>
<p>Without the right systems, he believes the risks multiply. But solutions such as TIS can bring together all functions and information, using a single payment gateway “so you have proper controls such as multiple approvers, access rights management and pre-defined approval processes all in one place for fraud prevention”.</p>
<h4 id=""asking-questions"">Asking questions</h4>
<p>Looking at account payables, Wiemer said companies must ask themselves the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you work with decentralised, proprietary e-banking tools and have too many manual steps involved in your supplier payment processes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you struggle with insufficient visibility of your company-wide supplier payments?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you experienced fraud attempts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are your payment management processes audit-proof?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you looking for ways to enhance compliance?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“If your answer to at least three of the above is ‘yes’, you should seriously revisit your current processes as your organisation may be at greater risk of fraud,” he warned. The solution, he added, is readily available.</p>
<p>“The TIS platform connects to any ERP, treasury management or HR system and takes care of bank connectivity. The platform guarantees a frictionless straight through process. With additional modules such as Sanction Screening, TIS also offers a high level of payment security and compliance.”</p>

<!-- BOXED -->
<p>For Wiemer then, decentralised processes and having to use multiple tokens and logins “belong to the past”. By streamlining the processes and consolidating financial data on one platform, it is, he states, “possible to get visibility and real-time reporting with just one login”.</p>
<p>In anti-fraud terms, the advantage is clear. But how does TIS generate 3x ROI, as Wiemer claimed? He offered the following: by decreasing the level of friction in internal processes; by reducing IT costs; and by saving on bank fees. But these are just a few examples; every TIS customer is different, and will require a different approach, he said, further citing the speed with which fraud risk mitigation is rolled out as having a potential positive impact on ROI.</p>
<h4 id=""act-now"">Act now</h4>
<p>It’s apparent that change is happening on many fronts, and all treasurers must respond. Critically, Wiemer predicts a mind shift from working ‘on premise’, to a new ‘remote culture’. “Everyone needs to get used to the new norm and a kind of ‘remote reality,” he said. “In times of disruption, greater attention is paid to cash and cash visibility because liquidity is vital – and cash really is king.”</p>
<p>In finding the ideal solution to these issues, he recommends a ‘best-of-breed’ approach, enabling treasurers to pick and choose specialised products from different areas or vendors to get the exact features needed to achieve their goals. “This open-ecosystem approach, enabled by APIs, is the future – and TIS wants to be a driving force behind it.”</p>
<p>TIS offers a secure, cloud-based platform which acts as a single point of contact for the entire finance function, allowing all payment transactions to be combined in a uniform way across the company. The platform also offers real-time cash visibility, ensuring payment procedures and cash flow are controllable at all times.

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The total belief at BNP Paribas that finance can have an impact on sustainability has, over the last two decades, been guiding its policies, said Duteil in the recent webinar. Indeed, with a clear exit timeline strategy on funding coal-based power plants, a very restrictive unconventional oil and gas policy, and the publication last year of its ocean bio-diversity policy, the bank exhibits a determined strategy to help clients transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>BNP Paribas already has at least €185bn of on-balance-sheet financing directly contributing to the fulfilment of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). And as a signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Banking and the Collective Commitment to Climate Action, it continues “tilting the balance in favour of sustainable practices”, said Duteil.</p>
<p>However, client appetite for sustainable finance solutions induces “mixed signals” said Ayerza. He cited Treasury Today’s 2020 Sustainability survey, which suggests treasury’s ESG awareness is still maturing. For it to be embedded in company culture, it is his belief that education will prevail. With respondents spending less than 10% of their time on ESG matters, he urges “a little more involvement”, indicating treasury mindsets should shift further towards the longer-term goals of their organizations.</p>
<p>For Kish, the financial pressure created by the ongoing pandemic could present the perfect opportunity for many companies to re-focus priorities right across the sector spectrum. This would allow treasury to lead the education of senior management teams on available products and the boost these can give to overall corporate sustainability KPIs and goals.</p>
<h4 id=""new-options"">New options</h4>
<p>Products, commented Duteil, have shifted from the simple “labelling of proceeds” (as per green bonds), to the “impact assessment” mode of sustainability-linked products. But where next? Ayerza believes the trade and supply-chain side is ripe for development. With many companies publicly stating measures to curb emissions in their own, and their suppliers’, activities – and 52% of treasurers saying they have metrics related to selection and management of their supply-chain partners – he feels progress towards the financial resilience of supply-chains is “encouraging”.</p>
<p>Integrating ESG goals into liquidity management and investment strategies also presents an opportunity for treasurers, said Kish. She suggested starting with a review of investment policies, along with bank counterparties and asset management providers, employing a broad and flexible approach to innovation and market development. Sample language could highlight an organization making earnest attempts to incorporate ESG related investments in its practice, while insuring that these investments comply with the top priority of safety and preservation of principal followed by maintaining liquidity and generating yield. Kish emphasized the importance of creating consistency with the organization’s overall ESG policies and priorities, which will offer, she stated, “another chance for treasury to work ESG language into company consciousness”.</p>
<p>Further opportunities for treasurers to contribute to their organizations’ ESG strategies referenced in the webinar included green deposits (including CDs), sustainability-linked deposits, ESG-focused prime money market funds, and tailor-made solutions such as separately managed accounts, and structured deposits linked to a specific ESG index.</p>
<p>On the trade and supply-chain side, Ayerza cited as an example BNP Paribas’ own work with Siemens in Spain to create a €600m sustainability-linked syndicated guarantee facility, incorporating dual environmental and social objectives. “There are many opportunities out there that we are open and willing to explore with our clients,” he declared.</p>
<h4 id=""determination"">Determination</h4>
<p>With all the damage caused by COVID-19, will the pandemic deter implementation of sustainability measures? “Absolutely not,” asserted Duteil. “If anything, COVID-19 has given us a glimpse of what the future may hold.” Indeed, with the private sector “embracing and raising the bar for the sustainability agenda”, he foresees greater adoption of longer-term perspectives, a better grasp of what systemic risk means in socio-economic terms, and an absolute need for a ready and rapid response as the transition to a new normal advances.</p>
<p>Duteil believes that treasurers now have an opportunity to play a leading role in how their organizations respond to the urgent call of sustainability. He concluded the webinar with his view that although sustainable finance has created a virtuous “race to the top”, if the transition is to happen successfully, all stakeholders – especially treasurers – face a “collective challenge” and must continue in open dialogue to accelerate the future we want.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>Welcome everyone. Sustainability often has some very personal values attached so let’s start by looking at what it means to you, and how it manifests itself in your treasury department.</h4>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Treasurer, Tideway:</strong> Our company was created to address a sustainability issue, so it was natural for us to align the financing and the treasury function with that mission. We started with financing and have now turned to our cash investments. On a day-to-day basis, we also have many activities that we do as team, to be more sustainable. We’ve implemented paper-free meetings, and we have organised team volunteering sessions, with litter-picks on the river.</p>
<p>In a huge city like London, we need an acute awareness of the entire ecosystem in which we operate. We look at it as needing both a license to operate for construction and a social license too. We have a long-term view of reconnecting London with the Thames. As an example, in order to build the tunnel, we had to bring tunnel boring machines and other equipment onto the sites, and then remove the spoil from the tunnel. Normally, this would have required about 600,000 two-way heavy goods vehicles trips across London. Our solution was to implement a “more by river” strategy. We now transport about 90% of all equipment and spoil by river for sites on the river. Because we are trebling freight traffic on the river, we worked with the Port of London Authority to establish an academy to train 300 new pilots, for now and for future use of the river.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Group Treasurer, Renewi:</strong> Renewi is a recycling and waste to product company. Sustainability is one of our core values and we have been able to align treasury activities so that we are now entirely green-financed. It’s about making sure that we reinvest into the circular economy. We are focused on finding new, sustainable solutions for waste issues that don’t yet have solutions. Last year we invested in PMC, a joint venture in reprocessing asbestos-contaminated steel which previously would have gone to landfill. We’ve also entered into a joint venture with firms such as Ikea to find ways to recycle old mattresses. In treasury, our focus is supporting the business to continue to invest in the circular economy.</p>
<h4>On the financial institution side, what has the sustainability journey been like for your organisations?</h4>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, Head of Global Cash Management, BlackRock:</strong> Journey is the right way to describe it for us at BlackRock. Today we have a centralised division called BlackRock Sustainable Investing which focuses on identifying drivers of long-term return associated with environmental, social and governance issues. The team looks across all of our products, considering how we can integrate ESG into our investment processes and create solutions for our clients to achieve sustainable investment return.</p>
<p>Two years ago, in the cash management world, few were talking about sustainability. Through increased investor interest in these issues, we had to work out how we could overlay basic ESG metrics on our existing products, making sure that we were fully capturing the exposure to ESG risks of individual companies. It was a fairly modest beginning, but the world has evolved and sustainability is resonating even more deeply, at a personal and corporate level with many of our clients. We found we weren’t being ambitious enough; there was a void in cash and liquidity management in terms of dedicated sustainable strategies which we have now turned our attention to. Earlier this year we launched a family of green money market solutions to stunning market reception.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges for our clients was the ‘value versus values’ debate, which is something we’re seeking to address. Our job as a fiduciary is to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns. Many felt under pressure from their board and investors to incorporate sustainability, yet were concerned about the risk of underperforming benchmarks. Now we can take a lot of those worries away.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Managing Director, Global Head of Liquidity GTS, Bank of America:</strong> So not dissimilar to what Tom described. I think that Bank of America has been a market-leading institution in terms of green financing for a long time, and we try to build on that success. Responsible growth is a cornerstone of our corporate strategy, and we try to do that also through ESG leadership in the broader market.</p>
<p>Where I sit, within the global transaction services, we work together with treasurers. And what we found over the last few years is that there is an increasing demand from them to try and turn their treasury departments into more sustainable and greener operations.</p>
<p>Also what we realised, I think, was that in the past we, as a bank, did a really good job focusing on ourselves and making sure that we are doing things in a sustainable way, and the right way. But I do believe that that there is a great multiplication impact to be had once we start extending that approach to our client base, simply because across the globe we deal with thousands of corporate clients.</p>
<p>In my view, the greatest impact for us on the broader economy and in wider society can be gained once we can work together with our clients and turn their treasury departments and businesses into sustainable and greener functions; it creates a far greater impact than if we just focus on ourselves.</p>
<p>It’s because we can impact our clients’ life within their treasury departments across the board, from the point that they make a payment, take out the loan, invest their excess cash, or even get their statements. We realised that we actually provide our clients with a very clear set of actions that they can take back to their businesses and start executing them. And it doesn’t take a lot, honestly; it just requires a little bit of focus and the willingness to move forward with their sustainable agenda.</p>
<h4>And do you notice different regional appetites for this amongst your clients?</h4>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> At BlackRock, absolutely we have and this is reflected in the US$5bn of assets already raised in our green money market strategies in Europe. There has been enthusiasm and energy in Europe that we have not quite seen yet in the US; this is partly due to regulators and governments expanding their focus on incorporating sustainability into investment information and decision making and corporate treasurers are often engaged on the topic through their pension fund or internal sustainability teams.</p>
<p>In Asia, demand has been primarily driven by investors in Hong Kong and Singapore. We are also seeing the ESG investment theme starting to emerge from Chinese investors.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> I would say no real differences between the regions except perhaps for product choice but there is a difference between the size of the company. Larger corporates, with greater resources might be able to dedicate more people to creating a wider scope of ESG-friendly treasury, whereas I think smaller companies tend to focus, for example, on moving away from paper statements to electronic statements, or they stop using cheques in favour of electronic transfers. Across the globe though, the consistent theme is that clients are really interested in discussing their ESG agendas with us.</p>
<h4>Let’s move on now to thinking about some of the best practices that treasury departments can adopt. What best practices have you adopted, and are putting in place for KPIs?</h4>

<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> We have introduced a sustainability-linked loan which has various KPIs. As we meet those targets, the price of facility is reduced correspondingly. One of the things that was really important to us was that the KPIs that we chose were also important metrics for the organisation. We were very keen to ensure that we could leverage the same measures that we were already using for our CSR reporting. By putting them into banking documentation they gain importance, they have a monetary value linked to them and they have a specific target linked to them each year over the five-year life of the loan. They need to be realistic and achievable because we don’t want to miss our sustainability targets but they need to be sufficiently challenging to deserve reward from our lenders.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> When I first took a green-financing strategy to the board, I was mindful that I didn’t want to create a mini-industry on the side, just producing reports. Although treasury has to look at what we are doing, how we measure it, and what we are reporting, we also have to align with the rest of the company in this respect. It brings more discipline because once we got treasury involved, the metrics were no longer optional. We formed a great relationship with our sustainability colleagues because it meant we are supporting the efforts that they lead.</p>
<p>I’d add that, like many things you do first time, you can find resistance, but with us, once we went through the cycle and the business saw the final product, those barriers quickly dissolved.</p>
<p>And what I would say on KPIs, it is important to be very candid about it with stakeholders. We have 54 legacy objectives – many in terms of employment – of which about 37 are live, with 90% on-track. Investors like to hear about those targets we meet as well as those we are still working towards and it makes the rest of our performance much more credible.</p>


<blockquote><p>Sustainability is one of our core values and we have been able to align treasury activities so that we are now entirely green-financed. It’s about making sure that we reinvest into the circular economy.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>What about external measures such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index or the Global Green Finance Index. Are any of those of relevance for either of you?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> ESG ratings are broadly relevant. There is a lot of commitment to the UN PRI Principles for Responsible Investing from equity investment managers, and it is certainly a topic of conversation on the equity side of the equation. Many ESG ratings are unsolicited and un-consulted so the veracity of them is questionable sometimes. But I think that the ESG rating industry is maturing and is becoming more relevant as a benchmark; as their understanding of the idiosyncrasies of individual companies improves, the level and quality of their ratings improve.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> We are on some of the green bond indices but have minimal exposure to ESG ratings. Some of the unsolicited ratings providers show companies what they have drafted, giving them a chance to provide feedback, others don’t. There is an ongoing discussion in the investor community about the general lack of transparency of the methodology. One view is that they should all have the same methodology, and all be transparent, with companies publishing their data just once a year. I think it is fine for each to have different approaches because it allows for indices to be valued in different ways by investors but consistency in the data procured would be welcomed by corporates.</p>
<h4>From a financial services perspective, what are your thoughts on the use of metrics?</h4>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> Clients have different priorities. One could be interested only in having sustainable vendors and suppliers, and would like to offer different supply chain models and price points to suppliers that meet certain sustainability criteria. Another could be interested in having diversity on their board or be interested in moving completely away from paper-based payment instruments. Rather than focusing on and trying to follow the sometimes confusing methodologies by the rating agencies, we would rather engage on a bi-lateral basis, then work with them to really dig deep, and then try to tailor our solutions and advisories to those specific objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> There are issues that have to be talked about, especially the metrics, when creating portfolios. We often see wildly diverging ratings on the same company so we created our own ESG credit methodology approach, taking into account Sustainalytics and MSCI metrics, and other third-party data. It is confusing for clients and we do find a lot of inconsistencies. We have had times where the treasury department can’t buy our funds, but their charitable foundation can, because of different policy guidelines. And there are different standards for what qualifies as a green bond for certain clients, so it is hard to create a one-size-fits-all product when there are so many conflicting demands. We can bring the breadth of our experience, having gone through this journey ourselves, and can create custom solutions for clients. But there needs to be a dialogue because it is more complicated than I think many of us appreciate.</p>
<h4>Let’s turn to the practicalities of using green finance tools such as green bonds and green loans. Can you talk us through your experience?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> Renewi issued its first green bond in 2015, which was a Belgian retail bond. We did a more substantial green financing in 2018, where we converted our main banking facility into a green finance document. That involved creating a green finance framework, which we worked closely with our banks to prepare, with Sustainalytics reviewing and providing a second opinion.</p>
<p>Our banking group is a syndicate of lenders, and a couple of those banks were our ‘green advisors’. They were able to sound out the other banks on the documentation, making sure that what we were proposing was acceptable to all parties.</p>
<p>Somewhat unusually for Renewi, we were able to create a ‘perpetual’ green framework that documents our asset position versus our liability position. This meant it was fit for purpose for another bond issuance that we did earlier this year; we didn’t need to create a new framework for the new instrument.</p>

<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> Both Renewi and Tideway are pure-play sustainability businesses and so it may not be quite the same for other companies. I make that caveat because sometimes people say it is easy for you, because you are a pure-player, but we have still taken a green finance strategy to the board and then created our green finance framework.</p>
<p>We are often asked how much work it involves. Our framework offers a short description of the company, a section describing what we do from a sustainability perspective – all that information already exists – and then we just follow the simple four IMCA Green Bond Principles: Use of Proceeds, Process for Project Evaluation and Selection, Management of Proceeds and Reporting. It is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>Since 2017, all our financing has been green. We have issued seven green bonds – much of which is done on a deferred basis – and in August this year we closed our first green US private placement, also deferred.</p>
<p>We are now going a step further. Our green evaluation by Standard &amp; Poor’s now covers all our bonds issued since the inception of our EMT programme, and we will be transferring all to the London Stock Exchange Green Exchange, greening all of our bond financing.</p>
<p>And then of course there is the reporting. Anyone designing a green bond framework should pay attention to how they plan to report; as they are reporting on the allocation of funds, that has to be very straightforward. In terms of the impact, just don’t design things that will require a lot of work later on!</p>

<h4>What benefits have these instruments brought to your organisations?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> We get a financial benefit: that is clear, and a strong sell in and of itself. But we are also linking one of Renewi’s core Values, ‘Sustainability’, with multiple teams internally. Our treasury and finance teams are more closely connected with the ESG function and together are driving a stronger dialogue with the board as a result. On the equity capital markets side, it has been a helpful additional part of our narrative; offering proof positive to investors that we are entirely focused on sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> We are very similar; it has definitely helped in aligning the company’s sustainability mission with financing. It has changed the dynamics inside the company. It has brought financing closer to some other functions. Finance is generally misunderstood but we made it much more understandable, so others could link what the company is doing with what finance is doing; it started a number of conversations. It also started conversations with our shareholders; they are delighted! We are one of the most advanced portfolio companies and so they use a number of our sustainability case studies, including financing, in their reporting.</p>
<p>I’d add that there is a lot of discussion as to whether you get better pricing or not. I think there is some evidence that you may, but I think that it is still early days. It was not our main motivation.</p>
<h4>Tell us about Bank of America’s approach to sustainable financing and investments.</h4>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> We have heard a lot about green bonds and green financing. Within global transaction services, we like to extend the spectrum of products we are offering in the financing space. One particular solution that we are getting a lot of interest in is sustainable supply chain finance. It’s a very simple yet powerful concept because of the multiplication impact again.</p>
<p>We give tools to our clients that allow them to offer preferential payment terms to certain suppliers who meet specific sustainability targets. Clients love the flexibility that it is not just about their green bonds and loans and facilities but also that they can extend the ESG concept across their entire supply chain model. It remains that the most important incentive for clients, across, all products, is that it enables them to achieve their ESG goals.</p>
<h4>And how is BlackRock adjusting its products to keep ahead; are you responding to clients or doing so on your own initiative?</h4>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> We respond to clients and also to market structures. The essence of any money fund is of course liquidity and preservation of capital. Just because a fund is green does not relinquish that requirement. The challenge that any asset manager moving into this space has is that there is very little – next to zero – issuance of short-dated green bonds. Multi-billion dollar liquid portfolios of green bonds just don’t exist!</p>
<p>In time, as market structure changes, our portfolios will change. But as with many sustainability projects, you have to start where you are, not where you wish you were. And right now we are at the front end of the market, where 80% of issuance comes from financials which are not green entities. At BlackRock, our approach is ‘best of breed’. We have many financial names and we filter and rank them based on publicly available green criteria.</p>
<p>As we become successful and these funds grow, it is going to change issuer behaviour. Since we have launched these funds, we have issuers talk to us about green CP programmes and green CD programmes. The short end of the market is always the deepest, most liquid and most cost-effective part of the curve to issue, but right now that is not available to choose a green project. As firms like BlackRock create the products and the demand, supply should follow, making it cheaper and more efficient to finance green projects.</p>
<h4>And do you see a time when we will stop using the term ‘green’ because it will become ubiquitous?</h4>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> What I would love to see is that, whether you call it green or whether it just becomes a more ubiquitous term, that the green issuance will trade at a premium to non-green issuance, ie the market will pay more and issuers will finance more efficiently for green products than for non-green products. When we get to that point, it becomes the ultimate incentive for issuers to create these products.</p>
<h4>We hear a lot about how technology is revolutionising corporate treasury so would you say that it is enhancing your sustainability agenda?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> I don’t personally see, at the moment, technology playing a major part in our sustainability activities. Obviously using a treasury management system concentrates the activity and makes it more efficient, but that’s really driven by efficiency and how we want to operate.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> I agree that system integration can help – we have in our procurement policies a number of ESG KPIs that can be centrally managed.</p>
<h4>How is Bank of America using technology, in terms of driving your own sustainability agenda, and as a service for clients?</h4>

<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> We believe that technology does have a very important role in driving the sustainability agenda and are trying to look at different ways to innovate around this. An example of what I mean is the idea of ‘digital disbursements’. This allows corporates to make payments based on an email address. There are two very important sustainable aspects to this.</p>
<p>Because it is all electronic it replaces the need for anything paper-based, removing a lot of transportation and paper costs. Also, where we work with a number of US charities, we have found that in areas impacted by natural disasters, for example, by hurricanes, often the physical infrastructure is damaged; using digital disbursements helps get immediate aid to people. For us, it’s about challenging ourselves, using technology in innovative ways, helping drive the sustainability agenda.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4>And how is technology being used within the asset management space in the context of sustainability?</h4>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> Our company is built around a single best in class risk analytics and order management platform, called Aladdin, which enables us to efficiently manage our own US$6trn in assets. Our approach is to fully integrate sustainability and ESG metrics into Aladdin so that we are able to operate at scale.</p>
<p>Anytime a portfolio manager purchases an asset in one of our green funds, it goes through the same filters as any other class, ensuring that we are being consistent with our investment philosophy and that non-green assets don’t end up in green funds securing their credibility.</p>
<h4>Let’s turn now to how this space might evolve over the next five years. How much further forward do you think your company’s approach to sustainability will be?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> We completed our conversation to all-green finance earlier this year; it was a major milestone for us. We have got our CSR targets too, so in five years’ time I would hope that we have met all of those. But that won’t be the end of the journey. We will need to define the next stage of the journey for the organisation, and from there continue to focus on the positive impact of sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> We started with financing and so all our financing going forward is green and sustainable. We are now turning our attention to our cash deposits, and in particular money market funds. It’s very early days in this market. There are probably only two or three companies that have suitable products available, and even explaining how these work is still difficult.</p>
<p>We’re also focusing on the ESG performance of our counterparties. They may have a great fund, but if the organisation is not committed, we’re not so interested. We’ll either replace them or engage them in dialogue. We know that it’s difficult in the very short-term investment space, where 80% of holdings are financial institutions, to create a product that is different from what exists already. But we are watching that space.</p>
<p>Generally, I think for all companies sustainability is quickly becoming central to their business. It’s not something on the side, it is essential to their strategy. Most of the business opportunities and most of the risks will come from this space and soon it will be second nature to everybody, treasury included.</p>
<h4>Are either of you working towards any other kind of sustainability agenda at the moment, with specific goals?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> Becoming an entirely green-financed company was our primary focus but in the longer-term maybe there are more products to consider as the banking market evolves, and as Renewi itself evolves. Hopefully we can participate in some of those developments.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> Corporates have traditionally been under-represented in bodies where frameworks and guidelines have been created but these will ultimately have to be implemented by corporates so it is vital that we have a voice. That’s why we are a group member of the Corporate Forum on Sustainable Finance, and we are very keen to share our experience and best practices with others at event such as this.</p>
<h4>As corporates, will you increasingly expect green credentials from your suppliers?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> I think that would be a logical extension. Obviously, it depends on the nature and scale of your organisation and the nature and scale of your suppliers. In our industry, we work with businesses of all sizes, and the requirements are going to be different for a ‘mom and pop’ business versus a massive global corporate.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> We have three main work contracts of around £2.6bn and they have to report on a quarterly basis on all of those commitments. We try as much as possible in our procurement policies to extend our commitments to other suppliers, but we have to be realistic.</p>
<h4>How do you see this space evolving over the next five years from a financial services perspective?</h4>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> Just based on what we have seen in the last few years, I think it is just going to be more front and centre for our clients. In August, more than 180 CEOs signed, as part of the business roundtable, a new statement making sustainability part of a common core strategy, with common goals that we are going to work towards in the next five years. This topic is not going away, it is just going to become part and parcel of our everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> My hope, ambition and expectation is that in the coming years, as it relates to liquidity investment, sustainability goes from a niche strategy to the default choice for liquidity management. That might sound ambitious, but I think that there is a generational shift that is happening in the world, and certainly in corporate treasuries where the up-and-coming generation care passionately about these issues.</p>
<h4>What are the key sustainability initiatives that your organisations are working on for next year and beyond?</h4>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> I think we have managed to get to a point now where ESG in Bank of America is not just a group of experts sitting somewhere in New York. ESG principles are embedded in all our lines of business. Our product managers are thinking about the kind of products we should bring to market. We are, for example, looking at bank-deposit products which could align with ESG principles. We are looking at broadening our digital solutions, helping treasuries to become more sustainable.</p>
<p>We are also spending a lot of time on training our sales force and our coverage bankers, educating them on the importance of ESG, giving them the confidence to open up that discussion with their client base and adding another dimension to that relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> At BlackRock, our focus right now is on broadening and deepening our investor base and our product line-ups. We have been very encouraged by the market reception of our approach to sustainable cash investing. We will see where we go from here, based on investment demand, but we feel on the evidence so far, we are on the right track.</p>
<h4>As experienced practitioners, what advice would you offer to treasurers who are just getting started on a sustainability project?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> Just talking to people. You can hear from the other side of the table that this is a conversation that the banks are very happy to have. I think there are other treasurers who have experience, such as myself and Inês, who are happy to share that – and there is a growing body of that experience.</p>
<p>I would say to treasurers contemplating it, that as well as discussing it with your banks and your peers, also make a point of connecting internally if you are not already, with your teams responsible for managing CSR and sustainability. Do make sure that you understand these themes within your organisational context because it will help you explain it when you are having those conversations with the banks and the investment community.</p>
<p>More and more treasurers are interested and engaged, and they are curious as to my experience of sustainable finance, and how they can translate that into their own organisation. As we have said, each organisation will be different in its application, and they may be very different in their Purpose and Values, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t find the parts of the organisation where they can have a positive impact and find eligibility in the way that we have.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> Have a go! And I think have a go now whilst it is optional, because regulation will soon catch up. There are risks and opportunities involved, but I believe that one day this will become central to all corporate treasuries, finance being at the heart of all of companies.</p>
<p>As treasurers, we may not know everything about sustainability, but we can bring a lot to the table alongside our specialist internal partners. In fact, we bring a wealth of experience in communicating with investors and in reporting, and that is valuable to other areas of our organisations.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information out there to fill the gaps. As an example, A4S, the Accounting for Sustainability Project , published a very practical guide, with lots of case studies, earlier this year specifically for treasurers, explaining how to raise sustainable finance.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> From a bank perspective, I agree with Adam, encouraging clients to speak with their financial providers, and also to challenge them because we need to be proactive in bringing these solutions to our corporate clients.</p>
<p>But I would also encourage treasurers to think as broadly as possible. For a number of years it has all been about green finance and green bonds. We’ve heard today that there are so many other possibilities, from how diverse their treasury department is, to what extent they incorporate green and sustainable principles into their investment policies or into their broader treasury policies. But also think about rating vendors and suppliers from a sustainability point of view, and even to what extent it is possible to eliminate paper from treasury.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> I agree with what everyone else has said, but perhaps the most important advice that I would give to corporate treasurers is to understand the power that they have. This is a new and evolving market. It may not seem so important in terms of sustainability for the treasurer to think about where they allocate their cash, but the power that they exercise through their investments will change the products that the asset management brings to market. And those products will change issuer behaviour, and issuer behaviour will have a direct impact on green and sustainable products. Treasurers should never underestimate the upstream impact that they have at this very early stage of this market in terms of how this market will evolve. It is incredibly powerful. They should appreciate that power and exercise it!</p>

<h4>Sustainability has a naturally strong human element so, to finish, I wanted to ask you all if there was a moment for you personally when you knew it was something on which you needed to focus your attention?</h4>
<p><strong>Adam Richford, Renewi:</strong> For me certainly there was less of a focus on sustainability before being part of Renewi. But it particularly became front and centre as we went through a merger and created a new organisation and got to re-define our sustainability purpose as an organisation. The personal resonance that this has for me became very obvious and apparent as well, and that has been a driving force to want to push the agenda within the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Inês Faden da Silva, Tideway:</strong> I previously worked in banking and in the emerging markets energy sector. In 2003, a small group of banks, including mine, launched the Equator Principles, a risk management framework to help banks assess and manage environmental and social risk in project finance, based on IFC’s Safeguard Policies from 1998. Because of that, I became very much aware of critical environmental and social aspects affecting the projects on which I was advising.</p>
<p>But it was only since joining Tideway, a company created to address a major sustainability issue – and where the whole company is enthused by what we are doing – that I really knew I had to do something, to the point where I decided to study sustainable business whilst working.</p>
<p><strong>Henrik Lang, Bank of America:</strong> For me, it all started with volunteering, early on in my life. Later, when I had a family, I realised just how important sustainability is. At Bank of America, culturally, it is just ingrained within the organisation. Everybody is aligned with our sustainability cause and works together as a team. Importantly, we enjoy talking about these topics. ESG discussions are very personal so it becomes interesting and easy for everybody to engage.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Callahan, BlackRock:</strong> Engaging with our clients around sustainable cash investing has been personally transformative in terms of how I think about this and how I live my life.</p>
<p>The world is changing, and so are our clients. BlackRock holds charity events throughout the year and our beach clean-ups have quickly become the most popular and over-subscribed.</p>

<h4 id=""why-think-about-esg"">Why think about ESG?</h4>
<p>Corporate treasurers mandated with investing their firm’s money to preserve capital, maintain liquidity and deliver some yield have tended to think of ESG as a secondary concern, if at all. Those who did consider it – including asset managers – largely believed it would restrict the investment universe and the flexibility of money market funds.</p>
<p>In fact, ESG is a key determinant of value creation and protection, and therefore highly relevant to treasurers’ aims. ESG factors are the non-financial aspects of a company’s performance that are key contributors to its bottom line – so taking them into account is highly pertinent. It is not the same as ethical investing, which avoids specific investments for ethical reasons without taking into account the impact of these choices on financial performance.</p>
<p>For instance, the money market funds using ESG criteria today are prime funds, invested in commercial paper and other private instruments, so their primary exposure is to the financial sector. As such, governance has always been an implicit – but essential – consideration. In recent history, examples of material governance failings readily come to mind, from Wells Fargo to Danske Bank, and of course the subprime crisis. This also highlights how some ESG risks can materialise quickly, impacting short-term investors perhaps even more than longer-term ones who can afford to ride out a crisis.</p>
<p>As illustrated by the number of ESG money market funds launched recently in the US, but also flows into these funds, interest is growing rapidly. According to <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/2c7b8438-a5a6-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Fitch Ratings</a>, assets rose 15% to US$52bn over the first half of 2019, after growing 1% through all of 2018<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. The momentum is building as regulators and authorities call for greater ESG disclosure from asset owners and managers, and investors understand this. They are increasingly asking probing questions about how ESG is integrated into their portfolios.</p>
<h4 id=""asking-the-hard-questions"">Asking the hard questions</h4>
<p>Because ESG is complex, investors need to choose managers that understand a wide set of metrics and carry out their analyses within the context of dynamic global events – such as the shift to sustainable consumption, the climate change agenda and the movement for equality, all of which will create winners and losers.</p>
<p>When conducting due diligence, investors should look beyond managers’ claims, to avoid those content with greenwashing, and they should ask challenging questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does the investment process go beyond simple exclusion criteria?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the manager have a framework to categorise strategies by type of ESG approach (eg integration, active ownership, exclusion, positive screening, etc)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they have a proprietary, forward-looking scoring methodology focused on the material factors most likely to impact performance? For instance, although MSCI ratings are a good start, they present significant limits on these points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the manager’s track record in terms of ESG integration, voting at AGMs, industry lobbying and active engagement to encourage companies to improve their ESG practices? Meaningful engagement of this kind can reveal a manager’s true level of commitment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having fully integrated ESG factors into their credit research, asset managers should act on the data. They can exclude some investments where companies present a high level of near-term risk. To take a non-financial example, explicit governance failures led us to shun BP shares in 2010. When the Deepwater horizon spill occurred, this decision benefitted our investors. Where short-term risks are low but long-term risks more meaningful, the best approach is usually to engage with companies to encourage them to adopt best practice, both through voting – where asset managers hold shares – and via meetings and correspondence with company boards, to raise concerns and follow progress.</p>
<h4 id=""growing-momentum"">Growing momentum</h4>
<p>While ESG is one of the hottest corporate topics today, it has been a key part of our investment philosophy for decades – our record of engaging and voting at company AGMs dates back to the 1970s. We see it as a demonstration of our responsible stewardship of our clients’ money, putting that money into projects, companies and assets that will deliver long-term value.</p>
<p>That said, we recognise that ESG is a complex space. To make further progress, the market needs to come together to make ESG more readily understandable. Among many other initiatives, we have long been advocating for ESG standardisation, and we are pleased to see it emerging. In the UK, the <a href=""https://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/committees/50283405"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">British Standards Institute</a> (BSI) is working towards a standard for sustainable investment. It is also in conversation with its global counterpart, ISO, demonstrating the growing momentum towards a global taxonomy.</p>
<p>Few investors ever used to ask their asset managers what ESG factors they incorporated. Today, this question is becoming increasingly routine. The asset management industry needs to be ready, and as the industry continues to align capital with the ever-more relevant risk metrics of ESG, we urge investors to keep asking those hard questions.</p>

<p><em>In recent years, the focus on sustainability has been growing in popularity across the globe. With treasurers facing increasing pressure to imbed sustainability principles to support and drive their corporate’s strategy, the sustainability agenda sees no sign of abating. In the latest podcast with Treasury Today, we caught up with two pioneers leading the sustainability charge – HSBC and the Republic of Seychelles.</em></p>
<p style=""margin:2em 0 2em 0;""><a class=""button--red-stroke"" href=""/treasury-talks-podcast-series"">Listen to the podcast</a></p>
<h4>What exactly is sustainability from a treasury point of view?</h4>
<p>According to Lance Kawaguchi, Managing Director, Global Head – Corporates (Global Liquidity and Cash Management) at HSBC, sustainability means being aware of environmental, social and economic influences, and building for the future without compromising on the resources and ability of future generations to meet their needs.</p>
<p>“Sustainability fits with ESG and CSR as both refer to taking responsibility to innovate, grow, and improve risk management – this will result in a more sustainable business,” he says.</p>
<p>Every major international business has an impact on people all over the world – from its customers, employees, suppliers and regulators, to its investors and the wider communities it serves.</p>
<p>“Being sustainable means recognising the importance of relationships with all these different groups while taking into account their needs and aspirations,” says Kawaguchi.</p>
<h4 id=""looking-after-customers"">Looking after customers</h4>

For HSBC, its sustainability approach focuses on three main areas:

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sustainable finance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustainable networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entrepreneurship and future skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Within global liquidity and cash management, we are supporting the transition from paper to digital in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint and give time back to our clients through productivity gains,” he says.</p>
<p>The bank sees particular opportunities for its clients to embed sustainability best practices. Kawaguchi points out that one way for treasurers can move forward in this space is by actually focusing on opportunities in the supply chain.</p>
<p>“By reviewing their current supply chain and moving to more sustainable suppliers, treasurers can have a huge impact in reducing their organisation’s carbon footprint,” he points out. “Another way is to digitise and automate processes as much as possible. This may require an initial investment, but will realise long-term benefits.”</p>
<p>For Kawaguchi, being sustainable doesn’t mean that it’s not profitable - quite the opposite. “By reducing your key costs, and by making sustainable investment decisions, it can only increase your profitability margins.”</p>
<h4 id=""looking-after-the-environment"">Looking after the environment</h4>
<p>The beautiful archipelago of the Seychelles, with its miles of sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters, is heavily dependent on its tourism industry to survive. But in the face of climate change, it is its marine economy – particularly the fishing industry – which has come under major scrutiny in recent years.</p>
<p>“Both our tourism and marine economies are interlinked,” says Patrick Payet, the Republic of Seychelle’s Secretary of State for Finance, Trade, Investment and Economic Planning. “They are highly dependent on external markets, and particularly vulnerable to external factors.”</p>
<p>Payet makes the point that the economy of the Seychelles has experienced a high level of volatility and a loss of production in its fisheries over the last two decades. With the Seychelles’ ‘blue economies’ of high importance, it was imperative to ensure that its fishing industry, and tourism industry, remained resilient and future proofed.</p>
<p>“Because we are committed to supporting the development of a sustainable marine economy, we needed to issue a flagship transaction which would reflect not only our social and environmental responsibilities but achieve competitive pricing at the same time”.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution"">The solution?</h4>
<p>In October 2018, Payet and his team went to the capital markets, and successfully issued a US$15m ten-year ‘Blue Bond’. 100% of the proceeds were earmarked for supporting the development of a sustainable marine economy.</p>
<p>“We obtained optimal terms by using the World Bank guarantee, which helped us to achieve more competitive pricing,” says Payet. All of the proceeds from the bond will contribute to the World Bank’s South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance project. “This supports all countries in the region to sustainably manage their fisheries resources and increase economic benefits,” he added.</p>
<p>The ‘Blue Bond’ will see a number of key benefits – it will help to raise employment and conserve its marine resources, which has had a knock-on impact for operators in the tourism industry. As Payet concludes: “Despite all of these benefits, ultimately it is the general population of the Seychelles that will see the biggest benefits from our healthier marine environment.”</p>
<p>In paving the way for future ‘blue issuance’ to help protect our oceans, the Republic of Seychelles was a worthy winner in the Best Sustainable Finance solution (Highly Commended) at this year’s Adam Smith Awards.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Sustainability is a topic which incorporates a number of different areas, but in the context of business the focus tends to be on environmental and social concerns. “A sustainable business is a business that looks at the environmental, social or governance (ESG) risks that may have a significant impact on a company’s bottom line,” explains Loic Dujardin, Research Director at Sustainalytics.</p>
<p>This topic has become increasingly important to corporates in Asia over the last couple of years. “Broadly speaking, the topic of ESG started out in Europe, where it is pretty familiar to corporates and investors and has been for over a decade,” says Beijia Ma, a strategist on the Thematic Investing team at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. “In the last 18-24 months, there has been an explosion of interest among corporates and investors in Asia Pacific.”</p>
<p>This is particularly the case in China. While CO2 emissions have increased rapidly over the last few decades, China has committed to a number of actions under the Paris climate agreement, including peaking the country’s carbon emissions by 2030 while increasing the use of non-fossil fuels to account for 20% of China’s energy consumption. Indeed, China is the world’s foremost investor in renewable energy, accounting for 45% of the world’s new solar installations last year. “There is an increasing awareness from corporates in Asia that they should be focusing on their own sustainability, and that this is something investors are increasingly asking for,” comments Ma.</p>
<p>Dujardin notes that in Asia, ESG risks such as water pollution, climate change and corruption may have a profound effect on company’s operations and profitability. “The ability of a company to manage ESG risks is key for its long-term success,” he adds. “Consumers in Asia are becoming more aware and concerned about the sustainability issues that impact their health and well-being, such as air pollution and food safety. Workers are also in a stronger position to demand better treatment.” As a result, Dujardin says that corporates which stay ahead of these changing expectations can differentiate themselves from their competitors.</p>

<p>For companies, these topics are becoming a higher priority. “I have no doubt that corporations as a whole are realising that being environmentally irresponsible just doesn’t work anymore,” says Damian Glendinning, Treasurer at Lenovo. “Even in the US, the polluting industries which stand to benefit from the relaxation of environmental protection laws have made it clear they do not want to be associated with relaxed environmental controls. Everyone wants to have a good public image when it comes to the environment.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Lenovo recently demonstrated its own commitment to this topic by inventing a new process which lowers the temperatures used for soldering components. This consumes significantly less electricity, and therefore has considerable environmental benefits. “Instead of trying to profit financially from the invention, we are making it available free of charge to the whole industry, on the grounds that we feel the environment comes first,” says Glendinning.</p>
<p>Lenovo is far from the only company in the region focusing on this topic. “Sustainability is important for corporates in Asia for a number of reasons,” says Paul Davies, Partner at Latham &amp; Watkins LLP. “In order to attract international investment and business, Asian companies increasingly have to demonstrate corporate sustainability and responsibility. This is because multinationals risk reputational damage, legal action, and investor pressure if they fail to consider sustainability.”</p>
<p>Davies says that companies may increasingly find it necessary for brand-building and growth potential to prioritise sustainable development, corporate social responsibility and an overall awareness of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that could impact a company. “Moreover, regulations relating to sustainability are becoming increasingly strict in many Asian countries, giving companies that take early action an advantage in complying with such regulations,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""what-does-sustainability-mean-for-treasurers"">What does sustainability mean for treasurers?</h3>
<p>Sustainability may not be a core component of the treasurer’s role, but there are a number of reasons why treasurers should pay attention to this topic. “For corporate treasures, the implications are interconnected across green financing, managing supply chains and creating positive social and economic benefits in this region,” explains Cynthia Tchikoltsoff, Head of Supply Chain for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>Treasurers also need to be aware of the risks that can arise in relation to this topic. “Some ESG risks may impact the company’s liquidity,” says Dujardin. “For example, pollution from a company’s operation may trigger fines or litigation costs. A product safety issue may impact a company’s reputation. This, in turn, could potentially prevent the company from generating revenues or restrain its ability to access funds from banks.” Consequently, Dujardin says that treasurers need to have a good understanding of the ESG risks a company is facing, and of their effect on the company’s liquidity.</p>
<p>As well as understanding the risks, corporate treasurers can also play a role in supporting companies’ ESG goals in some key areas. These include replacing paper with digital workflows – and thereby helping to reduce their organisations’ CO2 footprints – as well as incorporating sustainability into their funding strategies by taking advantage of the growing green bonds market.</p>
<h4>Replacing paper with digital workflows</h4>
<p>Companies have many reasons for digitising their paper workflows: digital workflows bring greater efficiency and visibility and can therefore enable the treasury to operate at a higher level than would otherwise be possible. Beyond these benefits, digitisation can also bring considerable sustainability benefits.</p>
<p>“There are several large companies who already have extensive programmes towards sustainability and replacing paper with digital work flows is one way corporates can enhance efficiency in a green way,” explains Rakshith Kundha, Managing Director, Trade and Supply Chain Finance, India and South East Asia at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Currently, much of the paper is digitised by parties in the work flow. As such, it would be more effective for companies to receive information and data in a digital rather than paper format.”</p>
<p>As Kundha explains, going paperless is an efficient option for companies to streamline processes and increase efficiency, while also reducing their costs and their carbon footprints. Information reporting and transaction initiation are two areas which can offer opportunities for improvement. Kundha points out that corporate treasurers can initiate transactions and view statements via electronic channels, including mobile, which are directly integrated into their ERP systems. This enables companies to save time and manpower spent on reconciliation and updating while increasing efficiency and visibility.</p>
<p>“For example, millions of sheets of paper were used for printing client statements annually in Asia Pacific,” he says. “We have since implemented digital statements, thereby reducing paper consumption while enhancing the overall client experience. This is just one example of how digitisation of work flows can make a material difference. And for our firm, it is also part of our broader efforts to manage our environmental impact – including reducing paper waste, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kundha says there are some areas where it is more challenging to replace paper with digital workflows due to regulations. “For example, regulations may require that the paper document is provided, checked or retained,” he says – although he adds that with governments looking to digitise workflows, these areas are likely to become less challenging in the future.</p>
<h3 id=""green-bonds"">Green bonds</h3>
<p>As well as building sustainability goals into treasury processes, treasurers may also have an opportunity to tap into the green bond market. As the name implies, a green bond is a bond which is used to fund projects with environmental or other green benefits. The market for green bonds has grown rapidly in the last decade: the sixth annual State of the Market report commissioned by HSBC identified “a universe of US$895bn climate-aligned bonds outstanding which is made up of 3,493 bonds from 1,128 issuers across seven climate themes” – including US$221bn of labelled green bonds. According to the report, China was the largest source of issuance in 2017.</p>
<p>“Since the beginning of last year, we have seen a dramatic increase in Chinese issuance,” comments Ma. “This is likewise the case with places like India, Japan, South Korea and several other East Asian countries as well. We have seen quite a few new countries issuing for the first time this year.”</p>
<p>Corporate issuers can benefit from green financing in a number of ways. Ma notes that corporates are often attracted to green financing “because you tend to tap into higher quality types of investor. Some of the major investors in green bonds are traditional ESG investors, who tend to hold onto those bonds a bit longer”.</p>
<h4 id=""driving-adoption"">Driving adoption</h4>
<p>With a growing focus on sustainability at a global level, issuers and investors have much to gain by investigating this area. “Investors are increasingly aware that sustainability, and the commitments the international community has made to improving it – such as the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by UN Member States, including China and India – brings with it a host of opportunities across sectors and regions,” says Davies.</p>
<p>Davies points out that many Asian countries have ambitious renewables targets, and are seeking to bring in the required investment through green financing. “The use of green bond proceeds for carbon reduction energy projects, for instance, is important for many Asian countries as a step towards meeting the Paris COP21 Agreement climate change targets,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""principles-and-guidelines"">Principles and guidelines</h4>
<p>While the Asia market follows the ICMA Green Bond Principles (GBP), local guidelines are also beginning to be adopted. In December 2015 and January 2016, green bond guidelines were published by the People’s Bank of China and by the National Development and Reform Commission. These are largely aligned with international practice as set out by the GBP when it comes to defining what constitutes a green project, although there are some differences.</p>
<p>“It’s generally pretty clear what constitutes a green bond and what type of project qualifies,” says Ma. “This might include renewables, energy efficient buildings, clean transport, clean waste and clean water. Even R&amp;D in a specific area could qualify as well. The major difference in Asia versus the broader market is that countries like China are looking at more controversial areas like clean coal.”</p>
<p>Across the region, a number of similar initiatives are under way. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has developed a set of rules for the issuance and listing of green bonds. In Japan, the Ministry of the Environment issued a set of Green Bond Guidelines earlier this year in order to encourage issuance and investment. Meanwhile the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum is introducing green bond standards, based on the GBP, in order to support sustainable growth and meet investor interest in green investments.</p>
<h4 id=""innovation-in-the-market"">Innovation in the market</h4>
<p>There’s more to green financing than green bonds alone. This is a rapidly evolving market, and Davies notes that there has been a good deal of supply-side innovation in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>“The green finance market has increasingly seen products other than normal bonds, including securitisation of cash flows from green product contracts and credit facilities with margins linked to the use of the borrowings or the sustainability rating of the borrower,” he explains. “Green bond indices enable investors to benchmark performance and promote liquidity. Green bond-linked exchange-traded funds have helped to stimulate broad-based demand by offering investors access to the investment grade green bond market.”</p>
<h4 id=""using-green-bonds"">Using green bonds</h4>
<p>While the market for green financing is growing rapidly, this is still a nascent market – and consequently, there are a few pitfalls to look out for. For one thing, companies should be aware of the possible costs of issuance. “Historically, companies have tended to incur incremental costs of around US$15,000 – US$40,000 in order to issue a green bond, due to the additional reporting requirements,” says Ma. “It shouldn’t break the bank – but it’s worth noting that for repeat issuers, the incremental costs for further issuance would be much less.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In time, we may see a greater number of corporate green bond issuances from companies that are not traditionally considered green.”</p>
<p><cite>Paul Davies, Partner, Latham &amp; Watkins LLP</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When using green financing, Davies says treasurers should bear in mind that although green financing may lack pervasive and enforceable legal standards to be classed as a ‘green bond’ by international investing standards, “the projects for which the proceeds will be used must be carefully demarcated in light of prevailing international and local standards. If this is not the case, certain investors may decline to add the company’s debt to their investment portfolios”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he says that if a treasurer can build sustainable financing with thoughtful engagement on the company’s sustainability performance, “there is the potential to attract new investors and potentially improve commercial terms”.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Sustainability has become an increasingly important topic for corporates in Asia – and this is likely to continue in the years ahead. As such, treasurers should consider what they can do to support their organisations in this respect, whether this means issuing green bonds, building greater sustainability into the supply chain or digitising paper flows.</p>
<p>Where green financing is concerned, it will be interesting to see how the market develops in the next couple of years. “In time, we may see a greater number of corporate green bond issuances from companies that are not traditionally considered green,” says Davies. “Green bonds and sustainable finance have great potential as tools to finance not just renewable energy companies, for example, but also companies transitioning and improving their sustainability performance.”</p>
<p>Likewise, technology will continue to provide new opportunities for companies to eliminate paper from their workflows. As BNP Paribas’ Tchikoltsoff concludes, “The most important thing for treasurers to bear in mind when it comes to this space is that the cost of doing nothing far exceeds the benefits and rewards of acting.”</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Meryam Omi is responsible for engaging on sustainability themes globally and the development of responsible investment solutions.</p>

<br/>
<p>Governments globally have committed to tackling climate change. The historic Paris Agreement to address climate change entered into force on 4 November 2016 with the US, China, India and Europe all ratifying their national commitments. The direction of travel is clear: keeping the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C against pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>Alongside the political will for change, some of the world’s largest investors, including public and private pension funds and university endowments, are increasingly recognising that they need to address the long-term financial risks and opportunities associated with the shift away from traditional energy models.</p>
<p>As one of the largest institutional asset managers in Europe, LGIM has always played its part by using its scale to ensure companies are addressing the transition to a low-carbon economy. In our index funds, which have to hold all the companies in the benchmark index, we have focused on using engagement with the underlying companies to drive change, rather than excluding stocks or sectors (divestment).</p>
<p>The investment risks surrounding climate change have become so urgent that, for the first time, we are going beyond solely engaging with companies in order to hold them to account on the issue. Companies that fail to embrace the transition to a low-carbon economy by demonstrating adequate strategy, governance and transparency will be excluded from our new Future World Fund. In all other funds where we cannot divest, we will vote against the chair of the board to ensure we are using one voice across all of our holdings. This is the first time we have pledged to do so on a global scale for the issue of climate change.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to make the companies successful in the long run by addressing the challenges of climate change and low carbon opportunities. Our innovative approach, harnessing the combined powers of divestment and voting, ensures that our engagement, on behalf of our investors, has real consequences. Representing over $1trillion of assets that we manage on behalf of our clients, this one voice can carry a lot of weight. The message is simple to all of the companies we invest in: it is no longer enough to talk. We need to act now.</p>
<h3 id=""the-problem"">The problem</h3>
<p>The world is warming up at an alarming rate and this is starting to meaningfully alter weather patterns globally. At this rate, we will increasingly experience serious disruptions through floods, droughts, storms, bushfires, acidification and rising sea levels. Additionally, we will be impacted indirectly through interruptions to the provision of food, water and energy, and economically through the effect on trade, migration and geopolitics.</p>
<p>Climate change is already costing US$1.2trillion<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> a year, with 5 million deaths each year related to weather impacts and a carbon-intensive economy. Without strong action, the costs could be equivalent to at least 5% of GDP each year globally or up to 20% of GDP regionally<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Savings earmarked for retirement could be significantly affected by this trend, because businesses rely on strong economic growth and stable human capital. The current valuations of companies which rely heavily on policy support for their high energy consumption models are likely to be adversely affected, potentially limiting returns for investors. This means that climate change can pose a financial risk to future returns on our savings, and also raises questions about the kind of world we will want to retire in.</p>
<h3 id=""finding-a-solution"">Finding a solution</h3>
<p>The global temperature rise has already reached 1°C above pre-industrial levels. Scientists overwhelmingly agree that we need to limit global warming to 2°C or below in order to avoid severe consequences. Yet, 2015 was the warmest year on record.</p>
<p>In December 2015, 195 governments agreed in Paris to limit the temperature rise to well below 2°C. Despite this, many businesses are still basing their scenarios on a trajectory of 3°C to nearly 4°C, stating that we have no choice as energy demand is predicted to rise alongside population growth.</p>
<p>This is not a new story in our history. New and alternative technologies have always threatened incumbents who have too much to lose. For example, Kodak failed to embrace the powerful force of digitalisation in photography.</p>
<p>The market went from almost all film-based cameras to digital combined with phones cameras in 20 years. A ‘Kodak moment’ may sound still like picturing a precious moment, but it is a name now synonymous with myopic corporate vision and lack of adaptability.</p>
<p>How will energy be provided in the future? No one can predict with accuracy. But we know that a world with too much greenhouse gas is not the one we want. And continuing to finance the capital expenditure and research and development of companies whose assumptions are far from the Paris agreement will increasingly come under the spotlight.</p>
<h3 id=""your-money-your-emissions"">Your money, your emissions</h3>
<p>Everyone who has personal investments and pensions is likely to be invested in big companies which contribute significantly to global warming. As such, we all have a stake in their long-term success in order to fund our retirement.</p>
<p>Some companies make a much larger contribution to global warming than others, such as utilities whose businesses generate energy from burning coal and gas. Automobile companies which manufacture cars and other vehicles running on oil also contribute a large portion of global emissions. Extractive companies that provide the sources of such fossil fuels could also play a key role in curbing emissions globally. The chart below shows the sources of greenhouse gas emissions by economic sector.</p>
<p>Away from those direct contributors to emissions, sectors such as agriculture play an indirect role. The ever-growing demand for food globally is currently being met by inefficient agriculture practices and a large amount of food waste. These practices not only produce large amounts of carbon emissions, but they are also the biggest threat to forestry. Forests, which work as the lungs of the planet, turn carbon dioxide into oxygen as well as providing a vital ecosystem that controls the weather and water cycles. Companies in food retail and distribution are important factors in this chain who can help address this issue.</p>
<p>All companies, whether they emit carbon or not, need financing. They require banks, pension funds and insurance companies to buy their shares and debt. How they invest or allocate capital holds the key to financing a 2°C world rather than a 3-4°C world, because what gets financed today is the world we will build for the future.</p>
<h3 id=""making-your-money-do-the-talking"">Making your money do the talking</h3>
<p>Climate change is a financial issue. It is about companies succeeding in the future by setting forward-looking strategies, being efficient and financing the business models that are fit for the future. As investors in those companies, we have an interest in enhancing their value over time.</p>
<p>There are broadly two simple steps that can let our money do the talking. The first is for investors to find out what their funds invest in, assess their exposure to carbon, and review alternative options. LGIM has developed the Future World Fund for clients who want the potential for better risk-adjusted returns, while also protecting against the long-term risk of climate change.</p>
<p>The second step is for asset managers to talk to companies to assess their long-term strategies and ensure they are resilient to the forthcoming challenges of climate change. At LGIM, we are not just talking to them, but acting on it.</p>
<h3 id=""the-lgim-climate-impact-pledge"">The LGIM climate impact pledge</h3>
<p>We have made a commitment to address climate change by engaging directly with the largest companies in the world who hold the key to meeting the 2°C Paris target. The companies will be assessed rigorously for the robustness of their strategies, governance and transparency. Companies that fail to meet our minimum standards will be removed from our Future Fund range at LGIM. In the other funds where we cannot contractually divest, we will vote against the chair of those same companies. The Pledge is initially focused on the largest companies in the following sectors; oil and gas, metals and mining, electric utilities, automobiles, banks and insurance and food retail and distribution.</p>
<p>We rank all companies based on these criteria, and engage directly with them to improve their ranking. Those companies which fail to meet our minimum threshold will be excluded from the Future Funds. In all other funds where we cannot divest, we will vote against their chair of the board.</p>
<p>We believe this combined approach of ranking, publicising, voting and divestment can send a powerful message to all companies that their investors are serious about tackling climate change. Over time, the intention is to improve the standards and practices in these companies to make them more resilient to policy changes, more successful in providing consumers with low-carbon solutions and, ultimately, more prosperous as companies. We believe this targeted engagement can lead these key industries to be more prepared for the challenges of the future. In turn, our clients who hold stakes in these companies should benefit from their financial success in the long term.</p>
<p>Sending one coherent voice to companies and providing real consequences for inadequate standards is what we need to do on behalf of clients. Companies should benefit from the low-carbon transition, rather than being hampered by it. We are here to support this transition because we believe it makes financial sense.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There are certainly a number of overtly unethical practices that fall within the scope of finance and treasury, including bribery, money laundering, lack of accounting competence and transparency and high-risk investment strategies. These should all be regulated by internal corporate guidelines and codes of conduct, with fines and criminal charges as the ultimate enforcement for violations.</p>
<p>Some more subtle unethical behaviours that generally garner less media attention revolve around supply chain policies and payments. Late payment of invoices to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a huge issue globally, contributing to the liquidity crisis currently facing many SMEs. It has a significant impact on the ability of small businesses to grow and is considered to be a major factor holding back the global economy.</p>
<p>A recent Bloomberg Business article reported that China’s unpaid invoices or late payments currently total $590bn. According to authors Ye Xie and Fox Hu: “The raft of unpaid bills…shows how cash shortages at the weakest firms threaten not only banks and bondholders, but also China’s vast web of interconnected supply chains.”</p>
<p>It takes an average of 83 days for the typical Chinese firm to collect on completed sales, and the average days sales outstanding for SMEs across Asia Pacific continues to increase year over year.</p>
<p>Also, there is the uncertainty of when the payment will come. If a buyer is consistently late in paying, the supplier may plan ahead, but the volatility becomes the crucial issue for cash flow.</p>
<p>When companies pay late, pay erratically or extend payment terms beyond what their suppliers can afford, the end result is that the SMEs risk being unable to fund the working capital they need to grow, or just to survive. In these situations, suppliers often have limited options to access adequate funds for working capital. Broadly speaking, they can either take on debt or monetise invoices before they are due to be paid.</p>


<blockquote>Late payment of invoices to SMEs is a huge issue globally, contributing to the liquidity crisis currently facing many SMEs.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Traditionally, banks have been the primary source of working capital funding for SMEs, either via loans or overdrafts. While this is still an option, lending to SMEs has declined since the start of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Treasury’s role in improving company ethics can be demonstrated via programmes designed to support the SMEs that make up their supply chain. One model that offers early payment to SMEs is dynamic discounting, which allows a buyer and supplier to establish new payment terms, with the discount amount being calculated ‘dynamically’ based on the number of days left until an invoice is due.</p>
<p>C2FO, for example, has created the first market for working capital, allowing buyers and suppliers to collaborate to discover the unique price for early payment that’s profitable for both.</p>
<p>When treasury actively solves the issue of late payments with a supplier-friendly solution, all businesses become more profitable as a result of fairly priced liquidity flowing down the tiers of the supply chain. The end result is increased trust between buyers and suppliers, reduced supply chain risk and an improved corporate reputation – all of which is thoroughly ethical.</p>

<p>The Volkswagen emissions scandal sparked a 70% fall in earnings per share, Brazil’s Samarco Dam Disaster has resulted in $5bn payment of damages and #BoycottBlackFriday helped reduce retail sales by 11% at a crucial time of year for the sector. These very recent revelations of unethical behaviour are in the spotlight, and have a very serious risk to the treasury function of a business – one which isn’t so well-addressed. Unexpected fines, investors pulling out and opportunity costs from customer policies can have a big impact on the bottom line and, ultimately, on business longevity.</p>
<p>Consider this example of the intersection between ethics and treasury departments: a mining company operating in Asia will save money and meet regulatory requirements by using local suppliers in their projects. However, the company’s payment terms can conflict with the suppliers’ capacity to deliver projects and cutting out cost-competitive local options.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the ethics employed by any organisation is the responsibility of everyone involved, but there are numerous ways in which treasury departments can make significant contributions, namely, by creating the right culture, engaging on ethical issues and reporting on performance.</p>
<p>The focus should be on a transparent approach when it comes to ethical matters particularly with internal decision-makers, and stakeholders such as investors. Obviously, there are some issues around competitiveness that will prevent complete transparency – but the more open conversations had around ethical issues enable treasury to view the biggest risks to the department.</p>


<blockquote>The focus should be on a transparent approach when it comes to ethical matters particularly with internal decision-makers, and stakeholders such as investors.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The second bit of advice is concerning engagement. Each business is different and corporates need to engage stakeholders to be able to understand both which environmental, social and governance issues are most relevant to their businesses’ success, and how best to assist different aspects of business units. Clear communication lines with internal decision makers, and also with those outside of the business with whom treasury frequently work, is key in ensuring this engagement is as efficient and effective as possible. Certainly, in our own research undertaken in preparation for The Responsible Business Summit Asia, we found that most business professionals in the Asia Pacific region are primarily concerned about stakeholder engagement, supplier collaboration and ethical business strategies.</p>
<p>You also cannot manage that which is not measured. Once treasury have an idea of the key ethical issues for the company, realistic KPIs need to be set in order to mitigate these risks, and then report upon progress and findings. It is similarly important to set up a monitoring mechanism to highlight risks before they gain momentum. Financial and non-financial reporting is becoming more integrated and most exchanges require non-financial reporting, so it is important to contribute to this data collection where possible.</p>
<p>Finally, whilst there’s a lot of focus on the negative aspects of unethical business practice, it is important for treasury departments to spend a little time in considering the positives that ethical business can have on the bottom line. As a supplier, responsible business practices are an important differentiator when winning contracts. What’s more, responsible business is a core value for the majority of millennials who as mega trends suggest will be your future customers and employees – it’s important to make them choose your business.</p>

<p>In a circular economy, products and materials flow in loops, maximising asset utilisation and minimising waste by design. It avoids the economic losses along the value chain and negative externalities inherent to the traditional linear model of production and consumption. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, SUN and McKinsey have identified that by adopting circular economy principles, Europe can create a net economic benefit in 2030 of €1.8trn compared to today, double that offered by the current linear development path<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>. The circular economy can simultaneously create opportunities for growth and jobs, stimulate industrial renewal and innovation, and reduce environmental pressures.</p>
<p>For companies to capitalise on this opportunity, business models as well as collaboration across the supply chain need to be reconsidered. The following two examples of circular economy business models being used on the ground are illustrative. One hundred La Place restaurants in the Netherlands provide 2.5t a week of waste coffee grounds to GRO-Holland, a company that uses them as a growth substrate for oyster mushrooms. The mushrooms are then sold back to the same restaurants to be used as ingredients. The supply chain is therefore made symbiotic or ‘circular’ by turning one player’s by-products into feedstock for the other.</p>
<p>As an example of pay-per-use, in addition to selling lightbulbs, Philips now also signs contracts to provide light, by the lux. The company keeps ownership of the lighting system, taking care of maintenance and remanufacture during the contract. Such a model can be both more profitable than traditional products sales for the manufacturer and cheaper for the user. It also promotes increased customer interactions – and potentially loyalty.</p>
<p>How do these business models affect companies’ (and customers’) working capital and financing needs? In the symbiotic ‘circular supply chain’ model there is a potential reduction in non-payment risk. Players become both buyers and suppliers and so possess a more equal balance of economic power, likely formalised by contracts that incentivise the continuation rather than termination of the relationship. Can such a risk reduction be measured and priced? Could cash handling costs be reduced, and more liquidity unlocked, by using closer bonds in the supply chain to net off more transactions and to extend supply chain finance to earlier in the purchase process?</p>
<p>The pay-per-use model increases working capital requirements by extending the time, potentially by years, before which production costs are recovered. It increases credit risk towards customers, but reduces risk from volatile raw materials prices by extending the useful life of the asset. Can assets on the now-extended balance sheet be valued by component rather than by product to allow depreciation to depend on each’s remanufacturing cycle? Can a leasing model share between the user, producer and financier the higher underlying value created by reduced future production costs?</p>
<p>These questions are part of a fundamental re-think of how companies create value and the potentially profound impact on their cash flow and financing: what is at stake is a transformation of the core business strategy, not a mere CSR plug-in.</p>
<p>Finance in a circular economy is a young field. More such innovative financial thinking is needed. How do treasury professionals see the potential for cash and risk management in their own institutions changing to take account of circular economy business models? What are the more radical ideas for new instruments to enable these models? The answers will help shape the financial landscape of the future.</p>

<p>With the former CEO of eBay, Meg Whitman, at the head, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is introducing technology that helps companies grow faster, but also allows them to be more sustainable – by playing a part in circular supply chains, for instance. The cloud solutions offered by HPE remove the need for data centres in every office building, saving on hardware and energy costs. The focus is on sustainably meeting the data needs of the future through energy efficient and innovative server technology.</p>
<p>For example, the company is the first in the industry to offer a ‘composable infrastructure’ to be able to respond faster to IT needs with software managing the hardware and when the job is done, the hardware is packed up again. IT infrastructure can be configured for a specific workload within seconds and then reconfigured as quickly for a different workload. This removes the need to run idle servers which are doing nothing, waiting until more capacity is needed. HPE provides this technology as a service, limiting the investments on the part of the corporate who do not need to take full ownership of the products. This is a new circular dynamic in a traditionally asset-based economy. One that may prove to be more efficient for businesses and less impactful on the environment.</p>
<p>Where HPE is putting hardware on the market, it offers customers the opportunity to take back the used equipment and recycle it or – even better – reuse it by operating an asset recovery service and a lease programme. Of the servers that are coming back to HPE, 77% is being refurbished and resold and 88% goes back on the market after end of lease. It also allows customers to demo equipment for an average of three to four months, before deciding to either keep or return it; when returned, the equipment is prepared for reuse and circled back on to the market with the same guarantees as a new product. By not discarding them as waste, but considering them a valued inventory and a business opportunity in itself, the lease programme contributes to an increasingly popular circular economy.</p>
<p>These developments will continue, as customer demand will change. IT companies will need to adjust fast to an economy of ideas where speed and agility is needed and new business models, circular in nature, are given an opportunity to prosper.</p>

<p>Supply chains can be more or less compliant with the principles of the circular economy, because we are in a transition towards a circular economy. The reasons urging for a shift to a circular economy are both environmental and business related. From the environmental perspective, the importance of reducing pollution and the consumption of natural resources is widely acknowledged, and it is a priority on the agenda of policy makers.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, innovative business models based on services rather than product ownership and innovative consumption patterns – such as the sharing economy – are gaining an increasing importance. Moreover, current trends suggest there will be rising prices and an increasing competition for raw materials. The circular economy represents an answer to these challenges and an opportunity to find synergies between the protection of the environment and the growth of profit.</p>
<p>In terms of impacting the financial supply chain, first of all, a circular physical supply chain implies opportunities in terms of profits and reduction of the costs. For instance, remanufacturing could imply savings in terms of production costs that range from 30% to 90% of the cost of producing a new unit product from virgin materials. At the same time, in a truly circular supply chain, new mechanisms for value sharing among the supply chain partners are necessary.</p>

<p>The Ellen MacArthur Foundation provides some very good examples of companies that are effectively managing the shift to a circular economy. These include Rype Office, that is exploiting a completely new business model for office furniture aligned with the principles of the circular economy, and Mud Jeans, that uses the principles in the different and challenging context of clothes. These are only two of several possible examples. In general, the transition to a circular economy is ongoing, and there is good evidence of successful businesses implementing the circular economy principles.</p>
<p>But if corporates want to truly exploit the potential of the circular economy, they should think in terms of systems and embed the principles of the circular economy at the strategic level of business model innovation. They cannot implement the circular economy principles by simply trying to make a production process green, or a closed loop supply chain more efficient. These principles should be embedded at the very early stages of product design, supply chain design, and definition of the commercial strategy.</p>

<p><em>There’s little doubt that efforts to engage in sustainable and responsible business are in the spotlight more than ever before; Volkswagen’s share prices plummeting amidst last year’s emissions scandal, the public reaction to Amazon’s treatment of employees and the outrage that China burns much more coal than it claims – the list could go on. But what do corporate treasurers need to know and what can they do to ensure their business makes a positive impact on the world without having a negative impact on profits?</em></p>
<p>When China’s President, Xi Jinping, visited the UK late last year – the first state visit from a Chinese president since 2005 – it marked an important moment between the two countries. The trip, however, was somewhat tainted by China’s poor history with human rights; numerous reports narrowed in on the fact that the country’s record has been distant from international standards until recently. The Telegraph questioned whether Jinping deserved the UK’s “red carpet” treatment, for instance. The general air of malaise was one indication, amongst many, of a mind-set that is focused on a responsible future more than ever before.</p>
<p>And it isn’t only the treatment of people that is receiving precedence; engaging in business that has a positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) impact has been in the spotlight for some time. “The train has truly left the station,” says Gavin Power, Deputy Executive Director for the UN Global Compact, a key sustainability initiative. “Sustainability is a global agenda here to stay.”</p>
<p>Since it is sometimes disregarded as a buzzword in the corporate arena, it is apt to provide a definition of sustainability. The UN Global Compact felt the need to put a stake in the ground and defined sustainability as the delivery of long-term value towards environmental, economic, social and ethical concerns. There remain some obvious hurdles, including the disparity in what embracing sustainability means for different businesses and the sceptics who believe that, in current economic circumstances, sustainability is unaffordable. But momentum is gaining ground.</p>
<h3 id=""what-do-companies-owe-society"">What do companies owe society?</h3>
<p>Bill Gates, however, probably wasn’t alone in his belief when he claimed last year that the private sector is too selfish to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. “There’s no fortune to be made,” he told The Atlantic. For many, it isn’t unreasonable to question the extent to which sustainability is an obligation for business – their allegiance, after all, is primarily to growth and profit generation. Axel Boye-Moller Head of Global Transactional Services, Asia, at Westpac, clarifies that this is an issue to overcome. “A sustainable approach to doing business makes sense for all stakeholders, including shareholders, and there are significant opportunities for businesses that get this right. However, in the short term, there are challenges. For example, producing sustainable agricultural commodities can be more expensive in the short term. There is a lot of discussion around who is going to wear that cost and how it will play out – however it is important to maintain focus on longer-term value, in line with shifting expectations.”</p>
<p>But, Power argues, there is a fiduciary duty to answer these questions. “For large companies and investors, there is a legal responsibility to ensure their organisations are managing critical sustainability issues.” Why? “Because they are risk issues.” According to a recent report from the UN Global Compact, ‘Fiduciary Duty in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century’, in addition to the ethic argument of meeting the needs of today without compromising future generations’ ability to do the same, there is a legal case for sustainability.</p>
<p>In terms of investment, ESG factors are certainly viewed as risk factors. Loic Dujardin, Director, Research at Sustainalytics, a leading global provider of ESG and corporate governance research, ratings and analytics, explains that the research they conduct enables investors to identify ESG risks that could have an impact on the bottom line of companies. “A typical example would be investigating the potential water scarcity for a mining or power generation company. Without water, they are not going to be able to operate the mines or power generation plants.” The risk management performance of companies, he says, is something asset managers and asset owners, who have a long-term investment perspective, should pay attention to. In the words of Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the G20’s Financial Stability Board: “The more we invest with foresight; the less we will regret in hindsight.” At the end of the day, ESG factors – such as climate change – are systemic risks to the economy, says Dujardin. “And for investors in Europe and North America, integrating ESG factors into investment decisions has become mainstream.”</p>
<p>In Asia, the story is slightly different. Although the sustainability landscape is rapidly changing, it is still a relatively new idea in the region. Broader recognition means unlocking the corporate leverage necessary to accelerate sustainable progress. This requires a new business mind-set – one which, according to Power, necessitates “an imperative on culture change top to bottom”. This includes the sustainability of a company’s own operations; the sustainability of its products and supply chain; and the encouragement of sustainability within the end customers’ lifestyles, and of all key business partners – suppliers or banks, for instance. It is about building resilience within company operations, as well as in the communities in which they operate. “At the very heart of that, it is about winning the hearts and minds of customers,” adds Boye-Moller.</p>
<p>If further motivation is needed, however, Sustainalytics offer a benchmarking service for corporates “so within a specific industry, a company can find out how they perform compared to peers”, says Dujardin.</p>
<p>Times are changing, however: the options available to corporates, the economic drivers encouraging sustainable business and actions many country leaders are taking towards this topic are on the rise. “Five or ten years ago, non-business organisations and spheres of influence were unclear about the best modes of engagement with the business community. Fast-forwarding to now, we are at an inflection point in the sustainability movement; multilateral organisations, governments, civil society, investors and corporates are aligning in some exciting ways,” says Power. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for instance are one example of this increasing alignment.</p>




<h3 id=""circular-supply-chains"">Circular supply chains</h3>
<p>A change from engrained business models, advocates of the circular economy argue that products should be designed to maintain their quality and continue to be useful to the economy beyond their typical shelf life. “In a circular economy, products and materials flow in loops, maximising asset utilisation and minimising waste by design. It avoids the economic losses along the value chain and negative externalities inherent to the traditional linear model of production and consumption,” say Jocelyn Blériot, Executive Officer and Ian Banks, Editor, both from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity with a mission to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. Working with businesses, governments and academia, the Foundation seeks to set out the economic opportunities provided by the restorative and regenerative activities needed in such an economy.</p>
<p>Blériot and Banks provide the following two examples of circular economy business models being used on the ground. One hundered La Place restaurants in the Netherlands provide 2.5 tonnes a week of waste coffee grounds to GRO-Holland, a company that uses them as a growth substrate for oyster mushrooms. The mushrooms are then sold back to the same restaurants to be used as ingredients. The supply chain is therefore made circular by turning one player’s by-products into feedstock for the other.</p>
<p>As an example of a pay-per-use business model, in addition to selling lightbulbs, Philips now also signs contracts to provide light, by the lux. The company keeps ownership of the lighting system, taking care of maintenance and remanufacture during the contract. Such a model can be both more profitable than traditional products sales for the manufacturer and cheaper for the user. It also promotes increased customer interactions – and, potentially, increased customer loyalty.</p>

<h3 id=""the-tide-is-turning"">The tide is turning</h3>
<p>For corporates, despite slow economic growth and lingering volatility, investing in sustainable business practices is becoming an attractive prospect – one that can add value, people are beginning to realise, rather than adding just another cost to the business. Companies are reporting substantial savings as a result of their efforts to reduce energy use and waste, for instance. “It makes business sense to embrace sustainability,” says Catherine Bremner, Global Head of Sustainable Finance Solutions, ANZ. “Yes, there are challenges in terms of the change, innovation and technology necessary but there are massive opportunities for businesses.” Her colleague at ANZ, Christina Tonkin, Managing Director – Global Loans &amp; Advisory, adds: “Corporates want to be operating for the long term and those that boast robust processes around their impact on the environment and society are the ones that will be in for the long haul. It is as simple as that.”</p>
<p>For example, businesses are demonstrating compassion for current environmental concerns. In October last year, 38 firms in Singapore pledged that their products were free of raw materials from companies being investigated for forest fires in Indonesia – an environmental disaster caused by forest clearance known as ‘slash and burn’, where land is set on fire as a cheap way of clearing it for new planting. The cost of this activity as of November 2015 was estimated – by the Indonesia government – at $47bn worth of financial damage to the region’s economy, illustrating the damage not only to the environment, but companies who are reliant on its health.</p>
<p>Corporates in Singapore aren’t the only ones adopting environmentally considerate initiatives. More of the success stories include: L’Oréal announcing its plan to become “free from deforestation” in the production of all its products by 2020 at the latest and Unilever supporting the most progressive suppliers which can guarantee key criteria, including compliance with the laws in the country on cultivation; informed consent from indigenous people and local communities; conservation and restoration of forests; and a pledge not to clear peat for new plantations.</p>
<p>Banks too are leading the charge against unsustainable primary goods. Westpac, for instance, recently launched a sustainable shipment letter of credit (LC) as part of the Banking Environmental Initiative to transform supply chain practices. By doing so, corporates can access commodities with a recognised stamp of approval to certify that they are produced sustainably. “We are now working with The Banking Environment Initiative to expand similar principles into more commodities and other trade finance instruments,” says Siobhan Toohill, Group Head of Sustainability and Community, Westpac.</p>
<p>As the range of sustainable financial products on offer expands, companies seeking out, or actively demanding, such solutions are leading ‘the new norm’. And the number of corporates taking sustainability matters into their own hands and looking for support is on the rise too, according to Power. The UN Global Compact is joined voluntarily, to publically commit to a universal language on corporate responsibility with the provision of learning materials and ongoing support. “We’ve passed a really important hurdle globally,” says Power. “When the Global Compact started in 2000, we had to coax companies to join but it’s now aligned with societal trends – graduates, for instance, look to join working environments which actively engage in the subject – and the membership of several large companies has encouraged others to join.” The initiative now has 8,000 companies and 4,000 non-business participants based in over 160 countries committed. Joining primarily involves company alignment with The Ten Principles, focused on human rights, labour, environmental and anti-corruption priorities.</p>
<p>Although it is a leadership agenda, the principles need to be cascaded throughout the organisation. Companies are provided entry level management resources to ensure they meet the expectations of how to implement the principles. The Global Compact also continually challenges companies to do more and produced a blueprint as a high-level aspirational model a few years ago. As Power says: “Sustainability needs to be a progressive agenda.”</p>
<p>Commitment also includes the mandatory requirement for corporates to submit Communication on Progress (COP) reports annually. Not only does this afford transparency, the UN now boasts the largest repository of these public sustainability reports. They can serve as learning resources, but have also generated numerous partnerships for companies who perhaps had never thought about sharing and inviting other partners. “I get calls and enquires from NGOs and UN agencies who, after reading reports, want to work with some of the companies on projects that they had heard about for the first time in a COP,” says Power. The Global Compact also has an interactive Business Action Hub to encourage similar engagement.</p>
<h3 id=""the-banks-role-in-championing-change"">The banks’ role in championing change</h3>
<p>Banks, of course, play a huge part in ensuring sustainable business practices come to the fore. “Five years ago, the first things banks thought of were immediate footprint actions – such as conserving electricity or reducing paper use – which are important but don’t get to financial institutions (FIs) central role in the global economy, finance,” says Power. More recently, banks in Asia Pacific (APAC) have been taking some impressive steps, however.</p>
<p>Westpac received recognition as the industry leader for banks in the 2015 Dow Jones Sustainability Index. “Sustainability is fundamental for the bank, it is embedded into all processes – our lending criteria for clients, for instance,” says Toohill. “We look at sustainability at a country and sector level, at a customer level and at a transactional level.” If a client’s sustainability policies aren’t up to scratch, banks will work with them to create alignment. When it comes to sensitive sectors, such as agribusiness, because there are a range of potential environmental and social impacts, specific mission statements and strategies exist.</p>
<p>In terms of guidelines on an individual transactional level – project financing, for instance – both ANZ and Westpac are signatories of the Equator Principles which sets a framework on risk management for projects. Banks often also commission separate research as part of that assessment. Trade finance, on the other hand, is short tenor and there may be transactions that need a decision intra-day “so we’ve got tools, frameworks and checklists in place to assess risks at that level quickly”, says Toohill.</p>
<p>In recognition that sustainability should be progressive agenda, banks keep their offerings up-to-date. “We need to have the finance available for corporates so they can grow their businesses in a sustainable way,” says ANZ’s Bremner. For instance, originally in Australia a lot of focus was on renewable energy, mainly wind power, but the bank is seeing mounting interest in rooftop solar. “Therefore, finance solutions are tailored in a way to suit individual client needs.” One of the largest targets of its type to date, an AUD 10bn commitment to support customers’ transition to a low carbon economy by 2020, will help meet this developing need.</p>
<p>Additionally, when Westpac exceeded its goal of AUD 6bn of funding for the CleanTech and renewable energy sector by 2017, it set a whole new benchmark in terms of what classifies as sustainable and warrants the allocation of funds, rather than resetting a new end objective. For example, a higher threshold for green buildings within the portfolio. “All of these movements are of interest to corporates across Asia,” says Boye-Moller. “I recently participated in a seminar in China, organised by The Banking Environment Initiative, alongside other banks, regulators, academics and some of the largest Chinese commodities importers. They were incredibly interested in what the banking sector is doing in the sustainability space.”</p>
<p>Indeed, according to Tonkin, “there are few institutions that will touch customers’ right across the globe and across all different sectors in the way FIs do. I welcome the increasing involvement of FIs into the sustainable finance space as the pivotal role banks play will benefit corporates and society going forward.” Providing their experience, driving advocacy through the standards set in lending practices and underlying policies, banks can raise the bar. For the treasurer, it is about selecting banking partners that can support their company’s transition to sustainability. The product suite, funding and attitude towards supporting ongoing sustainability are of consideration. Watch out however, as Power believes some are behind the times in terms of ESG concerns.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-the-lead"">Taking the lead</h3>
<p>In the near future, ANZ’s Tonkin and Bremner believe there will be an increased interest in company resilience – whether existing infrastructure is up to the task of withstanding increasingly severe weather, for instance. “Part of the challenge will be funding over the long-term,” she says. When US President Barack Obama delivered a call to action to some of the world’s biggest companies at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila in November last year, he raised the issue that “few regions have more at stake in meeting this challenge” than APAC. Aptly, as Tonkin says: “We are seeing sustainability embraced more as part of the DNA of business. It’s part of the conversation on a daily basis, elevated in the thinking of corporates across APAC beyond what was once a fringe subject.”</p>
<p>Investment opportunities, as well as funding opportunities, are on the rise. “We see good momentum in three markets predominantly: Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong,” says Dujardin. “Drivers include reforms and initiatives from regulators, governments, banks and other financial intermediaries. Investors too are concerned about the disruptive effects climate change could have on the stability of their portfolios.” Therefore, it is in the best interest of all that businesses align with climate and societal objectives. This could mean capital reallocation strategies for investors or for treasurers, investing capital in projects that will deliver sustainable returns, ensuring they are resilient to shocks that may come, and avoiding feeding into negative concerns through careful selection of business partners.</p>
<p>The risk of ignoring ESG priorities is becoming clear for the corporate world and, as a result, action is occurring – in supply chain management, for instance (see box opposite). But there remain aspects somewhat out of a treasurer’s control. More than anything, though, as Boye-Moller says: “In Asia Pacific, we need to get to a point, as you see in many more developed markets, where you have a large groundswell of consumer sentiment. People who are demanding, and are prepared to pay more for products that are produced sustainably.

<p>Leonie Schreve, Global Head of Sustainable Finance, ING, is responsible for driving, promoting and generating sustainable business opportunities for ING. While initially focused on lending, the mandate has been expanded to all commercial banking areas. Before joining the commercial side of the bank, Leonie headed the Environmental Social Risk Management team and introduced the new topic of sustainability risk management. Leonie represents ING in the board of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP FI Banking Commission) and has acted as Chair of the Equator Principles Steering Committee until 2013. Leonie has more than 15 years experience in sustainability though her work as Management Consultant in which she worked with various multinationals, as independent consultant in Costa Rica, and through setting up the ESR and Sustainable Finance team within ING. Leonie holds a Master in Environmental Science, Business Ethics and International Sports Management.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The world around us is in a constant state of flux and today, sustainable practice really does matter. The extent to which companies take seriously their commitment to conduct responsible business is in the spotlight like never before – as Volkswagen’s executives will attest. Companies that fail to adopt a more environmentally friendly and socially responsible mind-set now do so at their own (often financial) peril.</p>
<p>Stripping out any moral or ethical imperative, it is now widely acknowledged that embracing sustainable business practices can be financially prudent for companies. While once the debate around sustainability initiatives centred on the question of affordability, now more and more businesses are questioning how and in which ways such practices can add value.</p>
<p>“There is now evidence which shows that clients who are leading in sustainability measures are more innovative, show better financial performance and have better credit ratings,” notes Leonie Schreve, Global Head of Sustainable Finance at ING. Sustainability, it seems, can be a source of competitive advantage. What’s more, according to Schreve, those companies that take sustainability seriously and demonstrate an ability to “adapt, anticipate and transition to new business models”, are likely to be the most successful in the future.</p>
<p>Fine words indeed, but in anticipation of tomorrow’s economy – in no small way led by the increasing scarcity of natural resources – ING has a genuine commitment to practical sustainability. “We partner with those clients we can support in taking a step ahead and anticipating the future economy,” states Schreve. This is not a concept working in isolation as a kind of PR exercise; ING does not set aside a specific sustainability portfolio to tick a few boxes. As Schreve explains: “Sustainable opportunities are integrated into all of our sectors and all of our client segments.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-path-to-sustainable-thinking"">The path to sustainable thinking</h3>
<p>Sustainability at ING has its initial focus on lending; the bank even increased its lending volume for clients engaged in sustainable projects in the first half of 2015 (a portfolio that is now heading towards €21bn). But it quickly recognised that to be effective, sustainability must be embedded in all areas of commercial banking. ING’s target is to grow its financing of sustainable transitions (affording social change to sustainable patterns of production and consumption) and to increase sustainable assets under management (AUM); it believes that the concept should be a mainstream priority geared to effective change of the way we all live. Embracing this way of thinking is something from which non-financial corporates can benefit and what’s more, their treasurers can have a key role to play in adopting and adapting to sustainable practices.</p>
<h3 id=""with-a-little-help-from-friends"">With a little help from friends</h3>
<p>It is a fact that most treasurers will know and understand their business better than any consultant, bank or external advisor. They will therefore already have the fundamental tools in place that will show sustainability will work for their business. “However, it is not until you actually start working on the topic, that you appreciate all the complexities,” Schreve notes. This is where collaboration with key business partners – especially those with a firm commitment to sustainability – can help to piece together the puzzle.</p>
<p>Having developed a unique toolkit to enable its account managers to analyse a company’s sustainability performance, ING is well placed to help clients along the way. Its analysis of existing methods and models provides the starting point for a ‘personalised’ discussion between bank and client, taking into consideration the client’s industry sector and specific circumstances. Once the mapping of sustainability is complete the bank can help in the development areas that may need financing, for instance. “The aim is to encourage a discussion on how we can support our clients in their transition towards sustainability,” explains Schreve.</p>
<p>The bank takes its responsibility seriously and has an on-boarding process to identify those clients which are already proactive on sustainability initiatives and which will most benefit from its guidance. Sustainability will mean different things to different people and it is extremely beneficial for all if ING is able to get to the table early and have a more strategic discussion around how sustainability can be made to work for a specific company, based on a factual discovery rather than a lecture. As Schreve notes: “Once we have ascertained which part of the portfolio is ‘sustainably-marked’ internally, we can be better positioned to have proactive discussions with clients on what their challenges are and how best we can support them.” The consultative approach seems to be paying off. “We are seeing more and more corporates approaching us, asking what we have to offer companies that are taking sustainability as seriously as we are. On this basis alone, we can establish a more strategic partnership,” says Schreve, adding that “together, we can anticipate tomorrow’s economy”.</p>
<h3 id=""cost-of-caring"">Cost of caring</h3>
<p>What the on-boarding process means in practice is that ING will take an initial environmental and social risk (ESR) view of where their client is on the spectrum of international environmental, social and human right standards. This ensures that all clients in the ING portfolio are compliant with international standards. But on top of the ESR screening ING identify clients that are leading in sustainability. By mid 2015, clients spanning sectors such as energy, real estate and transport, and which met ING’s Sustainable Transitions Finance criteria, benefitted from €21bn in loans.</p>
<p>This is all about partnership through which value can be created, says Schreve. ING entered into partnership with Corporate Facility Partners (CFP) for Real Estate clients in the Netherlands. For example, clients can access a platform onto which they can upload their entire building portfolio. The tool measures the whole portfolio, identifying where certain measures can be taken to optimise energy efficiency and sustainability. This delivers an immediate correlation between a company’s sustainability performance and the financial implications this has. Initially, it highlights the measures that can be taken from a sustainability perspective. It will then translate these actions into actual cost and pay-back time.</p>
<p>Schreve notes that initial investment costs of sustainable measures can be higher, but this will balance out when efficiency gain are made. Of course, this needs to be factored into cash forecasts and financial analysis for treasurers, but if the business knows the cost/income ratio and the environmental benefit, then related cost/benefit becomes much clearer.</p>
<p>Despite how it may seem, embracing sustainability does not have to involve revolutionary new concepts. Indeed, expertise in this field “is more directed at re-using and maintaining a high value of resources”, notes Schreve. For a business looking to adopt this model, this always starts in the design phase where they should create products that either have a longer life-span, or which can be easily recycled whilst maintaining the value of resources and their reusability.</p>
<p>However, new thinking is essential at both client and financier level. A bank such as ING can step in at an early stage to ensure a “circular business model” is financed appropriately, and that innovative solutions to address certain challenges can be created wherever needed. “For example, when companies step into a service business model, pay per use such as offering light as a service instead of selling light bulbs, and remain owner of the products delivered, financing would be structured around contracts rather than the collateral of the goods,” explains Schreve.</p>
<h3 id=""a-new-sustainable-world-order"">A new sustainable world order</h3>
<p>True sustainability cannot be achieved by companies working in isolation, strategic partnerships in the supply chain become more important. But also government measures can help in the regional context. As an archetype, ING has a separate entity – the Green Bank (Groenbank) – based in the Netherlands. “It is specifically designed around the regulations that the Dutch government have in place to stimulate the green economy,” notes Schreve. There are specific criteria and sectors identified that qualify for green agreements – and companies that fall into these areas can be provided finance at a discounted rate from ING’s Green Bank.</p>
<p>Although it is largely focused on Dutch regulation (only a small percentage of the portfolio can be used abroad), it highlights the appeal that stimulation measures and collaboration can have for corporates considering integrating sustainability into their business models.</p>
<p>Expansion of such measures at a European level would accelerate the drivers of sustainability, says Schreve. “But, on the other hand, based on our strong belief that sustainable business is better business, it is also the responsibility and role of financial institutions themselves to find ways to stimulate that further and shift their own portfolios towards sustainability.” And in this regard, there is a notable progression. Together with a number of banks, united in the Banking Commission of the United Nations Environmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), ING has launched a positive impact manifesto. This is a commitment from a number of member banks – and some investors – to unite, share knowledge and accelerate the banking world’s involvement in sectors and transitions that actively contribute to the sustainable development goals of the UN.</p>
<p>“From a commercial perspective, there are initiatives to further accelerate sustainable business,” says Schreve. Ultimately, the UNEP FI group expects a series of pilot projects to create a vibrant market place where needs, solutions and financing of sustainability can be matched effectively.</p>
<p>By putting the topic on the table, a new dimension to the relationship between business partners is already beginning to manifest itself. Schreve concludes: “Once you move beyond discussing the concept, start looking at figures and ratios and exploring how sustainability can be integrated into your business practices. From here, it becomes a much more strategic partnership – and one that can help future-proof your treasury.”</p>

The only way is ethics,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>As large corporations expand globally, their relationships with and sensitivities to the communities in which they operate may naturally deteriorate. Centralisation and outsourcing, for example, can distance the decision-makers from the operational activities of the company. Expansion does not excuse a business from its social responsibilities, but the drivers for discharging these responsibilities may not be as genuine as some companies would have you believe.</p>
<p>Genuine or not, the concept of ethical business practice is nothing new. In the UK, for example, the Quaker involvement in business in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries is well known: the four main chocolate companies of Cadbury, Fry, Rowntree and Terry are fine exponents of genuine corporate care (albeit with an overtly religious agenda).</p>
<p>According to Sir Adrian Cadbury, descendant of the Cadbury family, Quaker businesses not only respected the value of every individual worker (and made sure they were well looked after), but also had a code that insisted they maintain strict integrity in business transactions and in relations with individuals and organisations. It required its employees to be personally scrupulous and responsible in the use of money entrusted to them, and never defrauded public revenue.</p>
<p>Roll forward to 1932 and A.A. Berle and G.C. Means had just published ‘The Modern Corporation and Private Property’, in which they observed that the corporations of the day had grown so large as to have become “a means of organising economic life”. They argued that within such an expanse had formed “a corporate system – as there once was a feudal system – which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.” The authors thus asserted that corporate management “have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners but all society.”</p>
<h3 id=""whats-right-for-you"">What’s right for you</h3>
<p>Operating ‘for the greater good’ is often seen as laudable, but ‘good’ is notoriously difficult to define. But the often impenetrable semantic debates about what is ‘good’ or ‘right’ or ‘just’ can arguably be replaced (at least by tabloid newspapers) by the application of a common sense (if not intuitive) response to a given situation. But does ‘ethical’ really equate to ‘common sense’?</p>
<p>According to the ‘Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking Concepts and Tools’ by Dr. Richard Paul and Dr. Linda Elder (of the Foundation for Critical Thinking), “most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs and the law”. Instead, they argue, ethics is a standalone concept which can be defined as “a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behaviour helps or harms sentient creatures”. This still leaves the definition of those principles and their application to tackle which takes us back to square one.</p>
<p>Perhaps a vague notion of ‘doing right’ is as good as it gets. In a commercial context, the rise of corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes in the 1980s and 1990s looked like businesses had caught on that they were (and are) increasingly being judged not only on their ability to deliver goods and services but also the way in which they impact on society and the environment. CSR policies are not necessarily the same as engaging with ethical practices – the former can be an outcome of the latter, but not the other way round – but they have a role to play beyond mere PR trickery by at least opening the corporate mind to ethical practice.</p>
<p>CSR, as typically enshrined in company policy, expresses a desire to minimise destruction of the environment, maximise the preservation of resources for future generations (usually referred to as sustainability) and respect the well-being of staff, customers and other stakeholders and the communities in which they operate.</p>
<p>But balancing the aforementioned depersonalising effects of globalisation and the need to drive profitability – after all, there is no business, ethical or otherwise, without capital – against just criticism (and there are many who rail against all corporates) and a desire to do right is difficult. The pressure to come up with a solution is becoming increasingly urgent as a younger generation of professionals rises up through the ranks, ever-more aware, in a media-saturated world, of the errors of ‘ethical’ judgement made by some corporations.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to a survey carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in September 2008 (just as Lehman’s hit the wall), graduates place a high value on good corporate behaviour. The survey sought the views of new PwC graduate recruits around the world. The respondents cannot reliably be considered a proxy for all graduates but figures showed that 88% want an employer with social responsibility values that reflect their own and 86% said they would consider leaving an employer whose values no longer aligned.</p>
<h3 id=""the-age-of-reason"">The age of reason</h3>
<p>There is an interesting generational divide in the perception of and response to workplace ethics. US-based non-profit organisation, Ethics Resource Centre’s (ERC) 2013 study highlighted this gap, noting some of the difficulties corporates may face when trying to align organisational and personal values when the latter can be so much at variance. For the purposes of the exercise ERC divided age into the following segments: Traditionalists (64-84); Baby Boomers (45-63); Generation X (30-44); and Millennials or Generation Y (18-29).</p>
<p>On this basis, and through the lens of the current economic environment, it appears younger workers are more willing to close their eyes to corporate misconduct if they think it will help save jobs. There is a sliding scale inversely proportionate to age on this matter, with agreement from 35% of Millennials, 22% of Generation Xs, 17% of Baby Boomers and 12% of Traditionalists.</p>
<p>But the economic downturn will not last forever; companies for whom recruitment of the best young talent (graduate or otherwise) is a key facet of their strategic development would be well-advised to meet this group’s perceived ethical needs now, not least because the age scale tips in the opposite direction when it comes to the perception of an ethical culture and the level of engagement. Indeed, when employees feel they are working in an organisation where ethical conduct matters, they are more likely to be engaged in their job. ERC shows that the level of engagement lessens with age, with a sliding scale ranging from a maximum of 77% for Millennials, 76% of Generation Xs, 72% of Baby Boomers, down to 68% of Traditionalists.</p>
<p>In building an ethical programme that reaches and influences each generation it is essential to pay attention to these differences. ERC’s studies over the years reveal that the younger the worker, “the more social interaction with co-workers will influence their perception of ethical matters”. Conversely, the older the employee, “the more hierarchy, structure and visible company commitment matter” as they get their ethical cues from stated company values and senior management messages.</p>
<h3 id=""the-impact-on-profit"">The impact on profit</h3>
<p>If upholding moral integrity is seen as a direct route to profit limitation, the UK-based non-profit organisation, Business in the Community (BITC), has demonstrated otherwise. It has shown that companies’ actively managing and measuring CSR issues financially outperformed their peers by between 3.3% and 7.7% over a five-year period. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) also looked into the commercial viability of CSR and found that 74% of respondents to a 2008 survey said corporate citizenship “can help increase profits at their company”. When asked for their firm’s primary motivation for corporate citizenship, the top three answers all relate to the bottom line: revenue growth (16%), increasing profit (16%) and cost savings (13%). This is not perhaps the most ethical of reasons but if the policies have a genuine positive effect then ‘doing the right thing’ is clearly not a cost centre.</p>
<h3 id=""the-ethics-of-investing"">The ethics of investing</h3>
<p>Ethical investing has many devotees: in 2011, 12.2% of the $25.2 trillion in total assets under management tracked by Thomson Reuters were involved in what it described as ‘socially responsible investing’. But ethical investing is subjective. It depends entirely on the investor’s view of what is and is not ethical behaviour by a company. Typically, a positive stance is sought on areas such as energy, waste and pollution, natural resource conservation, the treatment of animals, workers’ rights, human rights, supplier and community relations and government interactions. But for some, so-called ‘sin stocks’ (such as pornography, tobacco, alcohol, weapons and gambling) may also be off-limits. In many cases the direct activities of a company may be obvious but its indirect connections may be less so. And just because a company does not fall under an easy ethical heading (such as a green energy business) does not mean it is unethical.</p>
<p>The financial instruments available are much the same as those available to all investors but true ethical investment adds another layer of research (and thus time and effort). Subjectivity aside, investment is typically in companies that aim to create positive change in the world (or at least have a neutral impact). If a business wishes to stand by an ethical investment policy it means looking far beyond company publicity material. The complexity of some funds also means direct or indirect ownership is uncertain, as indeed the Church of England recently found out when it was very publicly pointed out that it was unwittingly investing in the pay-day loan company, Wonga, and thus contravening its own ethical investment policy.</p>
<h3 id=""a-question-of-business"">A question of business</h3>
<p>In terms of everyday policy, most internal businesses decisions do not require soul-searching but where there is contention, according to Florida-based independent leadership consultant, Dr. Cathy Bush (Ph.D. in industrial and organisational psychology), some decisions that have ethical implications may be difficult for managers to tackle simply because that individual may not have encountered the issue before. “This lack of experience may be characterised by a great deal of ambiguity in terms of what to do,” Bush has noted in a blog. She offers a number of guiding questions that may be used to help resolve the issue (or at least define it as one of an ethical nature):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How would you define the problem if you stood on the other side of the fence?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your intention in making this decision?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who could your decision or action injure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you confident that your position will be as valid over a long period of time as it seems now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could you disclose your decision or action to your boss, CEO, the board of directors, family, or society as a whole without qualm?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The annual ERC report has repeatedly shown that employees who work in organisations with active ethics programmes – and where values such as honesty, respect and trust are seen in action at work – “generally report more positive experiences regarding a range of ethics outcomes”. It lists the following possible improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Less pressure on employees to compromise ethics standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less observed misconduct at work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater willingness to report misconduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater satisfaction with their organisation’s response to misconduct they report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater overall satisfaction with their organisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater likelihood of feeling valued by their organisations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the American Society of Association Executives (which represents over 10,000 trade associations and individuals around the world), there are a number of questions that anyone working for a business may ask about that company’s policies and procedures as a way of testing its ethical stance. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why might good people in this organisation do unethical things?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are our organisation’s values?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have we adequately articulated these values internally and externally?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does our organisation have written ethics policies, procedures or structures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To whom is our organisation accountable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do we mean by success?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the leadership of our organisation support the idea of an ethical workplace?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""affecting-change"">Affecting change</h3>
<p>In assessing its most recent survey, ERC noted that “ethical conduct improves when the economy cools”. Some 42% said their company had increased efforts to raise awareness about ethics. But ERC’s historical data shows that as the economy improves, misconduct rises and reporting drops as employees feel more confident about their financial position.</p>
<p>The current improvements in perception of ethical behaviour shown by ERC’s study may indicate a general swing towards a more considered approach but more likely, it says, it is a “snapshot of a workforce knocked off its historic trend lines” by a downturn that made people uneasy about job security. Now, as the economy slowly improves, behaviour is in the process of returning to the patterns seen in past studies.</p>
<p>Indeed, ERC reports “ominous warning signs of a potentially significant ethics decline ahead”. It notes that retaliation against employee whistle-blowers “rose sharply”, with 22% of those who reported misconduct claiming they experienced some form of retaliation in return in 2011. In 2007 the figure was 12% and in 2009 it was 15%. The number of employees who faced pressure to compromise standards in order to do their jobs rose from 8% in 2009 to 13% in 2011. Weak ethics cultures were perceived to be in 42% of businesses, up from 35% in 2009’s survey.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in perceptions of ethical performance according to the prevailing economic environment suggest that whilst not mutually exclusive, business and ethics can make awkward bedfellows at times, even if it is difficult to state categorically what ethics actually means in practice. It is apparent too that pretending to be as pure as the driven snow is an act increasingly difficult to maintain. But the publicity generated by perceived ethical transgressions can damage corporate reputation irreparably, thus the pressure to perform should serve as a counterweight to any loss of ‘ethical’ focus. Whether the re-alignment of business stance to meet the views of stakeholders is driven by a genuine desire to ‘do the right thing’ or by the need to offset bad PR remains a matter of choice and conscience.</p>
<p>Either way, companies must be aware that there are many activists who will be only too happy to highlight acts of hypocrisy – any failure to respond positively to the just criticisms of an ever-watchful world is sheer folly. Ultimately, if the outcomes are the same, perhaps it does not really matter if a business is genuinely concerned about its impact on the world or is merely engaged in a PR stunt. After all, Adam Smith wrote in ‘The Wealth of Nations’ (1776) when discussing the impact of market competition on individual behaviour: “By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.</p>

Taking sustainability seriously,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In today’s business world, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is no longer an option for companies – it is fast becoming a fundamental imperative for ethical credentials.</p>
<p>One reason is that consumers now expect higher ethical standards when it comes to global brands. According to a 2013 study by Cone Communications/Echo Global, just 6% of consumers believe that generating profit for shareholders is the singular purpose of business. A clear majority (31%), meanwhile, want to see companies doing much more than just donating time and money in communities – they want a long-term commitment to the well-being of the community as a whole.</p>
<p>A stronger focus on CSR is also necessitated by today’s changing regulatory landscape. In April, the European Commission (EC), following other jurisdictions, such as India, China, Brazil and South Africa, released a draft directive on sustainability disclosure, a process for publicly disclosing an organisation’s economic, environmental and social performance. The policy proposed by the EC requires large companies to annually disclose data on the social and environmental impacts of their activities across their supply chain. Although companies can reserve the right not to report on a particular topic, they will be legally required to explain why they are not doing so.</p>
<p>In the UK, regulation is also expected before long. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) is currently consulting with key stakeholders to build a CSR framework. The framework, which is expected to be implemented towards the end of 2013, will encourage companies to manage their supply chains more responsibly and transparently.</p>
<h3 id=""it-pays-to-be-good"">It pays to be good</h3>
<p>Beyond consumer expectations and regulatory necessity, most organisations also see a growing business case. The notion that environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues have a material impact is now beginning to gain more traction, says Andy White, an Associate Director at Sustainalytics, a research company which analyses the ESG performance of companies on behalf of the investors.</p>
<p>For over two decades, Sustainalytics and others in the responsible investment world have been arguing against the widely-held view that ESG issues have little or no bearing on financial performance. “That has been quite a challenge over the years because the industry mainstream regarded these issues as being largely peripheral,” White says. “This perception is changing; around 1,200 investor signatories, globally representing $35 trillion in assets under management (AUM), have signed up to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Such a high level of support indicates that investors want to integrate ESG into the investment process and recognise that ESG is a good proxy for understanding management quality.</p>
<p>“There has been a large amount of research indicating that companies with a good ESG record can perform better, together with a steady flow of assets into responsible investment funds, many of which have performed strongly. And there is plenty of case study evidence at the corporate level to demonstrate that, conversely, poor performance in this area can be very costly. If companies choose to flout health and safety regulations or are involved in big environmental accidents like BP was, for example, the costs of associated clean-ups and litigation can be value destroying for the business.”</p>
<p>However, CSR is about much more than just prudent risk management, he adds. Good ESG practices can also influence how a company approaches new opportunities, with emerging markets being a case in point. With consistently strong levels of economic growth, emerging economies clearly look like opportune places at the moment. “But those regions often have very complex environmental and social issues to contend with which require a level of market intelligence that goes beyond traditional financial analysis,” he explains.</p>
<p>“For example, we’ve seen incidents like the factory collapse in Bangladesh, severe pollution in parts of Asia and miners shot by police in South Africa. Therefore, as companies expand into emerging markets there are great opportunities, but there must be some awareness of how to manage the ESG risks in those countries as well. Long-term reputation damage can ensue if companies are linked to environmental and social problems, and with the rise of instant media and messaging, companies are more in the spotlight than ever before, no matter where they operate.”</p>
<p>If White is correct and integrating ESG with business objectives can have a tangible effect on the bottom line, then companies will surely want to know what measures they can take to improve their performance in this area. Drawing on lessons learned from recent ESG initiatives by Standard Chartered and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill), Treasury Today has compiled helpful pointers that companies may wish to consider when thinking about how to enhance their social, ethical and environmental performance.</p>

<h3 id=""evaluate-your-performance"">Evaluate your performance</h3>
<p>In 2010, Standard Chartered published a series of independent studies assessing its impact upon markets in Ghana, Bangladesh and Indonesia – the first of their kind to be conducted by a major financial institution. These reports were produced to help the bank better understand how well it has been performing in relation to its three over-arching CSR principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enabling the real economy to achieve sustainable growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivering sustainable finance to respond to risks and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leading by example in the workplace and community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments, the Ghana report found that through its core business activity Standard Chartered was making a significant contribution to the country’s socio-economic development. The launch of new products was said to have helped widen access to finance, with basic current accounts benefiting thousands of previously unbanked Ghanaians. The report praised the bank for its commitment to environmental targets, the introduction of sustainable finance criteria and investment in community projects.</p>
<p>But, importantly, these reports were not produced exclusively for the purpose of drawing attention to all the good work Standard Chartered has been doing in developing countries such as Ghana. It was also written in order to highlight areas where the bank can potentially improve and deepen its impact upon the Ghanaian economy.</p>
<p>In Ghana, these included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working with the government to ensure more favourable conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support diversification of the economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Align community investment programmes with its core skills and services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to provide employees with world class training and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate with government to improve business infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By looking critically at its impact on countries such as Ghana, Standard Chartered is demonstrating that it understands the business case for CSR. “We recognise that the long-term sustainable nature of our business is closely linked to the health and prosperity of the communities where we operate,” says Mark Devadason, Group Head of Sustainability at Standard Chartered. “We seek to contribute to sustainable economic growth in our core markets, by promoting robust, responsible business practices and widening access to finance.</p>
<p>“The independent impact studies we have recently commissioned allowed us to assess how we are meeting this objective and better understanding the contribution our business makes to a local economy,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""focus-on-your-strengths"">Focus on your strengths</h4>
<p>When it comes to social projects it helps to have a good understanding of the focus of your business, says Andrea Sullivan, Head of Corporate Responsibility for Europe and Emerging Markets (ex-Asia) at BofA Merrill. For many years now, the bank has been using its expertise to promote and teach financial literacy in communities across the globe through its ‘Your Financial Future’ curriculum. In the UK, Sullivan is thrilled to see an issue that the bank has spent time and money on, to raise awareness about gaining government recognition. “Use your strengths to match the needs of the community,” says Sullivan. “Financial education is now part of the UK curriculum, and that is encouraging; we can marry up what we do well with what is needed – and that alignment is always where companies are going to make the most impact.”</p>
<p>The bank already does a lot of work in communities where its focus is on financial education and employability. The bank’s Financial Education and Employability programme is one of the largest of its kind in the UK, says Sullivan. Over the past six years, more than 6000 young people have passed through the teaching which has been delivered to schools by 2000 BofA Merrill employees. The programme not only teaches young people about financial awareness, but more importantly it teaches employability skills.</p>
<p>Some of these students are now beginning to leverage these newly acquired skills to access higher education and enter into employment, Sullivan says. “I cannot claim that this is all down to one scheme. However, in today’s competitive world, being articulate, engaging in conversation and understanding how to get your point across are so important for getting a job.”</p>
<p>Another initiative the bank is sponsoring is the ‘Tech for Good Challenge’, a competition led by Big Issue Invest and Nominet Trust that offers digital technology entrepreneurs the opportunity to work with leading corporates to develop business plans to help solve social issues for or with young people. BofA Merrill has committed financial resources and eight mentors from within the bank to help the participants put together their business models. As well as ongoing support from business experts, the challenge also offers each successful applicant an investment in their business of up to £50,000. This initiative, Sullivan points out, is another example of the bank focusing on its strengths. “One of the things we have is an understanding of business and a strong technology group,” she says. “We have the knowledge, resources and people, and by connecting start-up capital with need we are able to support innovative ideas to help drive healthy economies.”</p>
<h4 id=""get-everyone-on-board"">Get everyone on board</h4>
<p>It is important to ensure that principle of responsibility is firmly embedded throughout the business. “To do that you have to create processes, procedures and an atmosphere of people working together and wanting to do the right thing,” says Sullivan.</p>
<p>The culture within BofA Merrill is now one where employees understand that acting responsibly is to their benefit and that they, as staff members, have a duty to raise issues when they are not right. This, she says, is of central importance to the bank’s CSR agenda. “Addressing the wider community’s social and environmental needs is crucial to the strength of the economy and to the sustainability of our business. It is important that we all understand this proposition,” she explains.</p>
<p>If this can be achieved, then improving CSR doesn’t necessarily mean spending more money. According to BofA Merrill, over the past few years its spend on CSR initiatives has remained reasonably steady. Instead, the difference is that the bank is thinking more strategically about its CSR commitments. In 2011, the bank created an EMEA CSR council to bring together senior management from different areas of the business to discuss the strategic direction the bank should be moving in terms of CSR in the region, and the measures needed to be introduced to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>“This is a journey,” she explains. “We are working together to improve, to be better connected and to be more focused – and that is great for the bank and for its employees.</p>
<p>“These initiatives are not just a ‘nice-to-do’, by any means,” she adds. “If we look ten years out to what we where to be as a company, social responsibility is going to help get us there.”</p>

Building a sustainable treasury function,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For some functions within the corporate entity, embracing sustainability is quite straightforward, or at least there are obvious initiatives to implement. IT can focus on low-hanging fruit, such as energy efficiency and the product development team could look at using recyclable materials, or building ‘eco’ versions of existing concepts.</p>
<p>But just having the treasury team recycle their plastic water bottles or work on energy efficient computers isn’t going to cut it in this day and age, especially since sustainability goes much deeper than just being environmentally friendly – it’s about mining for valuable information too. What this means is that treasurers must take a long hard look at their operations and policies to identify areas that could become more sustainable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Treasury Today has done a lot of the groundwork for you. By speaking to award-winning treasurers and sustainability experts from across the globe, we have outlined key areas where treasurers can really begin to drive change. Unsurprisingly, the first of these is by getting rid of paper.</p>
<h3 id=""saving-trees-shedding-costs"">Saving trees, shedding costs</h3>
<p>Still printing documents like its 1999? Well, the vast majority of office workers are, according to a survey released in December last year by Nitro, a company that delivers products to help people work smarter with digital documents. In fact, the survey results reveal that a mere 1% of us always – without fail – review documents electronically, rather than on paper. Like their legal counterparts, many treasurers are all too familiar with a paper-intensive workflow.</p>
<p>“When you’re operating in a company that has hundreds of bank accounts and thousands of customers, paper is most definitely the enemy of efficiency,” says the Treasury Manager of a manufacturing company, who wished to remain anonymous. “Getting rid of paper and going ‘green’ in the process has to be the way forward for treasury functions of any size. And it’s not just about the impact on the planet, or the bottom line improvements. Think about the quality of your employees’ work life. Do they really want to spend their days photocopying, filing and manually reconciling?”</p>
<p>A relatively early-mover in the space, Kellogg began a company-wide ‘Go Green’ initiative in 2005. The aim was to reduce the company’s impact on the environment and the communities surrounding its operational centres. As part of these efforts, the company’s treasury function identified an excellent opportunity to reduce the amount of paper flowing in and out of the department on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Almost 10,000 pieces of paper being handled each month and the equivalent of one full-time employee was dealing solely with manual reconciliation of receivables. With assistance from J.P. Morgan, the company underwent an electronic transformation.</p>
<p>Best practice solutions were rolled out to allow the company to view a significant amount of its bank statements online. For receivables reconciliation, customer remittance information was also moved online. Not only did this electronic solution get rid of paper, it also made automated reconciliation far more achievable, and reduced the company’s days sales outstanding (DSO).</p>
<p>In addition, Fifth Third Bank implemented an electronic remote cheque capture and deposit system for Kellogg. This meant that the company no longer had to use an armoured vehicle to transport cheques, thereby reducing cost and risk, as well as its carbon footprint. All this suggests that going paperless is the most obvious and wide-reaching way of embedding sustainability right at the heart of the treasury function.</p>

<h3 id=""paper-reduction-a-checklist-for-treasurers"">Paper reduction: a checklist for treasurers</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Make the most of your bank’s online offering.</h5>
<p>Logging into your bank’s online platform to view bank accounts will surely be much quicker than digging out the relevant file. It also provides added security controls and keeps an easily accessible record of reviewing and approval processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Embrace e-invoicing.</h5>
<p>In addition to the cost benefits that have been so widely reported, e-invoicing leads to greater consistency and standardisation, which in turn helps to reduce organisational complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Say goodbye to cheques.</h5>
<p>Using electronic payments instruments improves visibility, reduces the risk of fraud and can significantly reduce costs. Consider wire payments, cards programmes and mobile solutions. Where customers persist in paying you by cheque, discount incentives for signing up to direct debit may be useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Consider electronic bank account management (eBAM).</h5>
<p>Do away with paper-intensive account opening and maintenance procedures to really improve efficiency and control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Set up digital treasury workspaces.</h5>
<p>Whether in a secure cloud environment, or protected on your work server, archive reports and other documentation electronically. The search functionalities this provides can prove invaluable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Printer etiquette.</h5>
<p>If you or your team really do have to print, make sure it’s double-sided and on recycled paper. Any non-confidential documents should be put in a recycling bin after use and a sustainable confidential document destruction programme implemented.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""the-next-link-in-the-chain"">The next link in the chain</h3>
<p>Moving on from paperless treasury, the next area of sustainability investigation is supplier management. While the physical supply chain and the company’s choice of suppliers may not fall squarely into the treasurer’s camp, the bond between the physical and financial chains does make it their business. Even more so where the company is actively financing suppliers through supply chain finance (SCF) programmes, for example. What is more, having responsible suppliers can improve relationships and also reduce risk in both physical and financial supply chains.</p>
<p>Increasingly, companies are using matrices and questionnaires to measure the sustainability of their suppliers. Philips is a best practice leader in this space with a programme that stretches far beyond merely assessment to help suppliers to become more sustainable. The company’s Supplier Sustainability Involvement Programme is built on five core pillars, see table below.</p>
<p>During stage one, the supplier sustainability declaration is made based on an assessment of suppliers across five key checkpoints: labour; health and safety; environment; management systems; and ethics. There are also general considerations such as the suppliers’ compliance with laws and regulations. Suppliers can self-assess their compliance using an online Excel-based questionnaire on the company’s website.</p>
<p>Business is only awarded to the suppliers that live up to the company’s high expectations, but Philips also works with suppliers that need to improve their sustainability, as it sees this as a joint responsibility. Some companies do not have quite such rigorous supply chain standards in place, and many large food and beverage chains have been accused by the global press of simply chasing ‘ecolabels’ to bolster consumer sentiment. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted today that supply chain sustainability is not just the right thing to do from a PR and corporate social responsibility (CSR) point of view, but also from a company viability standpoint.</p>

<h3 id=""a-step-beyond"">A step beyond</h3>
<p>Aside from supplier assessment, there are a handful of other tools and techniques that come under the heading of supply chain sustainability. Supplier finance is one of these – by providing suppliers with access to credit at a lower cost than they would typically be used to and not squeezing them on payment terms, buyers are taking a responsible attitude towards supplier management. Ultimately, this builds a more robust and sustainable supply chain.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, reverse logistics is an interesting angle to consider. Sometimes referred to as the reverse supply chain, this is an often neglected part of the working capital management process – and sustainability initiatives. In a nutshell, it involves the flow of goods from the point of consumption back to the point of origin. While this may sound like the domain of logistics managers, there are good reasons for treasury to get involved, not least the fact that an inefficient reverse supply chain process can end up costing companies anywhere between two to four times the amount paid for the original item.</p>
<p>And just the transport alone of these returned goods has a far from inconsequential impact on the company’s carbon footprint, but centralised ‘take-back’ processing plants can assist. Sometimes though, it makes better financial and environmental sense to simply replace a faulty product without asking for it to be sent back – the end consumer can recycle it locally where appropriate. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the EU, disposal of the waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is now the producer’s responsibility, not the consumer, under the European WEEE directive.</p>
<h3 id=""employees-on-the-frontline"">Employees on the frontline</h3>
<p>If a treasury function is determined to set about demonstrating best practice in sustainability, then it is only right that it upholds high standards in all aspects of the day-to-day running of the department. Naturally, this should include employee welfare. This is not just about corporate social responsibility and making sure you are operating an ethical, diverse workplace, but also engaging employees to make sustainability a reality.</p>
<p>A few practical ideas to improve the treasury department’s sustainability credentials by engaging employees might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Setting performance targets that include reducing the amount of printed documents in the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arranging flexible working, to reduce commuting where appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased use of video conferencing rather than physical travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentives for walking, cycling or taking public transport to work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to set achievable targets for recycling within the department, as easy-wins can help to drive employee engagement. There are also new technologies that companies can leverage to assist, such as CloudApps SuMo (short for sustainability momentum). SuMo is in many ways a modern equivalent of the ‘star chart’. It combines social networking, gaming and sustainability, to help employees connect with sustainability goals and aims, whether departmental or enterprise-wide. Treasury managers should not underestimate the power of such engagement when it comes to employee satisfaction and retention.</p>
<h3 id=""investing-in-the-future"">Investing in the future</h3>
<p>Sustainable investment is another area of focus for sustainability-aware treasurers. It’s a topic that we’ll be covering in the next article in this six-part series, but it certainly deserves a mention here.</p>
<p>Inevitably, companies won’t invest in sustainable instruments purely out of good will; the main incentive will be performance – but this does not negate the fact that sustainable investing can help to ensure that future commitments are not compromised by meeting short-term goals. There are a number of institutions that offer sustainable investment services for corporates, so speak to your bank or asset manager to find out more. Alternatively, you could follow the example of carbon-neutral Google and invest directly in green energy projects. The tech giant committed $915m to renewable energy projects in 2011.</p>
<p>There is another side to sustainable investment to consider as well – investing in the company, as opposed to the markets. Honeywell’s corporate finance team, for example, recently undertook a project to raise $8m in cash and $4.5m in net after-tax benefits to save an ageing production facility that was facing imminent closure – as it specialised in producing substances such as CFC refrigerants, which are being eliminated globally. Not only was the plant saved, but the local community also got to keep a valuable employer.</p>
<h3 id=""reporting-for-duty"">Reporting for duty</h3>
<p>Finally, we come to the treasurer’s role in sustainability reporting – and how sustainability initiatives can provide valuable information and insight.</p>
<p>According to Alan McGill, a Partner in PwC’s Sustainability and Climate Change practice: “non-financial sustainability information can help an organisation to have a far better understanding of what might put their business at risk, such as resource scarcity. It also helps to assess the ability of your supply chain to deliver the goods you require, so that you can continue to manufacture.” In other words, the critical driver for companies to have sustainability information available is the ability to continue to deliver the financial returns that they have historically.</p>
<p>There are various sustainability reporting frameworks that exist in the marketplace, says McGill. “The most widely used and globally accepted is the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which provides companies with a solid idea of what kind of information they can report, what disclosures would be required and so on. At the same time, there are some global standards that do exist, and the most widely referred to of these is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for carbon reporting.”</p>
<p>Arguably what’s going to happen, as it did with financial reporting, says McGill, “is that over the next five to ten years, we will see a maturing of the measurements and the standards for reporting non-financial sustainability information. This will be part of the broader move in corporate reporting towards what is called ‘integrated reporting’. Historically, most corporate reporting has had a single issue focus around the financial performance of the business, but there is a lot more information that can support companies. So, reporting needs to become more reflective of that – particularly around the impact the business is having from an economic, social, environmental and financial perspective.”</p>
<h3 id=""paving-the-way"">Paving the way</h3>
<p>In the future, this means that the finance department and key actors within that world, such as the CFO and treasurer will become far more engaged in the provision of information – both financial and non-financial. “The fact that the information has tonnes of carbon, or metres cubed at the end of it, is irrelevant. Companies need to start thinking about these measures as the equivalent of different currency symbols, so instead of a dollar, pound or euro sign at the beginning, you have CO2 at the end of it, for example.”</p>
<p>And it’s true. Sustainability can have many tangible benefits, but one of the biggest barriers to it is totally intangible: mind-set. Is it time to change your way of thinking?</p>

<h3 id=""reporting-requirements-a global-snapshot"">Reporting requirements: a global snapshot</h3>
<p>In the UK, the coalition government is introducing mandatory carbon reporting for listed organisations this year. There is also a requirement in the UK on directors, when preparing their annual reports and accounts, to consider and report on the material social and environmental issues that the concern the company.</p>
<p>Outside of the UK, there are legal requirements for sustainability reporting in countries such as Sweden and Denmark. And in France, Grenelle 2 requires French companies to include a variety of social and environmental factors as part of their annual reporting.</p>
<p>Certain stock exchanges, such as Hong Kong, India, Brazil and South Africa, also have listing requirements around social and environmental issues that need to be reported. In South Africa, there is a government code called King 3 (named after Mervyn King who led the review into government reporting) which is entitled ‘Integrated Reporting’. It requires companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to include all the social, environmental and economic aspects of their business, alongside financial performance.</p>
<p>But critically, adds McGill, integrated reporting “isn’t about asking companies just to report more information – which would put huge reporting burdens on companies. It’s about putting out better information. So it’s redefining corporate reporting as we know it.”</p>

Sustainability: it’s the business ,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The mere mention of ‘sustainable business’ provokes a range of reactions among today’s corporate community. For the cynics, sustainability still conjures up images of animal rights activists or long-haired ‘green’ campaigners. Others just brush it off as the latest, rather intangible, fad. But for a growing professional contingent, corporate sustainability is becoming a trusted tool in their risk management armoury. So what exactly is sustainable business? What benefits does it offer? How can these be measured? And how can companies evolve from sustainability laggards into sustainability leaders?</p>
<h3 id=""enter-the-triple-bottom-line"">Enter the triple bottom line</h3>
<p>Back in 1994, the year that the Whitewater Inquiry began, corporate sustainability was very much in its infancy. To help embed the concept in the mass consciousness of business executives, John Elkington, co-founder of strategic advisory firm SustainAbility, coined the term the ‘triple bottom line’ (TBL). Through this, Elkington proposed that companies must pay attention not only to financial risks, but to the social and environmental threats to their profitability, too. This trio is sometimes referred to as ‘the three Ps’: profits, people and planet. By the late 1990s, the idea had gained significant traction, especially among the big global brands and fossil fuel CEOs. As Western consumers became increasingly aware of the use of sweatshop labour and the environmental impact of excessive hydrocarbon usage, corporate sustainability became not only a buzzword but a watchword for cutting-edge organisations.</p>
<p>Today, the fundamental pillars of TBL still form the basis of business sustainability; however the approach has evolved beyond a pure accounting play. While there is no globally accepted definition of what sustainable business is, the gist is that by being connected with ‘the three Ps’, a company can build resilience to external shocks, as well as contributing to the communities around them through sustainable development. According to the World Council for Economic Development (WCED), sustainable development ‘meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’.</p>

</figure>
<p>The group’s framework of csr-at-alliance-boots-group priorities covers the four key areas outlined above. This framework is called the ‘scorecard’ (see diagram) and is used across businesses within the group. Business plans are presented to the social responsibilities committee for approval and progress against these plans and the scorecard are monitored centrally.</p>
<p>“Corporate social responsibility forms a natural part of our group’s business culture,” explains Ornella Barra, Chairman of the social responsibilities committee at Alliance Boots. “People lie at the heart of Alliance Boots and our commitment to them is as important today as it has ever been. Our CSR approach continues to reflect this, whether through improving the health of communities around the world, creating healthy workplaces, striving to encourage healthy living or reducing the impact of our activities. As we grow, so too will our commitment to the local communities we serve.”</p>

<h3 id=""how-are-companies-interpreting-this"">How are companies interpreting this?</h3>
<p>A well-established manifestation of the sustainability drive is corporate social responsibility (CSR). Once again, this is a term that lacks a firm definition, but it broadly revolves around a company taking responsibility for its impact on society and the environment. A typical CSR programme will tackle four aspects of a company’s reach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Workplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To see how this might work in practice, let’s take a look at how international pharmacy, health and beauty group, Alliance Boots, approaches CSR:</p>
<p>Like Elkington’s triple bottom line, the concept of CSR has moved on in recent years. Nowhere is this more evident than in the European Commission’s (EC) communication on its ‘Renewed EU strategy 2011-14 for Corporate Social Responsibility’. According to this paper, the EC previously defined CSR as ‘a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis’.</p>
<p>However, the communication goes on to say that: ‘The economic crisis and its social consequences have to some extent damaged consumer confidence and levels of trust in business. They have focused public attention on the social and ethical performance of enterprises. By renewing efforts to promote CSR now, the Commission aims to create conditions favourable to sustainable growth, responsible business behaviour and durable employment generation in the medium and long term.’</p>
<p>Here we see the scope of CSR significantly expanded. This is no longer about paying lip service, or making a few public donations to charity. It’s about delivering growth for future generations – whether business owners and employees, or consumers in the community they serve. So, sustainable business challenges traditional CSR, taking a longer-term, more holistic view.</p>
<h3>Reaping the benefits</h3>
<p>No matter what size your company is, the benefits of embracing this holistic approach to corporate sustainability are numerous. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Improved company or brand image.</h5>
<p>Consumers are becoming more demanding and expect corporations to act ethically and responsibly. In return, a reputation for integrity and respect can help to build customer loyalty, based on these values. In fact, a 2011 survey by Green is Universal (the sustainability division of US media and entertainment company NBC) found that 68% of consumers believe it is worth paying more for a green product or service if it is a brand they trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Enhanced risk management.</h5>
<p>Many businesses decide to embrace sustainability as a means of recovering from bad press, or mitigating reputational risk – see this month’s Risk Management article on page 34 for more details. Sustainability also offers companies an enhanced way of looking at risk – one that is broader than traditional enterprise risk management, going beyond economic, strategic and operational factors to consider emerging external risks as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cost savings.</h5>
<p>These may come in a number of forms, ranging from process efficiencies (eg electronification of paper-based processes) through to more careful monitoring of resource consumption, such as water usage. Elsewhere, experts argue that by minimising certain business risks, sustainability can help to reduce the costs of regulatory non-compliance and litigation, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reduced cost of capital.</h5>
<p>A study conducted by the Canadian non-profit Network for Business Sustainability confirmed that companies that ‘implement an environmental risk management strategy reduce their weighted average cost of capital.’ Higher levels of environmental risk management, the study found, can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Greater willingness of debt markets to provide debt financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher tax benefits that partially offset the cost of debt capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced cost of equity capital from a decrease in systematic risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced cost of equity capital from an increased dispersion of shares.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Supply chain stability.</h5>
<p>By acting responsibly towards suppliers, companies are better placed to secure consistent, long-term access to the raw materials and products that they need. Contrary to popular belief, sustainable procurement can actually work out to be cheaper than traditional routes – largely through more transparent relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Competitive advantage.</h5>
<p>Sustainability enables “enterprises to better anticipate and take advantage of fast changing societal expectations and operating conditions. It can therefore drive the development of new markets and create opportunities for growth,” says the EC. When looking at strategies for becoming sustainable, companies also often take stock of their current business model and examine how they can become more innovative, or gain an edge over their peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Improved employee satisfaction, morale or retention.</h5>
<p>According to a survey released by non-profit community Net Impact in May 2012, employees who have a job that enables them to make a “social or environmental impact on the world are more satisﬁed with their job by a 2:1 ratio”. And when employees are happier, they are more productive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is more, many reputable reports show a strong correlation between a company’s sustainability credentials and its financial and stock market performance. ‘Companies that are considered leaders in environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies also lead the pack in stock performance – by an average of 25%,’ according to a 2007 Goldman Sachs report, which it released alongside the launch of a sustainable investment focus list, GS Sustain.</p>
<h3 id=""best-practice-implementation"">Best practice implementation</h3>
<p>With the benefits outlined, how does a company put a workable sustainability programme in place? The following five-step process provides a good outline of the stages required, although somewhat simplified:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Envision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most difficult of these five steps for the majority of businesses is engagement. With a well-researched business case behind it, sustainability should be a no-brainer for the C-suite. But while buy-in from top-level management is essential, so too is buy-in across the business. Securing this will depend to a large extent on how robust the company’s proposed sustainability policy and framework is. This is where specialist consulting firms can add real value.</p>
<p>Placing sustainability representatives throughout the organisation can also be invaluable in ensuring enterprise-wide engagement. Alliance Boots, for example, has a ‘champion’ in most businesses with responsibility for defining and delivering local CSR priorities and targets in line with the group’s overall objectives. All champions are supported by the company’s CSR Director and Co-ordinator, who provide guidance and additional expertise on working within the group’s CSR framework. Colleagues from a number of departments including, human resources (HR), communications and finance also support the work of the champions.</p>
<h3 id=""sustainability-metrics"">Sustainability metrics</h3>
<p>Measuring the company’s progress against its sustainability goals is often the second most challenging step. While every company will have different requirements for sustainability metrics that ensure compliance with the stated goals of its programme, examples of indicators that could be easily and effectively monitored are (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Customer satisfaction and loyalty levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of customer complaints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The social impact of the company’s core product or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy and water consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waste sent to landfill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon footprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental impact of the company’s supply chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workforce diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of staff grievances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level of staff turnover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percentage of suppliers and partners screened for human rights compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percentage of suppliers and partners meeting sustainability requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only does having metrics in place allow companies to measure their progress, the process of defining the correct metrics can actually help to cement the organisation’s sustainability goals and priorities. Moreover metrics can assist in reinforcing personal and organisational accountability, as well as improving internal and external communication around the success of the company’s sustainability drive.</p>

<h3 id=""marks-and-spencer-learning-from-the-best"">Marks &amp; Spencer: learning from the best</h3>

<p>Launched in January 2007, Plan A is UK retailer Marks &amp; Spencer’s sustainability drive. The company originally set out 100 commitments to achieve in five years. That has now been extended to 180 commitments to achieve by 2015, with the ultimate goal of becoming the world’s most sustainable major retailer. Through Plan A, the company is working with its customers and suppliers to combat climate change, reduce waste, use sustainable raw materials, trade ethically, and help customers to lead healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p>In 2012, Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S) sent zero waste to landfill. It is also now a carbon neutral company. Since April 2012, M&amp;S has stopped selling confectionery designed to appeal to children. These are just three examples of how the company is making a real difference.</p>
<p>“Plan A is how we do business at M&amp;S – it involves our customers, our employees, our suppliers and our suppliers’ suppliers. We are fully committed to it,” says Marc Bolland, CEO, Marks &amp; Spencer. The initiative is called Plan A “because we believe it’s now the only way to do business. There is no Plan B.”</p>
<p>M&amp;S was named Responsible Retailer of the Year in the 2012 World Retail Awards.</p>

<h3 id=""global-leaders-in-sustainability"">Global leaders in sustainability</h3>
<p>The best practice steps outlined above are designed to bring sustainability laggards into the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. Going the extra mile and becoming a sustainability leader requires something extra special: genuine, deep-rooted commitment. The case study above illustrates the difference.</p>
<p>Being a sustainability leader isn’t just about the accolades though. In a world where companies increasingly have to compete for resources, corporate sustainability will – sooner rather than later – become the ‘new normal’. And now is the time to get ready, because sustainable business models aren’t put in place overnight.</p>
