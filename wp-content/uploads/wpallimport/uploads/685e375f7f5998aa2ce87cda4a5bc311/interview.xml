<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Tell us a little about your professional background and the moves that have led you to this current role at Coupa?</h4>
<p>I have spent most of my professional career working in financial services, mostly in transaction banking, global payments, cash management, treasury and trade products. I have a particular passion for technology and innovation. After getting my Master’s degree in Law, my career started at the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce in New York and eventually I joined Sungard’s AvantGard, which is now known as FIS, where I was selling treasury systems.</p>
<p>In 2008 I then moved to SWIFT in Hong Kong for the launch of SWIFT for corporates there. After three years, this was followed by moves into banking with HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG. There I worked for a man who was really inspirational, and a critical force in helping my career. In 2019 I moved to Amsterdam to be closer to my family and went to work for HSBC again in the Global Liquidity and Cash Management division. Earlier this year I received a call from Coupa, I was wowed by the people and the company and couldn’t resist the chance to move again and really loving the Coupa Culture.</p>
<h4>Tell us about your experiences with gender equality and DEI over the course of your experiences in technology and finance?</h4>
<p>My first working experience in technology was with the Belgian fintech company Trax.  Technology has always been a passion of mine. By the time I moved into banking with HSBC, I worked with a mentor who was at the time the Regional Head of Sales for HSBC in APAC. He was very important in helping to progress my career. Gender equality, diversity and inclusion in all its forms have always been important to me. The concepts of fairness and justice are integral for me, and throughout my career the issue of gender equality has always been important, as I have always worked in a more male dominated industry and often been the only woman in the room throughout these experiences in technology and finance.</p>
<p>The first negative event that happened to me was back in 2008 when I was Director of the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce. I was the only female director at the table, and one of the other directors tried to order a coffee from me because he presumed that I must be one of the staff. That wasn’t the only time I experienced discrimination in my career, I was also once denied a promotion because, as a woman, I could not manage a team of men. It’s great for me now to be at a company like Coupa where everyone is very committed to gender equality. For example, we have a programme called Empower which strives to progress and support diverse talent inside the company and in general across the industry and beyond. We believe in the fact that diversity drives better business results. It’s just nice to see that there is a commitment at Coupa to breaking down boundaries to women’s success, and I also feel like this is the reality and not just empty words since joining this community and working together with my colleagues.</p>
<h4>What work is Coupa doing to address gender equality within its ‘Empower’ initiative which will be showcased at next week’s Inspire event?</h4>
<p>The Empower initiative wants to break down barriers and unleash the potential of women in business through three pillars:</p>
<p>Discover – we focus on the individual. Discover provides development skills for career growth and allows for talent that is diverse to rise up. We facilitate mentorship both internally and externally and offer high quality training programmes.</p>
<p>Connect – we try to facilitate events and talks around different, relevant topics where we aim to connect women and allies. We have many different partnerships globally, 51 in total to be exact, and we are constantly looking for new ones. At our EMEA Inspire event we are hosting an Empower breakfast dedicated to the topic of female development which falls under this pillar also. There, an impressive panel of leaders will be sharing their inspiring, insightful and empowering stories.</p>
<p>Impact – this pillar leverages the power of the community to deliver positive change to the world that we share, live and work in. For example, we support different charities such as When She Speaks, which is a Silicon Valley initiative that features senior women leaders in tech, and the Renand foundation in Haiti, which is dedicated to eradicating child slavery.</p>
<h4>So what can people expect from the Inspire conference and how can our Treasury Today community get involved?</h4>
<p>Inspire is taking place in Berlin from 16thy-18th May where we are uniting our community from across supply chain, procurement, treasury, finance and IT. On the morning of 18th we are hosting as already mentioned an Empower breakfast panel session dedicated to the themes of diversity and equality. Female speakers from Maersk, Barclays, Bourne Leisure and a male ally from the Metropolitan Police will join Helen Trim, Coupa’s SVP of Marketing EMEA &amp; APAC, to speak about how they overcame (or helped others to overcome) numerous hurdles to succeed in their careers, to reach senior positions and deliver great impact in their organisations. Hopefully attendees will walk away with invaluable insights and concrete actions and techniques, while feeling a greater sense of belief and empowerment to realise their potential, raise their profile and reinvent their future – supported by the wider community.</p>
<p>We believe this is a great moment to bring everyone together. We also have a specific track focused on treasury that includes sessions on, for example, cross border disruptions, and the power of the SWIFT payments network to arrive at payments transparency and efficiency. There will be demos and conversations and in general this is a great opportunity to break down the silos between procurement and finance to unlock new opportunities together.</p>
<p>Anyone in treasury interested in attending can use the <strong>ILOVETREASURY</strong> code to get their free ticket and join us!</p>
<h4>Any final thoughts on the issues we’ve spoken about today?</h4>
<p>As we progress further, I think solutions should stimulate education and learning. Equality and inclusivity are long-term goals to work towards and there is still much work to be done. We don’t want to just have diversity for the sake of it, but I believe we should focus on how we can deliver better belonging and wellbeing. Gender inequality issues have certainly improved over time, but I think equal rights in society and access to family care still have some way to go. Stereotypes within gender roles at work are still visible and need to be done away with. Equality is fundamental for a prosperous, sustainable, and peaceful world.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Tell us about the history of the company.</h4>
<p>My brother Phillip and I recognised that the growth of open banking and the disparate state of legacy corporate treasury technology presented a major opportunity to create a contemporary, app-based system that can fit into a corporate’s existing ERP system, powered by bank API connectivity.</p>
<p>In May of 2021, we closed on a US$16m equity funding round led by Point72 Ventures, with investments from Nyca Partners, former Palantir CFO and Founding Partner of Friends &amp; Family Capital Colin Anderson, and Plaid Founder William Hockey. This funding allowed us to further invest in our technology and expand our global reach and executive leadership team. We have secured clients such as Citrix and partnered with leading global financial institutions like Standard Chartered. We also recently announced the launch of the industry’s first bank API catalogue for corporate treasurers.</p>
<h4>What can clients expect?</h4>
<p>There are two distinct factors that set FinLync apart from legacy treasury technology. The first is that our treasury apps are embedded inside a corporate’s ERP, meaning that FinLync’s apps install quickly and easily inside a company’s existing system of record, comparable to installing apps directly onto a smartphone. Benefits include one centralised data location, a reduced number of software systems to maintain and pay for, reduced exposure to fraud, and a decrease in expensive implementation, all the while using a corporate’s existing ERP login.</p>
<p>The second factor is that bank connectivity is made via real-time bank APIs, getting rid of both bank portals and bank files. Corporates have streamlined API connectivity to all their banks and accounts in an always-on format, freeing corporates from laborious bank portals and host-to-host connectivity while reducing manual labour. Real-time data means speed and precision which enables faster decisions with more accurate data.</p>
<p>One client we can point to is Citrix. Citrix is leveraging FinLync’s technology to integrate its bank and ERP data which will allow its corporate treasury team to benefit from real-time payments, balances, account information and status, machine learning-assisted reconciliation the same day as transactions, more certainty for urgent payments – while being protected by the latest enterprise-grade security. This multinational software company got a technology solution to improve its payment lifecycle while lowering costs and streamlining operations. Citrix will be leveraging FinLync’s solution suite, including Balance and Transaction Inquiry, Payments, Approvals, Status Tracker and Reconciliation applications, bringing speed, reliability and 24/7 transparency to its corporate treasury function.</p>
<p>The use cases for FinLync include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Global cash position in 60 seconds. As frequently as a treasurer wants, whenever they want – think of having a “refresh” button for all of a corporate’s bank data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instant traceability of critical treasury payments. This includes detailed reject reasons, and step-by-step payment tracking from origination to final beneficiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instant reconciliation. Corporates can count on same-day reconciliation, invoice matching, and user-trained AI creates new rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<p>More precise forecasting. This is achieved by leveraging up-to-the minute available balances and all AP, AR and GL data.</p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>How has the pandemic affected your offering?</h4>
<p>The pandemic has only highlighted the need for real-time treasury along with more sophisticated liquidity management and cash forecasting capabilities. For example, at the onset of the pandemic and resultant lockdowns, when a large portion of revenue stopped and budgets froze, corporate treasurers needed instant data about their firms’ financial status. For many, this was impossible because legacy treasury management systems are only built for delayed or scheduled information. Today, corporate treasurers are facing pandemic-related supply chain issues that require them to forecast more frequently and with more granularity, something legacy technology can also make difficult.</p>
<p>As the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty and fundamentally change the world we live in, we have seen corporate treasurers more open than ever to exploring how bank APIs and real-time treasury can help them drive efficiencies into their teams’ functions.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-professional-background-as-well-as-your-current-role">Could you tell us a little about your professional background as well as your current role?</h4>
<p>I have been in financial services for more than 15 years.  I started my career at Morgan Stanley Investment Management where I joined as one of the first analysts for their then newly launched US Institutional Money Market group.  In 2017, I had an opportunity to join State Street Global Advisors to lead their global cash investor coverage for New York City-based financial institutions, and have been there for more than three years now.</p>
<p>I see my role as very much that of a business development leader and relationship manager, engaging with both traditional and alternative investment managers, private equity, and banks about the wide range of investment approaches and strategies we offer in the short-term fixed income space.</p>
<h4 id="what-motivates-or-inspires-you-in-your-career">What motivates or inspires you in your career?</h4>
<p>I would say there are three things that motivate me. First, the desire to learn and to grow. Second, the desire to help others. And third – I like to build things.</p>
<p>It’s easy to go along in life doing what’s comfortable, but if you don’t challenge yourself with things outside of your comfort zone, are you denying yourself the opportunity to grow and realise your full potential?  From traveling to new places and trying new foods to exploring new solutions in a rigid market place – it applies to all facets of life.</p>
<p>I also believe it’s important to help others. When I meet with existing or potential clients, I aim to listen more than I speak. And the reason is so I can fully understand their situation and what hurdles they are facing, and in turn be in the position to offer the right solutions.  Outside of my 9-to-5, I try to find time to give back through volunteer work.  For many years I volunteered at a non-profit that helped prepare high-achieving high school students from low-income households for college success.</p>
<p>And lastly I enjoy building things, whether it’s helping to build a team or a new product, or finding new opportunities within sectors or market segments that we haven't focused on before. That entrepreneurial spirit really excites me.  However, nothing excites me more than building a large tower or bridge out of toy blocks with my son.</p>
<h4 id="how-have-you-and-your-clients-been-coping-with-the-global-pandemic">How have you and your clients been coping with the global pandemic?</h4>
<p>I am based in New York City, so the first couple of months were quite difficult.  For both my clients and myself, this pandemic has really impacted all aspects of life, professionally and personally.
Adapting to the new normal – or rather ‘abnormal’ – has forced us to be creative and innovative in the ways we engage with each other. To be in an environment where we have to be physically distanced is a challenge: instead of office visits or in-person meetings I now do most of my engagement virtually.</p>
<p>Many of us are experiencing the same challenges. We are all working remotely. But because we are communicating even more than we have done in the past, we are more connected.  In turn, I feel much closer to my clients.</p>
<p>I have family globally and we hold Zoom calls on a regular basis, so I would say that if there is a positive aspect in all this, it is the way that we have learned to utilise technology. That, in turn, has given us new opportunities to enjoy a more balanced life.</p>
<h4 id="in-terms-of-what-your-clients-are-focusing-on,-has-it-led-to-any-changes-regarding-their-goals-and-objectives">In terms of what your clients are focusing on, has it led to any changes regarding their goals and objectives?</h4>
<p>For people who had never done so before, working from home was a challenge. In the beginning there were so many variables with the liquidity crisis and with the markets being so volatile: people were very reactive. However, in the United States, positive intervention from the Federal Reserve and other government bodies helped normalise the situation and calm the markets.</p>
<p>I think my clients were then able to catch their breath – rather than putting out fires and just focusing on their day-to-days, they were able to start to evaluate more long-term projects. Presently, clients are focusing on managing risk, understanding cashflows and operating effectively in a zero-interest rate environment.</p>
<h4 id="are-there-any-learning-experiences-from-the-past-few-months-you-would-like-to-share">Are there any learning experiences from the past few months you would like to share?</h4>
<p>People have been far more effective working from home than we ever thought possible, but it has not necessarily been easy. My wife also works in financial services and we have a two year old son. Working while also having parental obligations is tough to juggle. We aren’t alone in that; there are many others in a similar situation.</p>
<p>Working from home means you are living in your office, so setting boundaries to maintain a healthy balance is vital. It’s easy for divisions between life and work to become blurred when you are working from home.</p>
<p>It is also important to establish when you are at work, when it is family time and when it is your own personal time. For example, when we are at home having a meal, we have no electronics: we are trying to find that rhythm, that balance. It’s important, because if things are unmanageable you become much less effective – you need to adapt to the new environment and then move forward.</p>
<h4 id="what-will-you-be-focusing-on-in-2021">What will you be focusing on in 2021?</h4>
<p>On the work front it will be finding new ways of effectively establishing new business relationships in what has become a changed environment. In the past, a lot of business development revolved around social interactions, going to conferences and other networking events. That has changed, so the challenge will be in finding new ways of establishing contact with new and potential clients.</p>
<p>On a personal level it will be to prioritise health, especially now that I’m cooking a lot of comfort meals at home. I would definitely like to get out on my bike more!</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="tell-us-how-you-came-to-your-current-role">Tell us how you came to your current role.</h4>
<p>I graduated from Fordham University in New York. While I was in graduate school, I joined Morgan Stanley’s rotational analyst program. After completing the program, I joined the cash team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. I gained experience through exposure to all aspects of the business, including working with the intermediary channel, interacting with banks and asset managers, at the same time working with the direct sales, cross selling and product teams.</p>
<p>I moved to a small alternatives investment firm in Boston where I worked with hedge fund managers and institutional investors. That was a great opportunity for me to gain further experience in sales.</p>
<p>Then, five years ago, I joined the institutional product development team at State Street Global Advisors working across asset classes, including equity, fixed income, alternatives and cash. For the last two and a half years, I’ve been leading distribution efforts for our institutional liquidity products in the South East and parts of the Midwest, working with institutional investors and companies ranging in size, foundations and endowments, hospitals, insurance companies and the like.</p>
<h4 id="'what-would-you-say-inspires-and-motivates-you">What would you say inspires and motivates you?</h4>
<p>I grew up in the Dominican Republic, moving as a teenager to the United States with my mom and younger brother. When I came here, I didn’t speak a word of English. My mother was a single mom and she had to work hard to support us. I had to figure everything out for both myself and my brother, including things like college and internships. It forced me to grow up quickly. It seemed normal at the time but looking back I realise just how challenging it all was. Now I am married and have a daughter of my own. I have an amazing family, so making all of them proud! I would like to think that my experience can show my daughter and any young girl who dreams of success that they can succeed in whatever career they choose. If they work hard, they can do anything that they want to, no matter what their backgrounds are.</p>
<p>And last – but not least – I am inspired by my mentors. Most of them are people that I have worked for at some point in my career, and have helped me grow personally and professionally. I would like to say to them that they made the right decision in supporting me and giving me opportunities. I am only here because they have had faith in me.</p>
<h4 id="how-has-the-global-pandemic-affected-your-work-and-the-work-of-your-clients">How has the global pandemic affected your work and the work of your clients?</h4>
<p>My main focus is on expanding and developing relationships with institutional investors in the territories I am responsible for. In many ways, the pandemic has allowed me to get to know my clients on a more personal level. Many of us are in similar situations: people are trying to create new routines, and they might have to balance working from home with looking after children who are unable to go to school, or not able to go full time. But since we are all working from home, we get to see more of each other’s families and homes. That makes it a completely different experience. We’re all in this together and we will get through it together.</p>
<p>The pandemic has taken its toll on people, and we miss the little things that we took for granted. I know that a lot of people miss the team-building aspects of being with their colleagues and the conversations they would have in the office. The in-person interactions have always been an enjoyable part of the job. At the end of the day we all recognise that a face-to-face meeting is hard to match, especially when it comes to developing new relationships. But for now we make do with what we have, and technology has been extremely helpful when it comes to staying connected with colleagues and clients.</p>
<h4 id="has-it-affected-your-clients-priorities-what-they-are-looking-to-achieve-right-now">Has it affected your clients’ priorities? What they are looking to achieve right now?</h4>

People are trying to not let the pandemic have a long-term impact on their companies. For the most part, the feedback that I have received from my clients is that everything that needs to be done at their companies is being done. April and May were hectic: everyone was trying to absorb everything and figure out how to operate in this new environment. They may have put some projects on pause, but now that they have had time to adjust, they can get back to tackling the priorities they had in the first quarter.



<h4 id="what-have-you-learned-over-the-last-few-months">What have you learned over the last few months?</h4>
<p>I am proud of the way my team and my clients have handled this challenging time. I particularly value the many conversations I have had with people about the positive aspects of this disruptive time. We are all human, so of course we have days where we are frustrated with the situation. But I personally feel very blessed that my loved ones are healthy, that I have a great job and that I work at a firm that has been so supportive during these difficult times. And I think my clients feel the same. This has been such a difficult year and we are still going through a lot right now – but it shall pass, and hopefully 2021 will be a better year.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-you-expecting-to-focus-on-next-year">What are you expecting to focus on next year?</h4>
<p>For my clients, to serve them and help them navigate through the opportunities, risks and challenges in the new year. Meanwhile, I plan to continue my involvement with the Inclusion and Diversity council at State Street Global Advisors. We can all do our part to drive change, and that is my way of trying to contribute to that. Reading the Treasury Today 2020 Women in Treasury Global Study was really encouraging – I think we have leaders paying close attention to this initiative, and we want to keep that momentum going.</p>

<p><em>From navigating the challenges that continue to arise from the COVID-19 pandemic, to driving other initiatives including sustainability and the transition from LIBOR, here’s what treasurers are likely to be focusing on in 2021.</em></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Twelve months ago, few could have foreseen the pandemic that would come to dominate 2020. As the year draws to a close, COVID-19 continues to bring widespread disruption to people and businesses around the world – and it is likely that this will continue well into 2021.</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers, the challenges of the past year have been extraordinary. Lockdown conditions have forced entire treasury teams to adopt home working models, often overnight. While some had prepared for such an eventuality – albeit with the expectation that any such disruption would be short-lived – others had to act fast to adjust their processes and secure the equipment they needed to operate from home offices. And for many, school and nursery closures meant that work had to be balanced with childcare and home learning responsibilities.</p>
<p>As if this wasn’t challenging enough, treasurers have also had to navigate numerous obstacles that have arisen during the course of the crisis, including securing access to liquidity, mitigating soaring cybercrime threats, managing FX in volatile conditions and addressing supply chain disruptions. Some companies, notably those in the aviation and hospitality sectors, have faced particularly severe challenges, while others have seen customer demand ramp up rapidly. As Jack Spitzer, CFO of health and wellness company Plexus Worldwide, comments: “We have had a strong surge in sales during COVID, so it has forced us to look further into how we can better handle spikes in volume from order to fulfilment to customer support.”</p>
<p>As 2021 approaches, treasurers are not only continuing to navigate the specific challenges brought by the pandemic itself, but are focusing on a wide range of treasury initiatives, from automating processes to exploring opportunities for sustainable financing. Matthew Davies, Head of Global Transaction Services (GTS) EMEA and Global co-Head of Corporate Sales, GTS at Bank of America notes that the challenges in the year ahead can be divided into three: “There are going to be the priorities that are a direct result of COVID-19; the priorities that are a by-product of COVID-19 – such as the macroeconomic environment – and the priorities that come under the heading of business as usual, including topics like risk management, working capital management and rationalising banking structures.”</p>
<p>While not exhaustive, the following are some of the areas that treasurers are expecting to focus on in the coming year.</p>
<h4 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h4>
<p>Unsurprisingly, businesses are expecting further disruption in 2021 as a result of the pandemic. Carl Sharman, Director, Financial Advisory at Deloitte, says a recent CFO survey carried out by Deloitte highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic is set to have the highest negative effects to their businesses over the next 12 months, with 75% of respondents expecting either ‘significant’ or ‘severe’ impacts. “Interestingly this compared with only 23% expecting the same level of negative effect caused by Brexit,” he says. “In comparison, 72% expect the negative effects for Brexit to be at either ‘mild’ or ‘some’, which highlights a significant shift in emphasis.”</p>
<p>But while the challenges of COVID-19 are set to continue in 2021, it’s likely that the focus will be somewhat different. Davies notes that while 2020 was a year of adjusting to the new environment and protecting the business, the emphasis in 2021 will be on “getting back to a forward-looking view of how to position the company for the future.” He adds, “That means making sure the right architecture, processes, structures and teams are in place to deal with an environment that continues to be highly uncertain.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sharman says that treasurers are “likely to be pushed into the fast lane” next year as developments take hold, with cost reduction and increased cash flow coming into sharper focus. “It is also highly likely that reducing leverage will become critical for many businesses and sectors, with asset disposal and debt/equity restructuring playing a major role,” he says. “Already the signs are there for next year’s budgets to have increased spend in software, data and IT/automation compared to pre-pandemic plans, in many cases offset by a marked decrease in land, buildings and workspace infrastructure spending, as businesses begin to re-jig their priorities.”</p>
<h4 id="technology-investment">Technology investment</h4>
<p>Alongside an abrupt transition to remote working models, technology has risen rapidly up the treasury agenda. Some treasurers have accelerated their adoption of treasury management systems, fraud prevention software and cash forecasting solutions in the quest for greater visibility and control – although in other cases, technology initiatives have gone on the back burner as more pressing priorities have emerged. As Enrico Camerinelli, Senior Analyst at Aite Group, points out: “On the one hand, the pandemic has pressed the pause button – a lot of people are stopping and thinking about what comes next. But the other comment I’m hearing is that the pandemic has accelerated some decision processes that were already there.”</p>
<p>The current climate may also have brought a shift in focus when it comes to the type of technology investment companies are focusing on. Deloitte’s Sharman says that before the pandemic, “spend may have been focusing on the competitive advantage and development areas of machine learning, automation and predictive analytics – but now it may be more concentrated in doing the basics well in terms of remote working.”</p>
<p>He adds that this may “put the treasurer at the heart of the recovery”, with robust payment processes, cash visibility and heightened risk management emerging as “core business-critical candidates for being enabled by the latest technology platforms, with corporates focusing less on marginal gains and more on protecting avoidable losses.”</p>
<p>Mark Smith, Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions EMEA at Citi, says a major focus in recent months has been on building resilience in order to manage business disruption. “It’s about being able to run your systems and platforms, connect with clients and enable them to continue serving their customers,” he says. For corporate clients, he says the crisis has acted as “a catalyst to investment and digitisation,” and has led to greater adoption of initiatives that can automate manual processes.</p>
<p>In this environment, banks are seeing significant uptake of their digital services. Bank of America reported in a Q3 press release that CashPro Mobile active users have increased by 39% in the last 12 months, while the value of payments approved using CashPro Mobile has increased by 111% year on year. “Clearly clients are embracing the opportunity to do more through digital capabilities,” says Fernando Iraola, Head of GTS LatAm and Global co-Head of Corporate Sales, GTS at Bank of America. “I see this as one of the opportunities to come out of this crisis, and this will continue in 2021.”</p>
<p>Smith, meanwhile, says that over 75% of Citi’s account opening can be carried out using digital onboarding capabilities. “We’ve been incredibly focused on our digital onboarding, and working out how we can make doing business with us easier,” he comments. “It’s not about having reams of unnecessary legal documents, but about having the pertinent ones that are necessary, and then offering digital onboarding.” He also cites the growing take-up of API connectivity to initiate payments, check balances and send queries.</p>


<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Preparing for the unexpected</h2>


<h3 class="fn">Chris King</h3>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer at Drax Group</h5>
<p><img alt="Drax logo" class="org" height="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/drax-logo-2020.png?la=en&amp;hash=0DFC9ADE3C31E882F296CE1437C02A8B" style="margin-top:0.5em;" title="Drax logo" width="60"/></p>

<p>For corporate treasurers, preparing for the unexpected has never been more crucial, says Chris King, Group Treasurer at Drax Group, a British electrical power generation company which aims to enable a zero-carbon, lower cost energy future.</p>
<p>“The approach we adopt is to look at core strategic themes, assess how they may develop and then seek to maintain as much flexibility and optionality wherever possible to be able to respond to the broadest range of scenarios,” says King. He notes that four themes in particular stand out as he looks forward to 2021:</p>
<p><strong>1. Net zero emissions</strong></p>
<p>“Drax, the UK’s leading renewable generator, undertook Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and was the first company globally to announce its ambition to become carbon negative by 2030,” says King. “We will need to continue to focus on innovation, in terms of how we seek to translate that into our financing structures, our financial KPIs and approach to derivatives structuring and risk management.”</p>
<p><strong>2. Brexit</strong></p>
<p>King says that once Brexit is finalised, “we should get some degree of certainty, which one would hope would be accompanied by inbound investment. This may happen as a cliff edge event, or it may happen over time and with it may come some increased questioning (and uncertainty) over how the UK navigates a post-EU trade landscape.”</p>
<p>He adds that currency and broader economic influences are very impactful to Drax, and continue to remain a key focus. “We have been immensely innovative in the last two or three years, working to reassess and implement a novel and fundamentally different approach to derivatives execution and risk management to substantially enhance our risk adjusted return,” he says. “We have developed a number of new products with financial institutions, and this is something we will seek to optimise further.”</p>
<p><strong>3. ‘Lower for longer'</strong></p>
<p>Where interest rates are concerned, King says “I have been wrong on this point for longer than I care to remember, in that over the last decade I have typically thought that global interest rates would rise.”</p>
<p>He adds that while he still holds this opinion, he now expects this will take longer than previously thought. “That said, for many organisations, including Drax, locking in long-term financing costs at ultra-low rates provides certainty to focus on strategic objectives, unfettered by concerns of near-term rising interest rates – which in itself is valuable.”</p>
<p><strong>4. Enjoyment</strong></p>
<p>In addition, King muses that people have become “less connected” during the course of 2020. He adds: “I believe that life is a collection of experiences, about embracing the diversity of mindset (while acknowledging differences of opinion) and having those unexpected moments that only arise in live scenarios. These are the real visceral influences that help stimulate creativity and guide our future.” When it comes to looking back on 2021, he says, “I want to ensure the approach taken to team, colleagues, family and the person on the street has sought to do this with positivity and fun at its core.”</p>
<p>In summary, King says, “If we focus on flexibility and enhancing risk-adjusted return, in the long run we should be able to navigate any changes that come our way – be it in regulation, in the economic landscape or within our business – while also having fun on the journey, wherever it leads.”</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="libor-transition">LIBOR transition</h4>
<p>Another topic facing treasurers in the coming year is the transition away from LIBOR. While the transition to LIBOR alternatives – such as the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD – is due to be completed by the end of 2021, many treasurers have yet to prepare for the switch.</p>
<p>“Transitioning from LIBOR is complex and will require a considerable amount of time and effort from corporates,” says Deloitte’s Sharman. “Alongside the commercial impacts of direct and indirect exposures, treasurers will need to understand the new pricing conventions in order to assess the cost of new products and identify any differences that would impact risk management strategy.”</p>
<p>When it comes to specifics, Sharman says that debt financing will be widely impacted, along with hedging strategies, KPIs and ratios. “Scenario modelling should enable proactive decision making and the formation and execution of a transition plan – including negotiation with bank counterparties.”</p>
<h4 id="sustainability-and-esg">Sustainability and ESG</h4>
<p>Meeting sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) objectives had been expected to be a major theme in 2020 – and despite the disruption brought by the pandemic, this has proven to be the case, not least because the shift to home working has helped accelerate the move away from paper-based processes.</p>
<p>Treasury Today’s 2020 Global Sustainability Study found that for 61% of respondents, sustainability is reflected in the organisation’s core values, while 81% said that their companies have a sustainability ‘champion’. That said, sustainability still represents a small portion of the overall workload where treasury is concerned. The survey found that 63% of treasury teams devote less than 10% of their time to sustainability issues – although as one respondent commented, “Sustainability issues will take up a higher portion of future activities – we are still in the early days.”</p>
<p>Likewise, ESG and sustainability are a major area of focus for financial institutions. Citi’s Smith says that the bank’s initiatives in this area include financing wind farms from the bank’s trade organisation, building ‘sustainable’ supply chains for financing, as well as the ‘Priceless Planet’ partnership with MasterCard to channel fee revenues from travel spend into a reforestation programme. “This also links into digital, and making sure that we can move away from paper statements, large amounts of documentation and wet signatures,” he adds. “We are really encouraged by the number of our clients embracing that, and working with us in partnership to drive it forward.”</p>
<p>Beyond these initiatives, Smith says there are “more exciting things to come”, including a focus on expanding the bank’s ESG investment portfolio. “We already support a lot of ESG money market fund investments, but that could potentially lead into ESG-compliant deposits that link the appropriate assets on the balance sheets into ESG assets,” he explains.</p>
<p>And it’s clear that corporations are looking closely at how banks are approaching this topic. BofA’s Iraola says that the bank is participating in an RFP with a global client, which has already included two stages focusing on the company’s business capabilities and technical requirements. For the third round, the company has requested a two-hour discussion about the bank’s ESG strategies and philosophies.</p>
<p>“They’ve already heard about ESG from a capability standpoint, but now they want to know that if they decide to work with us, they will have a partner that is completely aligned with their philosophy from an ESG perspective,” says Iraola. “We are delighted with this evolution, which shows how the ESG agenda is becoming even more relevant from a global treasurer’s perspective.”</p>
<h4 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h4>
<p>The events of the past year have brought significant challenges for treasurers – but they have also prompted treasurers to accelerate process improvement and digitisation initiatives which should leave treasury teams better equipped to tackle the year ahead. And while COVID-19 is sure to continue dominating the agenda for some time to come, treasurers will have plenty of additional challenges to focus on in 2021, including LIBOR reform, the post-Brexit European trade landscape and the continuing focus on ESG and sustainability.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="tell-us-about-your-current-role-and-your-journey-here">Tell us about your current role and your journey here.</h4>


I manage the financial resources of <a href="https://mindsmatterseattle.org/">Minds Matter Seattle</a>, overseeing various initiatives including budgeting, forecasting, endowment planning, fundraising, grants and sponsorships. I fully believe that the work we do here has real long-term social value, supporting students from low-income families and preparing them for college.


<p>Education has always been important to me. Having grown up in the Philippines, a developing nation, and starting my career in the country’s central bank, I had a first-hand macroeconomic view of some of the nation’s biggest challenges. Being based in Manila, a densely-populated city where poverty is an elevated factor, I could see that one of its root causes was lack of access to formal education. This confines many talented individuals to a state of poverty.</p>
<p>During my five-year term with the central bank, I decided to make a difference. It was inspiring that within the treasury department I was helping the broader economy by managing the bank’s reserves and undertaking FX and open market operations. But I also wanted to help the nation at the level where individuals directly experience poverty.</p>
<p>I found myself volunteering as a mentor within the non-profit Pathways to Higher Education. It identifies talented but financially underprivileged high school students, helping to equip them with the necessary academic and soft skills to become future leaders, who can help positively transform the nation. </p>
<p>I moved to the US to pursue a graduate degree at MIT, eventually moving to Seattle and joining the technology sector before moving on to become Treasury Manager at Expedia Group.</p>
<p>At some point I knew I wanted to find an avenue where I could contribute my professional skills and continue making a difference to society. Joining Minds Matter was an obvious choice, its mission very much aligned with that of Pathways. </p>
<h4 id="what-would-you-say-to-other-financial-professionals-considering-a-volunteer-role">What would you say to other financial professionals considering a volunteer role?</h4>
<p>Many professionals have had the time under lockdown to think of moving towards a position that gives something back. As one who has made that move, I would say this. In your profession, it’s great if you enjoy your job; it’s even better if you find meaning in it. If you can combine the two, you will find much fulfilment</p>.


<p>Achieving fulfilment does not necessarily demand leaving the for-profit sector. Volunteering professional services – especially, in the current economic environment, by those with financial expertise – is very much welcomed by organisations in the non-profit sector. With treasurers being uniquely skilled to fill a void that many such organisations face as they come to terms with the financial fallout of the pandemic, maybe it is time for you to make a difference.</p>
<p><em>The full version of this interview, including how Ken Bugayong is helping Minds Matter tackle the funding gap, will be available in the September/October edition of Treasury Today.</em></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="what-brought-you-to-treasury">What brought you to treasury?</h4>
<p>I started off in the oil and gas sector as a Petroleum Engineer at Schlumberger Oil Field in the Gulf of Mexico. At the time, I wasn’t even aware of treasury as a potential field. I rose to the top of the engineering ranks in five years and decided to go to business school to develop my growing interest in corporate finance.</p>
<p>I had every intention to come back to the oil and gas sector after my MBA, but during my studies I learned that a finance role can be industry agnostic. I searched for and selected a strong corporate finance programme at Pfizer, which rotated candidates through various finance departments – one of which was the treasury team in Dublin, Ireland. I was really hooked. The main draw was treasury’s combination of analytics and technology, both areas of interest for me.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-and-your-team-anticipate-and-tackle-some-of-the-key-challenges-of-today">How do you and your team anticipate and tackle some of the key challenges of today?</h4>
<p>I take the professional challenge of keeping Takeda’s treasury excited about the team’s direction very seriously. I manage this in a number of ways. The first is to secure agreement as a team to continue to strive for improvement in systems and processes, while acknowledging that there is not an end-state at which we will stop completely. This ensures that there is a steady stream of projects to work on that stretch the team beyond their day jobs. I believe a learning team is an engaged team. 
Secondly, I direct the team to plan and model many more transactions than are actually being executed. For capital markets and risk management, this keeps team members on their toes and reduces the chance of missing a fleeting market opportunity. We also try and rotate the team members across treasury to keep developing everyone.</p>
<p>Finally, I ensure the team often goes out to meet other treasury teams in order to benchmark themselves against the best in class. I have discovered that when we get a chance to meet external treasury teams, we get to see new fact patterns and new treasury solutions deployed in other industries. This allows a new perspective on how things can be done differently, and why certain industries tend to deploy particular treasury solutions.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-some-of-the-necessary-skills-for-a-treasurer-to-have">What are some of the necessary skills for a treasurer to have?</h4>
<p>Other than the necessity of having a facility with numbers and a penchant for analytics, there are a few things that are common amongst successful treasury professionals. The first is having an attention to detail. Many treasury activities are so unforgiving to mistakes that someone who just likes to ‘think the big picture’ would have a hard time succeeding. This is not a role for poets and cartoonists – no offence to poets and cartoonists!</p>
<p>I’ve also found that the most successful treasury professionals are a little paranoid and risk averse. Corporate treasury is partly a risk management role and therefore unsuitable for risk-seekers and day-traders. Successful treasury professionals spend their time worrying about low probability but high-impact, black swan events and planning around them. They sweat more in peace so they bleed less in a war.</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s really important to be good at explaining complex concepts in a simple manner, especially as you grow in your career and need to speak with senior management who may not have a treasury background. Couching your message in treasury-speak is a sure way to lose credibility fast. 
What are the main lessons you’ve learnt throughout your career?</p>
<p>Firstly, it is very hard to progress in your career by simply doing your current job well. You need to constantly improve yourself and strive for more responsibilities. In order to stand out, you need to go beyond your current role, learn new things, ask for new projects, develop financial modelling skills and build a general aura of credibility around yourself. In other words, bite off more than you can chew – and then chew it anyway. </p>
<p>Also, hard-working team players trump individual superstars, every time. And lastly, more projects fail due to poor communication than for any other reason. There is no such thing as ‘over communication’. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-professional-background-and-the-role-that-you-have-right-now">Could you tell us a little about your professional background and the role that you have right now?</h4>
<p>As the Head of Cash Management for BNP Paribas in Asia Pacific, I am responsible for the bank’s cash management business, from product growth strategy, business/P&amp;L; development, to execution and risk management, across 12 markets; from India on the Western side of the region to Japan in the Far East. Prior to joining BNP Paribas in 2018, I had more than 20 years of experience in transaction banking, across sales, product and P&amp;L.; I have worked in China, India and Singapore, which is my home.</p>
<h4 id="tell-me-about-your-journey-since-taking-on-your-role-at-the-bank">Tell me about your journey since taking on your role at the bank?</h4>
<p>My two years with BNP Paribas have been very fulfilling. The bank has a resilient business model, with a very rich client franchise and a strong network to deploy this franchise. We are truly a market leader in cash management in Europe, with a strong aspiration to be a top player in our chosen APAC segments. For this ambition, we have made significant progress in the last two years in deploying a cash management model that’s catering to the changing needs of our clients in the region. We have deployed a cash product strategy that is a hybrid between building our own, and co-creation with our clients and partners. This model has helped us to be quick and agile in responding to client requirements, by reducing time-to-market.</p>
<h4 id="how-have-you-and-your-clients-been-coping-with-the-global-pandemic">How have you and your clients been coping with the global pandemic?</h4>
<p>Our clients’ experience through the pandemic has been very much dependent on their industry sectors. Clients who operate in the sectors that are deeply impacted have reshaped their businesses to cater to essential services, while sectors that have seen higher demand have faced a positive challenge of coping with the demand and preparing their supply chain and payments accordingly.</p>
<p>To a great extent, our client engagement strategy has been very much driven by these factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For clients who have switched to essential services, we extend support in managing their cash management activities, with strong business continuity and good service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For clients who needed to expand their supply chain, our solutions cater to core cash management needs along with e-commerce, internet of things and technology such as API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the core focus for our clients has been on liquidity management, counterparty risk management, business continuity while working from home, and rapid adoption of digital technology.</p>
<h4 id="have-there-been-any-learning-experiences-you-might-like-to-share-from-the-past-few-months">Have there been any learning experiences you might like to share from the past few months?</h4>
<p>There have been a number of learning points in the last few months, to highlight a few:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Working from home – this has been a big transformation for everyone, both corporates and banks. We have experienced and learnt the need for rapid adoption of digital technology and having contingency measures in place within a short period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change in business models – with the different lockdowns that took place around the region, there was a rapid migration from paper to electronic, and from contact to contactless business activity. This positioned us well, given the investments we had made in accessing all the new payment platforms around the region and also establishing global partnerships to support e-commerce and alternate payment channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digitalisation of treasury – which has multiple aspects of how clients are running their treasury centres from home, including cash forecasting, reporting, reconciliation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-will-the-rest-of-2020-have-in-store-for-you-professionally-are-there-any-specific-projects-or-plans-you-might-like-to-outline-for-us">What will the rest of 2020 have in store for you professionally, are there any specific projects or plans you might like to outline for us?</h4>
<p>Our strategy is very clear: while we work with our clients to help them through these extraordinary events, we continue to focus on achieving our longer-term vision to be a leading cash management bank in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we will continue to deploy our investments and solutions to our global client franchise, eg multinational clients operating in Asia Pacific and Asian clients expanding into Europe. We continue to empower our people to bring innovative and client-centric solutions to clients in a fast-evolving business environment and offer a service delivery platform that sits in the front office, which allows us to manage the quality of our client interactions.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="why-is-learning-and-adaptability-so-important-to-you">Why is learning and adaptability so important to you?</h4>
<p>Throughout my career, I have learnt many important lessons, not least to step out of my comfort zone in order to achieve greater things. I never want to miss an opportunity to learn. But I also acknowledge the importance of social interaction for knowledge progression, and recognise that treasurers must also now be socially adept.</p>
<p>Formally, I have a bachelor’s degree in Business and Finance from ICHEC Brussels Management School, and certification from European Federation of Financial Analysts but I also believe that discussing interests with peers at seminars and conferences is a great source of knowledge for anyone in this profession.</p>
<p>There is a real need today too, to grasp how disparate elements, such as regulation and technology, impact treasury’s response to business needs. We all work hard, but it’s important to know that what is taking most of our energy will actually add value to our corporate strategy.</p>
<p>There’s no use wasting resources on something nobody cares about, but our effort should not be focused on highly visible projects alone. It can be something for which you know no one will say thank you, but you also know it is an important step towards a greater achievement.</p>
<p>I’ve never let my ego drive career moves and have declined some opportunities that did not offer the chance to learn or progress. It’s important for me always to understand what value the role brings today and tomorrow.</p>
<h4 id="you-are-an-acknowledged-technophile-why-is-technology-so-important-in-treasury">You are an acknowledged technophile. Why is technology so important in treasury?</h4>
<p>Keeping up with the right developments can be a challenge but there is no magic here; I just have a natural curiosity about technology in the treasury environment. But it’s important to understand firstly, there is no one technology that will resolve all of treasury’s issues. Secondly, for treasury purposes, every solution needs to demonstrate its value-add, and even then its adoption depends on where the company is on its technology journey. The most sophisticated technology solution can’t be effective unless you’ve done your homework to clean, manage and connect your data.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most talked about new technologies is AI, but it is not for everyone. My team doesn’t manage payments and collections, and we are not in charge of detailed cash forecasting, so I see fewer opportunities for AI at this stage. However, I certainly believe that for cash forecasting, AI could be a very powerful tool, with also strong potential in FX management.</p>
<p>The other mainstay of techy conversations right now is blockchain. On the bank side, especially in trade finance, I see strong possibilities. Honeywell is no stranger to the concept; we are already using a blockchain-based platform to manage multiple suppliers and sales of components of our aerospace division.</p>
<p>When we see a new technology, it’s important that we assess its advantages and disadvantages and find out precisely where it can help. For me, technology for the sake of it is a wrong direction; it must have a purpose, and that purpose must ultimately benefit the wider business.</p>
<p>Treasury is seen as an entry portal by many technology providers and I think we, as treasurers, must now be the catalyst for progress, giving options to other departments, trying to resolve their problems, breaking down silos and being ambassadors for a new approach.</p>
<p>The full interview can be read in the July/August edition of Treasury Today.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="describe-your-career-path">Describe your career path</h4>
<p>I started as an intern at Indian conglomerate, Larsen &amp; Toubro. I worked directly under the treasurer at the time and it sparked my interest in corporate treasury. I then had four years outside of treasury, and then L&amp;T; Infotech, a Larsen &amp; Toubro company, had a vacancy for a Treasury Executive.</p>
<p>Within five years I rose to become Treasury Manager, after which I moved to SOTC Travel Ltd as Head of Treasury. Five years after that, in May 2020 I left the company to pursue start-ups of my own: Success Valley and Beyond Abilities.</p>
<h4 id="what-did-you-enjoy-most-about-corporate-treasury">What did you enjoy most about corporate treasury?</h4>
<p>I always made a point of working on projects that fall outside of the remit of treasury, such as spearheading the establishment of a division for currency exchange. I headed the set-up of this by entering into agreements with service providers, negotiating rates and establishing agreements for currency purchase, getting the people in the department, and just basically getting things going from the ground up.</p>
<p>My favourite treasury function though is financial modelling. I actually devised quite a few financial models in my various roles, including cash flow projection models and calculation models. There was no treasury software available at the time either, so I had to do them all on Excel spreadsheets. But that did give me a lot of valuable hands-on experience in financial modelling for treasury and is part of the reason I find it so gratifying.</p>
<h4 id="how-have-you-noticed-the-role-of-the-treasurer-evolving-over-the-last-few-years">How have you noticed the role of the treasurer evolving over the last few years?</h4>
<p>It’s definitely becoming a more executive function, and the modern treasurer is now up with the CEO and CFO as a decision-making partner. There are several factors responsible for this, such as regulations evolving and becoming tighter, and the increasing use of a wider range of metrics to evaluate the merits of the business.</p>
<p>For me in India, the country has it’s own insolvency and bankruptcy code that came into place after 2008, so treasury became a much more specialised function. It was no longer a small function limited to one department within the organisation and called upon whenever a banker was demanded. Instead it became central to the running of the organisation.</p>
<p>It’s also evolved with the introduction of more technology. The future is tech, and when I joined a treasury, I made sure that making the case for automation was really high on my agenda. It means that treasurers don’t spend a lot of time on time-consuming, manual processes and can instead focus on innovation, franchising and becoming a truly strategic partner to the business.</p>
<h4 id="how-has-being-a-female-in-a-traditionally-male-orientated-world-impacted-your-career">How has being a female in a traditionally male-orientated world impacted your career?</h4>
<p>There’s often a ‘men only’ culture in corporations. The main one is the smoking sessions that happens every day outside the office building. Men gather and smoke, and typically women would be excluded from that – especially if they’re non-smokers. I think a lot of women can relate to this globally as well, as it happens at so many companies.</p>
<p>These sessions are so valuable for informal bonding between colleagues. It doesn’t happen as often anymore though, and the feedback I receive about the diversity and inclusion space is extremely encouraging now.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-some-of-the-key-skills-a-treasurer-needs-to-be-successful">What are some of the key skills a treasurer needs to be successful?</h4>
<p>Soft skills, for sure. The ability to listen is so important for negotiations, and the ability to understand other people is necessary for forming and maintaining relationships both outside and within the organisation.</p>
<p>An obvious one is attention to detail, and being able to think quickly. Market numbers can change every second, currency fluctuates every second, stock rates are fluctuating, commodity prices are fluctuating, and so sometimes decisions need to be made incredibly quickly.</p>
<p>A key one for me has also been understanding that a mistake isn’t something we need punishment for, but rather an opportunity to learn. That’s actually been my biggest life takeaway from corporate treasury.</p>
<p>The full version of this interview will be available in the July/August edition of Treasury Today Asia.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4>How would you characterise the current environment for businesses?</h4>
<p>This is an unprecedented time for us all but even amongst the dire situations in which many find themselves, there can be a silver lining. Whilst many corporates have already started adopting what they perceive to be the ‘new normal’, the immediate focus naturally shifted towards ensuring business continuity. This has seen most trying to understand the impact of various risks on their businesses, and taking those critical steps in managing the disruptions that have been caused by COVID-19.</p>
<p>As the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt around the world, the need is for all to take a measured approach. This time will pass but it is critical for businesses to remain connected with all of their stakeholders, including customers and employees. This can only really be achieved through the adoption of digitalisation at the core of the business.</p>
<p>Most corporates will have been super-sensitised to the power of technology in such critical and unexpected situations as we are experiencing now. This is the silver lining. COVID-19 has delivered a critical learning, that organisation-wide digitalisation and automation can be highly effective when adopting a holistic approach. In fact, I believe technology will be the only way businesses will be able to fight pandemic situations in the future, enabling us to be always prepared for unimaginable risks.</p>
<h4>What in particular do you believe the current crisis will change or accelerate, in terms of how we work and the technologies we adopt?</h4>
<p>There was a world pre-WWII and there is the world post-WWII. COVID-19 is the life-changing event of our lifetime. The post-COVID world will be revolutionised to the same extent; a new normal will be seen.</p>
<p>I strongly believe our world will be totally different afterwards. Working style and behaviours – everything will change. It will be less ‘physical’ and more ‘virtual’. It will be less paper-oriented and more digitised. Companies will prioritise mandates to upgrade process automation, and there will be faster decision-making with regards to the adoption of digitalisation, especially for critical operations. In particular, we will see rapid innovation around the use of blockchain, AI and machine learning.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury has transformed in the last few years into a more strategic function. For some, it has even become a profit centre. But there is still more than 80% of corporates worldwide that are dependent on manual methods for treasury and trade finance management. Considering the critical role of treasury, and the risks of not attending to its effective operation, its digitalisation should become a priority for today’s CFOs.</p>
<h4>How should treasurers be planning for the future fitness of their organisations?</h4>
<p>This is one of the most critical times of the professional treasurer’s life; overnight, the role in the organisation became much more important. It now falls upon the treasurer’s shoulders to further drive corporate treasury towards technology adoption for future security.</p>
<p>With the right treasury and risk systems in place, evaluating the financial risks created by the current pandemic would have been a lot easier, especially where these systems have been integrated with other data sources and core systems, such as ERPs and trading platforms, across the organisation.</p>
<p>In essence, immediate visibility of the right data becomes the most powerful decision-support system for the CxO. The need therefore to automate the whole area of strategy and risk management should now have become abundantly clear for any corporation’s treasury department.</p>
<p>Ultimately, humans have become the most adaptive of species. Tough times come and go, and so shall this. But we need to ensure we fully absorb the learnings each time if we are to prepare for the future. The ‘silver-lining’ lesson from COVID-19 is that the digitalisation and automation of corporate treasury operations is the way to ensure business continuity in the time of need.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading">How COVID-19 has sharpened the focus on liquidity and client support</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Could you introduce yourself please and tell us a little about your background and how you arrived at the role that you have today at Kyriba?</h4>
<p>I am a Director of Product at Kyriba and have been in the fintech industry for almost 12 years. I began my career consulting in professional services and have held various roles, from overseeing implementations to product marketing. In my last role, the primary focus was helping clients understand and manage foreign exchange risk. At Kyriba that focus continues, but FX is part of a greater end-to-end risk management approach, allowing our clients to manage the entire lifecycle of currency risk. It is an essential component of our clients’ holistic cash and liquidity management strategies.</p>
<p>Prior to fintech, I worked in business and went through graduate school studying entrepreneurship. It’s interesting how that sort of background can help with growth and strategic positioning, not only in how we help our clients be more successful, but also with how we manage our products and organisation so we can be proactive and agile as we navigate in a quickly changing market.</p>
<p>My interest in innovation and customer satisfaction led me to product management. This role allows me to leverage my business background and relationship with clients to help guide our product roadmap and development. It is Product’s responsibility to ensure we are building the right technology to assist our clients to more easily solve their everyday treasury challenges.</p>
<h4>Looking back over your career to date, how have you seen your space in the industry evolve?</h4>
<p>The biggest change that I’ve seen over the last decade is practitioners moving from asking, ‘why should I use technology?’ to ‘how can I modernise my processes using the technology?’</p>
<p>It’s about more than automation, CFOs and treasurers are demanding the ability to access real-time data with precision, including visibility and controls. I think the evolution of technology has helped with that, but it also has to do with the approach that treasury organisations are taking from a strategic perspective. They are proving to be a much more valuable asset to the organisation when they are consulting with and providing better information to the CFO. Treasury is definitely becoming more sophisticated and there is a much stronger desire to own and drive processes to lead continuous improvements across organisations.</p>
<p>Not only that, it has become less acceptable for organisations to make delayed decisions with incomplete or inaccurate data. For example, there has been an industry trend to move to immediate precision in cash forecasting. The fact that technology gives everyone access to a significant amount of quality information in real time, means there is little excuse for ill-informed projections or decisions any longer. CFOs and boards are expecting more from their teams. Our technology allows practitioners to better understand their cash conversion cycles and FX exposure to enable better decisions, market standards I expect to continue well into the future.</p>
<h4>How have the last few months with the pandemic affected your work and your clients?</h4>
<p>As a cloud-based company, Kyriba was able to quickly move our workforce completely online and remotely. We had the security and the infrastructure in place and we had the people and the processes to make the change practically overnight.</p>
<p>Over the last few months we’ve tailored the entire organisation to prioritise our clients’ needs, providing additional training, improving the quality of our operations and breadth of product offerings. It’s been great to be able to pivot to ensure that we are providing the best support that we can to our clients. I think part of that is, of course, having the necessary technology in place to be able to do that very quickly. Although that’s important all the time, when we’re going through a time of crisis like we are now it becomes even more critical.</p>
<p>From an FX side we’ve seen incredible volatility over the last couple of months. Talking with our clients, many of their exposures have increased too. Interestingly enough, there are opportunities that come with volatility. With the current interest rates, some organisations have modified their hedging programmes to create significant positive returns. It is a bit of a silver lining for organisations who, in other ways, may be struggling.</p>
<p>For us, volatility means the importance and value of cloud-based technology increases. More people are reaching out to talk about how to leverage our platform when their manual processes are failing. What they could get by with before isn’t sustainable with everyone trying to work remotely. From a product perspective, it is rewarding knowing we provide something that is truly helpful, given everything that’s happening in the market.</p>
<h4>Is there any advice that you can offer the community as they make their own plans and try to face whatever challenges there may be as we roll out the rest of 2020?</h4>
<p>Volatility is obviously going to continue. We can’t predict how long it will last at this level, so it is important for organisations to empower people and put processes in place to handle the unknown, allowing them to be proactive and agile to deal with the changes that are coming from a near and long-term perspective.</p>
<p>And it’s no secret there’s been a significant increase in cybercrime in the current environment, so tightening up your security processes and utilising technology to be able to better manage processes and roles with proper approvals is critical. Treasury teams working remotely need to use best practices to ensure they are not increasing exposure to payments fraud.</p>
<p>Emailing critical data, having a single point of payment approval, or no ability to screen payments, put companies at risk. And it’s not just the screening, but the fact that you are screening against what is supposed to be happening that matters. Anything that an organisation can do on that side can actually save millions in fraud-related losses.</p>
<p>Not only that, continuing to think about leadership and collaboration within the organisation and how different areas can help each other will allow companies to more comfortably weather this storm. Treasury, payments, procurement, FP&amp;A; working together with the CFO’s leadership should produce more value to the organisation. Although the natural tendency may be to focus efforts on our own daily activities, working together to look for improvements cross-functionally will likely bring about better results than you may be able to deliver on our own.</p>
<p>Finally, consider your vendors as partners, let us help you leverage technology to get through this and future crises that will inevitably happen. We can work together to understand your goals and help move your organisation from a mentality of fear and reactiveness to one of empowerment, knowing that you have the information and ability to make decisions to help your CFO be successful and your company to persevere through difficult times.</p>
<h4>Can you share a strong personal or professional inspiration that you draw strength from in your career?</h4>
<p>What motivates me personally is the opportunity to be able to help people, it’s the philanthropic side of business. Our technology allows organisations to cut costs, generate revenue and create operational efficiencies. This allows our clients to do their jobs better and frees up time and capital for executing strategic missions.</p>
<p>Most of the organisations that we work with around the globe are dedicated to improving the lives of others in one way or another. By helping them grow and protect their cash we help organisations improve their bottom line, allowing them to expand their workforce and investments in local economies. In addition to generating revenue it’s about being able to help companies give back to build a better future together.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>What’s your current role?</h4>
<p>Today I have responsibility for developing solutions that enable sales financing. Working with our banking partners, the team sits at the heart of the Microsoft customer payment offering across an area covering Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and large swathes of Asia. It’s a region that can loosely be categorised as ‘developing and emerging markets’, where adoption of more standardised financing solutions is not always possible.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s stated aim is to reach every person on the planet. With rising demand for innovative solutions in many of these territories, we are facilitating that growth, ensuring commercial customers have the right funding solutions available to them when they need them.</p>
<h4>Is the regional financial services sector delivering the right customer solutions?</h4>
<p>I feel that there is a lack of pace at which some domestic financial institutions have shown in keeping up with technology. This is most evident in how customers expect to transact with those institutions, and the speed with which credit risk approvals are handled.</p>
<p>Technology is progressing rapidly in the payments space, and it will continue to accelerate with the development of telecoms technology and the emergence of 5G. But I believe that it is just unacceptable now for any customer – retail or corporate – to be in a state where they cannot send a payment instruction virtually on mobile, or not be able to receive confirmations in real-time.</p>
<p>We build and offer customers new real-time technologies, only for those customers to face downstream process delays. The need to pick up the pace at every touch point is essential if customers are to experience the fast and smooth execution they want and need.</p>
<p>I believe that the emergence of the fintech community is forcing the progress within financial institutions. Within the GFS team, we are driven to keep up the pace and cut transaction times with every one of our partners, including the banks. And those that make the cut are encouraged to constantly explore and deliver solutions as rapidly as is possible.</p>
<h4>Describe how you became an award winner</h4>
<p>We collected the Treasury Today Adam Smith Award in 2019 for Best in Class Treasury Solution in the Middle East. Through the Microsoft GFS group, an innovative solution was developed that allows customers, when purchasing via resellers, to make monetary commitments to the Microsoft cloud, and simultaneously sign-up for extended, multi-year payment terms backed by our banking partner.</p>
<p>This is an innovative trade finance solution, using non-recourse assignment of receivables and is combined with the Microsoft sales offering to customers who purchase cloud products from any of our resellers. I see the end result effectively removing friction from purchases, kicking in even before a deal has closed. We no longer think of it simply as a working capital solution; we now organise the whole structure of receivables and payables flows as a sales-enabling tool.</p>
<h4>Is technology an essential part of the industry now?</h4>
<p>For those just starting out in their career in corporate finance and treasury, I not only advise familiarisation with the latest technologies, but also encourage them to go further and learn coding for applications in the worlds of AI, machine learning and data analytics, for example. Our environment continues to become more automated. Having a basic grasp of coding will be a valuable asset for anyone coming into this space now.</p>
<p>At a more general level, with all this technology, there is one factor that is often ignored by younger people which most experienced professionals agree is vital. It’s achieving an acceptable work/life balance. To me, this means moving away from the traditional ‘9 to 5’ regime and embracing flexibility. Mobile technology means we can be ‘always on’ if we allow it to go unchecked, but it also means we can manage the time as we wish within our working day. To me, work/life balance now means being able to use my time in ways that I want to. I’ve learnt to use technology to be more effective and productive.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Tell us how you came to your current role</h4>
<p>I’ve worked in treasury for my whole career, and I kind of fell into it by accident. When I graduated in 2003/2004, the economy wasn’t doing especially well. Like many fresh graduates at the time, my preference was to work for a bank. Since the banks were not really hiring, I ended up joining the treasury of shipping firm BW Group.</p>
<p>I was there for four years and then moved on to Cargill, first as an FX trader, then as a Treasury Advisor. I had a front row seat for the 2008 global financial crisis, I saw how liquidity dried up, how funding between banks dried up, and how the Australian commercial paper market dried up. Observing how the senior treasurers in the firm reacted to these challenges taught me that strong liquidity management ensures survival in tumultuous periods, and I carried this understanding through to my later roles.</p>
<p>I went on to be the Asia Treasurer at Mercuria Energy Trading S.A., where I had the opportunity to actually set up an Asia Treasury. I was involved in setting up regional liquidity structures and long-term funding for the group in Asia, and I managed in excess of 30-40 banking relationships. I had to understand what each bank was looking for and how to work with numerous banks. That was fairly early on in my career, and it helped significantly in terms of completing my profile as a treasurer.</p>
<p>In 2016, I took a break from the corporate world and worked as an independent consultant. That gave me the experience of doing business without a big corporate brand backing me. I then joined JERAGM in 2017, with the primary goal of establishing a treasury and trade finance function.</p>
<h4>What would you say have been the most valuable lessons you have learnt in your career to date?</h4>
<p>Aside from learning that strong liquidity management is key to survival, after witnessing the global financial crisis and then the oil price crash in 2014/2015, a key lesson I learned was the importance of banking relationships. During the oil crash, I diversified banking relationships to focus on more regional banks, which were relatively less exposed to commodity markets and understood Asia better.</p>
<p>The recent decrease in globalisation and the growing trend towards protectionism and nationalism is only adding complexity to doing business. Asia is not only a big market, but it’s also very diverse in terms of its regulatory and legal environments, and it makes doing business more difficult comparted to ten-15 years ago. Because of this, the ‘one size fits all’ banking solution simply doesn’t work anymore.</p>
<p>For example, large international banks are reporting poorer results and are taking a step back from the international market. Various European banks, in particular, are cutting their presence in the international market and focusing on their home countries, and then more local and regional banks are stepping up to fill some of these spaces. Are these banks definitely going to fill the shoes of the big international banks? Perhaps not. It just means that we have to work with local and regional banks much more, as well as leveraging on the benefits that international banks can offer the business.</p>
<h4>What personal skills does a successful treasury professional need?</h4>
<p>Treasury professionals must be inquisitive to ensure a successful career. Treasury is so diverse and it’s important to work at understanding both the business and the competition. As treasury professionals, we need to be versatile, we need to be resourceful, and we need to have intellectual curiosity to understand what’s going on within the firm.</p>
<p>Across all the roles I’ve had, I’ve found that you need to have a genuine interest in the world economy and the financial markets – and more indirectly, in the inner workings of the systems. That means looking at risk management systems and the accounting systems; asking how risk is being managed and how the middle office assesses those risks. This interest is what allows treasurers to gain insight into how best approach a range of tasks.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Tell us how you came to your current role</h4>
<p>In my early career, I trained as a lawyer, and worked on corporate finance transactions, focused on high yield debt and IPOs. After the cycle turned, this evolved into structured finance, and I joined Citi in this capacity. After several years in this business, I was given the opportunity to run the corporate bank in Japan, which I did two and a half years before moving to Hong Kong to manage the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<h4>Could you outline the nature of your current role? What sort of things are keeping you on your toes?</h4>
<p>I’m still pretty new in this role, so just about everything is keeping me on my toes at the moment!</p>
<p>My current role is global. I’m responsible for client strategy and execution across the corporate and public sector client sets. There are two main things we focus on: first is thinking about what solutions we can devise and deliver to our clients that will enable the treasury suite to become a better business partner to their front office. Second – this is the more traditional part of Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) – devising innovative, tailored and forward-looking solutions for the usual funding, liquidity, risk management aspects of treasury responsibilities. This is so we can help our clients future-proof within the treasury suite.</p>
<p>In addition to current events, what keeps me on my toes the most now is the sheer amount of innovation that’s happening – both within this industry and within Citi specifically. Our clients are remarkable sources of innovation themselves, and frankly we’re often lucky that they come to us with ideas and want to partner on those efforts.</p>
<h4>How have your previous roles prepared you for this new one and the world of TTS?</h4>
<p>Fundamentally, I’ve learned two things that I think are relevant.</p>
<p>One is that you really have to understand your clients. You have to know your clients’ business at a very deep level, understand what their goals are, what they think their opportunity set is, what they’re worried about. And then you have to take that and put it into the context in which they’re operating, and come back with insights and solutions and great execution. I think if you can do that then you’ll deliver every time.</p>
<p>The second is that you have to take care of your people. Everything to do with the bank, the technology or real estate or connectivity, it all pales in comparison to the talent that delivers those insights, that can create those solutions, and that delivers the best execution. That’s what makes all the difference.</p>
<h4>How do you think the current geopolitical issues are influencing the work that you’re doing, and at Citi as a whole?</h4>
<p>To talk about the geopolitical environment, you have to start by taking one giant step back, and start with what are we seeing in the macro environment – what are the consequences of that to our clients, and therefore to our business?</p>
<p>In the case of the coronavirus, we operate in every major market that has been affected, and so we’ve had to develop our own approaches to this. Clients are seeking our guidance because of our global presence. One aspect that strikes me, is the opportunity to use technology. We’ve been using video-conferencing at higher levels and I think it’s causing a re-think of how we do what we do. Clients have also been very receptive to it; we’ve had roadshows that have been conducted entirely virtually.</p>
<p>You also have a unique combination right now, where there is this explosion of popular sentiment around the world that is resulting in different political outcomes than we’ve had in the past.</p>
<p>The combination of those two forces is creating uncertainty, and our clients are finding that this is creating a lot of volatility for their businesses in ways that they just had not expected and had not experienced before.</p>
<p>So, I think it’s been a highly uncertain time but also a time for our bankers to really step in and deliver the solutions and advice that our clients need at times like this.</p>
<h4>From a corporate treasury perspective, what do you believe the key themes will be for 2020?</h4>
<p>Leaving the coronavirus out of this one, I think there are essentially four key themes.</p>
<p>First, is the shift to real-time treasury, recognising that we’re increasingly operating in an ‘always on’ economy. We’ve been spending a lot of time devising solutions around that and understanding the best advice to give clients.</p>
<p>Second, is the theme of treasury as a partner to their business and the treasury as an enabler to the business.  I think the days of a treasurer being someone who solely funds the balance sheet and manages risk have long gone. We’ve been working on ways to position our treasury clients with solutions that enable them to be that partner to the front-end of the business, and I think that trend is durable and is here to stay.</p>
<p>Third, no shock here, is environmental, social, and governance strategies (ESG). What’s interesting about ESG in a treasury context though, is that treasury really is the place where companies are able to express themselves and their own agenda around ESG. Whether it be what sort of modes of funding someone chooses – be it a sustainability-linked loan or a green bond, or supply chain finance and the ability to establish sustainability all the way down through a supply chain – treasury is the place where a lot of the talk about ESG actually becomes a reality.</p>
<p>At Citi, we have committed to lend, invest and facilitate US$100bn over ten years (2014-2023) towards activities that reduce the impacts of climate change and create environmental solutions that benefit people and communities.</p>
<p>We are also working on environmentally positive business opportunities in partnership with our clients, developing solutions to some of our most pressing global challenges, such as climate change. Additionally, our environmental footprint and supply chain goals, updated as part of our Sustainable Progress Strategy, focus on minimising direct impacts, reducing costs and reflecting global best practices.</p>
<p>Fourth and last, is future-proofing treasury, and continuing to make sure that clients are in a state of constant reinvention and constant reconsideration of treasury processes and systems. Clients will be asking themselves, ‘are in-house banks still the right structures?’, ‘are existing liquidity and funding structures the right ones for the next five or ten years?’</p>
<p>Some of the efforts that we’re undertaking now are designed to improve their preparedness for that next set of changes that are surely coming. It is important to have a treasury that’s agile and that can respond to change effectively, so that it can perform not only its traditional functions but also be a true partner to the overall business.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Tell us how you got to your current position</h4>
<p>I have a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering and Computer Science, and my first roles were in banks in India which were specifically hiring for someone to streamline paper-based processes within areas including treasury and trade. I was then the first technology expert hired in treasury at global conglomerate Cargill as Treasury Manager. I joined Agrocorp last year as Head of Treasury and Capital Markets and so far, I’ve focused closely on optimising working capital.</p>
<h4>How have you utilised your extensive technological background in technology in your current role?</h4>
<p>About three years back, most of our processes were Excel-based. I saw this as an opportunity. Learning from my experience in other roles, not least of all how costly it can be to implement new systems, I’m looking to set up a new-age ERP system which can offer real-time tracking of every system.</p>
<p>The legacy system can only talk about if an invoice has been created – it won’t talk about whether it has been signed by the counterparty, or whether we have taken insurance on that commodity, or what is the status of the goods. Where commodity trading is concerned, ERPs only handle information once a trade is completed, meaning there is a distinct lack of insight on all the processes in between.</p>
<p>Agrocorp is currently in the process of implementing a new TMS, and I hope that the new system will be able to extract more information from the DLT platform, as well as providing a more real-time view of the company’s cash flows. We are spending a lot of time getting the processes right, and trying to loop in all that information from the DLT blockchain platform into our legacy system – from FX, risk, cash flow and funding standpoints – to get our TMS to give us a holistic picture.</p>
<h4>How do you look at issues around sustainability at Agrocorp?</h4>
<p>Agrocorp is a strong believer in sustainability, and the adoption of eco-friendly work practices is central in the execution of all work streams across its business. The partnership with DLT.SG supports our sustainability initiative as it allows us to bring the entire supply chain in an ecosystem using blockchain technology and application program interfaces (APIs) together, to fill the gap in supply chain networks, eg traceability and transparency.</p>
<p>With the blockchain functionality comes a seamless ability to identify, track and trace movements along the supply chain. At the same time, disclosure of data and information is enhanced. As sustainability becomes an increasingly popular area of interest for end customers, the sourcing of where products originate from has become a priority. This includes who we source from, when we source and what is actually sourced.</p>
<p>The blockchain platform addresses these concerns and provides visibility on how the end products (from plantation to finished product) to the end customers are actually traceable and proven sustainable. Blockchain provides a network of all the people involved in the supply chain to be digitally connected.</p>
<h4>What do you see for the future of treasury?</h4>
<p>I think innovation will be key to the future of capital markets. One of the key things we’re looking at for the next couple of years is that once digital bonds and the digital issuance of commercial papers become a reality, we may be able to attract global investors, reduce our cost of capital and have an ordered base of investors.</p>
<p>Where liquidity management is concerned, I think the complexity involved in dealing with multiple banks will be a key challenge to overcome in the future. When we deal with multiple banks – especially placing surplus funds in fixed deposits – there is no platform from which you can seek information from multiple banks on a real-time basis. I’m hoping that either the regulators or a consortium of banks will get together to change this. I want to see banks able to provide us with a deposit quote or an investment quote, on a platform, so that we can pick and choose.</p>
<p>For trade finance, I definitely think paperless processes are on the horizon. A lot of processes have been digitised already, but we haven’t seen some of the key players – such as the shipping agencies and the ports – becoming digital. But with pilots currently being conducted in various geographies, I’m hoping that it won’t be long before the entire industry becomes paperless.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Tell us how you got to your current position.</h4>
<p>I started life as a banker back in the early 1990s, following my early training as a graduate entrant at Barclays Bank on its management development programme. I was approached by Morgan Stanley (our client) and asked if I would consider moving into treasury.</p>
<p>I said I wasn’t interested because at that time I was thinking of moving out of banking for something completely different, possibly in marketing or publishing – but they assured me that the role was not just ‘more of the same’, but rather it was in their corporate treasury function, and they wanted me to come and check it out. I liked what I saw and took them up on the offer. I started out in the bank relations team, then sat my ACT exams and broadened out into different roles, to make sure I made the most of it as a career opportunity.</p>
<p>After Morgan Stanley was rescued during the 2008 financial crisis, I thought it was time to move on and so joined Old Mutual plc’s group treasury function in late 2009 as Head of Funding and Risk. The treasury department at holding company level was somewhat more ‘corporate’ in focus, and being based in its London head office I was involved in bond issuance and liability management for the first time which was a real kind of intellectual challenge. I was also in charge of the middle office function, monitoring daily treasury activities from a risk perspective.</p>
<p>When I was appointed at Small World, the company wanted to ensure that the treasury model was fit for purpose, as the business has grown extremely quickly through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth in recent years. So my primary focus has been looking at the treasury operations to ensure they are scalable as volumes grow, and to really make sure we are doing the best we possibly can for our customers.</p>
<h4>What are the main challenges you’re seeing with the rise of technology in treasury?</h4>
<p>Technology has certainly shifted up a gear with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and machine learning. But the sheer fact of life for most treasurers is that they are in a constant fight to get budget, to get not only the headcount but the systems to start implementing and leveraging those new opportunities.</p>
<p>I think the challenge for many treasurers today is still the need to actually get treasury issues in front of the board. It’s not unusual for companies to function adequately for many years without a treasurer, but then by the time they need one, they really need one – meaning projects need to be implemented in a hurry – so I truly wish that treasury was a better understood profession than it currently is.</p>
<p>The pace of change in technology development in this market is as much of a challenge as an opportunity; not least because of the risk of ending up with technology which quickly becomes out of date. The key is to keep listening and to stay connected to your treasury network because the market, particularly in payments and cash management, is moving so quickly that it’s hard to stay abreast of what the best solution is.</p>
<p>These decisions are a pain point for treasury, especially when most treasury teams are already fully engaged in managing ‘business as usual’ and when the environment may be completely different in six months’ time. I think that’s why you see so many companies go to consultancies.</p>
<h4>How do you see the payments technology landscape looking in the future?</h4>
<p>Banks, to some extent, have been slow to provide real-time payment solutions. By definition, ultimately real-time payments would mean the mechanisms of value transfer being available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and if there is a reluctance by banks to implement this availability then maybe it’s because they struggle with the same sort of issues that everyone else is dealing with – round-the-clock availability of staff and, crucially, of liquidity and collateral.</p>
<p>The current economic landscape isn’t helping the case for technology in treasury. I think we are in for a bit of a difficult time economically but, even if there is no global recession, companies are definitely cautious. If this sentiment continues in the long term then to me, it only exacerbates the need to get treasury better understood and ‘out there’ as a profession.</p>
<p>Lots of things happen in economic good times, such as the promotion of flexible working and other staff retention initiatives, as well as a willingness to invest in new technology such as AI, machine learning or a TMS. However, in cautious times, sadly investment can get pushed to the back burner, whether that is in people or systems. A recession would put many companies into survival mode.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>Tell us how you came to your current role.</h4>
<p>I came to my current role in 2015, after spending over 20 years in other transaction banking roles across Singapore, UK, China and Thailand. I used to use this phrase a fair bit in my China days, explaining the pace and rate of accelerated change in China ie “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”. I would say that my “single step” in transaction banking started in Singapore, and progressed thereafter to different regions and geographies. As with my journey, the world of transaction banking, and specifically cash management, continues to rapidly evolve, and that certainly brings along with it huge excitement and significant new opportunities.</p>
<h4>Could you outline the nature of your role? What types of things keep you on your toes at the moment?</h4>
<p>The nature of my role requires me to bring the best of HSBC’s cash management solutions to our clients across different regions, by leveraging our network and people across the countries we operate in, and the investments into new digitised treasury solutions. Many things keep me on my toes at the moment. However, what we are focused on is ensuring that our clients are constantly updated on new solutions that are relevant, for them to better enable treasury to become more strategic to their business units, instead of simply enabling operational treasury efficiency. With the many rapid changes occurring in Asia, specifically the evolution towards real-time payments, e-wallets, fintechs, new technologies such as blockchain, RPA for example, we need to ensure that we bring in optimal treasury solutions that are digitised and optimised to enable treasury to operate in a strategic and relevant manner, supporting the business ambitions of their organisations.</p>
<p>Clearly, navigating in many countries in Asia also continues to be challenging, as regulatory landscapes are not homogenous and bring along their respective challenges with the evolving geopolitical landscape. We certainly endeavour to bring the best of HSBC to clients by also leveraging on our know-how and best practice across the Asia Pacific region. This also aligns with our ambition of assisting companies as they move offshore, and set up regional treasury centres across the Asia Pacific region. A recent series of corporate treasury advisory sessions for our Chinese clients, in Mandarin, across China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and India is an example of how we can assist our clients on their treasury transformation journeys.</p>
<h4>If we think of transaction banking itself, what do you think is powering its growth in Asia Pacific?</h4>
<p>The growth in the Asia Pacific region continues to be powered by strong client activity that we continue to observe, coupled with the many changes that are rapidly evolving in the payments landscape, new digitisation technologies, and regulatory evolutions. Dialogue has shifted away from the more traditional discussions around cheque collections, cheque outsourcing, cash pooling structures, to new developments in blockchain, omni-channel collections, mobile collections, next generation virtual accounts, digital accounts receivables tools, interest enhancement facilities etcetera. The development of these new solutions and technologies are rapidly keeping pace with the need for many companies and treasury teams to digitise and transform their treasury in line with the transformation of their businesses. The industrial revolution brought with it Industry 4.0, and this has also driven Treasury 4.0, where the world of digital and physical collide to create new treasury opportunities. At HSBC, we continue to invest into this space to co-create new solutions with clients, to enable them to realise these opportunities.</p>
<h4>How is geopolitics influencing the work that you're doing, and more specifically, how are the US-China trade war and lots of uncertainty in Europe affecting what your clients are doing in Asia Pacific?</h4>
<p>Geopolitics clearly bring about challenges for the companies we work with, but at the same time, also clear opportunities.</p>
<p>With the ongoing US-China trade war, we continue to see companies – foreign and local – who have been operating in China, seeking to diversify their supply chains to other locations. Let me however clarify that they are not looking to exit China – as China remains non-negotiable for many, given the investments made and the size of the market.</p>
<p>What companies are looking to do is to engage on a ‘China plus one’ strategy. This strategy is one where China will continue to be a key and strategic location but where there is also a need to look for other areas to enhance and better manage supply chains. ASEAN is one of the areas where we have seen companies looking to expand into, with a view of either expanding their existing manufacturing capabilities there, making an acquisition or building greenfield. Clearly, these are long-term strategic decisions that need to be undertaken, and we are looking to assist our clients on their journeys. This form of advisory also extends to our clients in Europe where concerns on Brexit are driving them to look for alternative treasury centres in other sites such as Paris, Luxembourg and Ireland. Our network, people and cash management capabilities across these geographies provide us a clear advantage as we look to provide the right levels of advice to our clients.</p>
<h4>How has 2019 been for you as a bank?</h4>
<p>2019 has been a year of challenges, with fast changing geopolitics rapidly evolving the business and financial landscape. If I may characterise it: it was as a rollercoaster of a ride – one filled with intense moments of excitement with many ups and downs however, always moving forwards! As mentioned, challenges also bring about opportunities, and we have been focused on bringing the best of the bank to our clients and moving them forwards.</p>
<p>From a transactional banking perspective, we have been ensuring that we continue to invest and bring to our clients the best and most relevant transactional banking solutions, catering to allow them better ways to operate, and enabling treasuries to be more strategic in their execution. Clearly it’s rewarding when we see clients reaping the benefits of the solutions we are putting into place for them.</p>
<h4>What are you looking forward to and what's going to be in store for you in 2020?</h4>
<p>2020 looks promising as we see the momentum of client activity continue, and as we look towards maintaining the treasury transformation journey with many of the companies that we continue to serve. There is never a dull moment, and we will continue to invest into our transactional banking franchise to enable it to remain relevant to our clients as we bring about new digital solutions for them. Companies remain focused on wanting their payments to be fast, seamless and secure – a theme we continue to invest heavily into, to enable our clients to thrive!</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>As a major environmental infrastructure business, to what extent is sustainable finance on your radar?</h4>
<p>We are investing heavily in some key sustainability targets and the majority of Group debt is now being executed as sustainable finance. This sees us working closely with investors, banks and external agencies to better understand what needs to be achieved in order to qualify. To do this, we have ensured treasury has become a central pillar of the business – and we are certainly dedicated to supporting sustainable projects across the business. Increasingly, the scope of the Group’s large capital projects dovetail with our desire, where possible, to access sustainable finance.</p>
<p>As a water utility and waste management company, our infrastructure improvement projects by definition, have positive social and environmental impacts. But because sustainable funding is contingent on meeting strict guidelines, treasury needs to go out to the business, discussing these major capex projects, probing how these align and integrate with the rules of sustainable finance. But given the strength of commitment to using sustainable finance within Pennon, we can even influence the way a project is executed.</p>
<h4>Does this make treasury a strategic player at Pennon Group?</h4>
<p>It does. And if the business units once rarely considered the source of their funding, they surely do now. With the low interest environment and a rising cost-of-carry, we have all had to become more precise, ensuring we are not holding surplus funds for too long, yet still having the pre-funding available to meet the needs of the business.</p>
<p>Investors are now closely scrutinising the environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores of target firms, and because we are seeking to access ‘impact’ or sustainability-linked loans, we have to provide a clear demonstration of our positive ESG activity. We’ve been working with third parties, such as the ESG-ratings firm, Sustainalytics, and the safety and sustainability registrar and classification society, DNV GL, to help us tell our story to the investor and banking community.</p>
<p>This means we’ve been able to mature our sustainability strategy and embed this throughout the company. Every business unit and function is now involved in the implementation, development and progress of the strategy. As a result, I need to understand more of the operational drivers in the business, as much as the business has to gain an understanding of what treasury does. I believe treasury’s voice is now heard loud and clear.</p>
<h4>Does the rise of treasury bring additional responsibilities, particularly around risk management?</h4>
<p>The last financial crisis certainly pulled financial risk management into focus, but it also changed perceptions of treasury, highlighting the value of the role right across the business, alerting many more people to what we do and how we can help them.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other challenges to our equilibrium as a Group, but some are less well-defined. Brexit, for example, is difficult to judge when building a response. Although as a UK-operating business, we are well-placed, compared to other corporates, to navigate through Brexit challenges, we know there will almost certainly be some fall-out to deal with, depending on how it is delivered. And then there is talk by some British politicians of possibly re-nationalising utilities; that is also on our radar.</p>
<p>We can only exercise a watching brief on such events, but a more immediate response is dictated by the ongoing demands made by the water and waste industry regulators and policymakers. Our waste management subsidiary, Viridor, has not waited to be regulated into action, transforming itself from a landfill business into one focused on recycling and energy recovery.</p>
<p>Of course, this has all required significant investment. Treasury has not only been called upon to ensure the business has the right funding to meet the capex profile, but also that a robust approach to risk mitigation is developed.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>What does running Grab’s treasury entail?</h4>
<p>With such an array of differing businesses, serving completely different markets, it is down to my team to keep the company running smoothly. The way I think about running corporate treasury is that if we are doing a good job, nobody will even realise we exist or the extent of the value we create. Our consumers and partners deserve the very best, and it is imperative that we earn the right to serve.</p>
<h4>What are the key challenges for Grab?</h4>
<p>Southeast Asia is one of the most culturally diverse regions in the world. The numerous countries within it account for more than 640 million people and there are large economic realities separating the region – such as differing central bank regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>This presents challenges in managing cash, liquidity and treasury activities, ranging from cross border payments, reducing the costs of funds-in and funds-out, foreign exchange transactions, counterparty risks, investments and financing to bank account management, across the different markets, while conforming to different local regulations and constraints.</p>
<p>We adopt a hyperlocal approach to businesses by setting up a local presence in every country that we operate in and we work closely with relevant government authorities, including tax and banking regulators.</p>
<h4>Just how critical is it to find the right partners?</h4>
<p>Very. What has been effective for Grab is the forging of strategic partnerships where the intentions are aligned and to access deep local expertise. This is due in part to the fragmented nature of the markets and the dynamic operating environment across Southeast Asian countries. We recognise that there are differences in social trust between people, as well as the way they interact with cash and cashless channels, coupled with the way they transact with banks across markets.</p>
<p>As we expand our service delivery platform in the region, leveraging these strategic partnerships has enabled us to drive innovation, ensuring that quick-to-market, regulatory-compliant and market-relevant products and services are deployed. To take some examples, when we started a lending business, we found a joint venture partner to enable the target business model. When we wanted to deliver an insurance service offering to our consumers, we found another joint venture partner.</p>
<h4>Grab are a Highly Commended Winner of Treasury Today Asia’s Adam Smith Awards Asia 2019 in the category of Harnessing the Power of Technology. Can you explain more?</h4>
<p>In November 2018, we forged a strategic alliance and partnership with United Overseas Bank in Singapore to access a variety of banking solutions as part of a broader commercial collaboration. We rolled out an instant payment solution for settlement with driver partners and merchants, using a straight through processing application programming interface. This greatly enhances the payout experience for our driver partners and merchants on a 24/7 basis.</p>
<p>The partnership with UOB has created many wins for Grab’s finance and treasury teams – from enhancing driver and merchant payment experience to reducing costs, improving cash visibility, standardising documentation, executing FX, leveraging industry-standard SWIFT interfaces and other banking requirements via a single platform.</p>
<p>Winning the award is testament to and validation of our strategy of leveraging local partners and technology to create impact.</p>
<h4>You mentioned your team earlier, what visions and values should a good treasury live by?</h4>
<p>At Grab we call them the ‘4Hs’: heart, hunger, honour and humility. These values are something that we as a team have to extol daily. We need the heart to do things for the right reason and serve the community, the hunger and grit to push ourselves to raise our game and not settle for less, the honour to be ethical and keep to our word, and the humility to own up to our mistakes and be better versions of ourselves every day.</p>
<p>I’m also a strong believer of continuous learning and improvement. My team members are encouraged to learn new skills such as data analytics, to network and share ideas, and take charge of their own career aspirations. In other words, being proactive to future-proof their careers in the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) environment.</p>

<p><em>From his parents’ food store in Italy to treasurer of one of the world’s leading media companies, Gianluca Gubbini has travelled far. He tells Treasury Today about his journey.</em></p>
<h4>How did you arrive in treasury?</h4>
<p>I feel like I have always worked in treasury. My parents used to own a food store in Italy, and it was our second home. Since we were kids, my brother and I were always helping in the store and one of the things I remember liking the most was helping with the closure of the tills at the end of the day, which included counting the money, preparing the slip and going to the bank the next day to deposit the cash. During that time, I even enjoyed keeping a cashbook and preparing the reconciliation of my Dad’s personal bank account. After high school, I went to university and got a degree in Economic and Banking Science; treasury was definitely meant to be my path.</p>
<h4>What lessons have you carried through as you have progressed?</h4>
<p>The main lessons I have learned and carried through my working life are to do as if it was my own business – no wasting of resources, time or money – and work hard to keep your customers happy. I try to apply these rules every day.</p>
<h4>Describe your current role</h4>
<p>I am currently leading the International Cash operations team. As a team, we oversee all aspects of Viacom International cash management and treasury operations. In addition to the day-to-day activities, we work very closely with our tax, legal and accounting teams in respect of treasury transactions that involve international cash, such as dividends, capital contributions, acquisitions and more. We are also responsible for managing bank relationships. I meet with our banking partners regularly to review service levels and to discuss new products. In the last few years, I have been very much involved in projects we are working to implement such as a new cash pool with virtual accounts and a full OBO structure.</p>
<h4>To what extent is technology deployed in your operations?</h4>
<p>Viacom has been at the forefront of embracing new treasury solutions. Throughout the last decade we developed a comprehensive treasury technology solution which resulted in great visibility, control, automation and the ability to manage and mitigate risks. We achieved this by rationalising our bank account structure, implementing a new treasury management system, a new ERP system, an in-house bank and we became SWIFT members. We are currently implementing a new cash pool, which will leverage virtual accounts to enable a full OBO structure. </p>
<h4>What challenges are you currently tackling?</h4>
<p>The media landscape is evolving even more rapidly than treasury, and Viacom has made a number of accelerant deals to grow its portfolio and capabilities. From a treasury perspective, the challenge is to integrate these new businesses into our existing core structure seamlessly. Additionally, we will need to ensure that treasury is able to support the different requirements that each acquisition has brought to the table in an efficient and swift manner. </p>
<h4>How do you keep up to speed in such a dynamic market?</h4>
<p>Bank relationships play a key role here, whether it is to answer an immediate request or to understand what solution may be available in the near future. I regularly meet with our relationship banks, attend seminars and conferences so that I am up to date with what is available in the market, what our peers do and what product and solutions we can implement to bring efficiencies and increase controls and working capital management.</p>

<p><em>Himanshu Kher, Group Treasurer, LMAX Exchange Group, knows the world of global brokerages, banks and consulting organisations inside out from a treasury perspective. He explains what keeps him sharp.</em></p>
<h4>You started your professional life in M&amp;A; banking, then moved through trading and consultancy positions. How and why did you make the transition to treasury?</h4>
<p>It was part accident and part destiny; there was some luck involved. After working in the M&amp;A; division at Nomura for several years, I took on a role as an index options trader at BNP Paribas in London. Then, the 2008 financial crisis happened, which obviously had an impact on all the major investment banks. I decided it was time for a career change and took up treasury advisory roles at consultancy companies such as PwC and the Boston Consulting Group.</p>
<p>Through my years of advising treasurers and Chief Risk Officers as a consultant, it became clear to me that the real action was in being a treasurer rather than a consultant. When the opportunity arose to become group treasurer of my previous company, IG, I immediately said yes.</p>
<h4>Describe the challenges you faced in that transition.</h4>
<p>As group treasurer, you are entrusted with a much higher level of responsibility than a consultant and just having a big picture view of treasury doesn’t work.  When I transitioned, key challenges were picking up a new industry (retail leveraged trading) as well as understanding the underlying processes that made treasury work.  I was able to draw upon my strong financial services background and years of experience, and, ultimately, it was a great opportunity that enabled me to grow as a professional and reach the next level of my career.</p>
<h4>You trained as an engineer before moving into financial services. Are there any similarities?</h4>
<p>Structured problem solving. Engineering is all about developing structured solutions to complex problems, and that is an essential skill for anyone in a financial services role.</p>
<h4>How do you think treasury in financial services differs from that of industry?</h4>
<p>Across all businesses and industries, treasury is about constrained optimisation. Treasurers must strike the right balance between security of funds, whilst managing liquidity risk whilst trying to maximise returns made by the business given a set of constraints. The main differentiator for the financial services industry is that it is more regulated than several other industries, resulting in a greater level of constraint.</p>
<h4>What attracted you to the role of Group Treasurer at LMAX Exchange?</h4>
<p>The biggest advantage was the opportunity it provided to shape the role and make a mark in a fast-growing, innovative and successful company. The high growth level of the business means the rate of change will be immense. And I view this as an exciting challenge.</p>
<h4>What are your main current and anticipated treasury challenges at LMAX Exchange?</h4>
<p>Right now, I am focused on automating a number of treasury processes to improve the quality of information, and how that information is communicated, to management. This will result in better-informed decision making and also translate to greater visibility of cash and risks in the business, bolstering our ability to manage the balance sheet. As our Asia Pacific offering continues to expand, we will continue to focus on finding new and innovative ways of handling clients’ funds in a frictionless way.</p>
<h4>What personal skills does a successful treasury professional need and what advice would you give to any young professional starting on their career path?</h4>
<p>I would say the personal skills somebody starting out in the industry needs are an understanding of the wider context of treasury and how it fits into finance across a whole organisation; a love for numbers; and, ideally, a treasury qualification that has given them a good understanding of the company’s balance sheet and cash flow statement. I believe that every treasurer also needs to be excited to learn new things and dive into the business.</p>
<h4>What specific successes would you highlight in your own career?</h4>
<p>The first would be my appointment to group treasurer of IG. I’m proud of my ability to have met challenges head on in my career. And now, I’m looking at taking on the new challenge of building up a group treasury function at LMAX Exchange, which is a high-growth business that’s transforming global financial markets. That’s very exciting, and I have no doubt there will be more successes to be enjoyed here in the coming months.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>As Group Treasury Director of JD.com, Jeff Yu has spearheaded a complete restructuring of the Chinese e-commerce giant’s treasury department, a mammoth task that saw him gratefully draw upon invaluable lessons and experience he gained from more traditional industries.</em></p>
<h4>What were the highlights of your career before joining JD.com?</h4>
<p>I feel very lucky to have been part of the treasury team at Ford Motor Company. Ford’s treasury is famous for its experience and not just because of the important role it played in the survival of the company during the financial crisis. It has been influential in the car industry and across the treasury profession for a long, long time. Those years at Ford were ones where I gained great experience and knowledge, learnt how to handle treasury in a multinational company with a global view.</p>
<h4>What were the most valuable lessons you learnt at Ford?</h4>
<p>Expertise in treasury and focus. Those are vital elements for treasurers. Another is learning how to be prepared for all possibilities. As treasurers, we need to prepare for every situation, every environment a company can find itself in, and know how to go about handling it, which is what the nature of the job demands on a daily basis.</p>
<h4>How do the opportunities, challenges and risks differ at an e-commerce giant like JD.com compared to more traditional industries in your view?</h4>
<p>It’s quite a different situation here at JD.com compared to my previous experiences. Ford, for example, is a typical multinational company in a traditional industry. JD.com is part of a much more recently established industry, e-commerce, one that is still developing very fast. You cannot handle the treasury here, and in new economy companies generally, I think, based on just the skills or abilities gained from traditional industries.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge at JD.com for me and my team is its enormous size and the speed at which it operates: it’s very big, and very fast. That is often the major difference between the traditional company and new economy company. And it is the speed at which developments can take place at JD.com in terms of volumes and scale across all operational aspects that makes treasury management here very different from that at Ford or other traditional companies.</p>
<h4>You began your career as a banker so what led you to switch to the corporate world?</h4>
<p>As a banker I was just looking into the corporate world from the outside. I felt I needed a more vivid experience of companies and organisations.</p>
<h4>On reflection, how would you sum up your career journey and achievements so far at JD.com?</h4>
<p>When I consider the treasury structure we have put in place at JD.com over the last three years, I can see now that it really makes full use of all my personal experience. I’ve had the opportunity to transform treasury practice here, create a new structure and make full use of banking technology. But there is a basic philosophy I have used here and it is based on time-tested elements such as ensuring we have a global view, treasury expertise, professional communication, prudent procedures in place… all the essential elements that I saw work so well and experienced at those decent companies such as Ford, Fosun and METRO AG. Those basic treasury qualities are the same whether one is working in the new economy or a traditional industry.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>With a passion for preparation matched by his love of a two-wheeled challenge, Paul Schreurs, Group Treasurer at Intertrust has learnt how to keep himself on top form professionally and personally.</em></p>
<h4>In your career so far, what lessons have you learnt?</h4>
<p>I’ve certainly observed a common association between the trio of finance and accounting, tax, and treasury. It’s a triangular relationship that I feel is extremely important to keep in alignment because there is always the risk that, if we don’t, some aspect will fall between the cracks. Although all three functions report up to the CFO, I believe that the strength of the relationship is maintained only with regular communication. In fact, there are many aspects of our work that overlap so communicating openly gives us a strong basis for the health of the overall finance function.</p>
<p>Within my own department, I’m an adherent to the philosophy that ‘preparation prevents poor performance’. It’s particularly applicable when answering key questions from senior management. I think there is evidence of my preparedness in my ‘standard’ treasury reports. I’ve formatted these to contain all the essential treasury facts and figures, detailing core elements such as debt positions, value and location of all cash balances, hedging instruments, FX rates, interest payments, volume of equity and outstanding treasury shares is invaluable. The reason I do this is simple: if I’m asked a question, I want to be able to answer it immediately. Having my treasury book with me at all times is a robust basis for being able to do this.</p>
<h4>Describe you approach to treasury</h4>
<p>I have a pragmatic approach based on keeping things simple. I always have to be able to explain things in simple words to the executive committee – if I cannot explain it very simply, then it is probably too complex and risky and we shouldn’t do it.</p>
<h4>What drives you?</h4>
<p>I’m not afraid of tackling intense projects because this is where the real rewards are to be found. I led Intertrust’s recent refinancing where, having developed the proposal for a hybrid financing structure, I used our first ever bond issuance to tap the capital markets, running this in parallel with a new bank financing programme designed to give us a diversification of funding and the right currency mix, and extended maturities. The timing of the issuance purposefully coincided with the release of our Q3 figures and this proved to be the perfect window of opportunity for going out on the roadshow. The book went on to perform very strongly, being significantly oversubscribed, enabling a very good pricing outcome.</p>
<p>Running a project like a complete refinancing reminds me, as a keen cyclist, of climbing Mont Ventoux. You always have to keep the summit in mind but, in the moment, you only focus on the next hairpin. Finally reaching the summit and looking back at the way to get there can be very rewarding.</p>
<h4>What would you say are the key characteristics that make you a successful treasurer, and how can these be developed?</h4>
<p>I’d describe myself as an analytical, dedicated and result-oriented individual, and I’m utterly convinced of the need for planning and preparation. Because of that, I can see the value in the awareness that I got from a recent Insight Discovery ‘<a href="https://www.thecolourworks.com/insights-discovery/" target="_blank">Colour Energies</a>’ training course.</p>
<p>Red, yellow, green and blue represent different psychological states. These can be loosely classified as having a focus on results, interaction, harmony, and analysis, respectively. These colour modes inform different characteristics, and likely reactions under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>I think it is advantageous to be able to recognise the dominant colour energies in others, and be able to adapt our own ‘energies’ to better meet their needs. You need each of these energies at certain times as a treasurer, but a focus on results and analytical skills is most important. So, although finance people are typically ‘blue’, I believe that there is a strong aspect of ‘red’ in the successful treasurer too.</p>
<p>For up and coming treasurers, I highly recommend reading Stephen Covey’s ‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People’. In my early career, it was a very useful guide. It gave me a strong understanding of what’s important, such as being proactive and always keeping the end-goal in mind.</p>

<p><em>The art of good treasury is all about intellectual curiosity, flexibility and a practical approach for Ben Walters, Deputy Treasurer, Compass Group. He talks to Treasury Today about his methods.</em></p>
<h4>What for you is the secret of good treasury?</h4>
<p>You have to be prepared to work extremely hard. You also have to develop a flexible mindset; you need to be able to switch seamlessly between talking about cash management issues in multiple locations, to thinking about group interest rate policy, to explaining a complex issue in layman’s terms to non-treasury colleagues. That mental agility is still a ‘work-in-progress’ for me but the capacity to quickly and easily shift modes – from the everyday, to the deeply technical, to the relatively simplistic – is part of the beauty of the role.</p>
<p>I think treasurers need to be excellent networkers too. Few of us have all the resources within the department to accomplish all we need to, so we have to be able to work across teams, internally and externally.</p>
<p>Treasury is the meeting point for many different skills. Being good at the job requires the individual to maintain a broad understanding of forward-looking risks, and elements such as the impact of strategy and the effects of global economics.</p>
<h4>What is the role of technology in treasury?</h4>
<p>Current levels of speculation and hype can make it extremely difficult to know where the dust will settle. It may not be the ideal stance, but no one wants to be a first mover so there is a strong element of ‘wait-and-see’ amongst treasurers.</p>
<p>If we consider AI and blockchain, there is much talk but a lot less action. That said, there are plenty of new, maybe less fully-formed treasury environments where it would be quite correct to try to take advantage of these developments.</p>
<h4>Is treasury now a strategic function?</h4>
<p>With our broad commercial perspective, technical know-how and our realistic appreciation of risk, I believe treasury is now perfectly positioned to become the strategic voice within the finance function. I’m excited by the prospect of trying to raise finance into a mainstream strategic discipline.</p>
<p>Business strategy tends to be thought of as a separate discipline, sometimes sitting outside finance. But effective strategising demands a significant merging of ground. Finance is a vast resource within every business, producing valuable quantitative data, painting an accurate view of the health of the business. Strategy teams draw heavily upon qualitative information, exploring and making judgments as to whether the company is, for example, producing the right products or operating in the right markets. Bringing the two together can create a ‘whole’ more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>There is a vast opportunity out there to think differently about the way data is used to manage the business. Traditional finance centres around the profit and loss account but treasury has the tools and wherewithal to genuinely cut and slice the data to see where the value in any business really lies.</p>
<p>The treasury profession, by the very nature of its experience, training and the broad perspective this engenders, is ideally placed to bridge the gap. When people talk about the strategic role of the treasurer, this to me is the crux of the matter.</p>

<h4><br/>From a corporate treasury perspective, what will be the key themes of 2019 across the Americas?</h4>
<p>Up until now we have been benefitting from a growth environment from an Americas perspective, particularly in the US. That dynamic is unfortunately starting to shift.</p>
<p>Globally, in 2019, we could start experiencing slower growth, in the US, and certainly in Asia, particularly China. That trajectory may well drive a different agenda from a corporate treasury perspective within the Americas.</p>
<p>There has been a build-up of vast pockets of liquidity here. Extremely cheap liquidity has been available for corporate treasuries to finance either M&amp;A, capex or share buyback programmes. But liquidity availability is slowly starting to shrink in the US as the Central Bank is no longer providing liquidity to the system.</p>
<p>Because the cost of funding associated with leverage is increasing, and there is a potential slowdown in economic growth, de-leveraging has to be part of the gameplan from a corporate treasury standpoint. Businesses must protect their credit ratings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, industries that have been dynamic in the M&amp;A space in the recent past, for example, need to start trending that downwards. I believe that they should be focusing on generating free cash flow that could be put to work reducing debt. In fact, one thing that has never gone away is the need for working capital optimisation, to drive that free cash flow generation. I think 2019 will be a year of working capital optimisation for all treasurers, whether in the Americas or Latin America.</p>
<p>In the current rising interest rate cycle, putting money to work has been a bit easier for treasurers. However, if the Fed’s interest rate hikes do come to an end, treasurers will need to work harder to make sure they are managing their liquidity effectively.</p>
<p>But there is a need for corporate treasury to continue driving efficiencies across the board, which leads us to the theme of technology and how best to leverage it when the demand to ‘do more with less’ continues unabated.</p>
<p>To this end, I think treasurers need to be working with technology partners and financial institutions that can help them navigate change. Of course, Bank of America Merrill Lynch will continue to invest in and deliver technology-driven solutions to its clients. But, as a key differentiator, we will also offer a higher ‘human touch’. In fact, this synthesis forms the cornerstone of our global Intelligent Treasury strategy; we will deliver treasury insights that are leveraged in technology but driven by our experts and our global, regional and local industry expertise across the board.</p>
<h4>What can treasuries operating in LatAm expect this year?</h4>
<p>A key theme for treasurers in LatAm in 2019 will be risk management, whether it is FX strategy, hedging strategy, managing interest rate volatility or the risk management angle on managing liquidity.</p>
<p>We continue to see multinationals setting up shared service centres or centralising vast portions of their treasury operations in Latin America. Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Argentina and Brazil have continued to be beneficiaries of investments towards those types of activities. It’s driven by lower cost locations but also by a large talent pool of treasury services and operations. However, when multinationals consider LatAm for growth, observing regional volatility is unavoidable.</p>
<p>That said, Brazil in particular has been improving as a consequence of recent political transition. We are entering 2019 with optimism for how the markets will react to its government’s reform agenda, although we are mindful of the risks of it not executing on that agenda. For now, emerging market flows are coming back to Brazil, and we are expecting more economic activity here to be an opening for multinationals.</p>
<p>The e-commerce space in Brazil and across the region is fascinating. It continues to present huge opportunities for multinationals, particularly to those in the shared economy as they continue to build their capabilities in the region.</p>
<p>We are entering an era of political change in other markets too. Argentina, which is still tackling 47% inflation, is facing presidential elections in 2019. And there will be elections in parts of Central America too. But there are economies in Central America and the Caribbean – such as Panama, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica – that continue to perform well, presenting pockets of opportunity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico is entering 2019 on an uncertain note, given the country’s political environment. However, one piece of very good news recently was the conclusion of the revised free trade agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Mexico and Canada (USMCA). It goes some way to ensuring that certain economic flows will remain steady.</p>
<h4>How do you see USMCA affecting corporate treasury operations?</h4>
<p>NAFTA is still in force. When and if USMCA becomes official, most current NAFTA rules and procedures will remain in effect. However, whilst it may not change how corporate treasurers interact across the region, it could provide a lot more stability from a foreign exchange perspective, which will be beneficial for corporate treasury operations, provided there are no serious political challenges to drive volatility.</p>
<p>So far, with no rule changes for importers or exporters, corporate treasurers should not be thinking differently in terms of managing their treasury operations. However, some sectors are poised to gain more from USMCA, notably the automotive sector because it won’t take much for it to comply with new requirements around local production and local components.</p>
<h4>What should corporate treasurers in the wider region be most mindful of in 2019?</h4>
<p>Volatility in the markets globally means focusing on working capital optimisation; this remains paramount for 2019. There is also a potential shift of supply chains from higher labour cost and complex markets, to markets where either the labour cost or complexity is more favourable.</p>
<p>As China becomes more expensive in supply-chain terms, and as it faces geopolitical challenges, it could help foreign direct investments into LatAm. If supply chains shift from Asia into the USMCA region, there will be increased potential for economic growth and stability for this part of the world.</p>

<p><em>For Suzanne Perry, Assistant Group Treasurer at RELX Group, continuous learning and tackling new tasks is the order of the day. This appetite for progress has seen her play an increasingly important role in the global structure of RELX Group.</em></p>
<h5>What is your approach to treasury?</h5>
<p>Getting involved is an essential part of the job for me and so I’ve taken on an increasingly broad sweep of financial functions since my arrival at RELX. When accounting rules changed in 2004 – when derivatives had to be recognised on the balance sheet – it was one of my first opportunities to deliver a solid contribution to the bottom line. I’m a practical person and I always like to feel I am doing something, so I built a reputation for expertise in this area to the point where colleagues executing derivatives and hedging deals in our Swiss Treasury Centre called me to help them correctly structure and administer their own deals.</p>
<p>I had already expressed my interest in taking part in a benchmark-sized debt deal, so in 2009 I headed off to Switzerland on secondment. Having just done an equity placement there I manged to get involved in the deal’s foreign exchange management, converting cash to pay down some of the facility. But this deal meant we were well-funded so I had to wait a few more years for the next big one to come along.</p>
<p>Although it meant extending my secondment twice, I saw that as an opportunity in itself as there was still a lot to get to grips with, particularly with the issuance of commercial paper throughout the year to support very cyclical sales patterns in our biggest entities. I learnt a lot about negotiation, trading, guarantees, and the legal and administrative processes, through a number of bi-lateral smaller deals. The benchmark bond came in 2012 and we followed in 2013 with a Swiss bond issuance in which I was fully involved in roadshow duties. The Swiss experience ended in 2014 but it was a great teamwork experience.</p>
<h5>How important is it for you to reach out to the business?</h5>
<p>I was in Switzerland for five years and managed to build many relationships with finance team members. Many have since moved into the divisions, so I am a familiar face right across the group. Having the background and contacts at ground level has proven advantageous in many ways.</p>
<p>Each division has its own finance team, often staffed by former members of the corporate finance function. Knowing that my door is always open, they feel comfortable coming to treasury with a problem. It means we are an approachable centre of knowledge for them. Keeping in contact reduces the likelihood of a business trying to do treasury without the knowledge. They know that anything treasury-related – including bank relationships – goes through us.</p>
<h5>As a technology company, what is the treasury view of this topic?</h5>
<p>We’ve got around 30,000 employees, and around 8,000 of them are technologists. It’s in the company DNA, so we’re a big fan of technology - but not for the sake of it. There has been a solid focus on the systems side for treasury and finance and this has mainly been about consolidation, uniformity and keeping processes simple. If you have a simple process it is easier to automate. Our biggest cost is people so through technology they can be freed from mundane processes, and be applied to something with more value for the business. It’s something we are constantly looking at and trying to leverage.</p>
<h5>With that in mind then, what is your take on people skills in treasury?</h5>
<p>I think one of the essential treasury skills is being able to read people. Nowhere is that more so than when we’re doing debt deals. We get feedback from the bank syndicate teams and they are always worried about giving too rosy a view, in case it cannot be achieved. It might be in their interests to have treasury accept as bad a price as possible because a low price is easier to sell to investors. They are trying to be fair but they won’t advise a treasurer to be aggressive in their pricing because they will then worry that if they can’t deliver, they will be blamed for failure. Syndicate teams are caught in the middle so it is vital for us as treasurers to listen closely, to read between the lines, and be able to develop the conversation to flush out where the cut-off is to get those last few basis points.</p>

<h4 class="fn">John Sweetman</h4>
<h5 class="title">Senior Director, Pfizer Treasury<br/><br/></h5>
<img alt="Pfizer" class="logo org" height="41" src="/i/logo/pfizer-logo-2013-70x41.png" title="Pfizer" width="70"/>

<h5><br/><br/>What are the main issues you face in the region?</h5>
<p>The regulatory nuances across each country in the region are a big challenge, and most prominently this is an issue in China, given the proliferation of “window guidance” in recent years. We manage this by talking to our banking partners to try and get a consensus on what is happening in the market. In addition, we have worked hard to develop strong bilateral relationships with the regulators, and in particular the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and meet them regularly to discuss developments.</p>
<p>Another notable issue is around liquidity optimisation. We are always looking for efficient ways to mobilise pockets of trapped cash as well as managing our counterparty credit risk.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there are ‘nuts and bolts’ treasury issues such as trying to minimise the number of bank accounts we have, and also making sure we are not running any unhedged FX positions in our business.</p>
<h5>What are going to be your main priorities going forward?</h5>
<p>The digital side of things is very important for us now. Getting an understanding of new technologies is key. I’ve recently come across an interesting novel concept that positions the treasurer as a technologist, in addition to needing the traditional areas of expertise, such as FX, bank relationship management, liquidity planning, international tax planning, etc. I am not a techie per se, but the way the environment is shaping up, you would need to have some basic appreciation of how these new technologies work, and how they may impact your business.</p>
<p>Within Pfizer we have a corporate-wide initiative around digital finance where treasury plays a key part. We are very interested in exploring opportunities such as virtual bank accounts, for example. We’d also like to improve our cash flow forecasting, so we are looking at how certain new technologies can help us support that objective.</p>
<p>After digital, another key priority – as we are a US headquartered firm – is understanding the impact of recent US corporate tax reforms. What will happen in terms of liquidity management models or opportunities to repatriate cash? What does it mean from a capital structure perspective? These are some of the questions that we have been reviewing in recent months.</p>
<h5>How would you sum up your relationship with banks?</h5>
<p>I think the banking fraternity’s mind-set of the past has evolved. With banks, it’s more of a partnership than it used to be. Pfizer has had a very strong partnership with J.P. Morgan, particularly in Asia in recent years as we centralised our cash management business with them. We have an ongoing dialogue and feel that the team there has a very good understanding of our business and operating model. The onus I think is on corporates to understand which are the strong banks in the respective regions, as not all of the bank offerings are the same. My advice to corporates is to work with your local treasury association, talk to peers, and understand where the proficiencies exist for which banks. Whether your needs are cash management, trade or innovation, make sure that you are working with the right partner bank for the region.</p>
<h5>Do you have a philosophy at Pfizer about using a number of banks?</h5>
<p>We took an informed decision after the financial crisis in 2008 to run a bunch of RFPs on a regional basis to diversify our banking risk. The result is that although we use a specific bank in Asia Pacific, we may not use the same one for Europe or North America. But we are big enough and have critical mass in each of those regions to justify that. For smaller organisations that could be a difficult strategy to action.</p>
<p>However, the structure can result in some additional complexity. For example, we run bank account reporting repositories through each regional partner bank, whereas if you had a single global partner bank, it would be one repository and a fairly straightforward task of taking your MT940s into your treasury management system. Having multiple repositories means we have to pull our reports from multiple sources, which involves extra upfront IT work, and ongoing maintenance. We are getting the diversification that we desire, but it does come at a price in terms of increased complexity.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Silver Zuskin has accumulated global experience across multiple functions including treasury, accounting, business process and trade finance. This has prepared him well for a life of change within one of the world’s best-known tech multinationals.</em></p>
<h5>Describe your journey into treasury.</h5>
<p>My financial career started in 1997 in the Slovakian office of a multinational telecoms business. No one had the notion of treasury at the time so I started building out the function from scratch. I added more activities such as payments and collections, credit risk, FX and bank relationship management, expanding the role into a recognisable treasury function.</p>
<p>With the same company I then spent time in Germany in a regional treasury, before returning to Slovakia and my own small team. I moved away from treasury briefly, taking on an international corporate role in France where I worked to define, create and deploy an SAP-based solution for small and mid-sized entities within the group but at a global level.</p>
<p>This exposed me to a very deep inside view of all those business processes internationally. This was the game-changer for me. I believe that looking at treasury only from one angle might restrict your perspective and not allow you to understand the views of other finance groups and other territories. Taking that wider view enables you to increase your own level of competence as a treasurer.</p>
<h5>Is treasury strategic?</h5>
<p>Since I joined Dell in 2006 it has become a highly acquisitive business and has worked to extract value from each new combination. I think treasury has played a vital role in enabling this. When we acquired EMC Corporation in 2016, for example, there was a shift from cash-rich to leveraged, with treasury managing both the funding of the transaction and the subsequent financial re-organisation. Treasury has undergone some major changes in this time too, centralising operations and building out our cash management Centre of Excellence. In July 2018, we announced plans to return to public trading and treasury will again be involved in planning.</p>
<p>With each big event, treasury has been pushed into the limelight to an extent and it has been vital for us to be more business-oriented, and good communication skills have been essential. Often it comes down to actively listening to what the business needs to be able to carry out its strategic intentions, and then for treasury to find the best solutions. We are definitely a strategic player!</p>
<h5>To what extent does diversity play a part in Dell treasury’s success?</h5>
<p>To start with, an international outlook is essential. At Dell, we need to work with people from all corners of the planet and so need to be sensitive to cultural differences when trying to meet the goals of the business. It’s not always easy to grasp the nuances of human interaction so we have created a learning and development programme to which treasury has ready access, online and in person.</p>
<p>On a personal level, one initiative that is dear to my heart is MARC (Men Advocating Real Change). It’s a community for men committed to achieving gender equality and diversity in the workplace that has been operating since 1962.</p>
<p>At Dell we have made MARC a cornerstone of our strategy around diversity, making it a strength of the company – although we have broadened it out beyond gender equality, renaming it as ‘Many Advocating Real Change’. At a regional level, and within the team in Bratislava, the approach to diversity is fully incorporated as part of the necessary education and development of all staff.</p>
<h5>What is your view on learning to be a successful treasurer?</h5>
<p>I have Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) and Certified Treasury Professional (CTP) qualifications and so I advocate classroom learning. I always support my team in their undertakings too, with full backing from Dell, but I am also keen on informal learning. I think attendance at major networking conferences and other events delivers many opportunities to seek out additional information and industry views from our treasury peers.</p>
<p>But it’s about more than technical skills. For junior treasurers and those seeking to move into the profession, I would say gain as diverse an experience of business as possible at an early stage. Try to take on roles in other countries wherever possible or seek out a position with a global organisation. I believe this will help form a truly international perspective. Then you need to really nurture your business skills and understanding so you can actively provide solutions and engage with the whole organisation. It is essential to keep learning.</p>

<p>Barry Callebaut is a leading manufacturer of high-quality chocolate and cocoa products. It is a fully-vertical, integrated business-to-business company, with a strong position in cocoa-origin countries. Its products serve the entire food industry, from global and local food manufacturers to artisanal and professional users of chocolate, such as chocolatiers, pastry chefs, bakers, hotels, restaurants or caterers. Jelle spoke with us about working capital management, the challenges of regulation, technology and cyber-security during J.P. Morgan’s APAC CFO and Treasurers Forum in Singapore in September.</p>

<h4 class="fn">Jelle Goossens</h4>
<h5 class="title">Regional Treasurer, Asia Pacific</h5>
<p><img alt="Barry Callebaut Logo" height="22" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/barry-callebaut-logo-2018-150x22.png?la=en&amp;hash=990F56F529761012C7D00E32F38D23BD" style="margin: 2em 0 1em 0;" width="150"/></p>

<h4>There is talk of change in the role of treasury at this forum but are you seeing treasury changing?</h4>
<p>Treasury is becoming much more pro-active than it used to be. Practitioners today are increasingly strategic and required to dive in and understand the mechanics of the business in order to fully visualise objectives and targets. For me, that is the most important development taking place in my profession.</p>
<p>Related to that, is the challenge treasurers have in convincing other stakeholders across the organisation of the importance of drilling down into the business and objectives. In finance we have tools to help with that process; everyone must have clear objectives. As treasurers we need to explain to people the importance of a particular KPI and how it affects them.</p>
<p>I am very fortunate to be in a region where, in terms of proximity, we are very close to the various stakeholders. We can have that active dialogue, speak to people who are on the supply chain side, the sales side or the purchasing side. And that is something that, from my own experience here in Singapore, has been very enriching for personal development.</p>
<h4>What are the biggest challenges you face as a regional treasurer?</h4>
<p>We have challenges on a number of levels. The basic ones revolve around systems and technology. But once you transcend those – and that is what we constantly try to do with investments in technology – you have other, much more interesting challenges, especially in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>Regulation, for example, is always difficult to navigate because you first need to understand the drivers for the regulation. That has been the case with regards to issues we faced in Malaysia recently, issues that meant we had to redesign our liquidity solution for the market. Banks play an important role in such situations – they can, for instance, offer us information on a no-name basis about developments as they see them relating to our situation. We find that any such information banks provide us always beneficial.</p>
<h4>How big a priority is cyber-security for you?</h4>
<p>Cyber-security is of extreme and growing importance and we are, again, thankful for the help banks provide us on this front. They are leaders in the space and invest the most in leading-edge technology to combat cybercrime so the advice we get from them is very valuable and welcomed.</p>
<p>Within the organisation, we have a cyber-security strategy that the advice feeds into. One of the most important elements of that strategy is making sure that all of our payment data is using straight through processing and every payment instruction is validated. We communicate internally about the risks – so it’s also about awareness.</p>
<p>We have seen some very sophisticated cases or scams that take advantage of people’s willingness to help, show a piece of data, extract other pieces of information, that ultimately lead to the compromising of accounts. This is a growing problem even in the B2B space, where there are examples of invoices being intercepted.</p>
<p>What we advise our customers is that we will never use a single route to communicate critical changes. If you see a change of payment instructions, call your sales contact. Going forward, we are looking to digitise processes even further, with a view of avoiding third parties.</p>
<h4>What are your main priorities in the region?</h4>
<p>In Asia we are leveraging our infrastructure by centralising certain activities. We think that is key, especially in light of the market volatility and macro events like monetary developments and tariff wars that could impact us. We believe it is important to centralise FX management because that way your knowledge base can be applied much more effectively.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>Adam Richford is Group Treasurer of Renewi plc, a FTSE 250-listed market leader in European waste management. A stock in trade for him is transformation. Here he describes his post-merger treasury activities and how they reach far into the business.</i></p>
<h4>What led to your programme of transformation at Renewi and how did you start it?</h4>
<p>I joined Shanks Group at the beginning of 2016, immediately prior to its acquisition of Van Gansewinkel Groep (VGG) which created Renewi. Following the acquisition finance, which included a reconstitution of our banking group, we then focused on the renegotiation of around 30 bilateral derivative, cash management, invoice discounting and guarantee facilities, tying most of these into an innovative Global Guarantee Deed.</p>
<p>This year, we converted our main banking facility into a green loan and introduced a margin discount aimed at further improving our critical sustainability measures. We now have leasing funding planned for investment in a new truck fleet that will improve the group’s environmental impact.</p>
<p>As part of the post-merger integration, we also set about transforming our cash management approach, migrating from divisionally-led ownership, to a centralised model. This will save the Group about €1m a year in interest expense resulting from idle cash.</p>
<p>To help us, our level of automation and consistency across our cash processes are being increased with the roll-out of Bellin TM5 [TMS] to the four divisions. We also just increased the treasury team to four.</p>
<h4>You have been part of two mergers (between Gala Coral and Ladbrokes, and Shanks with VGG). What did learn from the experience?</h4>
<p>Listed company mergers and takeovers are complicated! The Gala Coral and Shanks transactions were both reverse takeovers, meaning the target was bigger than the listed entity in certain ways, so both involved CMA [Competition and Markets Authority] approvals at different levels.</p>
<p>Working on different sides of the equation in these transactions – Gala Coral being private and Shanks being public – has given me some valuable commercial perspectives, not least around exposure to the Equity Capital Markets (ECM) and Debt Capital Markets (DCM).</p>
<p>We had to work closely with the underwriting bank and more broadly with our relationship banks. Apart from needing to secure a good debt finance package we had to ensure that the debt funding workstream didn’t become an obstacle to the closing of the transaction, which meant everything had to be in place at the right time. And for that, communication is critical. I’d also say that as companies undergoing this process don’t typically expand their resourcing availability, you just have to expand the time available to fit the task. Looking back, it is very rewarding.</p>
<h4>What were your immediate post-merger plans?</h4>
<p>At the start of this financial year we had ten key treasury projects. These include green financing, truck leasing, cash management transformation, further funding optimisation, and the strengthening of the treasury function. We’re making good progress so far.</p>
<p>One of the key aims we have is to transform the EBITDA profile of the group by €40m over three years, towards a level of around €200m. A second wave will target margin expansion. We’ll follow with strategic expansion. This is a critical phase from a treasury perspective.</p>
<h4>Does treasury have strategic value?</h4>
<p>It does. The majority of my time is focused on ‘strategic’ aspects which transform the treasury function and the company. I have a key role in deciding how group leverage will change over time, structuring the debt package to fit. Within treasury, we are now thinking holistically in terms of our own transformation, to ensure that the support is available for the wider business.</p>
<h4>Renewi is committed to sustainability. How is treasury helping?</h4>
<p>In our approach to funding, for example, we are linking debt pricing to our corporate social responsibility (CSR) KPIs through green finance. The benefit of being a sustainability-focused company goes well beyond debt pricing though. It is an important discussion point with our existing and potential new equity investors, many of whom are focused on socially responsible investing. I think all businesses should consider using it wherever possible; it is a differentiator to investments that do not contribute environmentally or socially. I don’t see any real downside.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>Hisham Malak, Head of Treasury &amp; Investor Relations at Mubadala Investment Company, details how the treasury department has evolved following the merger between Mubadala Development Company and the International Petroleum Investment Company.</i></p>
<h4>What are the key functions of treasury at Mubadala?</h4>
<p>When I took on my current role I initiated a strategic review of the treasury function to ensure we are best placed to support Mubadala’s ambitious international investment strategy. This followed the merger between Mubadala Development Company and the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) in May last year.</p>
<p>As a treasury team, we are very focused on providing integrated support across the business, ensuring that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations while managing payments, receipts and financial risks effectively. As a company, we have worked hard to integrate the investment platforms and business units so collaboration within Mubadala is second nature.</p>
<h4>Why has effective treasury management become so crucial following the merger between Mubadala Development Company and the International Petroleum Investment Company?</h4>
<p>The biggest impact of the merger has come from the need to place a renewed focus on delivering commercial returns for our shareholder, the government of Abu Dhabi. Our financial mandate has always been central to Mubadala, but we are more active in international capital markets and focused on expanding into sectors and geographies where we think there is significant growth potential. Our treasury team is integral to realising this strategy.</p>
<p>The merger has expanded our global scale and breadth, creating new opportunities for strategic growth and expansion. However, to tap into these opportunities, we need to have a clear line of sight on the micro and the macro context of each investment strategy. That is the critical area I encourage my team to focus on – to become partners in enabling deals but also to provide advice and support to help guide investment strategies.</p>
<p>The critical thing for me is that we have alignment across our four global investment platforms, so we can improve our overall investment strategy and performance. Following the merger, we have continued to deploy significant capital, whether through our US$15bn commitment to the SoftBank Vision Fund or the US$2.1bn acquisition of one of the most extensive petrochemicals facilities in the US, the olefins plant in Geismar, Louisiana, marking a significant entry into the US Gulf Coast market for NOVA Chemicals.</p>
<p>For this reason, I have established an enhanced investor relations function which now sits across the entire team to provide a joined-up point of engagement for our stakeholders. This holistic approach is especially crucial for our bondholders through the GMTN bond programme, enabling more strategic insights into the business.</p>
<h4>What work has been done to ensure treasury is more effective and delivers higher value to shareholders, and why have you focused on these areas?</h4>
<p>When I joined the team, we’d only recently completed the merger. To ensure we are best positioned to provide the support needed, I worked with my team to create some initiatives that would help further develop and adapt the way we worked. The review included a focus on management information systems to ensure we are capturing better data and moving towards real-time insights. My vision is for a mobile app-based solution so that we can access business-critical data on the go.</p>
<p>We have also launched a project around balance-sheet optimisation to manage debt, our interest rate mix and FX risk as efficiently as possible. Other areas I have focused on include looking at our debt strategy more holistically to ensure we have the flexibility needed for the business to either pay down or raise debt quickly.</p>
<p>This work comes hand in hand with a focus on alignment and integration across the business – from the global investment platforms but also in areas like corporate communications and strategy. This has not only enabled us to be better connected to the organisation’s goals but also helped us to communicate with the investment community more effectively.</p>
<h4>How do you hope to evolve the treasury department in the years to come?</h4>
<p>Looking ahead, we will increase our access to capital across the global markets where we operate while maintaining optimal pricing, liquidity and gearing. Our department objectives are to move more towards a value-added treasury, creating value through capital structure optimisation, cash yield enhancement solutions and supporting assets through structured finance solutions.</p>
<p>Beyond this, one of my key ambitions is to ensure that we integrate technology into our operations in a more proactive way. We have a workstream under way to incorporate real-time data analytics and provide access to the critical information we need to make decisions.</p>
<p>Another area that will become increasingly important is our communication with investors and other financial stakeholders. We are committed to providing industry leadership in the way we communicate so that our bondholders are fully engaged with our strategy and progress.</p>
<p>However, other stakeholders like rating agencies and banks, also need to have a dynamic and open relationship with our organisation. Mubadala has led the way on investor communications for many years, and we are focused on building on this momentum to further enhance the understanding of our business and its performance.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>Wei Li-Tuomela, VP, Treasurer China at Stora Enso, explains what makes treasury such a fulfilling profession and shares her views on what skills a modern treasury professional must have.</i></p>
<h4>Tell us about your career. Why treasury?</h4>
<p>I joined Stora Enso after graduating from Helsinki University with a degree in Forest Economics, embarking on the company’s PathBuilder programme – a partnership between Stora Enso and IMD business school focused on leadership and development.</p>
<p>Since finishing the programme I have held multiple roles across the company, including positions in marketing, sales, finance, M&amp;A, business intelligence and communications and, of course, treasury.</p>
<p>I spent five years working under the Group Treasurer in Helsinki. During this time, I worked on the day-to-day running of the treasury, as well as playing a key role in several large transactions and transformational projects. And the more I worked in the treasury department, the more fascinating I found it. As the internal bank of a large corporation, you really get to experience the power of capital.</p>
<h4>How does treasury seek to add value to the organisation in China?</h4>
<p>I believe that a modern treasury department must be more than an operational centre; it must also help drive the strategic objectives of the organisation. There are many areas where we seek to do this, but one that stands out is our work around credit management and controlling counterparty risk.</p>
<p>This is easily an area fraught with difficulty due to the differing KPIs of the treasury and sales departments, which creates a natural conflict. To tackle this, we engage with the sales team rather than dictating to them. This involves reaching out to them, building a standardised credit analysis process that enables them to continue selling while mitigating risks.</p>
<p>We have also put in place a process that sees the credit team issue reminders to the sales representatives regarding due receivables. This enables the sales team to proactively reach out to our customers and ensure they pay on this.</p>
<h4>What is one of the highlights of your career?</h4>
<p>In 2013, I took the career opportunity of a lifetime to set up a new project treasury office with full-scale treasury operations for the company's new mill in China.</p>
<p>As Project Treasurer, it was my responsibility to ensure that there was enough funding at a reasonable cost to finance the construction phase. To say this was a challenge is an understatement, especially given the size of the investment required.</p>
<p>It was also my duty to put in place all the elements required in any treasury department. This included bank connectivity, payment processes and risk management systems. It was incredibly hands-on but very exciting as I had my own sandbox and the ability to shape the treasury in my vision.</p>
<p>Three years on, the mill is up and running and a huge success for the company. Being part of it is one of the highlights of my career to date.</p>
<h4>What skills should the modern treasury professional have?</h4>
<p>As a treasury leader, you need to understand the fundamentals of the role. But cross-departmental and interpersonal leadership, networking and management skills are equally important, if not more important. The way I see it is that IQ can get you so far, but it is EQ – emotional intelligence – that sets you apart.</p>
<p>This is why I want my team to go out and be curious about the business, the people in it and what makes it all come together. I tell them to take every opportunity that comes up and learn from other people. Doing so will make them better treasury leaders in the future.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>Treasury Insights talks to Vasu Reddy, Treasury Leader, GE Africa, about keeping in touch with people and technology, and keeping a healthy mind and body.</i></p>
<h4>Tell us about your role at GE.</h4>
<p>My role gives me some of the most challenging regulatory and commercial environments to manage, currently spanning 25 countries. My core responsibilities include cash management and funding, bank relationships and FX management. With 21 of the 25 countries subject to exchange control regulations, advising the businesses on hedging strategy, repatriation opportunities and optimal investments is a vital element of my day-to-day work. Funding plays a major part here too, so I might advise group treasury, for example, on the suitability of capital injections and how best to optimise working capital for the businesses.</p>
<h4>How did you arrive at your current position?</h4>
<p>I joined GE from Chevron, where I was Senior Financial Manager – Treasury, covering South and Central Africa. Prior to that, I spent a year in banking, and six years in various finance functions at the South African multinational retailer, Woolworths. I started my career with a Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting) and Honours degree in Financial Management. I later earned a Postgraduate Diploma in Accounting and completed the Leadership Executive Programme from the Graduate School of Business, Cape Town. I’m also a member of the Association of Corporate Treasurers, South Africa. I always felt that treasury presented a more exciting opportunity for me than accounts, being both forward and outward looking.</p>
<h4>What is your view on professional training?</h4>
<p>Treasury training can give you a solid grounding in the concepts but in this region, experience is more important. It’s essential to know what the banks can do for treasuries so therefore it is important to keep them close. Anyone can learn what a hedge is; knowing what can and can’t be done to mitigate currency risk in Angola, for example, comes from close involvement with key players. Being immersed in the region means I can take a hands-on approach, seizing every opportunity to keep learning. Having worked in retail, oil and gas, banking, and now a diversified industrial setting, I can see that whilst the treasury principles are the same in most organisations, the way the different sectors operate generates nuances for each; understanding these is essential if I am to add value. This comes from experience.</p>
<h4>What are your main challenges?</h4>
<p>Africa is still considered an emerging market, so currency volatility is strong. Many of the local banks suffer from poor credit ratings, so they are difficult to work with from a risk perspective. Also, the local banking environment faces an under-developed technology infrastructure, so manual processes are rife and service levels can be quite poor. The markets are highly commodity-dependent too so there is a limited banking product set, and any market downturn immediately puts pressure on foreign currency flows and liquidity. There is often little or no FX liquidity in the market; the central banks then take control which usually means allocations are minimal. This means ‘ears to the ground’ to ensure all opportunities are known and decisions are made in good time.</p>
<h4>To what extent do you rely on technology?</h4>
<p>It is a driving force of treasury in all GE operations. We centralise as much as possible and technology takes away most of the manual interventions and the risks this creates. It’s very important in terms of simplification, cost-containment and the creation of an efficient and structured organisation. I believe technology has enabled GE’s African operations to be included in the global roll-out of our standard processing models.</p>
<h4>Any advice for new treasurers?</h4>
<p>Establish a strong accounting and finance background. Spend time in a relevant banking role and, if you can get the proper exposure, then I suggest also spending time in different industries. But remember that a healthy life and work balance is essential to stay focused and calm so nothing falls through the gaps.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Scott Engle, Group Treasurer at AIA, shares with Treasury Insights what made him join the treasury profession and how he has sought to add value to Asia’s largest life insurer.</em></p>
<h4>What do you believe is the role of the modern treasury professional?</h4>
<p>I believe that it is the job of treasury to provide the Group with cost-effective financial flexibility. This means making sure AIA has the appropriate financial resources to take advantage of opportunities as they come along, allowing the business to meet its ambitious growth objectives.</p>
<h4>Please talk us through your career. Why treasury?</h4>
<p>After graduating from Columbia University, I began working on the corporate lending desk with Bank of America in New York, before receiving the opportunity to move to Tokyo to support the bank’s growing franchise in Japan.</p>
<p>After several very happy years in Japan I decided to move back to New York and joined Citi, heading up the bank’s Insurance client coverage business. It was then that I decided to think about shifting over to the corporate side to experience what it was like being on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>The opportunity arose shortly after and I became Treasurer at AIG Consumer Finance Group. Nothing could have prepared me for what happened next, however, when the crisis hit. The company was hit hard by the financial crisis and as a key crisis team member, I was tasked with maintaining and allocating scarce liquidity across all international bank subsidiaries.</p>
<p>I joined AIA in Hong Kong in 2010 after the spinoff from AIG and haven’t looked back. I was given a blank canvas to work with and a long to-do list and have worked hard to build an efficient and best in class treasury department that can support the business’ growth efforts across the region.</p>
<h4>Can you provide some examples of this work?</h4>
<p>Of course. A lot of the focus has been building out AIA’s external and internal financial capacity. I have also worked to position treasury as a strategic department working closely with the business to deliver solutions that support AIA’s on-the-ground operations.</p>
<p>For example, in China – a country that demographically has all the attributes that make it a perfect growth market for a life insurance company – we have been supporting the business’ digitisation efforts. Most notable is our work around collections and disbursements.</p>
<p>This means building seamless digital integration with our banks to drive straight through processing and enabling collection and payments to be made using popular platforms like WeChat Pay and Alipay. These are crucial elements when it comes to creating a first-rate user experience for our customers.</p>
<h4>What excites you most about the future of Asia and the future of treasury in the region?</h4>
<p>I am a close observer of the developments in Asia’s economic and financial infrastructure. One area of particular interest is the advances in payment systems and the proliferation of instant payment methods because, as a business that collects and pays to consumers, AIA stands to benefit from these developments.</p>
<p>The region’s capital markets are also of interest as I see some game-changing developments happening. The dollar has been dominant in the region for some time and because of this, local currency capital markets have not developed as robustly as elsewhere. However, the importance of the dollar is starting to be balanced by other currencies, notably the RMB. This, tied with increased wealth creation across the region, will lead to the expansion of local capital markets, which will prove incredibly important moving forward from an investing and resource access perspective.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>His presidency of the Italian Association of Corporate Treasurers and role as Group Treasurer of global published collectables business, Panini Group, puts Fabrizio Masinelli close enough to the industry to know that co-operation is the way forward.</em></p>
<h4> What does treasury mean to you?</h4>
<p>There is so much more to treasury than just number-crunching. I believe it is a profession based on personal attitudes, creativity and personal qualities – more than most would imagine. I would go as far as saying that treasury is the most beautiful job in the world. For everything we learn over the years, we always have the possibility to put it into practice at some point. When we do, the company immediately benefits. Treasury for me is about creating value. I urge young people thinking about a finance career not to think of treasury as a simple job. Treasury means you must truly know the company you work for and only from this knowledge can you begin to continuously strive to create value. If you have a constant curiosity you will be doing the best job in the world.</p>
<h4>How is treasury seen today in the Panini Group?</h4>
<p>Only a few years ago, treasury was seen principally as being concerned with banking. The financial crisis of 2008 changed all that. With all business functions needing to be up to speed and know how to read market demands we decided to establish a new model for planning and mapping the entire Group’s financial processes and procedures. In this, the aim was to make available all necessary financial resources when they’re needed. Without this action, the whole business runs the risk of not being competitive and then we all lose our value. In our treasury today, everything is guided by two key words: strategy and support. This allows us to work with agility and speed alongside the general management and the finance department. The decision to include treasury, not just as a participant but as a key link in the chain, is positively accepted throughout the business now. In a sense, treasury’s rise to strategic player has been an essential part of Panini’s growth.</p>
<h4>What makes a good treasurer?</h4>
<p>Amongst the push for new technologies, we must never forget that this profession is mainly made of personal qualities born from personal experiences. Human intervention remains the most important part of the treasurer's profession. The depth and breadth of experience necessary to form a successful modern treasurer are precisely what makes the profession so interesting for me. As professionals, we all must love our work but to do the job well, there must be a balanced approach to making decisions and taking risks, along with a heightened capacity to think quickly. As treasurers, we must also exhibit the flair of the entrepreneur when managing corporate finance, and yet also be strong on teamwork.</p>
<h4>How do you rate the need for ‘soft skills’ in treasury?</h4>
<p>These should be considered essential and training in this aspect should be given the level of importance it deserves. I say this for good reason. With treasurers today working with every business area, having a well-developed ability to relate to people undoubtedly helps us to know ourselves and others but, above all, to understand how to deal effectively with many different situations.</p>
<h4>Is it essential for treasurers to get out and about?</h4>
<p>Solid academic achievement can offer an important grounding, but the value of study does not quite reach that of what I call ‘field training’. Attending seminars, conferences and events helps us to know how the outside world is. Having a good ‘network of networks’ is important too, helping us to share issues and problems that others have experienced before us.</p>
<h4>How has your approach to treasury steered your IACT presidency?</h4>
<p>I was elected as President of Associazione Italiana Tesorieri d'Impresa (Italian Association of Corporate Treasurers) in 2016. Since then, one of my key aims has been to create a wider network of associations, bringing together pools of experience that can be shared between many more businesses. I believe this will help nurture the understanding of finance and treasury management amongst many more professionals. I have created a strong team within Panini and my goal is to continue forging the same solidarity amongst treasurers from other companies. We do the same thing, so why not work together?</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Treasury Insights talks to Helen Hanby, Biogen’s Director of International Treasury, about connections, career progress and taking opportunities.</em></p>
<h4> Tell us about your role at Biogen</h4>
<p>I work out of the UK with treasury responsibility for all Biogen entities outside North America. We cover all aspects of treasury including cash and liquidity management, FX trading, balance sheet hedging, bank relationship management, pension plan governance and the company’s ex US corporate cards programme.</p>
<h4>How did you arrive in treasury?</h4>
<p>I describe my career path as opportunistic. I left school mid-way through A-Levels, to work for a bank. I then worked for a national newspaper publisher where I qualified as a management accountant. I then moved to a manufacturing organisation to gain experience of working in a different industry. After a couple of years, I had the chance to move to Germany alongside my then husband-to-be, running the finance and administration functions of the German sales office. When I came back to the UK, Biogen was looking for someone to take on both UK management accounts and international treasury. I think my transferable skills, openness to new experiences, language skills and professional qualifications unlocked the door to treasury for me. When Biogen eventually divided the roles, they gave me the choice and I immediately opted for treasury. From here I progressed via the positions of manager, senior manager, associate director and, since December 2017, director.</p>
<h4>What do you enjoy about treasury?</h4>
<p>I love the fact that it’s ‘real’; it has an impact on the business, looking at present and future rather than historical data. I love the interactions with external stakeholders, meeting with banks, investment companies and other providers – and the interactions with the many internal stakeholders, across different functions and geographies.</p>
<h4>What is the secret of treasury success?</h4>
<p>I think more than ever it is imperative to have strong professional relationships in order to stay abreast of developments. I believe every treasurer should be able to demonstrate strong communication skills as the role becomes more connected with the business. With so much change in the world, it is important for us, as treasurers, not only to build a network of other treasury professionals but also to develop strong relationships with our banks so they are aware of what is going on in Biogen’s business world.</p>
<h4>What activities are you most proud of?</h4>
<p>I’m proud of the work I did on our corporate card programme. Where cards had been outside of treasury, many different programmes had been set up. By talking to our main relationship bank, I could see that through its cash management footprint that we could build a new, consolidated programme.</p>
<p>We started in the UK and rolled out to the rest of Europe, with the programme’s success eventually winning support in the US. We’ve gone from a fragmented programme to a fully global approach. The programme was recognised as an Adam Smith Awards <a href="/adamsmith/2017/winners/bcs-highly-commended-biogen">Best Card Solution Highly Commended</a> in 2017.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to young finance professionals?</h4>
<p>I suggest embracing all the opportunities that come your way, even if they don’t seem obvious at the time. Had I not rather nervously accepted the position in Germany it would never have led me to where I am now. I know I speak from a position of advantage – in that I love what I do – I urge all young professionals to try to move towards things they enjoy doing; we spend so much time at work that it would be a shame not to.</p>
<h4>Do you have the work/life balance right?</h4>
<p>I feel very blessed to have a job that I love, working in a fascinating industry for a very supportive, and flexible, company and manager. After 14 years I still get up in the morning, and look forward to coming in to work. There is a lot to be said for that.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>In this exclusive interview, Amit Baraskar, Vice President &amp; Head – Treasury at Thomas Cook (India) Ltd, discusses his award-winning career in corporate treasury and how he has managed some interesting challenges.</em></p>
<h4> Tell us about your career. Why corporate treasury?</h4>
<p>I am a qualified Chartered Accountant and have always worked in finance. Initially, I worked for several SMEs across India, heading up their finance teams. This was a fantastic learning experience and I gained exposure to a variety of financial techniques.</p>
<p>It was during these years that I developed a flair for corporate treasury and realised that this is where I could add the most value to an organisation. I therefore decided to join the Thomas Cook (India) Ltd (TCIL) treasury team in 2007 and focus on this area full time.</p>
<p>I have deviated away from corporate treasury once or twice over the past decade. For example, I spent some time running one of TCIL’s Business Commercial and Credit function. But even then, I could not fully let go of corporate treasury and held onto some treasury responsibilities. Because of this, I moved back into treasury full-time and without a second thought when I was offered the chance to lead the team.</p>
<p>I have accepted that I am a ‘treasury guy’ and it is where I want to spend the rest of my career.</p>
<h4>How has the role of treasury at TCIL changed in recent years?</h4>
<p>Treasury at TCIL has always been unique because of the business lines it supports. We operate like a typical treasury function supporting the Group’s operations in India, Hong Kong, Mauritius and Lanka on one hand. Then, on the other, we also operate the Dealing Room (back- and mid-office) much like a bank to support TCIL’s foreign exchange business across India.</p>
<p>Then, last year, following TCIL’s acquisition of Kuoni’s global network of destination management specialists, our job became even more complex. This is because almost overnight TCIL became a multinational company with a presence in over 20 markets. This posed a huge challenge to treasury because not only did we need to integrate the new business into TCIL’s existing operations, we also had to put processes and controls in place in unfamiliar markets.</p>
<p>At the time, one of the biggest challenges was simply managing the team’s time because we had so much to do. I solved this fairly quickly by assigning different countries to different people, empowering them to become specialists in that market to provide maximum value.</p>
<h4>What else has TCIL had to deal with recently?</h4>
<p>In India, there have been a few big issues that we have had to deal with, for example, the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017. This is because it was introduced in a hurry and as a result, the financial services industry across India did not have time to implement GST properly.</p>
<p>This has resulted in the delay of many financial transactions across India. For TCIL and the whole of corporate India, one of the biggest issues has been the turnaround time for collections of receivables, which has increased greatly. This really hurts organisations, because every day that you are unable to collect your cash, you are incurring an interest cost that negatively impacts the business’ financials.</p>
<p>Another regulatory change that created a challenge earlier to this was demonetisation. This was a rollercoaster ride because TCIL’s foreign exchange business has a heavy rupee cash requirement. Demonetisation put extreme pressure on this business line as we were struggling to get the banknotes required to serve our customers. Thankfully, we were able to work with our banking partners to solve this issue after a few days. This did mean going overboard and withdrawing a huge amount of cash from the banking system, but ultimately it kept the business going. It was a tough time, but my team managed it beautifully.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Rakesh Kochhar has been working in treasury in Japan for a decade. He tells Treasury Insights what this experience has been like and why more treasurers should consider a spell working in the land of the rising sun.</em></p>
<h4> Why is Nissan’s global treasury function in Japan?</h4>
<p>No matter what the business, treasury should be where the headquarters are. The job of the global treasury function is to be strategic and part of the management committee making decisions around risk management and M&amp;A, you cannot do this if you are not sitting where the decisions are made.</p>
<p>For our business, global treasury being in Japan has other advantages when it comes to banking relationships. This is because the Japanese banks, which form a large part of our banking syndicate, value having face to face relationships with clients.</p>
<h4>What is it like managing a global treasury function from Yokohama, Japan? How does it compare to when you have worked in other regions?</h4>
<p>I have led treasury teams in the United States and Singapore and I really do not see much difference between managing treasury from these locations and Japan.</p>
<p>Japan has all the components required to make an excellent global treasury centre location. There is lots of good talent available, there is great technology available and all the major banks are present in the country.</p>
<p>In fact, in some cases, it is easier to run treasury in Japan, especially in comparison to the United States. For example, we use Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) as one of the main sources of funding. In Japan, I can complete a transaction in ten days. In the US, it takes 30 days minimum because of various reporting that must be completed.</p>
<h4>Why haven’t all Japanese companies set up similar structures?</h4>
<p>There is an imbalance in the level of treasury sophistication amongst Japan Inc. with many departments still very operationally focused and senior management is yet to see the value a strategic treasury department can add. This is often down to the way that Japanese companies have developed, with many taking a very decentralised approach to business. There has also been a lack of openness towards global best practice, which has also led to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>As a result, you often find many companies outsourcing their treasury function to their banking partners. This is clearly not ideal as there is a big conflict of interests being created. It is also hampering the broader development of the treasury function in Japan.</p>
<p>Nissan is quite unique in this respect. We have a multicultural senior leadership team that has brought in global best practices in various functions including treasury and across the business. As a result, we operate much like any other multinational, whilst remaining true to our Japanese heritage.</p>
<h4>What impact is digitisation having in Japan?</h4>
<p>Japan has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to technology. I remember when I first arrived here ten years ago people were using NFC payments with their phones to pay for train tickets, which was streets ahead of how people were behaving in the US. This continues today and Japan remains at the forefront of innovation, especially in the automobile industry.</p>
<p>From a treasury and finance perspective, lots is happening to upgrade the infrastructure in Japan. The big banks are also very keen to explore new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. There perhaps is not as much noise being made here when compared to Singapore, for example, but there is lots happening.</p>
<h4>What would you say to any treasury professionals with the opportunity to come and work in Japan?</h4>
<p>Do it. It is a fantastic place to live for me and my family. There is lots to do and it is incredibly safe.</p>
<p>From a professional point of view, it can provide a unique and rewarding challenge. In fact, I am surprised there are not more treasurers from overseas working in Japan already. But as the country begins to open further to immigration I expect more to come and help boost the status of the profession in the country.</p>




<p>Last week, Treasury Insights reported on how many Japanese companies are looking to establish a global treasury centre in Japan. <a href="/2018/02/japanese-corporate-treasury-returning-home-ttti">Find out why</a>.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Now that the first month of the year is over and treasury departments are back running at full throttle, Venkat ES shares some of the key trends in the region and what treasury teams should be doing to harness the opportunities.</em></p>
<h4> What were the key corporate treasury trends in 2017?</h4>
<p>Since the global financial crisis, there has been a clear trend of treasury becoming more strategic and taking a more prominent role within the organisation, be it global multinationals or Asian corporates. In 2017, however, what I started to see very clearly is the increasingly strategic role that treasury teams within Asian domiciled multinational companies are beginning to take.</p>
<p>This is no surprise. As these companies become more global and reach the upper echelons of the Fortune 100 they are exposed to more complexity and risk than ever before. Treasury is the department best placed to manage this and, as a result, is receiving increased attention from the Board and senior management.</p>
<p>The challenge for many treasury teams in fast-growing Asian multinationals is that they have been relying on outdated technology. This is changing quickly though and we are seeing many of these companies adopting pioneering technology, leapfrogging their competitors and becoming best-in-class. The advantage these companies have is that unlike their European and US peers they do not have to undo a spaghetti bowl of legacy technology to push ahead.</p>
<p>This theme ties into the broader focus on technology from all corporates across the region. Whilst there has been lots of talk about AI, blockchain, machine learning and robotics for quite some time, 2017 was the year when genuine treasury use cases started to emerge.</p>
<p>Despite this, treasury departments are unable to devote all the time and resources they would like to harness new technologies. This is because a lot of their time is spent managing the dark side of technology: cyber-risk.</p>
<p>Away from technology, market instability once again troubled treasurers across the region last year – a hangover from the turbulent geopolitical events of 2016. Interestingly, this has brought with it a renewed focus on bank relationships. Treasurers are ensuring that they are with banks that are safe, committed to the region, can play the advisor role and move mountains in times of need.</p>
<h4>What do you expect to be the big trends that emerge in 2018?</h4>
<p>Treasurers of US companies in Asia will certainly be occupied with managing the impacts of US tax reform this year. For the past twelve months, there was lots of speculation about what this reform might look like. Now that we know, treasurers are having to quickly assess the implications and build plans around whether they will be holding the cash or repatriating it.</p>
<p>More broadly speaking, the focus on technology will continue. Many treasury teams want to stop talking about the potential of these technologies and begin using them. It is becoming a key performance indicator for them.</p>
<p>This poses an interesting challenge for banks, who will be delivering many of these solutions to clients. I truly believe that 2018 is the year we need to move beyond proof of concept when talking about new technologies and begin focusing on proof of value.</p>
<p>The final trend that I see is the continued emergence of real-time payment systems across the region. Treasurers are taking an increased interest in understanding how they can be used to benefit their businesses.</p>
<h4>What will these mean for corporate treasury teams and what should they be doing to prepare?</h4>
<p>It is a cliché, but there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. Each treasury teams need to run an internal audit to see where they are doing well, what areas can be improved, and what will deliver the most value to the business. From this, they can begin building a plan to revolutionise the department in the coming years.</p>
<p>One thing that I think all treasury teams should be doing more of is engaging their banking partners on this journey. We have our ear to the ground and are witnessing the emerging trends first hand. We want to pass on this knowledge to our clients and become their strategic advisors.</p>
<p>By working together, we can also begin to co-create solutions, experimenting with new technology and testing previously untried ideas and concepts. We have had some great success doing this with our clients over the years and we encourage more to come and have a chat with us, to talk through what is possible.</p>

<p><em>For almost 20 years, Dheeraj ‘Raj’ Chadha has overseen the financial activities of UK-based global connectivity solutions group, TeleAdapt. He is a firm believer in getting out there and talking to people, making contacts and learning from anyone and everyone.</em></p>
<h4> Describe your role</h4>
<p>In almost two decades in the finance function of TeleAdapt my role has changed dramatically. We have a global outlook but the business is relatively small which tends to expose me to a lot of different and rapidly evolving areas, way beyond the usual finance remit.</p>
<p>I have close involvement in manufacturing, operations and sales and marketing, for example, and this brings a very wide perspective, helping me to understand and connect with the business.</p>
<p>In fact, the degree of diversity I have in my working life is similar to running a business by myself. It’s a good challenge, and every day is different so it can be like firefighting.</p>
<h4>How did you arrive in your current position?</h4>
<p>I came to the UK in 1994 via Malaysia, where I worked for Coopers Lybrand (now PwC). My initial goal was to complete my Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) qualifications before embarking on an MSc in Finance.</p>
<p>I gained practical accountancy experience with a number of firms in different sectors before being offered the position of UK financial controller at TeleAdapt in late 1999. Since then I have taken on the roles of Group Financial Controller and Group Financial Director, and was made CFO in 2007.</p>
<h4>Tell me about your work in China</h4>
<p>Most of our manufacturing has been shifted to Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta. China is going to become the biggest hospitality market in the world in the next decade, so we direct a lot of effort here.</p>
<p>It’s a difficult market to penetrate because away from the large international chains, the hospitality communications sector is driven largely by price and ‘who you know, not what you know’. The culture of the Chinese market is something that must be learnt and cannot be side-stepped by foreign businesses. Having worked in China for so long, I have come to the conclusion that you just go with the flow. It has evolved a lot over the years and it still has a long way to go. But for us, the money is there.</p>
<h4>What makes a good CFO?</h4>
<p>Dynamism and creativity. To be truly effective, you also have to get out there as much as possible. This means a lot of networking and membership of relevant associations. I regularly go to seminars and conferences because meeting and talking with new people raises the possibility of learning new ideas and new ways of working.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible to creatively integrate ideas from other sectors and industries into my work, helping me to think through problems and to evolve the business. Getting out and about enhances creativity; staying in the office will not give you the exposure and the opportunity to learn so it holds you back.</p>
<h4>What is you view on soft skills?</h4>
<p>I believe well-developed soft skills are essential to keep staff motivated and happy. As CFO, I rely heavily on them. I want them to feel responsible and be part of the business because if it grows and does well, we all grow and do well. The ability to read people and make good judgements does not come from sitting behind a desk: it comes from travelling and meeting people.</p>
<h4>What is your advice to corporate finance newcomers?</h4>
<p>For those just starting out, my advice is always to be honest and retain your integrity. Actions will always speak louder than words so if you promise something, you do it. I sometimes feel that younger generations are too absorbed with technology as a communication tool. To them, I say your physical presence and personality will win through in the end.</p>

<p><em>Treasury Insights hears from Patrick Tai, Finance Director at CNOOC and Shell Petrochemicals Company Limited, who documents his career and some of his proudest achievements to date.</em></p>
<h4> Tell us about your career</h4>
<p>Prior to working in corporate treasury, I spent most of my career in various infrastructure and project finance roles. I began at Hopewell Holdings Ltd and after that moved to the Project Finance desk at ANZ in Hong Kong and Singapore, where I was largely responsible for the execution and origination of advisory, with a primary focus on China.</p>
<p>Whilst working at the bank I gained a reputation as a China structured finance expert and Shell approached me to run a short-term project in 2001 that would see me lead the financing negotiations with banks in China for the private sector financing in Asia at that time. After completing the short-term assignment, I stayed on with Shell, working in Beijing and then London as a Senior Advisor in the global M&amp;A and Financing team. I then moved back to Hong Kong, managing the group’s M&amp;A and portfolio projects in the region as Shell’s Asia Downstream Portfolio General Manager.</p>
<p>This desire to learn about the business was one of the catalysts for assuming the corporate treasury role at CNOOC and Shell Petrochemicals Company (CSPC) when it became available in 2008. Having been largely focused on transactions my whole career, the move to treasury was appealing because it gave me the opportunity to see the real business and the impact my work was having directly on the bottom line.</p>
<h4>What did you enjoy most about working in corporate treasury?</h4>
<p>I most enjoyed the fact that my role in corporate treasury went beyond day-to-day cash management and exposed me to areas such as insurance and risk management. Whilst I was working in treasury, I looked for opportunities to participate in several cross-functional projects unrelated to finance. For example, I worked on a special project on people strategy and I found that others in the business were pleasantly surprised to see ‘finance people’ taking an enterprise-first mindset to deliver value to the business as a whole, not just to one department.</p>
<p>I believe that the time I spent in this role expanding my skill-set helped me make the step up to finance director. Indeed, any role in finance requires strong fundamentals. However, to be considered for those strategic finance roles you have to think beyond your departmental boundaries and transcend the business.</p>
<h4>What professional achievements are you most proud of?</h4>
<p>I am extremely proud of the work the finance team has done over the past few years to fund the expansion of CSPC’s business. This work has not only seen CSPC achieve the most competitive commercial terms amongst any corporate in China but has also seen it receive external recognition, in the form of an Adam Smith Award Asia from Treasury Today Asia.</p>
<p>To do this we have been pragmatic and created optionality by diversifying funding sources. It would be very risky for us to rely on one tranche of funding. We have therefore worked hard to make sure that we have several competitively priced debt facilities at our fingertips when we need them.</p>
<p>Given that CSPC is extremely capital-intensive, we continue to work hard in this area. Indeed, the cost of borrowing can be the difference between boom and bust, so we continue to benchmark ourselves against our peers to ensure we are staying competitive. There is also still plenty of room to optimise internally and ensure that we are getting value for every dollar.</p>

<p><em>Ship management is a unique industry with some unique challenges. Treasury Today Asia sat down with Aiden Fung, Group Treasurer at Anglo-Eastern Univan Group (Anglo-Eastern), to discuss his approach at the recent J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific Treasurers Forum in Tokyo.</em></p>
<h4>What is your role at Anglo-Eastern and what have you done since joining the department?</h4>
<p>I head up the group treasury department at Anglo-Eastern. This is a new function that was created when I joined the company in mid-2016 as a result of its significant expansion and increasing complexity.</p>
<p>Prior to my arrival, the treasury was extremely decentralised from a geographical and organisational perspective. A large part of my role initially was to begin centralising our operations. Today we have the group treasury function that I head, looking after all the strategic and process improvement aspects of treasury. Additionally, we have teams in shared service centres located in our key markets looking after the more operational parts of the department.</p>
<p>As we have been centralising I have also been organising the department, building a clean and efficient machine that can support the company as it continues to grow. The first thing I did to achieve this was issue a global banking RFP so that I could rationalise our banking group, putting in place a smaller tranche of trusted partners who could support us moving forward.</p>
<p>Internally, I have also worked to clean up our databases and organise the data in a structured and logical manner. This, along with our banking clean-up, has created a backbone for us to be a truly strategic and value-adding treasury.</p>
<h4>What have been the biggest challenges on this journey?</h4>
<p>Personally, when I joined Anglo-Eastern I thought that I could just replicate the treasury structure deployed by my previous employers. However, I very quickly learnt that this would not be possible because of the uniqueness of Anglo-Eastern and the ship management industry.</p>
<p>As an example of this, our business model is based on receiving funding from our clients which we then distribute to our suppliers, such as the shipping companies and the crew that staff the ships. The growth of the business means we now must process many more of these high volume, low value payments and this has posed some unique KYC challenges.</p>
<p>This is because the ships may be on routes that pass by some sensitive countries. Also, the staff on the ships are from all over the world, including some high-risk markets for banks. Because of this, our payments quite often alert the bank's compliance engines and with bank KYC becoming increasingly stringent it means that there is a lot more work for us to do to make these payments.</p>
<p>My solution is to build a robotic tool that can automatically reply to a bank’s KYC questions. The concept is to recognise the key points in the bank's question, scanning our database and pulling out the relevant information, sending it back to the bank. But as mentioned previously, this is something that could not be achieved without having a robust and trusted banking group and clean database.</p>
<h4>How have you encouraged the rest of the organisation to buy into what treasury is doing?</h4>
<p>Change management is a huge part of what we do. We are a new department within the organisation and we have some innovative ideas of how we can save costs, extract value and generally improve how the business runs. But at the same time, we must remember that Anglo-Eastern was founded in 1974 and has been hugely successful doing things a certain way.</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial that treasury takes the time to go out into the business and listen to all the stakeholders, striking a balance between the old and the new. By doing so we can all move forward together and ensure the company can continue to be successful in the years to come.</p>
<h4>What are your plans for 2018?</h4>
<p>2018 is shaping up to be a busy year. Top of mind is fine-tuning some treasury and payment processes and rolling these out globally – you can only move forward when the whole organisation is moving together in one direction.</p>
<p>There is also a little bit more work to do cleaning up the system so that we can continue to harness the data that we have and build new tools that allow us to analyse it.</p>
<p>From a broader change management perspective, it is important to establish a set of global KPIs so that the different departments can be steered in the right direction. The challenge then will be communicating these and pushing forward with the rest of our plans.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>At the recent J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific Treasurers’ Forum in Tokyo, Treasury Today Asia sat down exclusively with Sridhar Kanthadai, Head of Treasury Services, Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan to hear about his first six months in the role and the part data is playing in transforming how banks and corporates operate.</em></p>
<h4>What have been your initial impressions since beginning your new role at J.P. Morgan?</h4>
<p>It is an exciting time to be joining J.P. Morgan here in Asia Pacific. The firm has outlined its commitment to the region and we are investing heavily so that we can continue to deliver best in class solutions to a focused group of clients.</p>
<p>Our emphasis remains on those top-tier corporates from Europe and the US doing business in Asia, as well as Asia’s emerging multinational corporations. From a banker’s perspective, it is exciting working with these companies because they often have inherently complex operations across multiple markets. Our strengths around cross border, technology-led solutions, liquidity management and payment will help them become more efficient here in Asia and globally.</p>
<h4>You have worked for some time across Asia Pacific, how has the treasury profession evolved and what role do treasury teams play in their organisations today?</h4>
<p>When I first started working in this space, the trend was for multinational corporations from Europe and the US to replicate their successful treasury models in the Asia Pacific region. The primary job of the treasury teams here was to manage risk.</p>
<p>Post-crisis, there has been a lot of change in the way that treasury departments operate and their role within the organisation. As a result, treasurers here in the region are becoming more strategic, focused not just on managing risk but also bringing new ideas to the table that can help deliver better returns and allow the organisation to thrive.</p>
<p>This has been especially true in recent years, given the rise of eCommerce in the region. Nearly all companies are being impacted by this trend and it is often treasury teams stepping in and facilitating the organisation’s shift to online sales by putting in place the correct collections and reconciliation tools.</p>
<h4>What are the big challenges that corporates in Asia Pacific are having to manage and what is the bank doing to help them overcome these challenges?</h4>
<p>Regulatory changes always pose challenges to corporates here in the region. And for treasury teams the biggest issue is making sure they are compliant with the regulations whilst also ensuring the treasury is operating efficiently.</p>
<p>For the most part, regulatory change in the region is well documented, such as the implementation of GST in India. In these instances, corporates that have plenty of time to speak with their banking partners are better prepared for the changes. The sudden changes that happen overnight, however, like the revision of FX rules in Malaysia, pose more of a challenge. These require treasurers to be proactive in understanding what it means for their flows and what they need to do moving forward. Banks can add a lot of value here by being strategic advisors.</p>
<p>Tied to shifting regulatory change is the drive for efficiency in treasury departments. The new role that treasurers are playing means that they are having to do a lot more day-to-day. However, they often have to do so without access to additional resources. It is therefore our role as a bank to enable our clients to drive this efficiency by providing them solutions so that they can become efficient in the most cost-effective way.</p>
<p>Data also has an important role to play. At J.P. Morgan, we help clients with an industry benchmarking exercise, which enables corporates to understand where they stand compared to their peers, where they need to go and, most importantly, what they need to do to get there.</p>
<h4>How important is the use of big data and technology more broadly to your clients?</h4>
<p>All corporates are interested in technology but they are at different points in their journey. For instance, established multinationals that have the necessary technology in place are now upgrading and future-proofing it. On the other hand, you also have emerging Asian clients who may not have much technology in place but are looking to invest. Regardless, all companies are embracing technology at some level.</p>
<p>In respect of big data, I believe that we have only seen the beginning of what is possible and the insights this technology can deliver. Its continued usage is certainly going to have significant impact on how corporations operate and create many new opportunities for them to become more efficient and profitable.</p>
<p>However, corporates will not be able to achieve this overnight. A big issue is that data is often stored in a way that cannot be readily analysed. There needs to be some work done to standardise the data and ensuring it is consistent before companies can begin analysing it in a truly meaningful way.</p>
<p>This will happen, but it will take time and investment. One way we are looking to support corporates with this is by leveraging APIs and exposing the data that we have with our clients so that they can easily access and begin to analyse this.</p>
<h4>What should be on the treasury agenda for 2018?</h4>
<p>Technology will continue to be a key focus for treasurers. Digitisation has become a bit of a buzzword but from our perspective, clients are asking about how to improve efficiencies around their communications with us as well as the accuracy around data exchange. J.P. Morgan’s virtual branch is a good example of how we are helping corporates in this digitisation journey.</p>
<p>As operational systems digitise, cyber threats and fraud remain critical risks for corporates. The reality is that the number of firms experiencing cyber-attacks is increasing and treasurers need to be looking for solutions to safeguard their firms. Investing in fraud protection is a key focus at the bank, not just in how we protect ourselves but also to create a safety net for our clients.</p>
<p>More broadly, treasurers need to continue adding value to their organisations by coming up with new ideas to help them grow the business. And it is our role as a bank and trusted partner to guide them on this journey, and a lot of our investments are to make it easier, safer and cheaper for customers to do business with us.</p>

<p><em>Darrell Thomas, VP and Treasurer at Harley-Davidson and recent Treasury Today Adam Smith Award winner talks about the unique nature of the treasury department at Harley-Davidson and the work it is doing to support the business.</em></p>

<br/>
<h4>What responsibilities does the treasury have at Harley-Davidson?</h4>
<p>In addition to the primary treasury function of managing the cash resources of the company – this includes collections and investments, to borrowings and shareholder distributions – we are also charged with overall risk management. This involves a host of activities including insurance, worldwide business continuity management and financial risk management measures such as hedging currency and commodity exposures.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we look after the relationships the company has with banks and ratings agencies. We also manage the assets in the retirement plans as well as the firm’s working capital and capital structure. It is a lot, but it doesn’t feel that big because I have a great team supporting me.</p>
<h4>Why does business continuity planning sit within treasury?</h4>
<p>It is a function that does not necessarily have a natural home and I felt my risk management team and I could add some value to it. It has worked well. We have identified the key processes around the organisation and put a business continuity plan around these which informs each how to continue to operate in a range of disaster scenarios bearing in mind normal-day-to-day activities or support levels may not be available for some time.</p>
<p>All processes have been divided into high, medium and low tiers, giving each a degree of prioritisation. High priority processes, depending on the event, would determine which organisation attracts the resources first. For example, in the event of a major IT-centre outage resulting in a company-wide impact, tiering determines which processes must come back online first.</p>
<h4>How is treasury supporting the organisation’s ten-year strategic plan?</h4>
<p>The whole company is focused on the ten-year strategic plan to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders globally. Everything we do in treasury is designed to support that plan. When we work with other parts of the organisation we make sure we are all working together.</p>
<p>There are many ways that we support the organisation, but most crucially we must ensure cash resources are available, in a timely fashion, to support the company’s various marketing and product development programmes.</p>
<p>In other areas such as FX, we have also worked to protect the company against downsides as the recent strengthening of the dollar has not been in our favour. Thankfully we employ an active currency hedging programme, but this only buys us time. Therefore, we have been working with the procurement teams to source buying opportunities in currencies the company is exposed to; using local currency to meet local expenses, creating natural and longer-term hedges.</p>
<h4>How is treasury using technology to improve how it supports the business?</h4>
<p>Technology plays a key role for us, especially when it comes to reducing the number of manual tasks we must do. The most important part of this has been the rollout of a truly global treasury workstation, executed under a more comprehensive five-year game-plan to deliver standardisation.</p>
<p>This has improved our processes significantly, and reduced risk to our organisation. Also, the automation of low-value, manual work has enabled headcount to be halved in accounts payable and freed up people to staff international treasury positions and add more value.</p>
<p>Having laid the digital foundations, my eye is now on additional opportunities from AI solutions as a means of further increasing the productivity of our treasury staff.</p>

<p><em>As an international content marketing agency focused on the airline industry, Spafax is an organisation well versed in the complexities of doing international business. Simon Ogden, Chief Operating Officer at Spafax explains how it has adapted to meet changing needs and why it is crucial to build and maintain a positive corporate culture.</em></p>
<h4>Please provide some background information on yourself and your career.</h4>
<p>I graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a degree in economics and went on from there into management at McDonalds, following which, I professionally qualified as an accountant by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and joined Aspen. In 2000 I joined Spafax as CFO and became COO in 2013.</p>
<h4>What are the key trends/issues that global businesses like Spafax are currently facing and what strategies are the company using to overcome these?</h4>
<p>In common with many industries, our business is tackling technological developments head-on. These developments not only shape what we are able to provide to our clients but also, and crucially, the level of provision end-users expect. Consumers’ and business’ experiences are shaped by the ever-increasing technology around them.</p>
<p>This has shifted what people expect from their products and services and companies like ours must respond to this and adapt at a fast pace. At Spafax we are doing so by building products and services that ‘feel’ like people expect, but provide content beyond what end-users can experience elsewhere. In addition, Spafax has moved to a strategy where what we produce is platform-agnostic and can be monetised by our clients. Taken together, these help us maintain and grow our world-leading position in our industry.</p>
<h4>Is the business landscape more complicated now than it was ten years ago?</h4>
<p>Yes and no. The airline industry tends to go through cycles. Ten years ago, airlines were in a more difficult place with increasing competition. Today, competition is fierce but not increasing. Instead, cost pressures are paramount with every dollar counting and the need to reduce spend across the board.</p>
<h4>As the organisation has expanded around the world, what difficulties has this created in terms of creating a unified corporate culture and shared set of values?</h4>
<p>One of the largest challenges whenever a firm expands into a new market or region is the need to get the right type of people from the get go. The people you hire must be a cultural fit from day one and be able to maintain your corporate culture as the new office or enterprise grows.</p>
<p>At Spafax we know how important it is to get this right. Whenever a new office opens, hire the right people at the top and ensure our corporate culture is spread from there. Local leadership is vital in making any venture a success and they will only be able to do so if they are in line with a unified corporate culture and shared set of values.</p>
<h4>How important has the company’s finance department become in recent years to help it overcome some of these challenges?</h4>
<p>As part of WPP, our finance department is among the most important we have. To this end we have regional finance directors in the Americas and EMEA, a streamlined reporting process and systems in place to manage the multitude of currencies and tax regulations we deal in.</p>
<p>Without these processes, systems and staff, Spafax simply could not operate on a global scale – meaning we could not operate at all.</p>
<h4>What top tips would you offer fellow executives to help them manage teams that span multiple markets?</h4>
<p>The most important thing is to hire well. Any problem that presents itself can be overcome with the right people in the right positions. Any new hire must be a cultural fit, but beyond that I would advise to look for attitudes rather than absolute qualifications. The need for adaptability is greater than the need for the exact experience.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Vincent Liu, Asia Commercial Treasury Leader, GE, explains why he decided to follow a career in corporate treasury, and provides insight into the thinking that saw GE Asia Treasury take home the coveted Adam Smith Awards Asia Top Treasury Team 2016 award.</em></p>
<h4>What made you decide to follow a career in treasury?</h4>
<p>I began my career as an accountant. It was an obvious choice because I was not very good at arts or science so there were not too many options left.</p>
<p>As an accountant, I primarily focused on tax, business consultancy and some auditing. This gave me a very strong foundation in finance, in understanding balance sheets and how different businesses make and lose money.</p>
<p>After a time, I came to a crossroads in my career. This is when I decided to move into treasury. I decided on this because treasury leverages a lot of the knowledge I have gained in accounting. But unlike accounting, treasury also matched my desire to play a significant role in governing the direction of the business.</p>
<p>I spent just under 20 years working in bank treasury, primarily at Morgan Stanley as the regional treasurer for Asia. There are not too many differences between working in bank treasury and working in corporate treasury, apart from that I do not have to wear a tie here at GE!</p>
<h4>What has it been like leading the GE treasury as the company evolves?</h4>
<p>Since I have been working at GE, the company has undergone a monumental shift, pivoting away from financial services to become a digital industrial company.</p>
<p>This shift is not just redefining the company, it is also redefining the role of treasury. Our objective is to create a smaller, nimbler and more impactful treasury that can better support the organisation and its customers as it enters a new era. As a result, my role has changed considerably in recent years. Today I am a ‘change manager’ as much as a treasurer.</p>
<p>Part of this evolution has required us to complete many high-profile projects. These include the creation of a pioneering cross-border liquidity structure, implementing a single platform solution for all FX payments, enhancing working capital efficiency and creating a centralised transaction processing centre.</p>
<p>These changes have forged a contemporary treasury organisation that is integrated into the core of GE’s business operations.</p>
<h4>How important is team work when undertaking so many projects?</h4>
<p>A strong, talented team is crucial to the success of any treasury team. But a diversified workforce is more important than more people. Having competent and commercial-minded people in the team is vital. Having the right people in place can solve 80% of the challenges that you face.</p>
<p>Something I really want to see from my team is well-honed soft skills. I believe that skills that enable one to be a better leader, cope with adversaries and communicate effectively are critically important for the modern treasurer. These are attributes I look for when hiring and I would advise any aspiring treasurer to focus on soft skills just as much as the technical skills.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Miguel Trinidad, Corporate Treasurer at Mexichem, believes that treasury is about much more than the management of cash. Here he explains how he thinks a treasury should act and why having a talented team is crucial.</em></p>
<h4>Tell us about your career path, how did you arrive at your current position?</h4>
<p>My first job was with a bank after graduating from the Monterrey Institute of Technology (Tecnológico de Monterrey) with a degree in economics with a specific focus on corporate finance. This was only a short stint though as I soon joined the treasury at CEMEX to work on various projects including, client financing schemes, credit risk management, asset financing and lease portfolio management.</p>
<p>At CEMEX, I was lucky to be able to work in different countries in Europe, including Latvia, Germany, France, Ireland and the UK, and build up a wide-range of treasury and leadership skills especially after being promoted to Treasury Director for Northern Europe and the UK.</p>
<p>In 2009, I left CEMEX after receiving an interesting offer to take on the Group Treasurer role at NATRA, a mid-cap based in Madrid. I was later promoted to CFO in 2012.</p>
<p>I returned home to Mexico to become Group Treasurer at Mexichem in 2014. The chance to lead the treasury for a truly global multinational in expansion mode was an opportunity I had prepared for during my career path. What also excited me was that I would be given the mandate to take the treasury department to the next level and rebuild its overall operating model, creating a truly strategic global function.</p>
<h4>What are the chief requirements for a modern treasury department?</h4>
<p>Treasury is an increasingly important function that needs to be intimately involved in all corners of the business to help identify and proactively manage risks and facilitate growth. These are the core objectives of the strategic treasury.</p>
<p>To be a strategic treasury you need a team who looks at the bigger picture while keeping an eye on the details; take a global outlook while building local understanding and be technically skilled while holding management level soft skills. I also believe that the strategic treasurer should be knowledgeable while retaining a desire to keep on learning.</p>
<h4>How has this philosophy enabled the Mexichem treasury to support the business?</h4>
<p>We have worked hard to make sure that the voice of treasury and corporate finance is heard across the business. We start with the basics, explaining and showing the purpose and value of the treasury function to the business units. Once this elementary education is complete, the next stage is to demonstrate how the treasury really adds value.</p>
<p>I work hard analysing the local business units and approach the operations and business heads with suggestions for how they can improve their performance through various treasury related projects. These have been largely based around improving the working capital management of the business units and driving payments efficiency.</p>
<p>This work has thrust the treasury department into the consciousness of the business units and they know that we can help them and ultimately drive further value for them.</p>
<h4>How important has your team been on this journey?</h4>
<p>Having a talented team is vital. I spend a lot of time ensuring that my staff are given challenging projects and training to become well-rounded treasury and finance professionals. It is about offering people the opportunity and tools to harness their skills and strengthen their expertise to maximise the value that they offer the organisation and to ensure they can constantly improve.</p>

<p><em>Sean Kidney, CEO and Co-Founder at the Climate Bonds Initiative candidly tells Treasury Today that more needs to be done to promote green bonds if we are to halt the negative impact that humans are having on the planet.</em></p>
<h4>What makes a bond ‘green’ and what is the difference between a labelled and non-labelled green bond?</h4>
<p>In theory, a green bond is a bond issued by a government, corporation, financial institution or bi-lateral organisation with the proceeds being invested in green projects. In practice, however, the definition is more nuanced.</p>
<p>This is because green bonds typically come in two forms. There are labelled green bonds – bonds that conform with ICMA’s <a href="https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/green-social-and-sustainability-bonds/green-bond-principles-gbp/" target="_blank">Green Bond Principles</a>. And there are non-labelled green bonds – bonds that were not marketed as green and do not comply with these principles, but where the bond proceeds are going directly to green projects, wind energy project bonds for example. We call these “climate-aligned” bonds.</p>
<p>In 2016, US$93bn of labelled green bonds were issued by a range of companies around the world. These though only accounted for 17% of <a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/resources/publications/bonds-climate-change-2016" target="_blank">climate-aligned bonds</a> - most of the bonds issued were non-labelled.</p>
<p>If an investor is willing to do the due diligence on climate-aligned bonds then there is a much bigger pool to choose from than green-labelled. Solar company bonds could be regarded, for example, as green by default. Even if they are just funding working capital through the bond, these companies are still investing in green projects, meaning their bonds can be classed as green.</p>
<p>However, many investors say that they prefer to focus on labelled green bonds as it is easier to report back on these to their clients. It makes their lives easier as it reduces friction.</p>
<p>Reducing friction is always important to growing markets. Labelling will, therefore, be very important going forward in bringing in more investors.</p>
<h4>Why is the green bond market seen as an important weapon in the battle against climate change?</h4>
<p>Climate change is an extraordinary challenge facing the world community, fuelled by a mix of continuing increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and environmental feedback loops that threaten uncontrollable change.</p>
<p>To prevent this there needs to be a rapid and global shift from emission-producing to clean-energy generation.</p>
<p>A recent International Energy Authority report estimated that US$10.5trn is required in the coming two decades to fund the transition to a low-carbon economy, at a pace rapid enough to head off runaway climate change. A major report conducted by WWF corroborated that figure.</p>
<p>There are not adequate public funds to meet this challenge; that means engaging private capital, including the largest market of all, the US$100trn bond market.</p>
<p>Hitting this target would require investment equivalent to 1.5% a year of the world’s institutional investment fund assets, every year for just ten years. This can’t be just a niche solution; mainstream portfolios need to be engaged.</p>
<p>A green bond is designed to do exactly that: it has a risk and yield comparable with other bonds, with its contribution to addressing climate change being an “added bonus”. That allows investors to meet short-term portfolio management requirements while also helping to address the long-term risks of climate change. In the wake of the Paris Climate Agreement it also helps a little with risk mitigation – green bonds are less likely to encounter policy risk as a result of governments moving to meet Climate Agreement targets.</p>
<h4>What more needs to happen to help the market grow?</h4>
<p>Despite good progress in recent years, the green bond market is still far too small to achieve these global goals. If we are to shift our economies at the speed and scale needed to stop the planet becoming uninhabitable in the second half of the century then we need to do everything that we can.</p>
<p>The whole system, including regulators, issuers and investors, need to act together and drive this shift towards green. <a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/2017/01/new-report-china-green-bonds-market-2016-launched-ccdc-rmb-238bn-usd-362bn-issuance-green" target="_blank">China</a>, where the government is regulating the green bond market, is setting a precedent that other countries should look to emulate. There are other positive signs of regulators seizing the initiative, like the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which is <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/mas-to-offset-cost-of-issuing-green-bonds-with-new-grant-scheme-8603578" target="_blank">offsetting the costs for green bond issuers</a> to push the market forward.</p>
<p>To grow the market in new locations there also need to be more projects that are ‘bondable ready’, especially in regions like Africa and Latin America. Unfortunately, adequate levels of project expertise in these markets do not exist, so progress is slow.</p>
<p>It is clear though that the demand for green paper is there and it outstrips supply so now really is the time for the financial system to act and become green.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>In this interview, Eddie Mak, Group Treasurer at Kerry Logistics talks about why he has decided to follow a career in corporate treasury and the challenges that he has faced in recent years.</em></p>
<h4>Why did you decide to follow a career in treasury?</h4>
<p>I wanted to follow a career path that would give me a holistic view of a financial transaction end-to-end. Before joining Kerry Logistics as Group Treasurer, I had worked in numerous multinationals in various corporate finance roles and before that I worked in project finance on the banking side.</p>
<p>In all of these roles I was very much at the front line of the transactions that I was involved in. Once the deal had been completed, the control and monitoring of the asset were passed onto somebody else.</p>
<p>In corporate treasury, however, you get to stay involved after the transaction. For instance, I have worked on numerous M&amp;A deals since joining Kerry and have enjoyed integrating these new businesses into the existing set-up and extracting maximum value for the company in doing so.</p>
<h4>What has been your biggest challenge since joining Kerry Logistics?</h4>
<p>We are a very young treasury department. In fact, before I joined there wasn’t a standalone treasury department; it was handled by other finance disciplines. As a result, there have been lots of challenges building up the department and ensuring that we can add value to the business.</p>
<p>More specifically, the biggest challenge has been earning the trust of the business units around the world. Treasury can often come across as the bad guy, especially when we are chasing customers who have not paid us, potentially harming the relationship the sales team has with our customers.</p>
<p>We have therefore had to educate the business units and prove to them that we are on their side and that there is a negative impact on the company if customers pay late. It has been a gradual process, but I think that treasury is now well respected and listened to across the organisation.</p>
<h4>A logistics business is very much driven by the health of the global economy, has the recent economic downturn caused any issues?</h4>
<p>Yes, there have been a few issues because of this. One big thing that we have noticed is that some of our customers here in Asia are struggling and late payments have become more frequent.</p>
<p>As a result of this, we have been more prudent in analysing the creditworthiness of our customers and making sure that we are not exposing ourselves to any unnecessary risk.</p>
<h4>How is the treasury leveraging technology?</h4>
<p>Technology is very important to what we are doing. We are just installing TMS and this will give us more visibility over our accounts, a more accurate forecast and also highlight trends and anything that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>It must be noted though that installing the TMS has been a painful experience, as we do not have the technical resources in the company. It is therefore taking a lot longer than I would like but I know once the project is finished that we will have a much more effective and robust treasury function. This is worth the short-term pain.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>From humble beginnings, Sonam Donkar, Associate Director – Treasury Head at PepsiCo has scaled the heights of the corporate treasury profession. Here she outlines how she got there and how she hopes to bring on the next generation of treasury talent.</em></p>
<h4>Why did you decide to pursue a career in corporate treasury?</h4>
<p>After graduating with honours from Delhi University I started working with Ballarpur Industries, one of Asia’s largest paper manufacturers. It was a hardcore corporate finance position but it provided a breakthrough in my career – not least because I was working directly under the CFO.</p>
<p>After an enjoyable three years at the company I went back to school and obtained a qualification in Business Management from the prestigious Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. I then took a slightly different career course and moved from the corporate space into banking, working in a treasury sales role with Standard Chartered in India.</p>
<p>Working with corporates of all shapes and sizes in this role, it was interesting to see the different challenges they had and the various strategies they put in place to address these. What I found most interesting were the different policies that treasurers in India had to adhere to. It was clear that those that localised their policies to fit the domestic market were most successful. Yet not many were doing so, instead dogmatically following the policies set in Europe or the US.</p>
<p>I thought I could add value as a treasurer and therefore decided to pursue a career in the profession and joined Dell as treasury lead for India. It was a valuable experience and left me wanting to test myself further in a strategic sense because the Dell treasury was very process orientated. I then left Dell to join PepsiCo in 2013 to lead the treasury team.</p>
<h4>What does your role at PepsiCo comprise of?</h4>
<p>Treasury at PepsiCo does a lot more than most treasury functions I know. We are a strong and trusted business partner and involved across many long-term, enterprise-wide projects.</p>
<p>For example, I am head of an internal committee, charged with solving all the inefficiencies that exist throughout the finance function. There is a lot of non-value-adding operational work necessary in a business such as ours and this has traditionally required a huge headcount to execute.</p>
<p>The cross-functional team is therefore tasked with identifying labour intensive, non-value-adding activities and trying to utilise new technology to automate, simplify, or if need be, outsource them. To date, this team has saved around 21,000 man-hours through various efficiency projects.</p>
<h4>Do you believe that treasurers today need to have more than standard treasury skills?</h4>
<p>Yes. Traditional treasury skills have become ‘old school’. Although they are a pre-requisite for any treasury professional, it has become increasingly important to grow a broader skillset that makes you more relevant to the business and brings more value to the table.</p>
<p>Only by taking this approach will treasurers continue to thrive. In my view treasury should be a key business partner in every company, but that is not always the case. It is, therefore, incumbent on treasury professionals to develop their skills and show them off whenever possible.</p>
<h4>How do you plan to help develop the next generation of treasury talent?</h4>
<p>I often work with younger people, and I enjoy being a mentor and playing a part in helping their careers flourish. To do this I hold one-on-one meetings and a team meeting every week. My team also know that my door is open, should they have any challenges or questions.</p>
<p>More broadly, I believe it is important that the people in the team embody your own ethos and also that of the company. Mentoring is therefore as much about helping people grow as it is making sure they understand that they are representing themselves and PepsiCo – and must therefore act accordingly when dealing with counterparties. With the right discipline, they will become leaders of the future.</p>

<p><em>Having initially turned down the opportunity to join a corporate treasury department, Marc Vandiepenbeeck, Vice President &amp; Assistant Treasurer at Johnson Controls has gone on to forge an exciting career in the profession. Here he shares some of his thoughts on the evolution of the profession and what more can be done to push it forward.</em></p>
<h4>When did you decide that you wanted to work in treasury?</h4>
<p>I actually turned down the opportunity to work in treasury on numerous occasions in the early years of my career. I thought treasury was an important function, but that it didn’t offer the challenges nor the excitement I was looking for. From the outside looking in, it seemed to mostly revolve around penny-pinching and there was very little strategic input.</p>
<p>The chance to work as a member of the treasury team on a large M&amp;A deal caught my attention though, as I always wanted to be part of such a project. I therefore joined Johnson Controls in 2005 to work on the acquisition of York International.</p>
<p>Working inside a treasury department on this project opened my eyes to the strategic importance of the function and the scope it had to develop further. I made the decision that I wanted to be at the forefront of this development and haven’t looked back since.</p>
<h4>What was it like working in treasury during the financial crisis?</h4>
<p>Scary. Johnson Controls had significant exposure to cyclical automotive businesses and this created a great amount of risk. It was frightening to see experienced people with an intimate knowledge of the business concerned about how the company would make it through to the next day, let alone the entire crisis. There were just so many unknowns, which, from a treasury perspective is a worrying scenario.</p>
<p>What came out of the crisis though was a tremendous amount of learning and a changed perception of the treasury leadership role. Before companies would use the role as a transitional stop for finance leaders on rotation. The crisis highlighted that this was naïve and that companies needed a team of treasury professionals who understood the markets and also the business.</p>
<h4>What else is needed to make sure the profession continues to head in the right direction?</h4>
<p>It is important that treasurers leverage new technology that automates processes, enabling treasury teams to focus their time on value-adding work. This will become a necessity if the role of corporate treasury is to continue to become more strategic.</p>
<p>Evolving market conditions will also provide treasury with a chance to boost its importance within the organisation. In a rising rate environment, the cost of each investment dollar is going to become greater. It is therefore vital that treasurers become closer to the business so that capital can be allocated efficiently and in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>Treasurers must also keep a close eye on the broader macro-environment. Big macro-issues can easily be missed just as they were in the crisis and I think there are a lot of risks out there right now. If you look at the price of certain assets, many of which are at record highs, there could be a bubble that is forming. The question is, what impact would a market correction have? It might be small and easy to swallow, or it might have ripple effects like in 2007. It is nearly impossible to measure or forecast until it unfolds. This is quite frightening when you are managing a pool of assets and are responsible for the liquidity of the company.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>For Cale Bennett, Group Treasurer at Australian gaming giant Tatts Group, treasury is a role that demands creativity and flair if it is to add genuine value to the organisation.</i></p>
<h4>What is your philosophical approach to the role?</h4>
<p>I want the treasury department to add value to the organisation, be this through conventional methods or by ‘thinking outside of the box’.</p>
<p>Although it is vital for treasury to be compliant and adhere to its policy I don’t think that this makes it simply a support or compliance function – a belief that is commonly held.</p>
<p>As a result, in my time at Tatts I have worked on a host of projects and taken steps that have all sought to add value and show the worth of the treasury department. These include the renegotiation of debt lines and the implementation of an innovative hedging strategy.</p>
<p>In doing so, treasury has been able to bring tens of millions of dollars of added value to the company over what the market has offered naturally. Treasury has also been a significant contributor to net profit after tax (NPAT) uplift for each of the past three years.</p>
<h4>To become a consummate treasurer, what skills are needed?</h4>
<p>To be a great treasurer you need to know the profession inside out and be respected for your professional knowledge. When dealing with the banks this is especially important. I don’t want to sit in a room with highly incentivised bankers and not be respected as a peer. The smartest people in the room can’t all be on one side of the table – or the outcome will be similarly one-sided.</p>
<p>In the world we live in now, I believe that treasurers also need skills that translate beyond the realm of treasury. For instance, I have taught myself how to program. I am certainly no expert, but a capable amateur.</p>
<p>This has served me well though and I have been able to build a few solutions that we use in the treasury department that has helped streamline processes and save considerable hours per annum.</p>
<h4>What is your view on the current wave of regulation sweeping across financial services?</h4>
<p>The new regulatory paradigm puts a renewed emphasis on the need for treasury professionals to be technically excellent.</p>
<p>Banks complain that regulation is making their lives more difficult and more expensive. But really it provides a big opportunity for them to use regulation to make more money. Information asymmetry has always been a source of income – if the banks know more than the corporates about these regulations then they can use this to get the outcome that they want. This is why I believe it is so important to keep abreast of changes in regulation and the different ways that banks implement them.</p>
<p>It is also important to challenge regulation and the myths that sometimes can exist around it. I spend a lot of my time trawling through different regulatory documents to find the opportunities to challenge the status quo and drive value.</p>
<h4>What about fintech – how do you see this transforming the treasury profession?</h4>
<p>I am watching this space closely, but development is slow in the treasury world. The issue is that at present, the vast majority of all fintech is in the business to consumer space. This is because building enterprise level solutions is challenging and although fintechs have plenty of people that are good at the ‘tech’ side, the ‘fin’ knowledge primarily still sits in the banks.</p>
<p>Today, I still seem to spend a crazy amount of time filling in paperwork for the banks. It amuses me to the point of distraction, especially when I talk to the banks and they enthuse over their innovations. For the corporate treasurer, the banks taking a step back and removing some of these paper processes would be a great innovation. Nevertheless, I believe that banks will be forced to be more nimble and adaptive in the coming years due to the emergence of fintech.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>For Janko Hahn, Head of Treasury Operations at Autoneum the last few years have been about driving efficiency and standardisation across the company’s treasury operation. Here he outlines what he has been working on and what is on the agenda for 2017.</em></p>
<h4>What big projects have you been working on of late in an effort to add value to Autoneum?</h4>
<p>Autoneum as a whole has been undergoing a significant enterprise-wide transformation in recent years with the decision to adopt SAP as the company’s new global ERP system and reengineer processes. The overall aim of this project has been to become more streamlined and efficient across all of the group’s activities.</p>
<p>Treasury has been involved heavily in the SAP rollout, especially because we decided to use the software as our treasury management system. We were originally considering a number of standalone solutions but saw big benefits in integrating our treasury activities into the new system, most notably ensuring that we can drive straight through processing and use consistent data sets across the whole company.</p>
<p>The rollout of SAP also allowed us to implement our flagship project: a new company-wide payment factory. This solution is enabling us to centralise our payment flows and ensure that the execution of file transfers can be conducted in a low-cost and efficient manner.</p>
<h4>What was the toughest part of this project?</h4>
<p>For many treasury departments, it is making sure that the voice of treasury is heard during these big enterprise-wide projects, but at Autoneum this wasn’t such a problem because we were involved very early on in the process. Instead, it was the change management side of the project that took up the majority of my team’s time. This was primarily because the rollout of the payment factory would not only impact how the treasury operated but also how the local business units on the ground operated because until then they had run their own payments processes.</p>
<p>Previous experience told me that this would work best if we got their buy-in to the changes planned. We therefore spent a lot of time speaking to the units on the ground and making sure that they understood what we were doing and why. We also took on board their own concerns and leaned on their intimate knowledge of the countries they are operating in. At times these proved incredibly insightful and enabled us to make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>To highlight this, when working with the team in Mexico we asked them to use the US-based bank that we use in the rest of North America. The business units, however, claimed this bank could not support them in some nuanced areas around tax and social security payments and suggested another bank that could. We investigated this bank and then found we could leverage the relationships in some South American countries as well, so it made sense to go with them and everybody was satisfied.</p>
<h4>Away from the creation of the payment factory, what else have you been managing of late?</h4>
<p>We have been focusing on how better to manage treasury in some of the world’s more challenging markets.</p>
<p>Take China, for instance, which is a very important market for the company. In recent months, there has been a growing use of Bank Acceptance Drafts (BADs). These dramatically extend the terms in which our customers are paying us which puts pressure on the liquidity of the entities in the country. They also provide a challenge from an operational perspective because of the volume of paper that needs to be processed.</p>
<h4>What do you have your eye on for the coming 12 months?</h4>
<p>There is a lot. We are further investigating leveraging more advanced tools around our payment factory, such as POBO and COBO and expect to make some progress here in 2017.</p>
<p>I am also paying keen attention to the evolving technology landscape more broadly. There is a lot happening at the moment across payments and supply chains, to name but two. For treasury professionals, the difficult part is deciding what is simply hype and what will make a genuine difference to what we are trying to do.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to watch how fintech is impacting the banks and forcing them to think and act differently. In the short term at least, I see this being the main impact of fintech in the corporate space. It is constantly evolving though and it will be very interesting to see what happens in the years to come.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Fred Schacknies, VP &amp; Assistant Treasurer at Hilton chose a career in treasury to become deeply involved in how the business operates: and he has not been disappointed. There are some non-value adding tasks that he would rather not deal with, however.</em></p>
<h4>Why did you decide to follow a career in corporate treasury?</h4>
<p>I initially worked in FX sales and trading, but I always had a profound interest in what was happening on the buy-side and the decision-making process behind the deals that were being made.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury, in particular, was appealing because it is perhaps the one role in finance that bridges the internal workings of the company with the external dynamics of the market.</p>
<p>Today, I spend most of my time dealing with issues outside of the treasury department and understanding how treasury issues pertain to the rest of the company. It is truly a varied and dynamic role and it is that which I find most fascinating and that has validated my decision to join the corporate treasury profession.</p>
<h4>What has been a focus of late for the treasury?</h4>
<p>The company has undergone many changes in my time and as a result, the treasury engine has been running at full steam for some time now. The list of projects that we have worked on is therefore pretty extensive.</p>
<p>One area, however, that we have focused on recently is the restructuring of the Group’s international entities and the education of its people to foster a more currency rational approach to liquidity management.</p>
<p>As the company has grown internationally the need to have a greater understanding of our global liquidity portfolio and the risks associated with this has intensified. We have therefore, partnered with other groups in finance who were already working to restructure the business for commercial reasons and looked to redefine the currency plumbing.</p>
<p>Key has been gaining control and visibility over our transaction data. From here we can measure risk in terms of notional exposure, simple factor sensitivity and probabilistic models (value-at-risk), and calibrate this with historical results data. With this information, we are then able to make more informed hedging decisions and better manage our risk profile.</p>
<h4>Do you have any challenges or things that you would rather not be dealing with?</h4>
<p>Know your customer (KYC) requirements. I joke that it is death by a thousand papercuts.</p>
<p>This has become an immense burden for corporate treasury departments and the banks. It saps time – not simply because of the work involved in meeting KYC requirements, but also because of the need to explain these requirements to the business and make them understand why it can take a long time to open a bank account.</p>
<p>Frankly, this adds no value to what we are doing and our time could be better spent doing other things. It has also increased the cost of doing business through indirect taxation.</p>
<h4>How do you overcome this challenge?</h4>
<p>There is no silver bullet. We rely on honest and frank conversations with our banking partners and push back whenever we think their requests are unreasonable.</p>
<p>Hopefully, there can be some regulatory alignment around the standards that are required in the near future. Then, from this base, it will be easier to leverage technology to help automate and solve the KYC burden for banks and corporates.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Currently the Deputy Treasurer at Capita, a leading UK outsourcing firm, Matt Cornwall entered the treasury profession seeking a challenge and the desire to be involved in the commercial heart of the organisation. Here he outlines his role today and his thoughts on the treasury profession.</em></p>
<h4>Describe your roles and responsibilities at Capita.</h4>
<p>My current role within the organisation is comprised of three key tenets.</p>
<p>Firstly, I am a consultant to the business. The treasury provides financial support to over 200 companies within the group and I can take a call from any of these asking for advice at any time and on all manner of topics. This is a challenging role as you do not know what will be coming next, but I enjoy the variety it offers.</p>
<p>The second key part of my role is leading the treasury’s M&amp;A funding and integration work. Capita is quite unique in the fact that the company conducts around 10-15 M&amp;A transactions a year, on average. So not only does treasury have to find the cash to make these purchases, we also have to integrate these companies into our organisation and mitigate any risks. It is a challenge because of the sheer number of companies that we are buying and it has been vital to make sure that we are as efficient as possible in our work.</p>
<p>Finally, I look after the bank relationships for the organisation. I suspect this is a similar role to many other treasury professionals but it is interesting to hear what the banks are doing and how they are looking to improve the products and services they offer the corporate community. I would say that on the whole I am happy with our banks and I have developed some great relationships with them, but there is always more that they could be doing!</p>
<h4>What skills have you had to develop in order to fulfil these roles?</h4>
<p>Core operational skills, of course, are key. But what has become increasingly important for the corporate treasurer are soft skills. Treasury is now talking to a wider range of people, not just financial professionals so it is important to be able to effectively communicate.</p>
<p>I believe that empathy is key here and it is vital that you understand your audience, their knowledge base, their drivers and their needs. It is then incumbent on the treasury to explain complex issues in a simple and succinct fashion.</p>
<p>Without these skills, it would be hard to be successful in my role.</p>
<h4>How has the Capita treasury department worked in recent years to help support the growth of the company?</h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, Capita is growing in size and complexity because of our large amount of M&amp;A activity. Treasury has had to mature as a result, and quickly, to be in a position to support the growth.</p>
<p>Since I joined, I have been involved in many projects ranging from the implementation of a treasury management system, the development of a highly efficient straight through payment process using SWIFT, the building of multiple cash pools and the roll-out of a corporate card programme.</p>
<p>The hard work has been worth it though; treasury is now perceived as one of the key finance departments within the organisation.</p>
<h4>What impact is technology having on the role?</h4>
<p>Technology is fundamentally changing the treasury profession in numerous ways. And whilst the vast majority of this change is positive, I do foresee some negative effects of technology. For instance, there is a danger that future generations may become over-reliant on technology and forget the fundamentals of the role. Take FX dealing as an example: a decade ago this was completed over the phone and required some technical understanding. Today, this can be completed automatically through an online platform without the need for specialist skills.</p>
<p>Within our organisation we ask junior members of the team to sometimes complete FX dealing over the phone so that they can better understand the complexities of the buy and sell side. Technology is great to improve things, but it is important that the profession doesn’t lose sight of the fundamentals.</p>

<p><em>All eyes have been on China of late as the economy continues to transition towards the ‘new normal’. For businesses operating in the country the shift is creating new challenges, seemingly on a daily basis. But Cefi Chen, Regional Treasury Director China and Russia at Cummins sees past these challenges and recognises an opportunity for the corporate treasury department to raise its profile.</em></p>
<h4>You first began working in corporate treasury in the early 2000s, what did the profession look like then?</h4>
<p>The corporate treasury profession began to emerge in China around the time of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The events of this crisis made a lot of companies – especially those importing and exporting – recognise that there was a serious skill shortage when it came to managing financial risk and cash. Some organisations, due to this skill shortage, were badly impacted by the currency fluctuations at that time.</p>
<p>Despite this, when I assumed my first treasury role a few years after the crisis it was still primarily seen as a back-office support function. Treasury primarily focused on cash management, financing and monitoring regulation – but few within the company really knew what we were doing.</p>
<h4>How has it developed since and what have been the drivers behind this?</h4>
<p>Since these formative years, there have been major changes. For one thing, rapid international growth has led many companies in China to become more complex. Consequently, the treasury profession has become more prominent within these organisations as the need for prudent risk management and financial control has increased.</p>
<p>The rigorous regulatory regime in China has also played a role in building up the profession. There is a lot of regulation that companies have to adhere to in China, especially when doing cross-border business. Treasury has become specialised in monitoring these and making sure that the business is compliant.</p>
<p>Overall, treasury is now a well-respected function in China.</p>
<h4>China is going through a transitionary period at the moment. What are the challenges that this is creating for businesses on the ground?</h4>
<p>The slowdown in the economy and the broader structural shift is challenging companies in China – especially manufacturing companies like Cummins. One thing that is particularly notable is that credit conditions for Cummins’ downstream customers and upstream suppliers are declining and this is a major concern.</p>
<p>The difficult conditions that many companies are experiencing are highlighted by the increasing use of the Bank Acceptance Draft (BAD) as a payment instrument. Accepting these then negatively impacts our days sales outstanding and overall working capital cycle. Some BADs then have to be passed on to our suppliers and this negatively impacts the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>FX is also a growing area of focus because the RMB now fluctuates two ways – this is the new normal. For corporates to manage this effectively, we need to have more access to hedging tools onshore. These are limited at present, and I hope that this is something that the regulators will recognise and allow soon.</p>
<h4>How is this impacting your role and that of corporate treasury more broadly?</h4>
<p>Today I see organisations looking at the corporate treasury departments that they have built over the past two decades, wanting them to take a leading role in supporting the business to navigate through the difficult conditions that currently exist.</p>
<p>I make sure that my treasury team are proactive in doing all it can to support the growth of the company. We go out into the business to find out what is happening and what the challenges are. From here we can offer services and solutions that help solve these issues.</p>
<p>It is only by operating in this way that treasury can show its value and take full advantage of the opportunity that currently exists to drive the profession forward.</p>

<p><em>The best operators will do very well: leading banks will already be ahead of the curve in terms of their product and service offering, and opportunity is undeniably knocking for corporates and their treasury teams who are ready, willing and able to reconsider and optimise their structures.

<h4>How is the banking environment changing for treasurers?</h4>
<p id="jp-morgan-video">One fundamental change affecting the industry, from a liquidity and investing perspective, is the impact of Basel III as it continues to roll out over the next few years. Institutions that have already implemented Basel III will almost certainly be looking for their corporate clients to tie their deposits more closely to the operating business they transact through these banks, and for good reason. As a result, the traditional approach to banking relationships is likely to evolve as banks become increasingly focused on linking deposits to an underlying operating business. Basel III will affect the cost and availability of credit for corporates and this will have a major impact on treasurers.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In addition to regulation, continual innovation in technology is driving huge structural changes in treasury, with companies from all sectors operating in an increasingly digital environment.In particular, there is a dynamic ‘real-time’ advance taking effect in the payments landscape. New payments providers and systems are coming to market changing expectations. And now even traditional bank clearing systems for both high- and low-value transactions are becoming real-time settlement tools. Faster Payments in the UK, for example – and similar systems from Asia to the US – represent a fundamental shift in attitude that treasurers ought to be bearing in mind. With consumers and end-customers now expecting real-time payments, it is essential that the banks and the corporates they work with can support these immediate transactions; there is clearly a demand on both sides of the relationship.</p>
<h4>With Basel III changing the way banks are able to support corporate cash deposits, what strategy to bank relationships should a treasurer take?</h4>
<p>The tradition of having a global transaction bank complemented by several different deposit banks is inevitably changing. This means treasurers need to look closely at how they split their operating services business, making sure that they have the right counterparties for depositing cash, whilst ensuring those counterparties have the robust transaction banking capabilities to support the day to day receivables and payables needs of the corporation or institution.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that we have seen the full impact of Basel III in the banking market, due to the different implementation timetables across different countries. It is increasingly likely treasurers will find banks reluctant to take on deposits that are not supporting operating business for a client. This is different to what was seen in the 2008 crisis and we advise treasurers to prepare now for any such eventuality. For the strongest banks, who have taken proactive measures to ensuring Basel III compliance, aligning cash placements with operating businesses is already a priority. These banks are able to support ongoing deposits, provided they are accompanied by underlying operating flows, ensuring their ability to respond efficiently to their clients’ deposit requirements in any scenario.</p>

<p class="quote-block__source"></p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>With the continued consolidation and retrenchment of certain transaction banks around the world, treasurers must find the right balance of transactional bank relationships with strong counterparties, to create safe havens for their cash. It’s worth noting that during the last crisis, corporate investors recognised the need to more closely evaluate their money market fund investments than they perhaps had in the past, resulting in some choosing to simply move money back to deposits with their core bank group. Taking all into consideration, treasurers need to plan not just for the cash they are holding now, but they should also attempt to anticipate the impact of future regulation on their overall investments.</p>
<h4>Clearly there are significant implications for investment policies in the new and changing environment. How should treasurers be tackling this?</h4>
<p>Treasurers with investment policies that have principal preservation at their core certainly need to address how they can continue to deposit with banks which charge negative rates on some of those deposits. In addition, MMF regulation is undergoing reform – a process that is still evolving in Europe. This too is something that treasurers should give consideration to when revising their investment policy. The new rules that we know are coming into place in the US, and may be coming into place across Europe, may test and challenge that policy notion of principal preservation.</p>
<h4>Process digitisation is having a major influence in the new environment, especially in the field of payments. What considerations should a treasurer give to their operations with respect to the adoption of electronic solutions?</h4>
<p>This represents an immense opportunity for both corporates and their banking partners as many more aspects of our everyday personal and corporate lives are being digitised. Treasurers need to work with their business units to understand emerging payments needs, for example. Treasurers and cash managers, with their banks, should be aware of changes to clearing systems but they may not be as familiar with all of the consumer-related digital payments initiatives currently gaining ground. There is a huge amount of activity in this space, mostly with the aim of making payments more convenient for consumers by allowing seamless and instant payments through almost any channel. As online direct shopping increases, it gives treasurers the opportunity to digitise more payment processes. This should be welcomed because it affords a potentially very positive working capital impact. Indeed, if a company can enable its customers – business or consumer – to interact and pay directly and in real-time, it can reduce its Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) quite significantly. What’s more, it also gives immediate access to key metrics for credit decisions, which can in turn drive increased sales.</p>
<p>Treasurers have a strong role to play in creating awareness of, and navigating a path through, these new technologies. They can then engage with the rest of the business as it starts to support those new consumer habits more readily. But speed of transaction reconciliation also needs to be taken into account. The traditional banking model expects a transaction statement on a prior-day basis, reconciling the following day. This will no longer be satisfactory; businesses need to reconcile intra-day, in a real-time environment, because online consumers now expect to see their payments have been received and that their orders have been processed. And whilst visibility into the logistics flow of purchased goods can be tracked even on a mobile device, there is not necessarily the same ability to see where the payment is in that process. This is something that the banking industry – and certainly J.P. Morgan – is working towards.</p>
<h4>With so many processes being digitised, how should a treasurer respond to the increased flow of data?</h4>
<p>Data management is another very exciting area of development. As the link between business and the consumer becomes more direct, and payments and other information can be connected digitally, businesses can start collecting data that not only provides treasury with real-time visibility over cash flows, but also the ability to forecast on a real-time basis.</p>
<p>For example, businesses can leverage data from consumer credit or debit cards to harvest considerably more information about consumer habits. By marrying this information with profile data gained through a loyalty programme, for example, they can spot trends and target its consumer base with ever-more bespoke offers, driving more revenue. At J.P. Morgan we are already working with a number of clients and their data flows, helping them to spot trends and put in place initiatives that can steer them towards new sales opportunities, and of course using data to give treasurers real-time visibility in an automated way.</p>
<p>As treasurers become more fluent in new payment instruments and engage further with their business units and their banking partners, it enables them to obtain useful ‘big data’ derived information and knowledge. The insights afforded by those payment instruments are far richer than was ever available through traditional methods such as wire transfers or cheque payments.</p>
<h4>As digital systems become ever more integrated, the question of cybercrime rises further up the agenda. What can treasurers do to ensure security?</h4>
<p>As the world becomes more digital and increasingly interconnected, the drive to interact more with consumers gains in strength. While this has advantages making it easier and more efficient to do business, it can also expose the business to an increased cyber security threat. It is something we have to live with every day but it still needs to be top of mind. The treasurer, as a manager of risk, needs to be one of the leaders within their organisation, ensuring the threats are being addressed and that prevention and detection are being invested in across the organisation, not just in treasury.</p>
<p>Treasurers need to have a robust platform and extremely well-trained employees to avoid fraud and protect the organisation. But equally, they must make sure they are using the new flows of data to provide ‘early warning system’ visibility into potential threats and breaches. Treasurers have not necessarily had close involvement with the business, particularly as new online initiatives have been launched within that company. In such a case, I recommend treasurers put on their ‘good risk management’ hat by ensuring that external partners – including fintech companies and banks – are not only providing convenience for consumers, but are doing so in a safe way.</p>
<h4>As the banking environment has shifted, we have seen that banking relationships, investment policies and the approach to technology have changed too. What impact does all this have on cash-holding strategies?</h4>
<p>Once cash flows have been accelerated, DSO has been improved through the deployment of digital solutions, and the banking structure has taken into account the ongoing regulatory impact, treasurers need to look deeper into that overall structure to be able to optimise cash holding. They need to make sure they are leveraging best practice – and technology – to make sure they can invest cash in the most efficient way.</p>
<p>With many companies sitting on idle cash, account rationalisation is a key consideration. As they progress through their digital strategy, from paper to electronic, we have found that it gives corporates the ability quite easily to reduce the number of bank accounts they hold. For example, as the flow of receipts changes, treasurers can review the role of certain accounts. In many cases it will have been set up for convenience – an account held perhaps just for local cheque deposits. But as the digital agenda rolls out, simplifying the account structure becomes easier and cash holding strategies can be enhanced.</p>
<p>And now we are seeing clients going one step further. Instead of collecting money in the subsidiaries and sweeping this up to the treasury centre, they are using ‘on-behalf of’ structures to bring that money directly from the receivables instruments to the payment factory or in-house bank. On-behalf of structures have been used for accounts payable – payments on behalf of, or POBO – for some while, particularly in the US and Europe. But we are increasingly seeing corporates move regular customers to direct payment, using a ‘receive on-behalf-of’ or ROBO approach. The main reluctance to ROBO adoption has been the potential impact to customer relationships. However, as new digital instruments appear, it actually facilitates a rethinking of how to improve those relationships. As more corporates decide they want customers to start sending funds to them in this new way, it aids adoption if, instead of providing new bank details, they also offer customers access to all the new digital payment options.</p>
<h4>So as evolving policies and corporate business structures come on stream, what should treasurers be bearing in mind when seeking to adapt, and exploit these changes?</h4>
<p>One of the key views that clients are already responding to is that their bank account and liquidity structures need to be flexible. They must be able to adapt to continuously evolving regulations and policies, and meet ongoing changes in their own corporate structure.</p>
<p>We are seeing increased activity with regard to corporate spin-offs, for example. Treasurers are starting to consider how they can put a structure in place that is flexible enough to facilitate this. If there is a need further down the line to spin off a division of the business, then that structure should make it relatively easy to separate it from, for example, the existing global liquidity management or cash management structure. With this in mind, corporate clients are now challenging the banks to provide more flexible account configurations – and certainly there is a greater adoption of virtual accounts that mean changes can be made almost at the flick of a switch.</p>
<p>As treasuries seek to redesign their bank account structures, they must be mindful of providing not only the capability to handle different corporate structures – arising through events such as spin-offs – but also, in response to evolving regulation, quick adaptability to fluid situations as those changes impact the business.</p>
<p>As the UK and Europe transitions into the Brexit environment, there are many unknowns regarding how this will evolve over the next couple of years. Once again, corporates need to think about their banking structure and partners and prepare for a number of potential scenarios. Another key consideration is European and global tax changes coming down the line. The OECD’s BEPS initiative, the European Commission’s Anti Tax Avoidance Directive, and Section 385 of the IRS tax code in the US, will all provide another level of uncertainty for affected corporates which must be met by a broad suite of options.</p>
<p>The ability to have a banking structure that could easily change from a multi-entity, multi-currency notional pool to a sweeping structure, or vice versa, is something treasurers need to consider as they develop a structure and select partners to support the changing environment. To make the most of the ‘new normal’ banking environment, and to ensure that the businesses are taking advantage of the digitised environment, treasurers must look at optionality in those structures, making sure they are sufficiently malleable to adapt to changing policy, corporate structure, regulation and legislation.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Having been at the helm of the DFS treasury team for over a decade, Kenneth Ng has seen the profession go through some fundamental changes. Here he talks about these changes and how the rise of innovative technology may see it evolve even further in the near future.</em></p>
<h4>You have been working at DFS for over ten years now. How has the role of treasury and its status within the organisation changed within that time?</h4>
<p>Since the global financial crisis there has been a paradigm shift in both the role of treasury and its status within the organisation. Whereas prior to the crisis, treasury was seen as an important function, there was perhaps a lack of understanding within the business about the risks the department is exposed to. After all, the department’s chief counterparty is the banks, who before 2008 were seen as being quite safe. As a result, treasury largely operated in the background with little C-level focus.</p>
<p>It was apparent that everything changed from the onset of the crisis, however. Almost immediately I had management and C-level executives in frequent contact, asking about the risks the banks posed to the business and how we should think about structuring our banking relationships moving forward – typically all very treasury-related discussions.</p>
<p>Since then, treasury has stayed in the spotlight and grown to become a strategic, value-adding and cross-functional department within the organisation. In turn, this has made the role that more complex, and called for treasurers to not only have ‘traditional’ treasury skills, but also to possess soft skills, such as being able to effectively communicate with both financial and non-financial people.</p>
<h4>What issues have recently been causing a headache for the DFS treasury department?</h4>
<p>FX volatility has been a big issue of late. We operate across three continents, receiving and making payments in a variety of local currencies, so have a large FX exposure. At one time we used to manage this exposure by carrying out wholesale FX transactions and then either sweeping the funds back to corporate level, or transferring the funds to local procurement teams in their required currency.</p>
<p>However, the recent volatility has rendered this approach obsolete. We now split these large trades into smaller numbers – a $5m currency swap, will now be conducted as five individual $1m currency swaps, for instance. This ensures that we are able to achieve the best pricing and also enables us to manage our exposures more carefully.</p>
<p>Of course, as a result of this approach the number of transactions that we conduct has increased substantially. We have therefore recently begun using Thomson Reuters FXall to automate all our FX trading activity.</p>
<p>Aside from FX, regulation continues to provide a significant challenge, especially in countries such as India, where capital controls make it challenging to move cash out of the country. These controls mean that we have to approach funding our businesses in India in a very nuanced manner, not only considering their short-term financing needs, but also the long-term cash management implications.</p>
<p>We also currently have a lot of questions around Brexit. At present we are speaking to numerous merchant acquirers to provide services to our Venice store, which opens later this year. Some of these are based in the UK and we have questions around whether they will be able to continue to provide their services in Europe once the dust settles in the coming years. We have also told our procurement teams to carefully monitor any merchandise payments they are making in sterling, as this has become particularly volatile of late and can have an impact on earnings.</p>
<h4>How are the banks performing? Are they able to meet your needs and expectations?</h4>
<p>Overall, I am happy with the services provided by our banking partners. We closed a club loan deal last year with ten banks involved and these share the bulk of our wallet. Within this group there are a mixture of Asia domiciled banks, who have particular expertise in markets such as China and Japan. We then work with others who have a large footprint across Asia and are able to support our broader regional operations. Finally, we have some European banks that are able to service our needs in that region.</p>
<p>Whilst I do think that the banking sector in general has become quite commoditised in recent years, there are some, a number of whom we work with, that are looking to offer value-add services. This may be simply providing more advice around regulatory changes, or investing heavily in their technology to be able to offer insights into our business.</p>
<h4>On that point, what impact is technology and the rise of fintech companies having on your operations, if at all?</h4>
<p>Technology is transforming the profession and it is vital that treasury stays abreast of and embraces these changes where possible. As a company we are very keen to explore new technologies. We have implemented a number of solutions recently, including automated FX dealing. We were also one of the first companies in Asia to implement a cross-border, multi-currency, sweeping solution.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is that if the solution works and can help lower our costs, drive efficiencies and help the business perform better, then it is something worth exploring further.</p>
<p>I can’t see the proliferation of technology and the changes it is forcing abating any time soon. Indeed, if anything the changes may only become more acute. At present, we are very comfortable leveraging the offerings of banks and established technology companies. But this may change in the future as the current wave of fintech companies and their products mature.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>For Malaysia based treasurer Wan Chun Shong, the continued integration of ASEAN and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) offers enormous opportunity for businesses in the region and beyond. But, before this can be fully grasped, treasury departments, particularly in Malaysia, need to invest in cutting edge technology to drive efficiency and best practice.</em></p>
<h4>What has been your career path, and what attracted you to the treasury profession?</h4>
<p>I began my career in banking, working on the FX and derivatives desk for Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ in Malaysia, providing hedging solutions to Japanese corporates operating in the country. This was an interesting position and I was able to gain a solid grounding in treasury and a good understanding of the corporate treasury function and its role in the company.</p>
<p>It was during my time at the bank that I came to realise that the treasury is the heartbeat and profit centre of the organisation, and the perfect career path for somebody with my skillset. As a result, I left the bank and joined Elken Group in Malaysia in a corporate treasury role before later moving to a similar role with TwinWealth Group in Hong Kong – a change that allowed me to move out of my comfort zone and achieve some corporate experience in a different environment.</p>
<p>Today, I head up the treasury department at Tan Chong Group – an automotive conglomerate with revenue of around $3bn and operations across South East Asia – overseeing treasury, funding and risks.</p>
<h4>What challenges is the treasury facing and what are you doing to overcome these?</h4>
<p>As far as challenges are concerned, I believe that there is one that resonates with treasurers in Malaysia, and other markets around the world: working out how best to leverage technology. As an industry we are undergoing a tremendous transformation in terms of technology and how this is enabling us to find new ways of enhancing our business. But, on the other hand, it also presents a challenge in regards to rethinking how the treasury department should operate.</p>
<p>My team and I are therefore looking at how we can best streamline the financial value chain of the business. This includes analysing areas such as collections and promoting real-time electronic transfers and bank account auto reconciliation, improving visibility by replacing excel worksheets with a treasury management system (TMS) and also streamlining the payment process. Although this is a journey that has only recently begun, we have made great strides and have already brought in numerous efficiencies and greater control over core processes. Nevertheless, it is a long term project and we are aware that it will take many more years to complete.</p>
<p>As treasurer of the Malaysian Association of Corporate Treasurers (MACT), I am closely linked to my peers and there is a real push by the majority of companies to gain greater control through automation and the only way that this can be done is by investing in technology. Unfortunately, we are behind our European and US peers in this regard but I see this gap closing in the coming years.</p>
<h4>Has the recent volatility in emerging markets impacted your treasury, and what tips would you offer fellow treasurers unsure of how to manage this volatility?</h4>
<p>Emerging markets (EMs), and particularly those with weak fundamentals like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, have experienced a fair degree of volatility lately. There are various reasons for this, most notably: quantitative easing being unwound in the US, low oil prices and China’s slowdown.</p>
<p>For corporates, the volatility can create numerous risks including a significant impact on cash flow. The best way to mitigate this risk in my opinion is to use hedging solutions, enforced and controlled by a robust treasury policy. To ensure that the best results are obtained from hedging it is vital to work closely with your banking partners, as they have the expertise to help you find the most optimum solution.</p>
<p>Moreover, banks can also provide a wealth of information around the regulatory changes occurring in various markets and the impact this has on hedging strategies and various other treasury activities. I believe this is particularly important in the markets that we operate in, such as Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, because regulations are frequently changing.</p>
<h4>Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are just four of the countries that make up ASEAN. What impact is ASEAN project and the creation of the AEC having on both your business and treasury operations?</h4>
<p>Simply put, AEC is a similar project to the EU. It aims to create a highly competitive economic region with a single market and production base. This of course will have many benefits for businesses and afford higher productivity and cost efficiency through economies of scale and also because of the elimination of tariffs in countries like Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia. Moreover, for conglomerates operating in ASEAN, besides easier access to its markets, the free flow of goods and services will also boost their competitiveness regionally and globally.</p>
<p>Whilst ASEAN certainly offers businesses many opportunities, it does mean that the complexity of treasury operations is likely to increase, as a greater volume of transactions will be made across multiple geographies. This will place an even greater emphasis on treasury best practice, automation and control.</p>
<p>Recognising this challenge, we have centralised our treasury function after being granted Treasury Management Centre status by Malaysian Industrial Development Authority (MIDA) – a program that offers a number of incentives to companies who base their treasury operations out of Malaysia. As a result of this, we have been able to utilise an in-house bank structure enabling us to better manage our internal cash flows, reduce float and transaction fees, and subsequently bring down the operating costs of working across such a large market. I expect to see many more companies in Malaysia and across ASEAN replicate this structure going forward.</p>
<h4>Looking ahead to the rest of the year what challenges do you expect to face?</h4>
<p>This year will again be defined by volatility and treasurers need to be vigilant and hedging the exposures. There is also a need to think outside the box and ahead of time to guide the business through these uncertain spells.</p>

<p><em>In this concise interview, Karin Flinspach, Head, Cash Products, Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered Bank shares her expertise on the various challenges corporates operating in emerging markets are facing and outlines the benefits in partnering with a bank with a global platform and deep local knowledge.</em></p>
<br/>

<h4 class="fn">Karin Flinspach</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head, Cash Products, Transaction Banking</h5>
<br/>
<p><img alt="Standard Chartered Bank" class="logo org" height="34" src="/i/logo/standard-chartered-logo-2009-90x34.png" title="Standard Chartered Bank" width="90"/></p>
<p>Karin Flinspach is Head, Cash Products for Standard Chartered Bank based in Singapore. She is responsible for the development of cash capabilities for the bank’s global corporate, investor and intermediary client segments. In this role, she oversees the full suite of cash products that include payments, receivables and liquidity management tools.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Standard Chartered, Karin worked with Citi for 20 years in a variety of cash management product roles covering both developed and developing markets. She was most recently EMEA Head of Payments and Receivables and is a key authority on SEPA (Single European Payments Area). Karin has published a large number of articles on the bank process infrastructure in Europe.</p>

<br>
<h4>What unique cash management challenges do corporates in emerging markets face?</h4>
<p>While the emerging markets are by no means a homogenous region, we do see collections as being a common issues for corporates operating across our footprint of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In particular, how to ensure the collections process is done effectively and efficiently across often extremely remote areas.</p>
<p>Conventional methods have their limitations and corporates are looking to their banking partners to provide innovative and bespoke solutions to match very specific needs. To address this we have been working with our corporate clients to develop solutions that not only address local needs, but also offer pan-regional coverage. For instance, we recently worked with a client in Malaysia to utilise the ATM network of 20 major banks in the country to make cash collections straight into Standard Chartered Bank’s account. We have used this connectivity along with our award winning Virtual Accounts solution to apply funds straight through for our clients.</p>
<p>Another solution that has worked well with our clients is Mobile Money especially since in many of our markets, corporates are dealing with clients who are “unbanked” - which includes both individuals and small local businesses. In Africa for example, Standard Chartered is connected in four markets with mobile wallet providers allowing our clients to pay and receive funds directly from the mobile wallet holders. This allows smaller suppliers, even without a bank account, to receive payments from corporates on time and very easily. As an example, some of our FMCG clients pay directly to farmers and effectively replace cash transactions. This also substantially reduces not just the cost but also risks associated with cash distribution to un-banked recipients.</p>
<p>There is also demand from our corporate clients around the adoption and use of analytics to improve payments and collections processes. We have worked with them to leverage various tools that analyse the payment data from the organisation to generate information and insights over their incomings and outgoings across their global operations. This ultimately improves cash flow forecasting and working capital management.</p>
<h4>Given the changes in the global banking landscape, what do you think is more important to a corporate in terms of global reach or local presence?</h4>
<p>This really depends on the footprint and strategy of the client. We are seeing that for large corporates expanding overseas, global reach and access is key. However, this comes with its inherent challenges and these organisations will need their banks to develop standardised platforms, for example, in the area of reporting, that can be rolled out across the markets they operate in. This will ensure that the global treasury centre can look to automate and drive straight-through processing (STP) at all opportunities.</p>
<p>It also depends on the geographies that corporates expand into. For example, if the client grows across the emerging markets then it becomes increasingly important that their banking partner has deep local knowledge. Many of these markets pose complex regulatory challenges that may be difficult to navigate unless the bank has best-in-class knowledge of local regulations. Strong relationships with the regulators can make all the difference.</p>
<p>When selecting the best bank to work with, we find that treasurers nowadays do not just look for world-class systems and platforms that have cutting edge technology. The selection process is more complex than that and institutions which can offer the platforms and efficiencies as well as also add value and advice their client across issues like regulatory impact in a fast-changing environment definitely have the advantage.</p>
<h4>The renminbi (RMB) making huge strides towards internationalisation, how are your clients leveraging the new opportunities afforded to corporates around the RMB?</h4>
<p>The internationalisation of the RMB is a big topic for corporates, not just in Asia, but globally. The regulatory relaxation that has occurred over the past few years has now made it possible for corporates to move money out of China and pool this with other currencies offshore. Today, many of our clients are using RMB as a currency for cross-border trade and increasingly too as an investment currency. As a result, liquidity management solutions in Asia that include RMB are also becoming top of many corporates’ wish-lists.</p>
<p>There are also new developments such as the Shanghai Free Trade Zone and the loosening of restrictions on cross-border pooling and lending. With such a rapid rate of regulatory change, and significant complexity, clients are heavily reliant on Standard Chartered to help them keep up to date with changes, understand the opportunities and implement solutions that offer commercial advantage. Therefore, as we reflect on the future of the RMB, the question is not how fast and under what circumstances the RMB will become an international currency or a G4/G3 currency, but what this will mean for our clients and how we can prepare them in terms of infrastructure, balance sheet etc.</p>
<h4>How can technology support treasury departments moving forward?</h4>
<p>Treasuries are small entities that have lots of daily challenges. These are magnified as treasurers are being asked to do more with less. Technology has consequently become increasingly important to ensure treasurers meet their objectives. With limited resources, corporate treasurers are looking for solutions which can drive automation, help standardise operations and are also easily and quickly integrated. It is also important that these solutions are flexible and scalable to keep in tandem with business expansion and growth into new markets.</p>
<p>The role of big data moving forward cannot be downplayed and treasurers will require new and innovative solutions that better serve up key information, allowing them to make quick and well-informed decisions. This is particularly useful in the fast changing emerging markets.</p></br>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h5 id="describe-your-career-and-what-made-you-join-the-treasury-profession">Can you briefly describe your career and what made you join the treasury profession?</h5>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have had an acute interest in the foreign exchange markets. As such, the world of corporate treasury is one that I have always had a passion for and it was a career path that I wanted to follow. I achieved my aim in 2007 when I entered the corporate treasury department of HCL Technologies, one of India’s largest technology companies, as a management trainee.</p>
<p>Following a two year stint at the company, I moved to EXL Service, and assumed the role of Corporate Treasurer responsible for the treasury front office, middle office and also treasury reporting. My remit is broad and on a daily basis I have to cover: risk management, derivatives trading (both plain vanilla and also exotic derivatives), cash flow management and forecasting, currency trading, fixed income markets, management reporting, and all the respective functions of corporate treasury.</p>
<p>My passion for finance extends beyond the office, however, and I have also run my own proprietary trading desk covering currencies, equities, interest rate futures, and government securities’ futures. I am also an author and run a treasury academy that seeks to educate fellow treasurers on all things related to FX (more on this later).</p>
<h5 id="enjoyable-and-also-the-most-challenging-aspects-of-treasury">What are the most enjoyable and also the most challenging aspects of treasury? </h5>
<p>As you would expect, given my interest in the foreign exchange markets, the most enjoyable aspect, and also one of the most challenging, of being a corporate treasurer is to predict foreign exchange market movements and those of respective currency pairs. We live in a time when central banks across the world are implementing quantitative easing measures which are making currencies extremely volatile.</p>
<p>As a corporate treasurer, you need to keep a hawk eye on the currency markets to make sure that receivables are hedged at the correct rates, and payables at low rates. For me, the prediction of stops in the currency markets is the most enjoyable part of my role as a corporate treasurer.</p>
<h5 id="what-made-you-launch-your-treasury-academy">What made you launch your treasury academy?</h5>
<p>The purpose of the Foreign Exchange Academy is to educate fellow treasurers on all manner of practical topics and recent changes in the treasury function. I believe that I have a lot of knowledge to share and I want to create a community for treasurers to learn and share their experiences.</p>
<p>My YouTube channel ‘Foreign Exchange Maverick Thinkers’ is an integral part of the Foreign Exchange Academy. Currently I have produced 80 videos covering: foreign exchange risk management, treasury risk management, derivatives trading, deliverable and non-deliverable derivatives markets, interest rate hedging and many more.</p>
<p>To share my knowledge further, I have also co-authored a book: ‘Options for Risk Free Portfolio.’ And will soon be publishing my second book entitled ‘Techniques to Hedge your Interest Rates Exposures’. It will cover all interest rate hedging techniques, and is scheduled for release in Australia and Singapore later this year. I am also a speaker at global treasury forums around the world, as I believe it is important to share knowledge in this way.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-ultimate-career-goal">What is your ultimate career goal?</h5>
<p>The ultimate goal is to be an entrepreneur and develop ‘Foreign Exchange Maverick Thinkers’ into its own brand with goodwill in the market and a reputation for covering all manner of financial issues from foreign exchange to investment banking. I dream big and I want to achieve similar to what Apple has managed in the technology space, but in the foreign exchange markets!</p>
<h5 id="if-you-could-be-anything-other-than-a-treasurer-what-would-it-be">If you could be anything other than a treasurer what would it be?</h5>
<p>If I didn’t have a fantastic career in treasury, I would want to be an investment banker covering various M&amp;A deals, due diligence and other investment banking activities.</p>
<h5 id="word-of-advice-for-anyone-looking-to-join-the-treasury-profession">If you had a word of advice for anyone looking to join the treasury profession what would it be?</h5>
<p>I have two key words of advice: stay hungry and continue to do new things in the life. Also, try to be a benchmark, rather than following a benchmark.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>After working in a number of different finance roles, what made you move into treasury?</h4>
<p>In my previous roles at Adobe and McKinsey, I focused primarily on the reporting and analysis, in which exchange rate movements had significant impact on operational performance. It is a fascinating aspect of the finance world and one I was interested in pursuing further. The remit of the treasury profession encompassed not just foreign exchange but all aspects of business risk, so in many ways it was a natural progression. I also enjoyed looking at the micro and macroeconomic factors underlying business and market volatility.</p>
<p>One of the key duties of the treasury function is to analyse market factors such as risk and liquidity, assess their impact, and provide advice on actions to mitigate possible adverse impact on the company operations. So, being able to use my analytical skills in an unpredictable environment was one of the primary reasons that I decided to move into the treasury profession.</p>
<h4>What are the most enjoyable aspects of the role and has it lived up to your expectations?</h4>
<p>Treasury is a wonderfully complex area as risk exposures have a wide geographic reach, impacting operating companies in multiple ways, from a plethora of evolving regulations in developing countries to varying degrees of market maturity. The economic and geopolitical environment in Asia Pacific also has a large impact on operations, constantly offering unexpected challenges, requiring treasury teams to always be alert.</p>
<p>These factors make the profession very diverse in terms of the skills required, and provides many learning opportunities. I meet and work with a wide range of people daily, including: bankers, procurement specialists, acquisition teams, board level executives and legal and tax experts. This offers the opportunity to learn how different areas interact with treasury and the wider business. The idea of constantly learning is one of the strong appeals of the profession for me and it has certainly lived up to my expectations in this regard.</p>
<h4>For you, what were the biggest challenges in the first six months working in the treasury function?</h4>
<p>My primary focus when I joined WPP was to develop the reporting and analytics infrastructure for the organisation’s treasury operations. But shortly after joining, I realised that, although this was my primary focus, there are many elements that are involved in the process and many other functions in treasury that I also needed to understand. These areas, including cash management, risk management and working capital management, were quite new to me so getting up to speed with these topics was a big challenge. In fact, this was the biggest challenge in the first six months and is still ongoing because the scope of the treasury function is large and ever evolving.</p>
<h4>What has helped you overcome these challenges?</h4>
<p>Talking to people in the industry and learning from them is an invaluable tool. My treasury colleagues at WPP are all professional treasury specialists and have a wealth of knowledge that I have been able to tap. The team at WPP has also been very helpful in answering all of my questions or pointing me in the right direction to find the information that I need.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I try to attend as many seminars, conferences and events that are focused on the treasury profession as possible. Not only do these provide a great opportunity to hear about the latest trends and what other corporates and banks are doing, but it also allows you to meet other treasurers and build the network of peers that you can learn from. Another way that treasurers, both new and experienced, can enrich their knowledge is by reading the wide-range of magazines, journals, internet reports and reports by the banks that are available, this again allows you to hear about the latest developments and about what your peers are doing.</p>
<h4>If you had a word of advice for anyone looking to join the profession what would it be?</h4>
<p>Do it, treasury is a great profession to be in! There are however, some areas that it is helpful to have an acute interest in. Firstly, you have to be interested in number crunching and enjoy developing insights from the numbers that can then be applied in practice. Secondly, it is important that you are interested in the global economic and geopolitical environment and have a good sense about what is happening and how this may affect business. These are the two areas that for me are key for anyone looking to join the profession.</p>
<h4>With the role of treasury being so demanding and there always being lots to learn, can you share with our readers how you relax outside of the office?</h4>
<p>When I am not spending time with my family, I enjoy reading about finance and economics. As I mentioned, this is a passion of mine so I am lucky that my main interests directly reflect what I have to do in my job. I am always learning.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[60 Second Interview: Andrew Marshall, Director of Treasury Solutions, AstraZeneca]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Andrew Marshall is an experienced consultant and project manager with a vast range of involvement both as an external consultant and as an entrenched in-house treasury executive. AstraZeneca is a leading biopharmaceutical company. Andrew speaks to Treasury Today from his current position as Director of Treasury Solutions at AstraZeneca…</em></p>
<h4>Can you tell me a little bit about your background, your experience, and what you like most about your role?</h4>
<p>I’ve been fortunate in my career that I’ve worked around the world in both the corporate sector in industries as diverse as Automotive, Aviation, Mining, Food and Beverage and Retail, as well as in the investment banking sector. This has given me a very broad based experience of treasury.</p>
<p>The great thing about working in the Pharmaceutical industry is that by the very nature of its business, it operates at the cutting edge of innovation. In the case of AstraZeneca, this is clearly evident within the Finance function. I have therefore been lucky to have been working alongside some wonderfully talented and visionary people, enabling a small treasury team to implement a huge transformation project in a relatively short space of time.</p>
<h4>Was the treasury space a lot different ten years ago from what it is today? If so, have any fundamentals changed and what are they?</h4>
<p>I prefer to reflect on the last three years as we are in the middle of a once-in-a-career financial crisis which has forced change upon treasury in ways that nobody could have ever envisaged. Consequentially, treasury as a function is now the subject of far greater levels of scrutiny than ever before, this having a major impact on both operational methodology and priorities. Although counterparty credit risk and liquidity grab all the headlines, we have also witnessed the rise in prominence of controls, security, audit compliance and the adherence to best practice methodologies. These are no longer ‘nice to haves’.</p>
<h4>What impact do you feel the (on-going) financial crisis has had on the corporate treasurer? Has this enabled any positive developments?</h4>
<p>The economic crisis has certainly put treasury back on the map, and as such its relative importance to the financial well-being of an organisation is now more apparent than ever before – from operating subsidiary right up to board level. The crisis has definitely provided treasury with unlimited free publicity and with it, increased levels of exposure. On a positive note, this heightened visibility has provided an ideal opportunity to showcase our talents and skills and to clearly demonstrate how these add genuine value to an organisation. How we choose to build on these solid foundations is in our own hands.</p>
<h4>What are the top five areas that treasurers should focus on to optimise success in 2012 and for the future?</h4>
<p>As an industry we need to continue to look and plan for life beyond the current crisis and to ensure that our operations are not only fit for purpose in today’s environment, but that they continue to be so well into the future. As such, my future focus areas are based around the need to leverage treasury’s new found ‘popularity’, and ensure we continue to build on this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the crisis as a catalyst to ensure adequate long term budget/funding allocation to continue a policy of on-going investment based around a flexible and dynamic five year operational roadmap;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work towards implementing the optimal operating model for your organisation and don’t be afraid to embrace outsourcing of ‘non-core’ treasury processes where this can add genuine benefit to your team;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review and question your current operations using different approaches such as best practice reviews, time and motion studies, for example, to remove wasteful and inefficient activities from your daily processes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a culture of on-going and continuous improvement within your team to ensure that you are regularly evaluating and questioning what, how, when and why you are performing your processes. Always ensure that technology is at the forefront of all planning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest time in existing vendor/supplier/banking relationships. The value of this is often overlooked, but this is a no cost activity that can pay big future dividends.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Does an experienced treasury consultant like yourself take your treasury ‘hat’ off from time to time? Can you share with our readers what fills your time outside of the office?</h4>
<p>I have no idea why I agreed to it but some comedian in the local pub has managed to convince me to do a 70 mile cross country run from Carlisle to Newcastle. This is an example of the dangers of drinking…</p>

		<title><![CDATA[60 Second Interview: Misys has China in its hands ]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>Misys PLC, a global leader in treasury, capital markets and banking software solutions, opened a new centre of excellence in Beijing at the beginning of 2012. The company says it has taken a foothold in China so that it can familiarise itself with local market conditions and service its expanding client base in the APAC region. Rose Jan, Head of Sales at Misys tells us more…</i></p>
<h4>What prompted your opening of a ‘centre of excellence’ in Beijing?</h4>
<p>The centre of excellence has been built to enhance Misys’ product development capability further. The centre was officially opened in January 2012 in Beijing with 150 people covering all Misys treasury and capital market solutions. We provide a wide variety of capabilities including quality assurance, coding and testing in the Beijing centre, which caters for our clients’ needs in China especially regional requirements – for example, CNY related, but other territories in APAC as well.</p>
<p>The rationale for the extension of our presence in China was due to customer numbers. We have added many more clients to the base there (now 400 strong) and we were keen to use that as a trigger to extend our presence by launching the centre of excellence and make use of the local expertise to staff our research and development site.</p>


<blockquote>We were keen to use [our growing client base] as a trigger to extend our presence by launching the centre of excellence and make use of the local expertise to staff our research and development site.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>We intend to grow our staff numbers to 300 in the near future so we can continue to offer the best and most varied solutions to meet the needs of the customers in China from a local base.</p>
<h4>What are the biggest challenges the financial services sector in China faces at the moment?</h4>
<p>China’s financial services sector is developing rapidly, but as an emerging market and for some historical reasons, there are some limitations within China on the financial market. So, one of the biggest challenges is how to make the Chinese financial market more manageable and flexible. This is a big focus for China.</p>


<blockquote>One of the biggest challenges is how to make the Chinese financial market more manageable and flexible. This is a big focus for China.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4>What kind of support do you provide to banks in China?</h4>
<p>We provide several kinds of support to our customers, including a 24/7 support team. This team works on site with the customers every day to address any support requirements. For instance one large customer that manages its global treasury business in Beijing and whose volume usage is very high on our system, needs that support from the centre in Beijing.</p>
<h4>What part is Misys playing in the internationalisation of the RMB?</h4>
<p>We put a team to research and work with one of the major banks in China on RMB IRS, cap and floor, CRM, RMB options and off-shore RMB bond issuance. All of these financial instruments are relatively new for the RMB market.</p>
