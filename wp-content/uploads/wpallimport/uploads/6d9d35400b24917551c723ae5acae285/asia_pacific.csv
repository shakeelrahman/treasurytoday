<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Australia, like the rest of the world, has bounced back from the pandemic and is now facing rising inflation and a need to rein it in – and also avoid a recession. The issues are similar to many other markets around the world, and Australia faces higher inflation, rising interest rates and a harder time for households. This also comes as uncertainty looms over the country’s relationship with China, and how this will impact companies and households.</p>
<p>There are reasons to be optimistic, however, as Australia’s inflation figures have so far not been near the level of other countries. Sarah Hunter, Senior Economist and Partner, Deals Tax and Legal at KPMG, expects the coming months to be difficult for the Australian economy, but not as bad as other markets where recession has been predicted. “I do not expect there to be a recession,” she says of the outlook for Australia. “Slower growth, definitely – but not a recession.”</p>
<p>Hunter comments the challenges that Australia is currently facing are the same as many other developed countries, such as rising fuel prices and supply chain disruptions. “There is a lot of commonality with other countries,” she says.</p>
<p>Also, Australia has experienced – like many other countries around the world – a strong economic recovery after the pandemic. The Australian government supported households and businesses through the lockdowns with social assistance programmes such as JobKeeper and Boosting Cash Flow. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics notes that three major strains of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the economy, with discretionary spending being the most impacted. Discretionary services declined as people were unable to go out but spending on discretionary goods increased as people stayed home and shopped online.</p>
<p>Hunter comments that the public health response to the pandemic in Australia was effective. And, despite the severity of the lockdowns, the country has been able to emerge without significant outbreaks of COVID-19. “That public health response appears to be paying dividends” and this includes employment returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.</p>
<p>Now, however, Australia – like many other countries – is experiencing a tight labour market and the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the 1970s, says Hunter. This tightness is in part due to low levels of immigration as a consequence of the pandemic. Workers were unable to travel to Australia and many of those already in Australia returned home during the pandemic. “That added tension to the labour market,” says Hunter.</p>
<p>Saul Eslake, Economist and Founder of Corinna Economic Advisory, comments that Australia’s inflation rate is lower than other Anglo-Saxon countries. At the time of writing, it was hovering just above 6%, while for other countries – such as the UK – it was around 10%. One difference with Australia, Eslake notes, “Wages have not made any material contribution to the acceleration in inflation.” In the US and UK, for example, wages have been rising at their fastest rate since the 1980s. And in New Zealand, they have been rising at their fastest rate since the 1990s. Anecdotally, however, Eslake is hearing that the wage growth will move up in Australia. One reason, explains Eslake, that the wages haven’t moved up so far is because there is a delay in the bargaining system for wage increases.</p>
<p>Also, the lack of migration has had an impact. “Employers who have come to rely on migrants have been holding out for a resumption of migration when borders reopened,” says Eslake. Australia had some of the tightest borders in the world during COVID-19, and many companies have been waiting for migration to return to pre-pandemic levels as an alternative to paying higher wages. This has been putting pressure on the economy, and also a squeeze on the tight labour market.</p>
<p>Australia’s immigration at net levels is not noteworthy compared to other countries, but as a proportion of its overall population it is. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, to the year ending June 2020, there were over 7.6 million migrants living in Australia. In the same period, the country’s population increased by 194,400 people due to net overseas migration. Perhaps what makes Australia unique, though, is that 29.8% of its population was born overseas. This, notes Eslake, means that Australia has the highest proportion of foreign-born people in the world, after Israel.</p>
<p>One issue, with this type of population growth, says Eslake, is that Australia has avoided focusing on training and education as much as it would have done if it was not relying on immigration. That discrepancy has been exposed, however, in the post-COVID-19 world.</p>
<p>Australia is unique in other respects. Eslake explains: “Unusually, for an advanced economy, it is an exporter of commodities and an importer of manufactured goods,” he explains. And this makes it unique in terms of the trading relations it has with other countries.</p>
<p>Australia’s relationship with China is a major contributor to its economy and has been troubled in recent years. Unlike other countries which may have been threatened by the rapid industrialisation of China – because their manufacturing industries lost out to China’s competition – Australia derived an enormous economic benefit because of its commodities exports. This has meant that Australia has become heavily dependent on China, Eslake says, and has not been dependent on another country in this way since the 1950s when Australia referred to Britain as the ‘mother country’.</p>
<p>According to figures from the Reserve Bank of Australia, 36.5% of Australia’s exports go to China, which far outweighs the relationship it has with other countries. Japan comes in second, accounting for 10.4% of Australia’s exports, then the United States with 6.2%, South Korea with 5.6%, India at 3.9% and the EU at 3.8%. The bulk of these exports are resources (68.7%), followed by agriculture (11.3%), services (9.8%) and manufacturing (7.6%).</p>
<p>The dependence of Australia’s economy on China has come to the fore since 2020 when diplomatic relations began to unravel. Geoff Raby, a former Australian ambassador to China, writing for a GLG, puts the relationship between the two sides in a broader context. He points to wider structural forces at play and how Australia shifted its view of China. He describes this as a shift from a position of strategic cooperation to one of competition. And more broadly, Australia chose to strongly align its geopolitical and strategic policies with the United States.</p>
<p>Australia-China relations began to deteriorate when Australia banned the Chinese technology company Huawei from being a provider on its 5G network, citing national security concerns. Australia further enraged China by demanding an investigation into the origins of the pandemic and China’s responsibility. China responded with trade penalties, including tariffs on wine and a ban on importing coal from Australia.</p>
<p>In recent months, there have been signs the relationship between the two countries is improving, but there are still many issues that need to be resolved.</p>
<p>“There are still uncertainties,” with the Australia-China relations, says Weihuan Zhou, Associate Professor in Law and Justice at the University of New South Wales. He explains there was a window of opportunity with Australia’s new prime minister and government. And there were signs of improvement when the two foreign ministers met, for example, which was a significant development as there had not been any diplomatic connection for more than two years, explains Zhou. But the situation in Taiwan has cast uncertainties over the current state of the relationship.</p>
<p>Australia is in the unique position of relying on the United States for its security but being economically dependent on China. With Taiwan, Australia could find itself stuck in the middle between two superpowers, but this situation is no different from its role in other political issues between US and China in the Asia Pacific region, notes Zhou.</p>
<p>Australia needs to ally itself with the United States for its security, but as yet, it has not been able to decouple its political and security interests from its economic interests. “As yet, there are no concrete policies that actually do this,” says Zhou.</p>
<p>He notes that at the beginning of the trade tensions in 2020, there were calls for Australia to take a more diplomatic approach that would balance its security interests (with the US) and its economic interest (with China). “We have not seen an immediate and clear policy that could achieve that balance,” says Zhou.</p>
<p>The disagreements centre on a few fundamental issues, says Zhou. The areas of sensitivity, he notes, are typically with high level issues that are of concern for China, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and human rights.</p>
<p>There have been signs, however, that the frosty relations have been thawing. Dr Jennifer Hsu, Research Fellow, Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program, Lowy Institute, comments that the change of Australia’s government in May 2022 marked a new point. Li Keqiang, the Premier of the Chinese State Council, for example, sent a note of congratulations when Anthony Alabanese became the Australian prime minister. She notes that the language used by Australia has become less confrontational and there have been a few high-level diplomatic meetings. After meeting with her counterpart in June, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong commented that it was a ‘first step’ in stabilising the relationship between the two sides.</p>
<p>Hsu notes that the caveat to expecting a better relationship is the current situation in Taiwan. The tensions in the Taiwan Strait – between the US and China – may be a ‘sticking point’ to whether Australia can get its relations with China back on track. Regarding the outlook for the next year or so, Hsu expects things to improve and there has been ‘chatter’ that the ban on Australian coal may be lifted.</p>
<p>Such easing of trade restrictions will likely have a positive impact on corporates that do business in Australia. As those companies keep an eye on the developing relations at an international level, they will also be paying close attention to matters at home. Interest rates, for example, have started to rise and they are expected to continue this trajectory. Eslake notes the central bank’s raising of interest rates represents Australia’s “most rapidly tightening of monetary policy since 1994.” This, however, he notes is still very low by historical standards. Eslake expects that the cash rate will rise further and will be 2.5% by the end of 2022. Meanwhile the financial markets have been pricing the rate to peak at around 3% or 3.5% in 2023. “That would still be relatively low by historical standards, but households are carrying record debt,” says Eslake. This could in turn impact spending power and have a knock-on effect for companies that primarily sell to consumers, he notes.</p>
<p>Also, Australian companies and the multinational corporations that do business in Australia are likely to be affected by global market conditions. While Australia may not be heading for a recession itself, many other countries will be, which may also have a knock-on effect for Australia.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>With car sales in 2021 almost equal to the total for the US, Japan and India combined, the Chinese market is fundamental to the success of the automotive industry.</p>
<p>In this context the most recent data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers is encouraging, with more than 2.4 million vehicles sold in July as production returned to normal as government incentives – including a reduction in purchase taxes – began to take effect.</p>
<p>So-called ‘new energy’ (electric and plug-in hybrid) vehicles accounted for just under a quarter of total sales. BYD overtook Tesla as the world’s best-selling electric vehicle manufacturer in the first half of this year and a number of other Chinese companies are now among the largest producers of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles globally.</p>
<p>In July, a briefing held by the State Council Information Office underscored the importance of promoting sales of new energy vehicles and ensuring the supply of auto chips and related raw materials at a relatively stable price. Guo Shougang, an official with the industry ministry, was quoted as saying that efforts were underway to expedite a study into extending purchase tax exemptions for electric cars.</p>
<p>These comments echo an earlier observation by foreign direct investment consultancy Dezan Shira &amp; Associates that a number of ministries including the Ministry of Information and Industrial Technology were negotiating with manufacturers about extending electric vehicle subsidies that were originally set to expire at the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Commerce has committed to other measures to encourage consumption, including incentives for using electric vehicles, improving the availability of charging facilities, and encouraging the replacement of older vehicles.</p>
<p>However, Dezan Shira &amp; Associates observes that China’s long-term strategy of reducing subsidies, coupled with supply chain issues and Covid lockdowns, is likely to drive up the price of electric vehicles over the coming months.</p>
<p>Manufacturers such as XPeng and NIO have responded by either absorbing the subsidy loss or cancelling preferential lending programmes for potential purchasers.</p>
<p>The surging cost of a number of automotive components has required Chinese car manufacturers to rapidly adjust their procurement strategies and increase budgets for procurement explains Jing Yang, Director of China Corporate Research at capital markets credit rating, commentary and research provider Fitch Ratings. “Larger inventories of parts and unfinished cars, and larger prepayments all have an impact on their working capital cycle,” she says. “Meanwhile, as car manufacturers are increasingly involved in critical parts production and sourcing, they need to allocate additional capital for such investments – in the form of capital expenditure, joint venture investments, or equity investments in upstream suppliers.”</p>
<p>For example, suppliers of electric vehicle batteries may demand joint investment in production lines from car manufacturers to secure battery supplies.</p>
<p>“These strategies require the finance and treasury team to provide professional assessments of the project returns and also to facilitate internal or external financing,” adds Jing.</p>
<p>Richard Hilgert, Senior Equity Analyst – Automotive at financial services firm Morningstar says finance and treasury teams play a vital role in supporting the procurement and supply chain strategies of the major car manufacturers in China by maintaining availability of funds in a volatile commodities market and by working with senior executives to understand future funding needs as the bill of materials changes in the shift to vehicle electrification.</p>

<p>Gao Tao, Associate Director Light Vehicle Production Forecasting at automotive solution provider S&amp;P Global Mobility refers to BYD as a success story in this respect, noting that its sales are up by 77% year-on-year despite the difficulties faced by all manufacturers since the start of 2022.</p>
<p>“The major driver of this growth is a stable in-house supply chain in the face of restrictions in semiconductor availability and increased material prices,” he says. “For other OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] relying on external supply chains, most new energy vehicle producers have increased their vehicle prices since the start of the year and some features have been cut off to save chips for major functions.”</p>
<p>The new automotive business model in China is customer service-centric and in this new world, mobility becomes both shared and autonomous explains Purshottam Purswani, APAC Chief Technology Officer for information technology service and consulting company Atos.</p>
<p>“The industry is evolving with many banks either providing the billing platform or integrating with car manufacturers’ procurement or supplier management systems to provide supply chain finance,” he says.</p>
<p>Purswani observes that car manufacturers’ own financial service companies are offering digital buying platforms or integrating with well-known e-commerce platforms. “This reinforces manufacturers’ investment in digital services for their consumers or sales channels,” he adds.</p>
<p>The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers has acknowledged that car production has been severely affected by the shortage of chips and the increase in the price of raw materials for batteries this year. Manufacturers have adopted a variety of strategies to address these issues.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Matteo Fini, Vice President Automotive Supply Chain Technology and Aftermarket at S&amp;P Global Mobility noted that LFP or lithium iron phosphate-cathode batteries would stand to gain further competitiveness in the market should nickel and cobalt prices continue to stay elevated.</p>
<p>LFP chemistry was initially favoured by Chinese manufacturers BYD and CATL as a low cost alternative to nickel and cobalt-rich chemistries. Chinese manufacturers hold a virtual monopoly on this technology thanks to key patents registered by a consortium of Chinese academic research institutions which agreed with local battery manufacturers to forego licensing fees provided these batteries were only produced in China, although these patents will start expiring from this year.</p>
<p>In 2014, Tesla reportedly tried and failed to acquire Californian lithium extraction start-up Simbol Materials, which later ceased operations.</p>
<p>At Tesla’s Battery Day event in 2020, the car manufacturer seemed to indicate that it was seriously considering establishing its own mining operations through the purchase of a 10,000 acre site in Nevada, although nothing appears to have come of this to date.</p>
<p>Industry experts reckon Tesla is more interested in securing long-term supply agreements with existing and potential new mines. But with lithium prices having increased by around 400% over the last two years it appears that the prospect of the car manufacturer acquiring and running a mining company cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), five mineral operations in Australia, two brine operations each in Argentina and Chile, and two brine and one mineral operation in China account for the majority of world lithium production with a number of additional Chinese operations under development.</p>
<p>But demand from Chinese car manufacturers far outstrips supply. A paper published in Frontiers in Environmental Science in June noted that the country accounts for just 6.8% of global lithium reserves and that 86.5% of its requirements are imported.</p>
<p>Hilgert notes that Chinese electric car manufacturers seeking to ensure sufficient supplies of commodities such as nickel, graphite and lithium are increasingly going directly to the raw material mine operators to secure supplies.</p>
<p>Most Chinese electric car manufacturers still rely on the battery suppliers and a cost pass-through mechanism was established this year which typically links battery procurement costs with the cost of the key battery metals.</p>
<p>Electric vehicle makers are paying larger amounts upfront, making joint investments in battery production lines and even establishing joint ventures with battery cell producers to ensure battery supplies, observes Jing.</p>


<blockquote><p>It may be easier to secure supplies for Chinese manufacturers than those in other countries, but eventually they will face similar challenges in the supply chain given the rapid increase in battery demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Rico Luman, Senior Sector Economist, ING</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“A small number have also started to make equity investments in upstream battery materials,” he says. “Yet with the exception of BYD, few Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers have taken further steps to acquire battery metal mines themselves.”</p>
<p>One exception is BYD, which earlier this summer announced that it would invest more than US$4bn in a battery factory and mining project in China’s Jiangxi province that could produce up to 100,000 tonnes of lithium annually in addition to a recently commissioned plant in Shaoxing. At current consumption levels the new facility would produce about 125% of the battery cell volume produced by BYD in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p>“Some OEMs are cooperating with battery producers who have either already established subsidiary companies or acquired lithium enterprises,” adds Gao. “Vehicle manufacturers with in-house supplies are expanding their lithium mining businesses in South America and Africa.”</p>
<p>Supply of battery metals is about to lag demand as manufacturers ramp up production and demand soars. This means a new supply chain crunch could emerge around these metals in the next few years – especially for lithium.</p>
<p>That is the view of Rico Luman, Senior Sector Economist at Dutch multinational banking and financial services corporation ING, who notes that concentration of supply in a small number of countries makes it more vulnerable to disruption.</p>
<p>“Large international car manufacturers such as Ford, GM and Tesla have moved to secure supplies via direct agreements with mining companies,” he says. “Chinese manufacturers are competing in the same global markets for raw materials and with China now taking the lead in the electric vehicle transition – not only in terms of absolute numbers, but also relatively in terms of share of new sales – sufficient supply of batteries is even more important to accommodate rising short term demand.”</p>
<p>The fact that most battery production capacity is still based in Asia offers an advantage to Chinese manufacturers.</p>
<p>“It also helps that Chinese market leader BYD is a battery manufacturer itself and thus it will also negotiate to secure supplies of raw materials,” explains Luman. “China produces lithium and nickel, but when it comes to ramping up production to keep up with demand it may also need to rely on supply from elsewhere. It may be easier to secure supplies for Chinese manufacturers than those in other countries, but eventually they will face similar challenges in the supply chain given the rapid increase in battery demand.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the introduction of new digital buying platforms and the ‘car as a service model’ has made relatively little impact on the finances of car manufacturers in China, although Gao acknowledges that greater use of digital buying platforms has reduced the number of dealerships and made it cheaper for manufacturers to expand their distribution networks.</p>
<p>According to Hilgert these trends have required manufacturers to increase their investment in IT infrastructure, software engineers, and digitisation of their vehicles.</p>
<p>Jing notes that although the direct sales model has been adopted by many electric vehicle start-up companies as a means of directly accessing customers without having to provide funding to dealers – the approach taken by traditional car makers – it comes with downsides.</p>
<p>For example, manufacturers have to bear the inventory risks themselves and invest intensively in distribution networks, which are typically a combination of an online platform and a large number of offline showrooms.</p>
<p>“Under the car as a service model, car manufacturers (or their service subsidiaries) typically hold the vehicle fleet on their own balance sheet, so it is an asset heavy business model,” he explains. “Car makers can opt to move such vehicle assets off the balance sheet through asset-backed securities or other structured finance products, or they may introduce strategic/financial investors to the car as a service companies to dilute their own stakes. However, e-commerce penetration is yet to improve in China’s retail car market.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It’s like a chronic condition that flares up every now and again, sometimes with different symptoms. It’s been there for years – the root causes are known – and sometimes it seems there is no cure.</p>
<p>That’s one way to think about the relations between Japan and South Korea, two countries that have a difficult relationship because of deep-seated issues related to Japan’s colonisation of Korea between 1910 and 1945. And it’s not just a diplomatic issue, the flare-ups have impacted trade, both economies, and the companies that do business there.</p>
<p>Things are looking up, however, now that South Korea has a new administration, led by President Yoon Suk-yeol. Taku Tamaki, Lecturer in International Relations at the UK’s Loughborough University, comments that under the previous administration, of Moon Jae-in, “things were pretty bad”. He points to a recent incident that is symptomatic of the wider issues: in early 2022 Japan made a bid for its gold and silver mines on Sado Island to be included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. This was met with uproar in South Korea, as it was deemed insensitive because the site was used for forced Korean labour.</p>
<p>As with the ongoing dispute, that pattern is the same. The Korean side feels aggrieved because Japan has not acknowledged any wrongdoing. Meanwhile Japan feels that the issue has been dealt with – they have made reparations – and Korea is unfairly painting Japan as the bad guy.</p>
<p>Now it seems the situation may be improving, and the frosty relations thawing. Eunil Cho, Associate Research Fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses and Lecturer in International Relations at Yonsei University in Seoul, says that both sides have the same purpose of improving relations. In recent years, she explains, South Korea-Japan relations “stalled in every aspect” and the Covid pandemic accelerated the impasse. “Because business, students, and others were unable to come and go due to COVID-19, a politically, economically and historically strained relationship was easily continued. But things are changing right now. And both political elites as well as both societies are ready to get back on track,” says Cho.</p>
<p>The spat between South Korea and Japan has a long history, and is rooted in Japan’s colonialisation period, in which it used forced Korean labour and ‘comfort women’ – Koreans who were forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese army. In 1965 an agreement was reached in which Japan paid millions in loans and grants. Whether this was compensation for wrongdoing or not is a major bone of contention. Korea argues that the 1965 agreement was signed under a dictatorship – without the consensus of the Korean victims – and the funds were for economic development, rather than compensation.</p>
<p>Lauren Richardson, Lecturer in the Department of International Relations and Director of the ANU Japan Institute at Australian National University, explains that the issue gained more prominence as South Korea democratised in the late 1980s. That was when various victims started to mobilise and seek redress. “In 1965 they had no voice and were not recognised,” says Richardson. “It’s been a long process,” she adds, explaining that they have been pursuing litigation for years now. And some of this has focused on challenging the basis of the 1965 agreement.</p>
<p>There have been various court cases. For example, in 1997 two forced labour victims took legal action against Nippon Steel Corporation, which went through various courts. The Japanese courts found that the company did not have liability for the old company that existed during the colonial era. Also, the South Korean lower courts threw out the claim. However, the higher courts in South Korea took a different view. In 2012 it was ruled that Japan’s colonisation was illegal and the 1965 agreement was to settle debt and establish economic ties between two countries – it did not cover reparations for Japan’s wrongdoing. In 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court upheld this view, which triggered another flare-up in relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Usually, a court ruling about your country in another country can be ignored, notes Richardson. But the litigation impacted Japanese companies that are doing business in South Korea because the courts made it possible to seize the assets of affected Japanese companies to compensate the victims. This prompted a “downward spiral” that effectively threw out the 1965 treaty, says Richardson.</p>
<p>Japan retaliated. It removed Korea from its list of top trading partners and put restrictions on chemicals, which would affect Korea’s production of chips and displays. Korea hit back and removed Japan from its favourite list of trading partners.</p>
<p>As it stands, there have been reports – for example, in the Asia Times – that the export of chemicals by Japan was not actually halted, and Korea’s chip production was not impacted.</p>
<p>Also, the assets of Japanese companies in Korea were not liquidated. However, they came pretty close to pressing that button, says Richardson. “[President] Moon was very close to toying with that idea – that would have been the point of no return.” As yet, Korea hasn’t taken that dramatic step. Throughout this period, both countries were preparing for the economic shock and were anticipating a hit to their economy as a result of the trade spat.</p>
<p>These days, however, the situation is looking rosier. Yoon took office in South Korea in May, and in the lead up to the new era, he had signalled that he wanted stronger bilateral relations with Japan.</p>
<p>Cho at Yonsei University comments that things are changing with the transition from the Moon to the Yoon administration and expects to see relations improve. “When President Yoon was the candidate for the presidency, one of his pledges in foreign policies was the normalisation of South Korea-Japan relations and paving the ground for developing future-oriented relationship,” she says. “Japan seems to recognise that the Yoon administration will try to improve Korea-Japan relations. This can be an opportunity to resolve the mismatch of perceptions of each other,” says Cho.</p>
<p>This is in line with Tamaki’s view of the new administration. He notes that Japan was paying close attention to the candidates in the run-up to the presidential election, and the conservative candidate – Yoon – had a softer stance towards Japan. “I think the Japanese government is happy the conservative President is in power,” says Tamaki. As for the state of diplomatic relations, he says, “I think there is scope for improvement,” adding that both sides have signalled they are willing to explore better ties.</p>
<p>There have been reports of friendlier relations, with envoys being dispatched to smooth things over. Ahead of Yoon’s inauguration there were reports that the Korean delegation wanted to “fasten the button of a new Korea-Japan relationship”, a reference to a saying that if the top button is done correctly, the others will fall in line.</p>
<p>Also, US President Joe Biden’s influence has been felt. He visited South Korea and Japan in May and has been keen to build alliances in the region. And the Asia Times reported that there were baby steps taken by Japan and Korea towards talks on the sidelines of the NATO summit at the end of June.</p>
<p>Richardson argues that the role of the United States is limited in this issue and its only leverage is as a security guarantor – in theory it could threaten to withdraw troops. However, “These disputes have nothing to do with security,” says Richardson. “This dispute means so much to the South Korean and the Japanese governments, and they will put this before security concerns,” says Richardson.</p>
<p>In 2019 when tensions escalated, and South Korea had been downgraded on the list of Japan’s trading partners, Richardson says that Korea was close to tearing up the military intelligence sharing agreement that it has with Japan. This didn’t happen, but Moon – the President at the time – was close to the brink.</p>
<p>Trade relations between the two countries now look better, however. Cho comments, “The current move to improve Korea-Japan relations from a broader perspective is certainly expected to catalyse bilateral trade relations.” In terms of trade relations, she explains, the two sides share the same concerns. “It is a trade dependence issue,” she explains. “As protectionism began and economic coercion took place, the countries began to think that excessive trade dependence on a country could increase vulnerability.”</p>
<p>Considering this, both countries have a need to diversify their trade and both countries have been participating in discussions in the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). “I think there is room for improvement in South Korea-Japan trade relations in the process of forming new supply chains in the Asia Pacific region,” she says.</p>
<p>And all of this has an impact on the companies that do business in Korea and Japan. Cho says, “What has been painful for the companies that do business in either Korea or Japan is that a two-track approach of separating politics and the economy has not been followed in recent years. The bilaterally strained relations have been a critical factor in the deterioration of trade relations, but the Trump administrations’ American-first rhetoric and the US-China trade war also had an impact on destabilising trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, if the two governments are willing to pursue an improved relationship, it will be possible to reduce the burden on companies that want to stably develop their businesses there.”</p>
<p>At the moment, it is difficult to say what the outlook will be for companies, says Tamaki at Loughborough University. He notes that as the new administration begins, the prospects are quite positive. “There are good indications that the relationship will improve. It all depends on how the Japanese conservatives and ultra-conservatives behave over the next several months,” he notes. “Businesses are quite pragmatic,” says Tamaki. He comments that South Korean businesses and Japanese investors know what kind of things trigger public opinion and they feel optimistic about the current state of affairs. “Historically speaking, conservative Presidents do quite well – I think the Japanese side welcomes this change in administration,” Tamaki adds.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Cho notes that it will be difficult for the relationship to be completely improved and the issues resolved. “What can be said at this point is that the Yoon government wants to improve Korea-Japan relations, and there is enough consensus with Japan’s Kishida government on that. It is expected that these political consultations will positively affect the improvement of the economic environment for the companies and businesses,” says Cho.</p>
<p>And while the relationship has been difficult, Richardson at ANU comments that this is something that had to happen. “The 1965 agreement was a very superficial level reconciliation – it did not set them up for the long term.” This treaty she says was like a “time bomb”. “It had to go off. It is messy, but the relationship will be better for it,” she comments, adding that the victims need to get their reckoning.</p>
<p>Although the relationship has been in an unhealthy condition, with occasional – yet serious flareups – the prognosis is more positive and there are hopes that the issues will eventually go into remission.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious project, a grand vision for Chinese overseas development to connect Asia with Europe and Africa – a modern-day Silk Road with networks both on sea and land. But like someone whose eyes were bigger than their stomach at a buffet, China has had something of a lending binge that is now being corrected.</p>
<p>The project has entered a period of belt tightening and Chinese lending to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has dramatically fallen. Like the buffet, items have been left on the plate and cast aside; partially built roads lead to nowhere and borrower countries have been lumbered with useless ‘white elephants’ and debts they are struggling to repay.</p>
<p>This picture of the BRI has called into question its sustainability. And the fall in lending has been dramatic: according to figures from Boston University, Chinese overseas lending was US$3.9bn in 2019, a fraction of the US$75bn that was recorded in 2016.</p>
<p>Yunnan Chen, a Senior Research Officer in the Development and Public Finance programme at think tank ODI, explains that data from numerous reputable sources shows that Chinese overseas lending has dropped. “The reasons for the decline are manifold,” she tells Treasury Today Asia. And while there have been debates about debt issues and BRI projects not working out, “The main driver of the decline [in Chinese lending] has been the domestic economy,” she says. Domestically, there has been regulatory pressure on financial institutions to rein in their lending. As a consequence, lending overseas has also dropped, she explains.</p>
<p>When compared to other countries, the scale of China’s international lending programme is massive. Scott Morris, Director of the US Development Policy Initiative, Co-Director of Sustainable Finance, and Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development, explains that official sources – such as World Bank data – show that China is now by far the biggest lender in the world, government lender in the world, and is bigger than all of the major lenders of the Paris Club (which includes the United States, United Kingdom and Japan) combined. However, “It is pretty clear that official estimates understate the scale of lending,” says Morris.</p>
<p>This points to the issue of ‘hidden’ lending. Dr Bradley Parks, Executive Director at research and innovation lab AidData at the College of William and Mary, explains how there has been a major increase in hidden debt. This is based on the AidData report Banking on the Belt and Road – which looked at 13,427 Chinese development projects worth US$843bn across 165 countries – and highlights how debt levels and implementation problems are affecting the BRI.</p>
<p>Matthew Mingey and Agatha Kratz, Senior Analyst and Associate Director respectively at research firm Rhodium Group, also point out that the overseas lending is much larger than previously thought. For example, the Boston University data doesn’t include lending from commercial banks, which has increased. And it is other entities – not governments – that are increasingly the recipients of the loans, such as state-owned enterprises or investment vehicles.</p>
<p>Parks at AidData describes this as a trend of falling sovereign debt and the rise of hidden debt. He estimates that 70% of China’s overseas lending is not to governments. And because these loans are to other entities, they do not appear on the government’s balance sheet even though there may be an implicit – or even explicit – understanding that the government would have to step in if the project runs into difficulty.</p>
<p>Parks says that 42% of countries have levels of public debt exposure that is more than 10% of their GDP. “These unreported debts are worth approximately US$385bn and the hidden debt problem is getting worse over time,” Parks says. He adds that governments of borrowing countries may not know the value of the debts they may or may not have to service in the future.</p>
<p>Another element of the ‘hidden’ debt problem, explains Morris, is that debtors are supposed to report their obligations, but many are just not good at reporting, or they may prefer to keep their borrowing hidden.</p>
<p>Even with lending that isn’t included in official figures, there has still been a decline, especially during the pandemic. Morris comments this is part of a broader trend of China overlending in the past and now there has been a correction.</p>
<p>Mingey and Kratz at Rhodium Group argue that Chinese creditors have been rethinking their lending after they have run into problems with some of their projects. Borrowers have needed to renegotiate their loans, and according to the Rhodium Group researchers, up to a quarter of lending has run into trouble.</p>
<p>AidData research also highlights problems with the BRI projects and found that 35% had experienced problems with implementation, including corruption scandals, labour violations, environmental hazards and public protests.</p>
<p>Amid this, some projects are falling by the wayside. Brooke Russell, an Associate Director at AidData and co-author of the Banking on Belt and Road report said, “Host country policymakers are mothballing high-profile BRI projects because of corruption and overpricing concerns, as well as major changes in public sentiment that make it difficult to maintain close relations with China. It remains to be seen if ‘buyer’s remorse’ among BRI participant countries will undermine the long-run sustainability of China’s global infrastructure initiative, but clearly Beijing needs to address the concerns of host countries in order to sustain support for the BRI.”</p>
<p>Chen at ODI notes that loan repayment issues have become more prominent in the last five to seven years. This comes in the context of accusations of ‘debt trap diplomacy’ and predatory lending by China, which Chen doesn’t agree with. “I would push back against the ‘predatory’ narrative – that these Chinese banks are working to serve a grand strategic purpose of locking in African countries to become tributary states. I think that is very simplistic and it is not evidence based,” she says. The idea of the ‘debt trap’, she adds, is a “myth that refuses to die”.</p>
<p>With many of the cases, says Chen, the reality is a lot more complex. The port at Hambantota at Sri Lanka is often given as an example of China seizing assets. From the outside, she says, it looks like the government of Sri Lanka was in debt and the Chinese took it over. “This is the example that has been thrown around of ‘this is what happens – China seizes your assets’ – but that is not true,” says Chen.</p>
<p>Academics Deborah Brautigam and Meg Rithmire wrote in The Atlantic that Chinese lending has been portrayed as the Mafia lending to a hapless gambler who is then in danger of losing a limb. They argue that Sri Lanka’s debts were much larger than the Hambantota port deal, and the Chinese finance was not a cause of the country’s financial distress. Also, there was never a default on the port and it was not an asset seizure. They write, “China’s march outward, like its domestic development, is probing and experimental, a learning process marked by frequent adjustment. After the construction of the port in Hambantota, for example, Chinese firms and banks learned that strongmen fall and that they’d better have strategies for dealing with political risk. They’re now developing these strategies, getting better at discerning business opportunities and withdrawing when they know they can’t win. American leaders and thinkers from both sides of the aisle still give speeches about China’s ‘modern-day colonialism’.”</p>
<p>Another case that has received widespread attention is the upgrade and expansion to the Entebbe International Airport in Uganda. This was also widely reported as an asset seizure, but the details are more complex. To address the various rumours and speculation, AidData published the actual loan contract between the government of Uganda and China Eximbank. AidData notes that the collateral is not actually the airport itself – an illiquid asset – but rather cash that is deposited in an escrow account. Also the agreement takes the unusual step, notes Parks, of stipulating that they have all revenues generated by the airport – even though this is a public infrastructure that existed before the existence of this loan from China.</p>
<p>Uganda does have agency in this arrangement, however, and has demonstrated that it is possible to push back against stringent terms, notes Parks. For example, when it renegotiated, the government of Uganda pushed back against China Eximbank’s demand that it has the right to approve spending decisions of the Civil Aviation Authority. When Uganda protested, China Eximbank scaled back its demands and agreed to monitoring the decisions instead.</p>
<p>Parks concludes that the Uganda case is not a debt trap. “Our analysis of the terms and conditions in the contract does not support the allegation that China engages in predatory lending. We instead find that Beijing is a shrewd negotiator who is willing to impose intrusive conditions upon sovereign borrowers to protect its balance sheet.”</p>
<p>Despite the reports, the Chinese Embassy in Uganda denied that it would take over the airport. “Not a single project in Africa has ever been confiscated by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>All this discussion of ‘predatory’ lending is perhaps unhelpful. Countries on the African continent are often being given too little credit to look out for their own interests, says Morris. Rather than using the term ‘predatory’, he prefers to look at the numbers and the behaviour. “Chinese lending is remarkably risk tolerant,” says Morris and these institutions are lending in situations where the borrower is more vulnerable, and having a harder time servicing the loan, because of the scale of the borrowing from China.</p>
<p>On the question of whether they are victims in this lending, Morris comments that “China is willing to refinance and restructure terms.” This is not necessarily a beneficent repayment plan as it can be structured so the creditor receives more money over time. You can go too far in saying that these refinancings are mutually agreeable and these borrower countries can look after themselves; the Chinese contract terms clearly favour the creditor, he adds.</p>
<p>In debt renegotiations, however, there are issues because of the secretive nature of some of the lending contracts. Parks comments, “by shielding their contractual arrangements from public scrutiny, Chinese state-owned banks have made it difficult for other lenders to know if they are positioning themselves at the front of the repayment line.”</p>
<p>On the question of confidentiality, Chen at ODI says, “Debt transparency is definitely a problem for borrowers from China. A lot of these loans require you to take out an NDA [non-disclosure agreement]. Chinese banks do not behave like the World Bank or multilateral development banks; they behave more like commercial banks,” Chen explains. In commercial lending it is advantageous to both the lender and the borrower for the rates not to be disclosed. This is typically not a problem, says Chen – it’s only when the loan needs to be restructured that it is problematic.</p>
<p>Chen explains that the Covid pandemic caused a widespread shock to many countries and affected their ability to repay. “The problem with debt transparency is a bit of a live wire if you want to renegotiate with other creditors,” says Chen, and no one has an interest in opening up their books.</p>
<p>From a legal perspective, says Chen, these contracts are default and commonplace, “They are not particularly unique or nefarious,” she says. She also notes that if there is a legal requirement in a country that the loan has to be disclosed, this overrides any agreement that might be stated in the contract.</p>
<p>In terms of how the Chinese lenders operate, Chen and Kanyi Lui, an international finance lawyer, wrote a report on China’s lending practices and found that, “Chinese lenders tend to give more weight to perceived long-term creditworthiness and the quality of the relationship with the borrower over technical contractual terms. Contractual terms should be evaluated within this broader relational context.”</p>
<p>Chen says that in previous cases Chinese banks have been willing to defer the payment when borrowers ask to renegotiate, “In that sense Chinese banks are quite flexible,” she says.</p>
<p>On the question of what happens to the debtors if they are unable to meet their obligations? “Chinese lenders are perfectly willing to kick the can down the road,” says Morris. “Lending to support big complex infrastructure projects is not easy – you can’t just flick a switch. It’s not easy to walk away,” says Morris.</p>
<p>This may be affecting more countries than previously thought. A paper by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy by Sebastian Horn, Carmen Reinhart, and Christoph Trebesch in January 2022, argues that defaults and missed payments are not usually disclosed. The research constructed a dataset of debt restructurings and found that problems – or ‘credit events’ – are “surprisingly frequent”. The research notes that China’s lending boom will likely result in a number of defaults or restructurings. The report notes, “If history is any guide, multi-year debt workouts and serial restructurings lie ahead.” Also, a lack of transparency means that it is difficult to assess whether the lending will be sustainable.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways that the Chinese creditors seek to get repaid even if the country is defaulting on their debts, says Morris. “It is hard to pick up the project and carry it back to China,” Morris jokes. “The Chinese are kind of stuck with the debtor” and that is why they have large escrow accounts in place. Those accounts may be held in Beijing with a commitment to revenue flows that may or may not be from the project itself, says Morris.</p>
<p>Chen argues that in reality it can be difficult to claim collateral that has been pledged. “We have not seen an asset seizure. In reality it is very difficult to claim it – even if the collateral is in an escrow account overseas,” she says, adding that if money is drawn on that account, then they wouldn’t get the rest of their money back.</p>
<p>This decline in lending, however, does not mean that China’s ambitions for the Belt and Road have changed. “I do not think that the Belt and Road is over or finished,” says Morris. “I think the sustainability of this overseas lending is very much part and parcel of China’s investment scheme,” he says, adding that is likely the government would step in if necessary to support the initiative.</p>


","Chinese lending to Belt and Road infrastructure projects has dropped dramatically, calling into question the sustainability of the initiative. And with accusations of ‘debt trap diplomacy’ persisting, what does the future hold for the project and debtor countries that struggle to repay their Belt and Road loans?",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2022-05-06-tta-01-ia__urban-architectural-landscape-jinjiang-chengdu-1172035588__1920x1080.jpg,2022-05-01,Asia Pacific,False

<p>If you are lucky enough to have a good office view in Singapore, you can see the container ships approaching and leaving the port. The locals say you can judge the state of the global economy by how many ships there are; if it looks busy, business is booming.</p>
<p>Singapore has long been a trading hub and in recent years has been building the infrastructure to match it. Multinationals and international banks have set up regional offices there to support the financial transactions for the physical trade that can be seen from their windows.</p>
<p>Singapore has been able to reinvent itself throughout its history, says Zennon Kapron, Founder and Director of Kapronasia, a consulting firm that focuses on the fintech industry. “It is a small country with very few natural resources. It has always had a story to drive growth: 15 to 20 years ago it was biotech; ten years ago it was tech, and now it is fintech,” he says.</p>
<p>And the focus on fintech is creating an incredible amount of economic growth, he says, and a number of the Southeast Asian unicorn companies – high growth tech companies with a valuation of more than US$1bn – have a presence in Singapore.</p>
<p>It is an attractive place to do business because of its infrastructure, tax regime, and the ‘cluster effect’ that has been created by having start-ups, multinational corporations and international banks all in such close proximity.</p>
<p>This has been proactively managed by the government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has pushed for Singapore to be a fintech hub – both in terms of the innovation and building an ecosystem. The city state currently has more than 40 innovation labs and more than 1,000 fintech companies. MAS sees the financial sector as an integral part of Singapore’s ambition to be a smart nation, and it’s not just about fostering innovation – it’s about having a purpose as well.</p>
<p>At the Singapore Fintech Festival in November 2021, MAS Managing Director Ravi Menon said, “The future of money, finance, and the internet will have far-reaching effects on economies and societies. It is important that public authorities and the financial and technology communities work together to shape that future, so that money, finance, and the internet can be forces for good, helping to expand economic opportunity, enhance social inclusion, foster stability, and protect our planet. Ultimately, money, finance and the internet must serve the people who use them.”</p>
<p>Premdeep Shah, Deutsche Bank’s Corporate Bank Head of Fintech and Platform Coverage for ASEAN, comments how Singapore is a vibrant place when it comes to fintech, which has been supported by the government and the policies of MAS. “Singapore is a powerhouse of innovation,” says Shah, adding that its small population means that it is a testbed of the latest consumer trends, which can then get rolled out to ASEAN and beyond. “The adoption of technology is very strong in Singapore,” he says.</p>
<p>With the latest fintech trends, Shah says, “corporate treasurers may think that innovation and disruption primarily affects start-ups – or fintech themselves – they might not think it is relevant to them, but that is not entirely true,” says Shah. There are companies that are at the forefront of this innovation, he says, and “these companies do not have to be in the fintech space”.</p>
<p>Kapron comments that he has observed a shift in the habits of treasurers and their approach to fintech. Only a few years ago, he says, the idea of approving a US$2m transaction from their phone seemed foreign, for example. “Now they are comfortable with this and high-value transactions have come to the mobile phone – they can sit at lunch, approve payment. There has been a change in mindset,” he says.</p>
<p>Now the major trend around innovation is about insight, says Kapron. Treasurers want these high value transactions to go through at relatively high speed – real-time payments, the infrastructure of which is already in place – but the speed is not so sensitive in high-value transactions, says Kapron. “The change is in the opportunity to better analyse the data around treasury and cash management and to be able to act on that in an automated way,” he says.</p>
<p>There are a number of innovations coming out of Singapore that are relevant to treasurers. Shah notes that one is using blockchain for supply chain financing. An automaker that purchases headlights from a supplier, for example, is now able to use supply chain financing – through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) – for its supplier, and its supplier’s supplier, or even one level below that, comments Shah.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Rahul O’Verma, Asia Pacific Head of Innovation for Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, comments on the other items that belong on the list of treasury innovations. These include the rise of digital assets; embedded finance and how it is driving direct-to-consumer growth; the coming age of healthtech; and using fintech to make better decisions around environmental, social and governance (ESG).</p>
<p>Citi has set up a new digital assets unit and is ramping up hiring to boost expertise in blockchain, digital assets and digital currencies. Those hired will be based in Singapore, as well as other cities, explains Deven Somaya, Singapore Product Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. The bank has also boosted its capabilities for instant payments, and been involved in hackathons and accelerator programmes. It has also partnered with API Exchange to tap into the ecosystem of fintech firms and be able to deliver a range of solutions – via APIs [application programming interfaces] – more quickly, he adds.</p>
<p>Such initiatives reflect how transaction banks in Singapore are exploring a number of areas of innovation to support their treasury clients. Deutsche Bank’s Shah comments on how other fintech trends in Singapore have a bearing on what treasury innovation looks like. “Buy Now Pay Later is a trend that is particularly hot right now in Singapore,” says Shah, and is relevant to corporates that sell directly to consumers. Companies that do not have this firmly embedded into their payments and collections may face challenges in getting it off the ground, he says.</p>
<p>Also, embedded finance – a trend that O’Verma at Citi also identified – is becoming more relevant and enables non-financial companies to offer financial products. Shah gives the example of a ride-hailing app making it possible to book a journey and an insurance policy at the same time. The insurance lasts for the duration of the journey and could cost as little as 30 cents, for example.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank has a number of large digitally-native companies among its clients. In developing solutions that support the needs of these innovative companies, the bank is able to feed the latest trends back into the product development for its clients in more traditional industries, such as manufacturing. This is a way of “bringing the new economy back to the old economy”, says Shah.</p>
<p>Linking new innovations and bringing it into traditional institutions is always a challenge, and Standard Chartered has developed a way to experiment with the latest technologies in a way that is unencumbered by the legacy processes, systems – and thinking – of the traditional bank.</p>
<p>SC Ventures, as the innovation unit of Standard Chartered, is run independently from the main bank and this means that it can innovate more efficiently, explains Harald Eltvedt, SC Ventures’ incubation lead. It develops solutions on its own and has also collaborated with corporate clients.</p>
<p>In a sense, SC Ventures is able to prototype some elements of what the transaction bank of the future might look like. Eltvedt comments that at SC Ventures they are experimenting with business models – sometimes by themselves, sometimes with partners – and the main bank benefits because they are able to innovate in a more agile way.</p>
<p>As it innovates, Standard Chartered has an eye on the potential future needs of its clients in both the physical and the virtual worlds: “We see ourselves as the bank of the metaverse,” he says. He explains that the bank is preparing itself so that it can be relevant in this future. Although no one knows what the metaverse will actually look like, SC Ventures has six principles – or high conviction themes – to guide it through its innovation. These are focused on being a digital bank; e-commerce; supporting SMEs; digital assets and tokenisation services; capability as a service; and sustainability and inclusion.</p>
<p>Eltvedt comments that the digital bank is about providing a digital banking platform – that enables others to plug in via APIs – that can support the “online, mobile-first, instant-gratification world that we’re now in”.</p>
<p>With the online commerce and payment solutions, Eltvedt says, “It might seem late in the game, but it is really needed. We actually saw during the pandemic the migration to online commerce accelerated – particularly in emerging markets where there was a transition to online banking and online payments at a much greater pace than other economies,” says Eltvedt.</p>
<p>One successful venture to come out of SC Ventures is Zodia Custody, which provides custody for crypto assets and enables institutional investors to securely invest in this new asset class. And on the trade side, SC Ventures invested in Linklogis, a Chinese supply chain finance technology company, which launched an initial public offering (IPO) in January 2020. They also formed a joint venture to create Olea, a digital trade finance origination and distribution platform. Eltvedt explains this platform puts suppliers, who are mostly in China and Southeast Asia, in touch with institutional investors anywhere in the world. “Blockchain can track the securities that are being created and where the investment is going,” he says. “It tracks everything in a visible and authenticated way, and creates more transparency between suppliers and potential investors.”</p>
<p>And when it comes to capability-as-a-service, SC Ventures has developed Standard Chartered nexus, a white label solution that allows other organisations – including corporates – to use its infrastructure. “We have an institution that has been around for a long time – there are certain things we know how to do well,” he says. Through open banking, and a ‘plug and play’ model, “We provide our capabilities to other players so they can manage their own system, their own lifecycle and they do not have to do the governance and all the security themselves,” he says.</p>
<p>SC Ventures is currently testing a use case for this in Indonesia, Eltvedt explains. When asked what kind of company would want to use Standard Chartered’s software-as-a-service in this way, he says that it could be a company that wants to transition to online commerce and manage the transactions itself and run its own loyalty programmes, for example.</p>
<p>With such a hotbed of innovation on its doorstep, treasurers in Singapore have a wealth of options to explore and apply, as well as the opportunity to explore what the treasury of the future will look like. And, if they are lucky, they might also have a nice view of the ships from their window.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>China’s dependency on coal came into sharp focus during the energy crunch of 2021, when the nation scrambled to meet demand ahead of the winter heating season. Energy was rationed and keeping households warm was prioritised over industrial production, and the knock-on effects of this could linger well into 2022. Although the worst of the crisis has now eased, questions remain about China’s shift to a carbon neutral economy and what role coal will play in its future.</p>
<p>“Unexpected” is one way to describe the energy crisis that gripped China in the latter half of 2021. That’s the word that Shan Guo, a partner at Plenum – a China-focused research firm – says is top of mind when characterising the situation. Although some thought that an energy crunch could be the outcome of China’s climate goals and decarbonisation, no one expected anything quite like this. And with China’s economy being so large, and interconnected with the global economy, any shocks that are felt on the mainland have ramifications far beyond its borders. Some industries in particular are expected to struggle in the coming months, and the lingering effects of the crunch could translate into higher prices for various goods and services.</p>
<p>A coal shortage is commonly cited as the main reason for the energy crisis. Or, in a simple explanation about the coal by S&amp;P Global Ratings, it was a case of, “A lot more demand, and a little less supply.” This increase in demand came as the first signs of recovery from the global pandemic arrived. Guo at Plenum explains that China’s energy demand grew rapidly in 2021 as the country emerged from the global pandemic ahead of the rest of the world. Industrial production ramped up and other countries shifted their orders to China. This surge in demand added to the need for power.</p>
<p>Dr Guo Yu, Lead Analyst, Asia Pacific at advisory firm Sibylline, says that the demand for energy was very high, and this also came in the context of soaring prices around the world. Commodity prices have been driven by the post-pandemic surge in demand when factories were left with many orders to fulfil. And when China needs additional power, it is mostly coming from coal. In fact, Dr Yu estimates that approximately 70% of China’s electricity is generated from coal.</p>
<p>At the same time of this increasing demand, there was also a shortage of coal. There are various reasons for this, such as the government’s move to shut illegal coal mines, and those that did not meet safety standards, for example. Elsewhere in China, mines had to close for other reasons. In north China, in Shanxi Province, flooding affected the coal mines there in October 2021, further adding to the slower production and shortage of coal. This drop in supply has been estimated by S&amp;P Global Ratings as being a decrease of 5% in June 2021, year on year, and 3.3% in July 2021 for the same month the year before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China had reduced its reliance on coal imports, in part to meet its targets of reducing carbon emissions. Also, a political spat with Australia meant that it was no longer importing from the antipodean nation from November 2021. This was reportedly in response to Australia’s move to support an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigate China’s early response to the outbreak. In 2021, from the start of the year to the end of August, S&amp;P Global Ratings estimates that coal imports had decreased by 10%, on a year-on-year basis. At the same time as the decrease in coal imports, there was also an increase in coal-fired electricity production. S&amp;P estimates that for the same period, also year-on-year, electricity production was up by 12.6% because of the increase in industrial demand as the world emerged from the pandemic and the orders got passed onto China’s factories.</p>
<p>China has publicly committed to reducing its dependency on coal and has stated it will reach carbon neutrality by 2060, with its carbon emissions peaking by 2030. However, although the country is transitioning away from coal, the alternatives cannot be relied on – a situation that was exposed during the energy crunch. Dr Yu at Sibylline points out that even though China is transitioning to cleaner energy sources like gas, the “underlying reliance on coal is not going to be overcome in the short term,” he says.</p>
<p>Guo at Plenum comments that the lack of coal also coincided with the under-performance of the renewable energy sector. She says that although there has been significant investment in the renewables sector, it is still volatile, and there has not been much hydrogen available, for example. In October 2021, a report by researchers at S&amp;P Global Ratings noted that China’s hydropower had a historically low water intake in 2021, and it was unable to meet the shortfall that was caused by a lack of coal. Also, wind power wasn’t a viable alternative during the crunch as wind is seasonal and there is not as much during the autumn. “There was one problem coming after the other,” says Plenum’s Guo of the situation.</p>
<p>Dr Yu at Sibylline describes multiple factors coming together to create a perfect storm that resulted in China’s energy crunch. And now, he says, “It is an evolving situation with factors beyond our control.” Like the weather: if the winter is particularly cold it will exacerbate the already high demand on the country’s power. “There is still a lot of uncertainty,” he comments (speaking to Treasury Today Asia in December 2021). However, the situation is not as bad as it was back in September 2021, he adds.</p>
<p>The energy crunch was exacerbated when many power producers – in the face of rising coal costs and a cap on the unit price of electricity – found that it wasn’t worth their while to produce electricity. S&amp;P Global Ratings notes that the coal-fired power generators had less incentive to operate amid the surging coal prices, and their fuel costs had increased by more than 50% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period the year before. This added to the electricity shortage, which led to rationing and planned blackouts, and there were reports of lengthy power cuts in Shanghai, for example.</p>
<p>The state intervened and took a number of steps to resolve the crisis. For example, it relaxed the rules on the unit price of electricity – giving producers the incentive to operate again. It also reversed its stance on importing coal and sought more orders. It also encouraged the production of coal by increasing mining capacity in Inner Mongolia and other regions. Bloomberg, for example, reported that more than 70 mines were ordered to ramp up production in Inner Mongolia. S&amp;P notes that the authorities were encouraging power producers to sign long-term contracts with suppliers ahead of the winter season.</p>
<p>The government had intervened following a public outcry because the crisis had reached their homes and affected their daily lives and there were serious concerns that many households would be without heating for the winter if swift action wasn’t taken. Guo at Plenum estimates that when the heating season begins, 30% more coal than normal is needed, and meeting this demand was a concern when the coal inventory was at a historical low.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The government’s intervention, however, was effective and the coal supply was increased – thus relieving the problem. “They have enough inventory for the winter, so the problem is over for now,” says Guo. She adds that the turbulence has largely been resolved, and adds, “I do not think the crisis is an issue anymore.”</p>
<p>The situation has improved and the actions by the state seem to have the desired effects, says Aiqun Yu, China Researcher at Global Energy Monitor. “With the government’s strong intervention, rushing to allow dozens of coal mines to enter operation, encouraging existing coal mines to reach their maximum capacity, firmly shut down some of the energy intensive facilities, China’s energy crisis since the second quarter of 2021 caused by a coal supply shortage has been largely mitigated.”</p>
<p>Yu continues: “Coal prices dropped significantly, though are still on the high end. The threat of the potential power cut and the winter heating cut have been relieved,” she says. However, this comes at a high environmental and economic price, she adds. “Coal consumption in 2021 will break the peak and reach a new record in the country’s history. It’s in the opposite direction of its carbon neutrality pledge,” she comments.</p>
<p>There could be some lingering effects of the crisis if the winter is colder than expected and energy demand increases further. The heating season, which typically runs from mid-November through to mid-March in the coldest parts of the country, will be affected by the weather. “If it is a particularly cold winter season the shortfall for supply could be exacerbated. There is still a bit of uncertainty – that’s for sure,” says Dr Yu at Sibylline.</p>
<p>The Chinese government intervened and took action to ensure that people’s homes would be heated through the winter. By prioritising the residential consumption of power over industrial production, certain sectors were particularly impacted – especially high-energy industries.</p>
<p>Sibylline’s Dr Yu notes that high-energy industries such as steel-making and glass-making cannot operate at full capacity. And it is still possible that local governments can impose energy restrictions on factories. There have been some reports, he notes, of the electronics sector being affected by energy rationing. “It really depends on the location, the local authority, and the balance of supply and demand,” says Dr Yu. The factories can be ordered to shut down at quite short notice, he adds.</p>
<p>One high-energy sector that is likely to be impacted harshly is aluminium, notes S&amp;P Global Ratings, and aluminium makers are expected to go through a “difficult time”. The aluminium sector is heavily dependent on coal and electricity, and its energy costs comprise a significant chunk – approximately 30-40% – of its overall production costs. With energy being limited, and its costs rising, high-energy industries like this are expected to be squeezed in the months ahead. Other sectors, however, will fare better. S&amp;P Global Ratings notes that cement will be less impacted as the power shortages and price increases will have less of an effect on the overall production costs of cement. Also, S&amp;P notes, the cement industry has made changes in recent years and has become more efficient and more adaptable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, industries that are less energy intensive will suffer less. For example, Guo at Plenum comments, light industries – such as textiles – are unlikely to be as seriously impacted. The costs won’t be as high for them as for steel, or aluminium makers, for example, as they require less energy in their production process.</p>
<p>The consumer sector is also less likely to be impacted, and S&amp;P expects consumer companies to be able to withstand power shortages. Where energy is rationed, it is likely that the smaller manufacturers that will suffer a greater impact as larger companies tend to get priority with the power that is available, notes S&amp;P. With energy costs accounting for a small part of the overall production costs, consumer companies are less likely to face long-term disruption.</p>
<p>Some sectors have been dramatically affected by the energy crunch. For example, the solar panel industry was reported to be particularly impacted by rising costs of its materials. This was put down to the energy rationing that was put in place to meet emissions targets, and also the shortage of coal. This meant that the production of silicon metal – a key component of solar panels – dramatically decreased. And so demand – and prices – soared. Bloomberg, for example, in October 2021 estimated that there was a 300% increase in the price of silicon metal.</p>
<p>Such an example shows the disruption that an energy crunch can cause, and its wider impact on the production chain of various industries. As China eases out of the energy crisis and recovers – after it ramped up coal production – there have been questions raised about China’s plans for a carbon neutral economy and how much it will continue to rely on coal in the future.</p>
<p>These disruptions and energy crunches could be seen as part of a wider structural shift to cleaner energies. However, the coal shortage – and the scrambling to boost inventory ahead of winter – meant the government had to prioritise the heating homes over its loftier climate goals.</p>
<p>In terms of China’s climate goals and net zero target, S&amp;P Global Ratings notes, “We see some wavering, at least this year [2021]”. With this kind of disruption, it shows how “economically challenging” decarbonisation can be. S&amp;P expects that the power outages will likely have a negative impact on China’s economy. “This is creating debate within China about the need to balance growth with climate goals. For example, the government’s decision to increase coal production in response to shortages reveal a degree of reticence about its carbon targets when they impede the economy and threaten social stability.”</p>
<p>In terms of the impact, Yu at Global Energy Monitor says, “The short-term coal supply shortage may be further relieved next spring, between the Chinese New Year and the end of the heating season. How the impact will be felt depends on how the government and the market interpret the crisis. So far, it seems the central government doesn’t relax the energy intensity restrictions in order to carry out its promise of the carbon emission peak in 2030. The industries which heavily rely on coal are facing increased pressure to upgrade to other energy sources or being phased out,” she says.</p>
<p>While the focus has been on a coal shortage, the energy crunch has pointed to the complex issues that China is facing. “On the surface, it’s the coal shortage that caused the crisis,” says Yu at Global Energy Monitor. However, she adds, the country’s heavy reliance on coal, and a lack of non-fossil fuel alternatives, is the deeper cause. “China should expand its energy transition to renewables on a larger scale and at a faster pace to prevent an energy crisis like this one from happening again,” says Yu.</p>


","Although the worst of China’s energy crisis is over, uncertainty remains and some sectors will continue to be impacted. Also, questions remain about China’s dependency on coal and whether it is on target to reach the climate goal of being net zero by 2060.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2022-01-02-tta-01-ia__solar-photovoltaic-panel-power-station-on-1934480714__1920x1080.jpg,2022-01-01,Asia Pacific,False

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic started to unfold, New Zealand took quick and decisive action while many countries seemed to dither. And now the country leads the pack in another way – this time by raising interest rates – as the world emerges from the pandemic and tackles the prospect of inflation.</p>
<p>The forecasts for New Zealand’s economy from earlier this year were positive. According to May 2021 figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), growth was expected to reach 3.5% in 2021 and 3.8% in 2022. During the pandemic, the OECD notes that private consumption had been robust. Also, the economy was buoyed by a wealth effect that was created by a 24% increase in house prices between March 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>Since then, inflation has been picking up, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has taken action. It had loosened its policy back in March 2020 and cut the official cash rate to 0.25%. In early October, the central bank announced that it was tightening again – to rein in inflation – and raised the official rate 25 basis points to 0.5%. It was the first time for New Zealand to raise rates in over seven years. It was also one of the first countries to start raising rates post-pandemic, which has put it out of step with many other countries, points out Will Thomson, Corporate Treasurer at Contact Energy.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether RBNZ’s action will have the desired effect. Inflation is expected to increase, and according to Trading Economics, is expected to peak above 4% in the near term, before slowing to 2% in the medium term. There are a number of factors driving the increase in prices, including rising oil prices and transport costs. These figures are in line with business expectations. In a central bank survey from August 2021 businesses expected that inflation would be around 3% in one year’s time, which is the highest figure for one-year expectations since December 2010.</p>
<p>New Zealand seems to have moved quicker than most when it comes to tackling inflation, and the same could be said for its handling of lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic. In March 2020, New Zealand was quick to close its borders and the whole country went into self-isolation. While the country avoided the death rates seen elsewhere, it has since been slower to come out of its lockdowns. The country has since changed tack and has moved away from its ambitious of eliminating COVID and having zero cases. “This is a change in approach we were always going to make over time. Our Delta outbreak has accelerated this transition. Vaccines will support it,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in early October this year.</p>
<p>Like in other countries, the pandemic and the lockdowns have forced people to go digital. And treasurers in New Zealand have been affected by similar issues to their peers elsewhere. Thomson at Contact Energy comments that while COVID has affected all roles, there are specific ways it has affected treasury management. One of these is e-signatures and getting banks to adjust to the new, digital, way of doing things. There are still laggards, however, among the banks in New Zealand that still insist on ‘wet’ signatures and paper documents. “Certain banks need the original signed copies – you have to physically post them,” says Thomson.</p>
<p>In the last couple of months there have been more discussions about moving away from physical signatures, comments Thomson. It is still an issue because even when working from home isn’t mandatory many companies are moving to hybrid working. If certain documents, for example, need multiple signatures this can create a headache if all of those people are working at home. Thomson gives the example of anti-money laundering requirements, which require certified copies of passports, that are incredibly inconvenient in a working-from-home world. This is how a routine part of the treasurer’s role can become very tedious and more complex, comments Thomson.</p>
<p>Richard Eaddy, Chief Executive Officer of Hedgebook, a New Zealand treasury software company, has also seen how the adoption of new technology has been a big issue. “There are a lot of legacy and outdated systems being used but the transition is still relatively slow. On the one hand we are seeing companies embrace the new technology that is available to make their jobs more efficient but there are still a number that aren’t changing due to intransigence or lack of budget on the back of the impact of COVID,” says Eaddy.</p>
<p>He has also noticed the challenges of remote working for treasurers in New Zealand. “One of the key changes we have seen from this is a move away from relying on spreadsheets to better use of software solutions that are more robust with information being able to be shared more easily. I am aware of some companies that have banned the use of spreadsheets as they try and move to more robust systems,” Eaddy says.</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source"">Richard Eaddy, Chief Executive Officer, Hedgebook</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In solving these issues, he says that the wider adoption of technology is an obvious answer. “Most companies are more open to using cloud solutions, whether that is their accounting system, cash forecasting tool or treasury management system. By adopting better and newer technology it then allows for easier sharing of information within this new environment,” says Eaddy.</p>
<p>Brett Johanson, a treasury management specialist and Partner at PwC in New Zealand, has also seen how technology and digital innovation – as well as cybersecurity – have become big issues for the treasury community.</p>
<p>One topic, in particular, is the use of APIs [application programming interfaces] and using them to streamline the use of different software packages. Eaddy comments, “Previously there has been a lot of talk around the use of APIs but we are seeing some of our clients asking to develop to our API so that they can import or export information more easily. We are seeing this happening with other systems as well as companies embrace technology and digitalisation.”</p>
<p>There have been other issues that the pandemic has also brought into focus for treasurers, many of which are similar to the challenges in other countries. Eaddy comments that the main impact for treasurers in New Zealand has been the sharper focus on cashflow forecasting. “Pre-COVID there was more certainty over supply chains, supplier payments and export markets remaining open. With all the issues attached to these new conditions, cash once again has become king. This has also brought a shorter-term focus as it has become more difficult to forecast out too far,” Eaddy tells Treasury Today. One effect of this is that there has been more focus on foreign exchange hedging. “Companies found some of their long-term hedges were not required and therefore these deals needed to be closed out or restructured. This has led to a shorter-term hedging focus for the moment,” explains Eaddy.</p>
<p>Johanson at PwC has also seen that COVID-19 and lockdowns in New Zealand have had an impact on cash and liquidity management, as well as working capital management. Also, he notes there have been increased committed stand-by facilities, with tenors lengthened. He also comments on the other challenges that treasurers face at the moment, which include the need for treasurers to have timely and reliable forecasts from their business units. Also increased costs and uncertainty are an issue due to supply chain disruptions and closed borders.</p>
<p>Despite the upheaval of the last year, the Herbert Smith Freehills Corporate Debt and Treasury Report 2021 notes that most treasurers who were surveyed reported that they had managed liquidity successfully through the pandemic. This, in part, was due to the measures that were put in place in the wake of the global financial crisis. PwC notes that this is also a trend among treasurers in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Also, according to PwC, there have been differences in how companies in the UK and New Zealand responded to government schemes. In the UK, many corporates registered for government schemes that would help their cash flow, but the majority – 70% – did not use them because they feared it would affect the perception of how well-managed they were when they sought funding in the future. “This strongly contrasts with businesses in New Zealand, where 77% reported having accessed COVID-19 related financial support from the Government in 2020,” the PwC June 2021 treasury newsletter stated.</p>
<p>Johanson at PwC also notes that other issues for treasurers include seeking alternative debt funding sources – such as non-bank lenders and credit funds – and their access to debt capital markets. This is an issue that Simon Till, Director Capital Markets at Fonterra, raised in a previous interview with Treasury Today. Given the size of a corporate like Fonterra, relative to the size of the New Zealand economy, it is crucial it can effectively raise funds in the global markets in all conditions. Also, corporates that rely on overseas funding need to build good relationships with investors around the world.</p>
<p>This is challenging in the best of times since New Zealand is so geographically isolated from the major financial centres. But in a pandemic, when treasurers can’t fly, it has disrupted the nature of the relationships with the investor community. Thomson explains that in the US private placement market, for example, “They like you to go and show your face,” which has not been possible in recent times. Although there have been alternatives like virtual roadshows, it has made maintaining those relationships more challenging.</p>
<p>Another hot topic in treasury in New Zealand, notes Thomson, is sustainable finance. “It feels like it has moved to the mainstream quickly – it was a bit niche, but now there is an explosion in expectation from investors,” says Thomson.</p>
<p>“We are quite well positioned for that,” says Thomson of Contact Energy, which has already gone green and converted its borrowing to sustainability-linked loans, for example. In a sense it has been easier for a company like Contact Energy to do this because sustainability already aligns strongly with what the company does. Thomson notes the energy company is already building a renewable energy power station, for example.</p>
<p>This focus on sustainability also echoes the comments of Fonterra’s Till in a previous interview for Treasury Today. In the past, he commented, it was only in Europe where investors would ask about the environmental impact of the corporate’s business. Now, he comments, it is the first question that investors ask in all meetings around the world. “Investors are increasingly demanding around sustainability and with that will come real change by the businesses,” Till said.</p>

<p>Singapore is a city state located at the Southern tip of the Malaysian Peninsula. It is made up of Singapore Island and then around 60 small islands of which the main island takes up all space excluding 18 square miles. Singapore is the largest port in South East Asia and one of the world’s busiest. Once a British colony and now a member of the Commonwealth, in 1963 Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia and then seceded to become an independent state in August 1965. Nearly two thirds of the main island is less than 50 feet above sea level. A dense network of short streams drains the island, but floods can be severe because the streams have low gradients and because of excessive water runoff from cleared land. Characterised by uniformly hot and humid weather all year round, Singapore’s focus on sustainability from an economic, social and environmental perspective has clean impetus.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>As sustainability becomes another marker of strength and resilience for countries across the world, it is interesting to look at how, in recent years, Singapore has also become a pioneer in sustainability and has made concerted efforts to associate itself with best green practice. The city state adopted a variety of long-term goals and decade spanning plans which would balance sustainability with its ongoing priority of economic growth.</p>
<p>Sustainability encompasses many different focal points, from climate change prevention to social issues and economic stability. We spoke with Seng Ti Goh of Focal Partners and Chair of the Association of Corporate Treasurers in Singapore, who explained Singapore’s particular commitment to sustainability, “Since the independence of Singapore in 1965, our Government led by the late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew made a conscious decision to make Singapore a clean and green city. In 2019, our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong devoted his national day rally speech to why Singapore should be preparing for climate change especially with global warming and the resultant rising sea levels that pose a real threat to low lying Singapore. He expounded the expedient need for Singapore to find sustainable solutions and that it might cost Singapore S$100bn to prepare ourselves against rising sea levels.”</p>
<p>Certainly Singapore’s unique positioning both in terms of geography, population and regional ambition create a particularly powerful case for sustainability. We spoke with Melissa Moi, Head of Asia Pacific Environment Social Governance at Bank of America, who expanded on Singapore’s somewhat unique positioning, “Part of understanding Singapore’s relationship to sustainability is context and understanding how the country is positioned. Singapore is a city state, it’s a relatively prosperous city state. It also has relatively high exposure to sustainability-related risks. So, if you look specifically at climate risk, we don’t have a source of naturally fresh water. Singapore is very exposed to climate change and to issues around sea level change. On top of that, Singapore is also impacted by the effect of climate change on the other countries in the region – both environmental and social. What is most interesting about Singapore is, number one, I think we’ve seen the country and its government and its corporate citizens as well, take a very strong position in terms of building up the resources and the resilience needed to battle and deal with climate change.”</p>
<p>Moi also expanded on the complexities of the reclaimed land in Singapore. The reclamation of land (https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/hp331-2014-10/?page_id=7) from surrounding waters was employed in Singapore to expand the city state’s limited natural land. The process involves rocks, soil or sand being added to water to create land. Moi explained, “They’re always really taking into account, what are the projections for sea level rise? And can we build on reclaimed land a metre higher than it needs to be? There are barrages that have been put in place to divert water. There are rainwater and wastewater systems diversions all through the city and they’ve really invested in terms of the infrastructure around dealing with some of the physical changes, which I think is really great to see.”</p>
<p>When it comes to government policy says Moi, “In the Singaporean government’s most recent budget, they’re really focusing on things like food security. Also ensuring that 30% of the country’s nutritional needs are locally and sustainably accessible by 2030. Looking at public transit, there have been various licences required, for example, to own a car. There has been a really big push to encourage individuals to move from personal car ownership to taking advantage of public transit. Then they are focused on transitioning the public transit so it could be in cleaner energy, public buses, even the cars and taxis needing to have clean energy models, electric vehicle charging points. And finally, real estate, implementing guidelines around energy efficiency, green buildings and benchmarks for energy efficiency, really promoting solar energy.”</p>
<p>As Seng Ti Goh also explained, “More recently in 2020, the Government announced the Singapore Green Plan 2030 that involves multi-ministries and agencies with five pillars: 1) City in Nature, 2) Energy Reset, 3) Sustainable Living, 4) Green Economy and 5) Resilient Future. The shift is profound and there is a strong impetus from the leadership and amongst the business and social communities. Singapore aims to be a leading centre for Green Finance in Asia.”</p>
<h4 id=""leading-by-exmple"">Leading by example</h4>
<p>Moi explains how Bank of America are playing a part in this mission, “From a financial institution’s perspective, we are trying to drive change around sustainable finance. There’s been a lot of work by the regulator here, the stock exchange here, the government here, to really establish Singapore and position itself as a leader in encouraging sustainable finance. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has come out with a taxonomy that is so specific, much like the EU taxonomy, language and specific categorisation of what can be considered green and sustainable from a sustainable finance perspective. This is to try to put guardrails and guidelines from a market development perspective. Also looking at establishing a sort of an environmental governance framework, whereby ensuring that the financial institutions that are based in Singapore and operating in Singapore have environmental and social risk integration across their governance. MAS is also a member of the steering committee of The Network for Greening the Financial System. Singapore also has sustainable or ESG-labelled bond incentives. It’s a really big push, from a governance, from a monetary authority, regulator and central bank perspective, that I think is trying to really develop, not just in Singapore, but also to encourage a lot of the South East Asian countries that are around us to look at making this a priority.”</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Singapore have a rivalry that is well established and in the case of sustainability can serve for the good of everyone as it spurs on both places to do better on sustainability. This is now becoming another tick and another mark of distinction. Moi explained, “Hong Kong is also in the similar position of establishing itself as a sustainable finance centre within Asia. This healthy competition is a good thing because it means that you drive for better standards, you implement more forward-thinking policies.”</p>
<p>Seng Ti Goh concurred, “The MAS has announced its Green Finance Action plan to 1) Strengthen Financial Sector Resilience, 2) Develop Markets and Solutions, 3) Harness technology, 4) Build Knowledge and Capabilities. We have seen the increased awareness and activities in the markets and eco-system with regard to Green Financing.” In addition, when it comes to influencing operations, or standards from an environmental perspective, of companies with headquarters that are operating out of those countries and some of the more active central banks and regulators. Moi mentioned the progress she has seen coming out of Malaysia and Thailand and in The Philippines around growing sustainable finance and the role that regulators and financial institutions play in financing transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
<p>Investors in Asia, are asking questions about ESG plans of corporations they work with and the sophistication of the questions is increasing, such as; ‘How are you going to do it?’ ‘Are you going to do it by 2050?,’ ‘What is your plan for 2030?’ ‘How is this tied to your business goals?’ ‘How is this tied to your projections?’ ‘How is your leadership?’ ‘How is it integrated into your governance?’ ‘What are you measuring, what are you reporting?’ The ecosystem requires investors, it requires the corporates, it requires that regulators and governments, that they all have a piece to play in this puzzle of really driving sustainability forward.”</p>
<h4 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h4>
<p>When Treasury Today Group began it’s research into sustainability with first steps towards our Global Sustainability Study in 2019 there were distinct regional variations, with Europe leading the way and North America and APAC some way behind, in terms of corporate awareness. As Moi said, the pace of change in Asia can really be quite rapid, “In Asia, things can happen quickly and rapid changes can occur, so there is the opportunity to leapfrog. What took years of development in the EU could happen within a much shorter span of time in Asia.” The pandemic has only served to highlight some of the real arguments for sustainability, as it has exacerbated issues particularly around things like income inequality. Then we have the stark reality that the pandemic is a harbinger of what happens when we don’t tackle the climate crisis.</p>
<p>As we look ahead to the future of Singapore post-pandemic we will continue to see Singapore trying to position itself as a leader in the space. Moi mentions, “One of the interesting stories is that of the plant-based meat alternative market and the community around things like vertical farming here in Singapore; hydroponics. So, as well as sustainability and self-sufficiency in the country, there’s also going to be a push in terms of investments and understanding.”</p>
<p>Treasury Today Group remains committed to covering all aspects of sustainability and this summer we will release the results of our <a href=""https://treasurytoday.com/supplements"">2021 Global Sustainability Study</a> where we will be able to assess the impact of the pandemic as well as assess the results on a regional basis. We are particularly keen to see how the pioneering example of Singapore impacts the sustainability journey corporations and governments alike, certainly the speed of awareness and dialogue has been quite remarkable over the past two years. As Seng Ti Goh concluded, “It is certainly an exciting sustainability journey ahead in Singapore!”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>After a difficult 2020, Hong Kong is hoping for better fortunes in the lunar year of the Ox. Like the animal – determined and dependable – Hong Kong’s financial services industry, and its role as an international financial centre, continue to hold strong and show resilience in the face of a number of challenges.</p>
<p>The city state has experienced crises before – the global financial crisis (GFC), the SARS pandemic, the Asian financial crisis – but in 2020 it experienced its greatest economic contraction in more than 60 years. In a research note, Chen Jianghui, an economist at Bank of China (Hong Kong) predicted that Hong Kong’s contraction for 2020 will be in the region of -6%, far greater than the -2.5% of the GFC, and also the -5.9% from the Asian crisis of 1997. “Looking into 2021, risks and opportunities coexist,” Chen states, adding that the outlook for the year ahead is more positive, with GDP growth expected to be up to 5%.</p>
<p>Like many markets, Hong Kong’s service economy came to a standstill in the wake of the pandemic. However, despite the hit to restaurants, shops, and the tourism sector, for example, the financial markets have been less affected. In fact, Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre has remained strong, despite the challenges of the pandemic and the protests.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) agrees: “Despite the challenges posed by social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic in the past year or so, Hong Kong’s monetary and financial system, as well as our role as an international financial centre, remained intact.”</p>
<p>For example, throughout the disruption, the linked exchange rate system, which pegs the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar within a tight range – continue to work well, and the exchange rate remained stable. Also, according to the regulator, there have not been any significant outflows from the Hong Kong dollar or the banking system. “On the contrary, we have seen more than US$50bn of inflows into the Hong Kong dollar since April,” the HKMA spokesperson tells Treasury Today Asia, adding that bank deposits grew 5.4% in 2020.</p>
<p>And despite the uncertainty and speculation that surrounded the suspension of Ant Group’s initial public offering (IPO) in November 2020, (which was planned as a joint offering with Beijing), Hong Kong’s status as an IPO venue does not seem to have been negatively impacted. In fact, the capital markets have remained strong. “Hong Kong remains one of the top IPO centres in the world,” the HKMA spokesperson says, adding that in 2020 around HK$400bn was raised through IPOs, a 27% increase on the previous year.</p>
<p>Herbert Poenisch, a former senior economist at the Bank for International Settlements and Academic Committee Member at China’s Zhejiang University, comments how from the outset Hong Kong has defined its role as a financial intermediary between international investors and Chinese investors and borrowers – a role that shows no signs of abating. “Most important international financial intermediaries are based in Hong Kong and have not expressed their intention to leave,” he tells Treasury Today Asia. The city state continues to have a number of advantages over mainland China, such as its financial infrastructure conforming to international standards. Chinese financial infrastructure, Poenisch notes, differs from international best practice. He gives the example of China not joining Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), which would reduce settlement risk. “While this continues, together with capital controls and lack of transparency, there will be a solid role for Hong Kong,” he notes.</p>
<p>Poenisch also points out the role Hong Kong plays with US dollar services, with Chinese entities, banks, enterprises, and high net worth individuals continuing to centre their US dollar business in Hong Kong. “The deep and liquid USD market in Hong Kong, together with real time gross settlement in USD, and the USD peg, guarantee USD funding and liquidity. During the USD shortage in early 2020, USD funding in Hong Kong proceeded smoothly. This was particularly important for Chinese banks, which fund their USD lending in offshore centres, first and foremost in Hong Kong.”</p>
<p>Also, Poenisch notes, banks resident in Hong Kong – notably Chinese banks – continue their international lending from Hong Kong rather than the mainland. He cites Q320 figures from the Bank for International Settlements that show cross-border claims from Hong Kong were US$1.66trn, compared with US$1.33trn from China and US$0.82trn from Singapore.</p>
<p>For the near future, it appears Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre will remain unrivalled. “There are a number of runners-up to replace Hong Kong in financial intermediation, but none of them with the solid infrastructure and legal tradition, as well as wealth of experience as Hong Kong,” says Poenisch. He considers the alternative financial centres: “Shanghai, with its international financial district, as well as Shenzhen as the residence of financial innovation, but also Hangzhou, with the head office of Ant (Group), are worthy candidates. However, their development is subjected to central control and guidance by the Communist Partyh of China (CPC),” he says.</p>
<p>Domestically, the financial services sector is a key contributor to Hong Kong’s economy. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry has remained stable in recent months. Hong Kong’s financial services industry has been resilient, and consultancy EY conducted a study to determine how domestic banks were perceived by the general public in Hong Kong. They wanted to test whether the industry’s resilience was correlated with trust. They found that the sector could do better, in the mind of the public, with the ‘trust driver’ of ‘integrity’ – by providing more transparent information on transactions, and with ‘purpose’ – by demonstrating how it is having a positive impact on society.</p>
<p>Gary Hwa, EY’s Asia-Pacific Financial Services Regional Managing Partner, comments, “While trust in financial services in Hong Kong remains strong, local banks are facing headwinds from increased credit risk in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this environment, both financial inclusion and sustainability must remain key focus areas for the sector if they are to maintain these positive levels of consumer sentiment,” he tells Treasury Today Asia. “With wealth disparity continuing to widen, financial inclusion is more important than ever before and should form an integral part of the sector’s overall recovery efforts. Likewise, Hong Kong financial institutions can take a leading role when it comes to sustainability, to help ensure environmental recovery goes hand in hand with economic recovery.”</p>
<p>Financial institutions have also been taking a leading role in their services to multinational corporations (MNCs), and the transaction banks in Hong Kong have developed expertise in setting up regional treasury centres for them. This role was called into question, however, when Reuters reported in June 2020, citing anonymous sources, that some MNCs were considering moving their treasury operations out of Hong Kong, in the wake of the protests. It referred to one US retailer that was considering moving some of its cash management operations to Singapore, although this could not be verified.</p>
<p>The HKMA, however, maintains that Hong Kong is still an attractive location for corporate treasury centres. An HKMA spokesperson told Treasury Today Asia that “the COVID-19 pandemic has somewhat slowed the pace of multinational corporations (MNCs) setting up corporate treasury centres in the past year,” and the HKMA continues to receive enquiries from corporates, as well as requests from banks and industry associations to host webinars about setting up corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. “In fact, there has been a surge of such requests in recent months, and the industry is expecting the momentum to return once the pandemic subsides,” the HKMA spokesperson said. The factors that attract corporates – the large talent pool, the favourable regulatory and tax environment, and connectivity with the region – remain unchanged.</p>
<p>It’s not just the HKMA that remains positive about Hong Kong’s strengths as an international financial centre; transaction bankers are also bullish about the future of the city state. Vishal Kapoor, Treasury and Trade Solutions Head, Hong Kong, Citi, points to the bank’s long history in Hong Kong, which stretches back to 1902, and says, “We are confident in Hong Kong’s future as a leading financial centre and our clients remain our priority. Our Treasury and Trade Solutions business continues to grow in Hong Kong where we continue to gain market share and are actively engaged in partnering with our clients as they further digitise their business. We also continue to lead the supply chain business in Hong Kong and across the region. Supply chain-backed trade assets in Hong Kong grew double-digits in 2020 despite a slowdown in trade in the region, reflecting strong growth in our trade business.”</p>

<p>As well as continuing with its reputation as a centre for the trade of physical goods, Hong Kong has been building its reputation as an offshore renminbi (RMB) centre. According to SWIFT’s RMB Tracker from December 2020, Hong Kong was the top offshore RMB economy. The city state took the lion’s share of offshore RMB flows, with 74.9% of volume being processed through its RMB clearing centre. This was followed by the UK with a mere 6.14%, then Singapore with 4.21%.</p>
<p>Poenisch comments that uncertainty prevails in the RMB offshore market. He explains the official policy of internationalisation of RMB has put the emphasis on RMB use for trade and investment settlement for bilateral trade and investment between China and its partners. “What is missing is a euro RMB market, ie RMB outside China’s jurisdiction used between non-Chinese,” he comments. He makes the comparison of the development of the US dollar as an international currency and explains how the development of the Eurodollar market from 1970 boosted its international role. This enabled non-US to invoice, settle and issue securities denominated in US dollars as well as hold investments in Eurodollar accounts and instruments. “After initial concerns about the possible inflationary effect of the euro USD market, US authorities have adopted a benign approach to this USD market beyond their jurisdiction and control,” Poenisch says.</p>
<p>Whether a euro RMB market will one day be developed remains to be seen. For now, however, there are a number of developments in Hong Kong that bode well for its immediate future. For example, there is the Greater Bay Area initiative, an economic plan that aims to connect Hong Kong with Macau and nine cities in Guangdong province – one of the most affluent regions in China. In June 2020, the authorities announced Wealth Management Connect, another move that would bolster Hong Kong’s standing as a financial centre, as it enables investors to buy wealth management products across the Greater Bay Area.</p>
<p>This, as well as other reasons – such as the city state’s flourishing fintech sector – are reasons to be optimistic for Hong Kong’s recovery after a difficult 2020. And like the Ox, Hong Kong’s standing as an international financial centre continues to be resilient and dependable.</p>

<p>Economists had to work harder than usual in 2020, with their forecasts needing to be revised and new updates released. In South-East Asia, as fresh information rolled in about restrictions easing, tourism resuming and a vaccine rolling out, economists have continued to debate whether the recovery in 2021 will follow a L, U, V or swoosh shape. Given the diversity of the region, the prospects of individual countries are mixed, but overall there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Vishrut Rana, an economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, expects a gradual recovery for South-East Asia in 2021 along with a gradual normalisation of consumer spending and business activity. However, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) region is still some way from normalisation: “We expect that ASEAN’s economic output will reach pre-Covid levels only by the third quarter of 2021,” Rana tells Treasury Today Asia.</p>
<p>In December 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) revised its forecasts from September and South-East Asia’s figures had a larger contraction than originally predicted: the estimate for 2020’s growth was revised down to -4.4% from -3.8%. The forecast for 2021 was also downgraded, with the region now expected to grow 5.2%. The ADB noted that South-East Asia remains under pressure as COVID-19 outbreaks continue, particularly in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>There is hope on the horizon, however, since the first vaccination took place in the UK in December 2020. Ricky Kaura, Head of Transaction Banking, Asia Pacific, Africa and Middle East at Standard Chartered, comments that news of the vaccine has added to the optimism for the year ahead. “The downside growth risk is now lessened,” he says. “One of the key challenges will continue to be pandemic management, as a widespread application of vaccines will take time,” he adds.</p>
<p>ASEAN’s recovery will hinge on the ability of individual countries to contain the virus, says Debopama Sen, Head of Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions, Singapore and ASEAN. “In the near term, the spread of the virus remains a concern,” she says. “In the area of trade, recovery in ASEAN will likely be uneven as the different countries are managing different challenges corresponding to how the pandemic is impacting their home markets and export demand,” she adds.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also highlighted the differences in the underlying economies in South-East Asia, with some countries being more open than others, and more dependent on trade and international travel. In the case of Indonesia, for example, its large domestic economy of approximately 270 million is less reliant on the external market, compared to Thailand, which is a major tourism destination. Thiam Hee Ng, Principal Economist of the South-East Asia Regional Department at the ADB, says Thailand received substantial support from its government — more so than Indonesia or the Philippines — because it had greater resources available. This, however, was not enough to stave off an economic contraction because the country is so dependent on tourism.</p>
<p>The Philippines, like Thailand, has also suffered because of the dramatic drop in international visitors because of COVID-19-related travel restrictions. The economy in the Philippines, however, does not rely on tourism to the same degree as Thailand. Instead, the country relies heavily on remittances from its overseas workers sending money home. Many of them have been on the frontline in fighting the pandemic — the nurse giving the world’s first COVID-19 vaccination in the UK was from the Philippines,— but many others, such as those working on cruise ships, for example, have had to return home, says Ng. This has yet to be reflected in the remittance figures, however, as inflows to the Philippines would have received a boost as those workers would have wired home their entire savings before heading home, Ng points out.</p>

<p>Malaysia likewise has been affected by the drop in tourists, but its economy is more diversified. As a major exporter of rubber, it has fared the pandemic well. “There has been huge demand for rubber gloves,” says Ng. “Next year should pick up for Malaysia and we expect Malaysia to have the strongest growth next year,” he adds.</p>
<p>And of the countries in the region, Vietnam is the bright spot. “Vietnam handled Covid the best,” says Ng, adding that unlike other economies, it actually experienced growth and not a contraction. The country has a large manufacturing industry and “Vietnam was able to keep producing because it had contained Covid,” explains Ng. “Next year Vietnam will continue to grow and expand,” he adds.</p>
<p>Sen at Citi agrees: “Vietnam has been the shining star in ASEAN with its effective coronavirus containment, which has helped prop up the domestic economy.” She adds how, prior to the pandemic, Vietnam already had a lot going for it: it is pro-business, has a liberal investment environment and benefits from multiple free trade agreements. “Even before the pandemic, a number of multinational firms had relocated parts of their supply chains to Vietnam as part of their diversification strategies,” she says, adding that she expects this trend to accelerate.</p>
<p>Rana at S&amp;P Global Ratings is also positive about the outlook for Vietnam, “Vietnam stands out as a potential outperformer in 2021. The economy is benefitting from a strong performance from its electronics sector, which will continue to support growth next year.” Like Ng, he also is positive about Malaysia’s prospects for the year ahead. He adds, “Malaysia is another economy that could see a brisk recovery, as the economy has weathered the deep downturn so far. However, the ongoing escalation of the pandemic is weighing on economic prospects for the first quarter of 2021.”</p>
<p>The business sentiment of executives on the ground in South-East Asia broadly mirrors the economists’ projections. McKinsey conducted a mass survey of thousands of executives every six weeks from June 2020 asking them when they expected the economy to return to pre-COVID-19 levels (ie Q4 2019) in the country where they are based. The survey results, which were released in October 2020, mapped out nine scenarios of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. These scenarios considered the degree to which the virus had spread, and the effectiveness of the public health response as well as economic interventions. The executives in ASEAN mostly opted for the scenario McKinsey dubbed ‘A1’. Of the ASEAN executives polled, 40% chose this A1 scenario, which expected to see a localised recurrence of the virus, with an effective public health response, and a partially effective economic response. In the A1 scenario, growth would accelerate in the second half of 2021 and would return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. The figure of 40% of ASEAN executives choosing this option is roughly in line with business sentiment elsewhere: 36% of global executives also chose the same scenario as the most likely path for their economy.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the effects of the pandemic, there are other features of the region that give executives on the ground reason to be optimistic. Vijay Shankar, Head of Transaction Banking, ASEAN and India at ANZ, says that Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand in particular are bright spots in South-East Asia. They have all effectively contained the virus, he says, and they also show promise because companies have diversified their supply chains to these markets, and also set up treasury centres there.</p>
<p>This is a trend that Kaura at Standard Chartered also sees. “We see many of our clients focused on establishing regional centres to manage treasury transformation as well as centralised supply chain management.” Kaura adds that many companies are also entering ASEAN markets because of their favourable demographics — a demographic dividend of a relatively young population that provides both a workforce and a large consumer market.</p>


<blockquote><p>We expect that ASEAN’s economic output will reach pre-Covid levels only by the third quarter of 2021.</p>

<p>Of the sectors that are expected to do well in 2021, Rana at S&amp;P Global Ratings notes that both financial services and technology have favourable outlooks. “The technology sector has performed well through the downturn. Demand for technology and electronics products, such as cloud services and consumer electronics, has remained resilient and has benefited from increased remote work globally. We expect technology demand to remain steady over the next year,” Rana says.</p>
<p>Shankar at ANZ says, “We are already seeing that the COVID-19 situation has given digital services industries like e-commerce, e-wallets, gaming and entertainment, semi-conductor-based electronic industries, pharma and auto ancillary a large boost, and expect the growth to continue post-pandemic.”</p>
<p>The internet economy is another bright spot for ASEAN, says Citi’s Sen. “From food delivery, education, healthcare, remote work, entertainment, shopping to banking, technology has been the backbone keeping our society functional during times of lockdowns and quarantines.” Since the beginning of this year, 40 million people in South-East Asia have connected to the internet for the first time. This is compared to a year ago at ten million. And of those new digital consumers, nine out of ten plan to keep using at least one digital service beyond the pandemic. “Suffice to say, a silver lining that has emerged in 2020 and beyond is the acceleration of digital adoption, both by consumers and businesses,” Sen says.</p>
<p>Of the industries that have the brightest prospects, Kaura says: “We would see consumption-based industries continuing to benefit, including fintech, e-commerce, healthcare, insurance and technology likely being stronger growth industries in 2021. Countries that have the existing base for these industries will see their businesses growing, not just in their countries but also the opportunity for the expansion to other less-ready jurisdictions.” Kaura adds, “We anticipate emerging ASEAN advancing as a manufacturing hub, potentially attracting new investments in labour-intensive manufacturing.”</p>
<p>Another positive development for the region, which the transaction bankers point to as another bright spot, is the development of real-time payments which are set to underpin further innovations in the region. “Today most of the major ASEAN markets have advanced real-time payments schemes with added features to enable digital commerce, and others are not far behind,” says Sen at Citi. She estimates that by 2025 digital payments will account for almost one in every two dollars spent in the region. This has come about because the governments across ASEAN have committed to digitising their economies, which in turn has created opportunities that will help drive economic recovery, she says.</p>
<p>Shankar at ANZ also notes the important development of the acceleration of real-time payments implementation across the region. “A number of countries including Myanmar, Thailand, Philippines are positioned to push the digital agenda and shape how we do business going forward,” he says.</p>
<p>Many are looking ahead to a post-COVID-19 environment, where the building blocks of a digital economy are developed so that South-East Asia can thrive. For now, however, the region is very much focused on managing the pandemic. “Overall, 2021 is projected to be a bounce-back year for ASEAN. However, recovery is likely to be uneven, and will hinge on the ability of countries in ASEAN and beyond, to contain the virus,” says Sen at Citi.</p>

<p>For companies around the world, implementing a regional treasury centre can bring many benefits, from supporting business growth to making sure the company has treasury experts in a specific region.</p>
<p>“The key principle behind companies’ decision to set up a regional treasury centre is to centralise treasury functions across regions,” says Aziz Parvez, head of Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Sales, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America (BofA). He adds: “When working across diverse markets, it is important for treasurers to have visibility across their operations, it creates efficiency and enables treasurers to make informed decisions regarding the business.”</p>
<p>As such, Parvez says that MNCs tend to consider the following key factors when setting up an RTC:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The company’s business model/scale, as well as the set-up of legal entities in the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to move from a decentralised to a centralised set-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The enhancement of governance and control in operating subsidiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision to centralise liquidity and funding for subsidiaries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to setting up an RTC in Asia specifically, there are some additional points to consider. Francois-Dominique Doll, Executive Director, Global Treasury Advisory Services, Deloitte Southeast Asia, points out that Asia is the fastest growing economic region and largest continental economy by GDP nominal in the world. As such, he says, there are a number of reasons why MNCs from other regions see value in setting up an RTC in Asia.</p>
<p>One is the need to put in place a centralised treasury function and take advantage of the resulting efficiencies. “There are 48 countries in Asia with a variety of different cultures, languages, currencies and government systems,” says Doll. “Because of this diversity, having a regional treasury centre in Asia will create a financial structure to concentrate cash, manage risk exposure centrally and hedge different currencies with a standardised process.” He also notes that a regional treasury centre can play a role in managing working capital more effectively, as well as optimising liquidity by providing clear regional visibility.</p>
<p>In addition, Doll says that having a centralised treasury function in the region can increase the company’s competitiveness, given the economic fragmentation of markets as well as differences in supply and demand profiles across the region. “Any required action could be executed on a timely basis without worrying about time zones,” he adds.</p>
<p>And as a further benefit, Doll points out that consolidating the treasury function at a regional level can considerably reduce the number of bank accounts and transaction fees. “To establish a payment factory or on-behalf-of (OBO) structure would be a leap forward for the regional treasury centre, because not only does it reduce transaction costs, it also reduces the overall processing time,” he explains.</p>
<h4 id=""locations-of-choice"">Locations of choice</h4>
<p>Given the disparate nature of Asia’s markets, different locations will have different features and incentives in place that may recommend them to companies as a potential treasury centre location. Singapore and Hong Kong tend to be seen as the most popular choices, but companies may also wish to consider a number of other options depending on their requirements and their geographical footprints.</p>
<p>Deepali Pendse, head of South East Asia Corporate Treasury Sales, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America, says that MNCs have so far favoured Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai, adding that in recent months there has been mounting interest in moving RTCs to Singapore, “given the shift in supply chains to Southeast Asia.”</p>
<p>However, she also notes that in the last five years, a few other locations have emerged, such as Thailand and Malaysia – not least because geopolitics is increasingly being taken into consideration as a factor. In addition, Pendse says Shanghai is being considered as a serious contender “due to the status of China as an important market, and also because a number of MNCs have significantly large operations in China.”</p>
<p>The advantages of these locations are explored in more detail below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Singapore</strong>. The location of choice for many, Singapore’s attractions include its Finance and Treasury Centre (FTC) incentive, which aims to encourage companies to grow their treasury management capabilities and use Singapore as a base for conducting treasury management activities for the region, according to the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).</p><br/>
<p>Under the scheme, approved FTC companies are eligible for a reduced corporate tax rate of 8% on income from qualifying services. Approved FTC companies are also eligible for withholding tax exemptions on interest rate payments. In order to be eligible for the incentive, companies “must establish substantive activities in Singapore and perform strategic functions,” with key activities including managing interest rate, foreign exchange, liquidity and credit risks, as well as control over the management of the cash and liquidity position.</p><br/>
<p>“Robust governance and transparency of the system allow MNCs to better navigate requirements and operate in a regulated and stable environment,” comments Aziz, adding that Singapore also has access to mature financial markets, advanced technology infrastructure, and a deep treasury and operation talent pool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hong Kong</strong>. As Doll notes, Hong Kong “serves as a good gateway to both China and the international market.” Indeed, with its proximity to mainland China, and its status as a Special Administration Region (SAR), Hong Kong has much to recommend it as a regional treasury centre location.</p><br/>
<p>Like Singapore, Hong Kong also offers particular tax incentives for companies seeking to set up treasury centres. In June 2016, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) set up a Corporate Treasury Centre (CTC) scheme. The headline benefits include a 50% deduction on the taxation of profits for particular treasury activities, resulting in a tax rate of 8.25%. In addition, CTCs may be able to deduct interest expenses related to intragroup financing under some conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shanghai</strong>. China – and particularly Shanghai – is also a location of choice for a number of corporations. “With the aim of the Chinese government to transform Shanghai into a global financial hub, regulations have been eased to make it easier for companies to manage their treasury activities in Shanghai, especially in the Free Trade Zone (FTZ),” says Doll. “It is recommended for companies, especially MNCs that have huge investments or have a big part of their sales generated in China, to set up a regional treasury centre in Shanghai.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thailand</strong>. According to Aziz, Thailand’s new incentives for locally incorporated companies makes the country worthy of consideration. In particular, he notes that initiatives such as the Bank of Thailand’s International Headquarter (IHQ)Initiative and Treasury Centre (TC) Initiative have made the reporting of cross-border funds flow and FX much easier for corporates with RTCs in Thailand. “However, the treasury landscape in Thailand is still evolving, and there exist gaps such as access to international financial markets, transparency on governance structures and the ease of doing business,” he notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Malaysia</strong>. Malaysia is another location that companies may look at when seeking a regional treasury centre location. Aziz cites the country’s Treasury Management Centre (TMC) initiative, which provides tax incentives on qualifying treasury activities/service income, as well as providing stamp duty exemptions for loan and service agreements. “A company has to be incorporated in Malaysia and meet a set of criteria to be eligible for the scheme,” he comments. “It should also be able to provide qualifying treasury activities, including cash, financing, debt management, investment and financial risk management services.” But as Aziz also points out, there are still gaps which may erode the competitiveness of the TMC incentives, “such as a less mature financial environment, smaller talent pool and political instability.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is no hard and fast rule about which location any particular type of company will opt for, companies in certain industries and from certain regions may gravitate towards a particular treasury centre location, as Irene Zeng, Head of Sales, Global Banking Corporates, North Asia, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Asia-Pacific at HSBC, explains.</p>
<p>For one thing, Zeng says that Hong Kong is a popular choice for retail businesses, the real estate industry and predominantly Chinese corporates, due to factors including the HKMA tax incentive programme. She also cites the market’s large consumer base, open and established offshore RMB market and easy access to talent “with cultural and language fluency to facilitate the ease of doing business in China.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Zeng says that since the introduction of the CTC scheme, “we see a good number of Chinese corporates moving their RTC/international treasury centre to Hong Kong.” Nevertheless, she says that companies with sizeable operations in China continue to favour China (mainly Shanghai).</p>
<p>Singapore, meanwhile, may be an attractive choice for many western multinational corporates with substantial operations in Southeast Asia. “It offers the FTC with preferential tax concessions; flexible rules in relation to thin capitalisation, and easy access to an educated workforce, mature financial markets, liberal FX regulations, a stable political environment and a friendly living environment for expatriates,” says Zeng. “We also observe some US and European MNCs moving their RTCs to Shanghai, backed by the fact that their China operations represent a majority or very significant share in their Asia business – hence the necessity to concentrate the resource.”</p>
<h4 id=""two-treasury-centres"">Two treasury centres?</h4>
<p>Some companies may opt for more than one treasury centre in the region. For example, Zeng says that some organisations choose to run centres in both Hong Kong and Singapore: “one focused on activities in relation to the mainland China market and/or CNH, and the other focused on ASEAN countries and currencies.” She says that in such cases, both centres can be run under a common infrastructure, with support from relationship banks, in a “very efficient and automated way.”</p>
<h4 id=""choosing-the-right-location"">Choosing the right location</h4>
<p>While there may be no ‘wrong’ choice when considering locations such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, it’s important to make sure the company opts for the location that best suits its specific needs.</p>
<p>“Any business decision will need to be taken in the context of the corporate itself, such as the nature of the business, key markets of operation, the quality of the workforce required, etc,” says Zeng. “For instance, the petrochemical industry is very active in China, given that most of the end users are based there – hence it makes sense for many MNCs to restructure their operations and move the RTC to Shanghai in order to get closer to their operation sites and consumers.”</p>
<p>“An RTC is the brain and nerve centre of a company’s business operation,” explains BofA’s Pendse. “Located in the right location, key decision makers within the company are able to gain visibility and control over their operations, ensuring critical decisions are made on a timely basis.” She says this is “absolutely important” given the fast-paced and complex environment that many MNCs are operating in, adding that the organisation’s goals and operations requirements are among the most important factors when selecting an RTC location. “Usually, the incentives provided by local markets are secondary,” she adds.</p>
<h4 id=""avoiding-the-pitfalls"">Avoiding the pitfalls</h4>
<p>As such, Pendse says a possible pitfall when choosing a location is to opt for one location which has very little in common with the footprint of the organisation’s business landscape. “The suitable location has to provide the right ingredients like an adaptive culture, ie least resistance to change/innovation, the right talent pool to be able to improve the scalability of treasury functions and access to financial markets which is a backbone of the RTC,” she says. “MNCs have to keep in mind that the journey towards centralisation and standardisation by establishing RTCs is not just for organic growth, but also to tap into inorganic growth needs and opportunities that can leverage the structure of the established RTC.”</p>
<p>Deloitte’s Doll likewise notes that companies should avoid certain pitfalls. For example, a company might find that treasury talent is not available in a particular market, meaning that the organisation would be unable to recruit treasury resources and that the hired resources would lack the qualifications needed to manage day-to-day operations. “The company could potentially incur more cost from daily operations due to errors or delay in execution,” he notes.</p>
<p>Other considerations are that the shift from a decentralised to a centralised model requires “a clearly defined roadmap and design of a ‘to-be’ process flow,” he says. “Treasurers, with the support of senior management, need to communicate effectively and sell the ‘benefits’ to the various local finance units to ensure success”.</p>
<h4 id=""asking-the-right-questions"">Asking the right questions</h4>
<p>BofA’s Pendse says MNCs need to consider a number of different factors when selecting the right treasury centre location, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Ease of capital movement</strong> – access to deep and well-oiled financial markets, ie long-term capital (equity and debt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Law and governance</strong> – transparency of doing business and setting up businesses, as well as international reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IT infrastructure</strong> – connectivity to the technology infrastructure providers and innovation hubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talent pool</strong> – the existence and availability of a highly skilled, well-educated international and mobile workforce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax regulations</strong> – local tax structure and the impact it would have on business and capital inflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government incentives</strong> – ease of applying the incentives related to finance and treasury-related activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She adds that an “important litmus test” is the existence of other successfully-run RTCs in the location under consideration, as this will provide confidence about the country’s ability and readiness for attracting new businesses. She also notes that a solid country credit rating “further provides an indication of the ability and willingness of a location’s government to fulfil their financial commitments in full and on time.”</p>
<p>As well as citing the importance of long-term incentives which may help MNCs achieve cost savings when setting up the treasury centre, Deloitte’s Doll also notes the importance of political stability, which “could ensure smooth treasury operation without incurring much cost from the business continuity plan.”</p>
<p>Last but not least, he also emphasises that stringent and clear regulations are important when it comes to setting up the regional treasury centre, which will usually take on the role of payment factory, in-house bank, netting centre or reinvoicing centre. “Treasurers would like to ensure the chosen location has regulations that would allow for all these key functions to take place,” he concludes.</p>

<p><em>Multinational companies continue to take advantage of opportunities in China. But there are many factors that treasurers need to be aware of when operating in this market. From seizing the opportunities brought by regulatory change to harnessing new technologies and digitalisation, what are the top developments and trends currently affecting corporate treasury?</em></p>
<p>As the world’s second largest economy by GDP – and the world’s largest by purchasing power parity – China has long been a major focus for companies operating across APAC.</p>
<p>It’s also something of a moving target. China’s double-digit GDP growth at the beginning of the decade may have slowed considerably in recent years, dropping to a 28-year low of 6.6% in 2018. Nevertheless, domestic consumption is a powerful driver of growth. A 2019 report by McKinsey, China and the world, points out that while China’s exposure to the world has fallen in terms of “trade, technology, and capital”, the world’s exposure to China has increased – reflecting “the rebalancing of the Chinese economy towards domestic consumption.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other initiatives currently under way are helping to drive growth – such as China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The initiative, which was first launched in 2013, spans over 130 countries, with the World Bank estimating investment in BRI to be worth US$575bn. BRI projects include rails, roads, bridges and ports as well as energy projects and free trade zones. Alongside these major developments, another notable initiative is Made in China 2025, a ten-year plan launched in 2015 that aims to promote manufacturing and develop high-tech industries.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, China continues to present attractive opportunities for multinational corporations. But while these opportunities are considerable, companies also need to be aware of the challenges they may encounter in this market. As a white paper published by executive search and recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson in 2018, the challenge for multinationals in China, notes: “All MNCs have to do to crack this giant market is adapt to a completely foreign culture, understand a plethora of different but connected consumer groups, and move at breakneck speed to keep up with technological developments and changing demand. Easier said than done.”</p>

<h4 id=""chinas-treasury-landscape"">China’s treasury landscape</h4>
<p>Where treasury is concerned, there are a number of considerations to be aware of, from China’s complex and rapidly evolving regulatory climate to the opportunities brought by digitalisation. While not exhaustive, the following are five challenges, trends and opportunities that treasurers should be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Regulatory change</h5><br/>
<p>For treasurers in China, the country’s complex regulatory climate is one notable consideration. “It’s no secret that China’s complex regulatory environment has posed challenges for MNCs,” says Rani Gu, Head of Treasury Services, China at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>Gu says that interpretations of regulatory rules can vary between different cities and provinces of China. As a result, treasury activities may be governed differently across different cities under the same rule. According to Gu, this could prove challenging for MNCs looking to centralise their treasury operations across China. “At J.P. Morgan, we take a proactive approach by staying close to regulators on the ground to help clarify as necessary and in turn communicate with clients to help them navigate accordingly,” she comments.</p>
<p>But regulatory developments can bring opportunities as well as challenges – and Gu says that continued efforts by the Chinese government to open up financial markets and push for renminbi internationalisation “are all positive developments for corporate treasurers.” A case in point is a change in regulations by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) earlier this year, making it easier for foreign companies to set up cross-border liquidity and payment structures. “This means treasurers can now set up cross-border sweeping arrangements and POBO/COBO as well as other netting schemes,” says Gu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Navigating trade tensions</h5><br/>
<p>Aside from regulatory considerations, the last year has brought numerous headlines focusing on trade tensions between the US and China. To date, the US has imposed tariffs on US$250bn of Chinese goods, while China has imposed tariffs on US$110bn of goods from the US. Despite ongoing talks, President Trump indicated in August that a further round of tariffs was forthcoming, with a 10% tariff proposed on a further US$300bn of Chinese goods, including smartphones and clothing – although a subsequent announcement indicated that these tariffs would come into effect from mid-December.</p>
<p>Companies have begun to feel the supply chain impact of these developments, which could lead to some shifts in terms of trade corridors. A recent poll by Baker McKenzie found that 93% of Chinese companies were considering making changes to their production and supply chains in light of trade tariffs, with 18% carrying out a complete transformation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Gu says the bank has not seen a material impact on clients in China as a result of trade tensions. She says that while some clients have expressed concerns about the situation, they are also aware that China represents one of the largest opportunities for businesses globally. “Most are staying cautiously optimistic and we will continue to support them fully as their banking partner,” she adds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Treasury 4.0</h5><br/>
<p>Meanwhile, companies in China are taking advantage of opportunities to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their treasury operations. “We believe the trends in corporate treasury evolution in China correlate with those on a global level,” says Patrick Zhu, Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management for HSBC in China. “This is known as Treasury 4.0.”</p>
<p>According to Zhu, Industry 4.0 “combines the skills of humans and intelligent machines to drive innovation and deliver process efficiencies, data-driven insights, and new growth opportunities across all sectors, including financial services.” He adds that this is particularly applicable to China, where the market is at the forefront of global technology advancement – “providing a vibrant test ground for corporates to explore new technologies, new strategic partnerships and even new ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Zhu adds that the global interest environment is another driver behind treasury transformation, noting that this is driving both cost controls and efficiency gains – a trend that he says is also becoming more prevalent in China. “A solid reflection of this is the fact that treasury centralisation, among numerous routes to achieve the efficiency goal, prevails,” adds Zhu. He explains that the execution of treasury centralisation can employ a wide range of means, from well-known models such as shared service centres (SSCs) and regional treasury centres (RTCs) to robotic process automation (RPA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Digitalisation and e-commerce</h5><br/>
<p>Likewise, technology continues to be a major driver for treasurers around the world – and China is no exception. Gu cites the increasing need for treasurers to digitalise their operations to adapt in the shift towards e-commerce – a trend that she says applies not just to pure play e-commerce companies, “but also traditional brick and mortar firms like automakers looking to migrate their commerce activities online.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the growth of e-commerce continues apace. A report by McKinsey, Global payments 2018: A dynamic industry continues to break new ground, noted that global digital commerce volume exceeded US$3trn in 2017, with this figure set to more than double by 2022. The report notes that Asia Pacific already comprises over half of the US$3trn – “and, due to the fast-growing Chinese market, will increase its share to nearly 70% by 2022.”</p>
<p>“In this context, helping our clients in their digitalisation journey remains our key focus here in China,” says Gu. She notes that many corporates in the country still rely on spreadsheets, or have standalone treasury functions that lack the capacity to handle the speed and volume of online transactions across a multitude of payment methods.</p>
<p>“At J.P. Morgan, we invest heavily in innovation to this end; a good example is the E-Customs Payment Solution we recently launched in China, which was developed as a direct result of specific needs of our clients,” says Gu. “The solution is a first by a foreign bank in China that allows corporates to fully digitise and automate cross-border payment of goods, solving common problems associated with the manual nature of such transactions.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Embracing emerging technology</h5><br/>
<p>On a related note, treasurers also need to consider the role played by emerging technologies. Zhu notes that China “is at the forefront of global technology advancement, providing a vibrant test ground for corporates to explore new technologies, new strategic partnerships and even new ecosystems.” He adds that this is also evidenced by “booming digital platforms and payment tools in China and their penetration into the economy, as well as the application and impact of other new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and robotics.” Consequently, he says, “corporate treasury management is expected to evolve.”</p>
<p>Indeed, new technologies have the potential to increase the efficiency of treasury processes in the future. “For example, with the sheer amount of data being created in payments today, solutions leveraging machine learning will likely become common treasury tools in the near future as treasurers look to interpret the data to identify inconsistencies in their processes or strategise through predictive analytics to optimise liquidity and mitigate risks,” says Gu. “Likewise, for robotics which is used to automate treasury processes, or application programming interface (API) which is becoming widely used for greater connectivity.”</p>
<p>The opportunities presented by some of these technologies are reviewed in PwC’s 2019 Global Treasury Benchmarking Survey, Digital Treasury – It takes two to tango. The survey found that 19% of respondents see RPA as ‘highly relevant’ for treasury in the next two to three years, with a further 45% judging the technology to be relevant or somewhat relevant.</p>
<p>Where the application of RPA is concerned, the survey saw payment execution as the top candidate, followed by deal confirmation, accounting and monitoring of payments. Meanwhile, the areas of treasury in which AI is seen as most relevant included exposure forecasting/analysis, monitoring of payments, payment execution, and liquidity management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h4>
<p>While China certainly has its challenges – both from a treasury perspective and in light of ongoing trade tensions – treasurers in the country have much to be excited about, from harnessing the potential offered by RPA and AI to taking advantage of favourable regulatory changes.</p>
<p>As Zhu concludes, “The challenges to treasurers in the current market are obvious. How corporate treasury management adapts to the changes and evolution trends, implements and leads the transformation through strategic partnerships with wider scope of services providers will define its success.”</p>


<h3 id=""understanding-business-culture-in-china"">Understanding business culture in China</h3>
<p>Business culture can vary considerably between countries and regions, affecting everything from communication styles to decision making processes. For any company operating in overseas markets, it’s therefore important to understand the nuances of local business culture. A clear understanding can lead to productive relationships – but equally, cultural misalignment can sometimes hinder the effectiveness of those relationships.</p>
<p>As Benny Koh, Southeast Asia Leader for Deloitte Global Treasury Advisory Services, explains: “Business culture is one of those funny things where one realises something is wrong and it’s usually too late – ie a transaction is called off, senior external relationships are soured, complaints are raised by employees or a poor performance appraisal is given by the CFO.”</p>
<p>For overseas treasurers operating in China, a clear understanding of the country’s business culture is therefore essential. “If you really want to create a strong, robust and long-term business relationship with China, then it’s absolutely critical that you understand the culture,” says Neil Payne of Commisceo Global Consultancy. “By learning about the culture, you learn to behave in certain ways and carry out certain actions that all help you become part of the local business fabric.”</p>
<p>For example, Payne says that one significant consideration when doing business in China is the concept of ‘face’. “As a foreigner you need to learn the rules around protecting people’s face as well as enhancing it,” Payne says. “Once you work out how to give face, you soon see a huge difference in how you are treated.”</p>
<p>Another feature of Chinese business culture is the concept of Guanxi – in other words, the ability of an individual to harness their personal connections.</p>
<h4 id=""what-do-treasurers-need-to-know"">What do treasurers need to know?</h4>
<p>Where treasury is concerned, Koh highlights a couple of cultural factors that treasurers should be aware of. “One is internal – team dynamics and management,” he explains, noting the importance of understanding “how one’s staff perceive authority and where the treasurer may be expected to lead/give explicit instructions vs adopting a more ‘laissez-faire’ or consensus-building approach like in the West.” He adds that deliberate consensus building “may be taken for indecisiveness and weakness.”</p>
<p>In addition, Koh says that externally the treasurer may be seen as the key decision maker and buyer of banking services. “In cases where he or she is not the ‘boss’, ie the CFO is actually the real decision maker on most treasury matters, it is better to be clear upfront with external parties to avoid commercial, and sometimes social misunderstanding which may be awkward,” Koh says.</p>
<p>Local business culture may also have implications for the way in which intermediaries and subcontractors are viewed, notes David Blair, Managing Director of Singapore-based Acarate Consulting. He adds that where local banks are concerned, risk management tends to be “less data driven”, while regulation is typically written in a way that “allows directional changes when expedient.”</p>
<h4 id=""beyond-china"">Beyond China</h4>
<p>Of course, China is not alone in having a unique business culture. Koh notes that in Asia generally, “hierarchical levels and authority matching are important”, noting that this can determine how bankers perceive the authority of the treasurer. This, in turn, can determine “who the treasurer interfaces with and can get access to in a bank, for example.”</p>
<p>When it comes to successfully navigating business culture, Koh says it’s important to have an open mind while being able to adapt quickly. “To be successful when navigating in a different environment, one’s sense of self awareness and sensitivity to social cues are required and that’s not taught in school,” he concludes. “Perhaps it’s part experience and part humility that make it work.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For Ernesto Pittaluga, Corporate and Public Sector Sales &amp; Marketing Regional Head – Asia Pacific, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, geopolitical uncertainty is a key issue for firms across the region, as this impacts the enterprise value chain. He notes that trade tensions could lead to the redistribution or relocation of production to facilities based in ASEAN, with implications for companies’ banking structures, cash management needs, and funding requirements in these markets.</p>
<p>Likewise, Pittaluga says that actions such as rebalancing export markets, relocating production facilities, and/or substituting suppliers have implications for treasury cash flows and risks. Shifts in cash flow patterns may necessitate adjustments to cash pool structures and intercompany funding arrangements, entailing a detailed assessment of associated regulations and tax implications.</p>
<h4 id=""regulation"">Regulation</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, agility in navigating regulation is another area of focus for firms operating in Asia. A survey of CFOs and treasurers at Citi’s Treasury and Finance Conference in April 2019 established that regulatory and tax framework related changes are the number one theme impacting their finance and treasury key performance indicators (KPIs). APAC treasurers also need to manage a range of government-led initiatives, giving both opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p>“In India, for instance, there has been a continued impetus towards promoting digitisation post the demonetisation initiative in November 2016 including the introduction of government-sponsored interoperable apps like BHIM to promote use of UPI, the launch of BharatQR (a unified QR platform across cards and UPI) and subventions to acquiring banks for low value card and UPI transactions. In the latest budget released on July 5<sup>th</sup> 2019, the government has proposed no merchant discount rate (MDR) for companies with more than Rs 50cr (US$7MM) turnover<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> accepting payments through digital means,” Pittaluga notes. “In China, we have had new, progressive, cross-border liquidity management programmes proposed. They are all positive developments – but at the same time, firms do have to contend with very high levels of regulatory complexity.”</p>
<h4 id=""knowledge-as-an-enabler"">Knowledge as an enabler</h4>
<p>Pittaluga says it is “very important” for corporates to keep abreast of developments and try to anticipate their impact. “It’s about assessing new risks and opportunities,” he says. “Corporate clients expect support from us in that regard.”</p>
<p>As such, he says the bank proactively communicates key changes to clients and how these are relevant for their businesses. To facilitate client access to regulatory and market developments globally, Citi offers an external portal, the Knowledge Exchange Centre (KXC), that provides a single point of access to market intelligence from the bank’s experts across the globe. “KXC offers insights and analysis across several areas including regulation and geopolitics,” says Pittaluga.</p>
<p>To highlight how the portal works, Pittaluga points to the new cross-border pooling programme in both RMB and foreign currency announced by China’s SAFE in March. “Its analysis would typically be of very high interest for a client,” he says. “We prepared a concise deck that explained to treasurers what’s new with the programme, the differences with any other existing programme, and the opportunities it presents to our clients.”</p>
<p>Brexit provides another example of how Citi’s portal can help treasurers. “Brexit is an area where a corporate could see changes in the way they run their European operations,” says Pittaluga. “It raises questions for firms about cross-border payments in Europe and how they manage liquidity in the region. What part of the provisions of the EU is the UK going to live with going forward? What exceptions are or will be approved for the UK? All of this has very specific repercussions to the way corporates manage their businesses in Europe – and the KXC represents a useful window into updated information on this and many other current subjects.”</p>
<p>He adds: “If you are a treasurer or CFO, how do you manage geopolitical risks or regulatory change? A big part of the answer is by researching what the banks have to say about a particular development, and discovering the opportunities and issues that emerge from it. Citi is well placed to play that advisory role because we are operating in all these markets across the region – we have a very detailed understanding of what’s going on.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""from-trade-tensions-to-growth-opportunities"">From trade tensions to growth opportunities</h4>
<p>Like Pittaluga, Sandip Patil, Asia Pacific Head of Liquidity Management Services and Financial Institutions Group for Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions, highlights geopolitics as one of the major causes of uncertainty for corporates across Asia.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about China and the US,” he says. “There is this important spread of change that we see across supply chains in Asia Pacific – from Australia, which has a huge commodity supply exposure, to China, all the way to North Asia, into ASEAN or South Asia and North America. The fallout of this has had an impact on the trade talks between China and the European Union, too. Treasurers will need to consider the impact of these changes on their treasury flows and intercompany arrangements.”</p>
<h4 id=""different-regulatory-landscape"">Different regulatory landscape</h4>
<p>As for the regulatory challenges and uncertainties for treasurers across Asia, Patil points out that there are more variations across the region than in any other geography. “The regulatory regime is different in each country,” he says. “It’s incredibly fragmented, right from rules governing clearing infrastructure, to banking infrastructure, to what is allowed in terms of foreign exchange and inter-company lending. Regulations across practically every space of concern to treasurers and CFOs are exposed to country to country variation.” Likewise, Patil notes that countries have different tax regimes: some countries charge transactional taxes, some charge border taxes, while income tax levels vary across the region. “That all amounts to a challenge for treasurers,” he says.</p>
<p>If such challenges weren’t enough for APAC treasurers, Patil points to variation in monetary policies. “They are very divergent,” he says. “You can have a situation where one country is taking a very expansive stance, pumping liquidity into markets. Another country, meanwhile, is trying to contract. You see inflation in one country but not in another; liberalising policies in one country while another is trying to increase taxes. From a client treasury perspective, that policy fragmentation creates some of the biggest uncertainties in managing businesses in the region.”</p>
<h4 id=""opportunities-for-growth"">Opportunities for growth</h4>
<p>Despite the headwinds, the region also has a positive story – one that makes navigating those hurdles worthwhile for corporates. Firstly, says Patil, due to a combination of factors, the quantum of growth Asia offers outstrips any other region. For one thing, Asia’s population represents approximately 60% of the world total, yet the median age is 30.7 years, compared to over 40 for most European countries<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>. There is also a deeply embedded savings culture, and discretionary spending on luxury goods is rising fast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, unencumbered by legacy infrastructure, Asia has taken a “technology-leap”, with mobile and new technologies proliferating, especially in big countries. “If you combine all those factors into one bucket, you get a very powerful, very compelling growth story, and that is the dilemma for our clients,” says Patil. “On one hand, you have growth and a very promising outlook to exploit; on the other hand, you have to deal with all the fragmented infrastructure and many sources of uncertainty. Managing the two together is the challenge that every treasurer and CFO deals with here in Asia.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-rise-of-digitisation"">The rise of digitisation</h4>
<p>In today’s 24/7 world, APAC firms are rethinking their business models and digitalising their infrastructure. In the past, investment was directed towards, for instance, ERP and manufacturing systems, but Patil now sees more broad-based digitisation of organisations – this is affecting companies’ client-facing systems and their financial and treasury systems.</p>
<p>“That is now the foundational infrastructure for the new world,” he says. “On top of that, different tech-led systems are being deployed by firms to help them take efficient decisions on liquidity, funding, foreign exchange, counterparty risk management and distribution. Each and every activity our clients have to deal with is now digitising, and that’s creating a powerful platform for them to optimise and manage their businesses efficiently.”</p>
<p>One key area that treasury teams are looking to improve through technology is cash flow forecasting. Having accurate, timely cash forecasts is essential to the management of firm-wide liquidity, funding and risks. “It is probably the biggest headache every treasurer faces, but new technology has the potential to help in ways that were not possible before,” says Patil. “Citi can help clients objectively benchmark their treasury function in terms of where they are at versus their peers. We can also offer practical suggestions in terms of the scope for digitisation and available tools to manage flows, liquidity and working capital efficiently.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""digital-revolution"">Digital revolution</h4>
<p>Morgan McKenney, Head of Core Cash Management for Asia Pacific, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, likewise emphasises the scale of the change brought by digital disruption. “The pace of digitalisation across all industries and societies is rapid and accelerating,” she says. “It’s a cultural and commercial phenomenon in every aspect, likely more so than for any other region.”</p>
<p>McKenney says the explosion in e-commerce across Asia is an accurate reflection of the fast-growing impact of digitalisation across the region. The Asian e-commerce market will be worth US$1.4trn<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> by 2020; 59% of e-commerce transactions are currently via mobile<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup>; and mobile wallet transaction volume is expected to total US$60trn over the next five years<sup id=""fnref:5""><a href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">5</a></sup>. Eighty percent of Asian millennial purchases are influenced by social media<sup id=""fnref:6""><a href=""#fn:6"" rel=""footnote"">6</a></sup>, while time spent on online shopping in Southeast Asia is twice that of US consumers<sup id=""fnref:7""><a href=""#fn:7"" rel=""footnote"">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>McKenney says digitalisation across Asia and the explosion in e-commerce means businesses are rapidly switching to direct-to-consumer models. At the same time, the payment landscape is becoming ever more digital. Even if there is a lot of cash in Asia, it is digitising at a much faster pace than anywhere outside the region, she notes, while banks, consumers, and merchants are increasingly shifting from batch to real-time.</p>
<p>Asia’s digital environment poses some key questions for treasurers, she says. “Firstly, what’s the impact of new business models on treasury? If your business is moving to sell direct to consumers, that means lots of new consumer payment capabilities, it means more real-time treasury management. Secondly, what opportunities are offered by innovation? And thirdly, how does treasury remain agile in this new landscape?”</p>
<p>McKenney points to Citi’s recent Treasury Digitisation survey, which reveals that amongst the over 70 treasury and finance respondents based in Asia Pacific, over half (56%) are exploring new digital technologies with a view to support the transformational change and development that is happening in their businesses, whereas a majority (64%) are doing so with a view to drive transformative development in their treasury function so as to enable them to assume a more strategic role within their enterprise over time.</p>
<h4 id=""leveraging-apis"">Leveraging APIs</h4>
<p>So, what are the new technologies that might impact treasuries in the near future? “APIs are here now, and their impact to treasury is expected to be felt over the next two years. At Citi we are investing heavily in them,” says McKenney. “They can help re-engineer workflows and provide real-time information.” She explains that clients can access their balances via API, with the information automatically populated into the treasury management system and constantly updated.</p>
<p>Results from Citi’s recent Treasury Digitisation survey reveal that over 55% of the respondents from APAC are currently exploring or pursuing API technology to obtain real-time visibility over their bank account balances. Treasurers are also exploring or pursuing APIs to facilitate payment status inquiries, initiate payments, and obtain credit notifications in real-time.</p>
<h4 id=""rpa-ml-and-ai"">RPA, ML and AI</h4>
<p>A lot of Citi clients are also focusing on robotic process automation (RPA), McKenney says. “It’s helping to automate manual repetitive processes, for example aggregation of bank statements and analysis of cash positions. Many manual tasks in the end-to-end payment process can be considered for RPA. We do see a lot of clients with keen interest in using RPA.”</p>
<p>As for a more tangible impact for corporates from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to augment decision-making and improve control, McKenney is eyeing a timeline of one or two years. The present emphasis for APAC treasurers exploring or pursuing ML and AI appears to be on cash management and forecasting. “Citi itself has really made its big data platform differentiated now in terms of quality of data,” she says. “It’s able to provide more intelligent recommendations, whether it’s for cash application/collections reconciliation or to improve controls over payments.”</p>
<p>The bank is applying sophisticated ML and AI technology in its Citi® Payment Outlier Detection service, an advanced data analytics tool that assesses all transactions that flow through its system against a client-specific behaviour profile. It triggers real-time alerts for transactions that do not conform to the routine patterns and behaviours of the specific organisation. The service also constantly updates the client-specific profile to better detect future erroneous payment and potentially fraudulent events.</p>
<h4 id=""blockchain"">Blockchain</h4>
<p>As for blockchain, McKenney regards it as more “bleeding edge than leading edge” and says it’s a technology that is very much for the longer term. She is, however, enthusiastic about its potential in, for example, digitising the documentation involved in payment processes or in trade. “One of the big potential benefits of blockchain besides being able to move an asset is that you can also be much more thoughtful about workflow organisation,” she says. “You can have different certifications by different parties along a workflow with common visibility of the status. That’s why blockchain is being looked at in trade finance, as an example.”</p>
<h4 id=""real-time-treasury"">Real-time treasury</h4>
<p>More broadly, McKenney expects that in three to four years, progress towards truly real-time, intelligent treasuries will be evident. “You’re going to have information that is available wherever you need it, whether it’s in TMS, merchant platforms or other systems,” she says. “There will be more flexible access and greater connectivity with banks for various information and transactional level initiations. There will also be smarter tools to manage cyber risk.”</p>
<p>While technology is destined to help define corporate operations in Asia, Citi’s global clients are clear with their operational priorities and how the bank can help them: “They want operational efficiency and balance sheet optimisation of all their treasury functions and capabilities. That’s always been the bread and butter in transaction banking and we’re very focused on helping treasurers do that.”</p>
<p>The other two are “super exciting objectives,” and relate to helping Citi’s clients grow and improve their own clients’ transactional and service experience. “It feels very rewarding to help our clients achieve sales efficiency,” comments McKenney. “Citi is helping them grow their business with our capabilities and plugging into all these new clearing houses and instant rails, paying into wallets, collecting from wallets. This, especially in Asia, will be a defining feature of business growth.”</p>
<p>McKenney adds that Citi supports a lot of digital and e-commerce clients, noting that creating a virtuous circle between them and their own clients is key to unlocking growth. “It is about making our services more flexible and embeddable to help make our clients’ clients’ experience frictionless and rewarding,” she concludes.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Catchy acronyms have long been used to indicate groupings of emerging markets. TICKs – incorporating Taiwan, India, China and South Korea – is one of the more recent. But what do the TICKs economies really have in common? And which other markets in the region may offer growth potential in the coming years?</em></p>
<p>The practice of using pithy acronyms to group together emerging economies with shared characteristics goes back many years. The term BRIC was coined in 2001 by Jim O’Neill, former Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs, and initially encompassed Brazil, Russia, India and China. While geographically and culturally disparate, the four countries included under the BRICs umbrella were deemed to have something important in common: their potential to grow rapidly and play an increasingly important role in the global economy in the coming years.</p>
<p>As well as indicating these nations’ common ground from an economics point of view, the acronym was enthusiastically adopted by fund managers – and it also led to a political alignment, with the first formal BRICs summit held in June 2009. The following year, the grouping was expanded to include South Africa, thereby turning BRICs into BRICS, although O’Neill himself argued that South Africa’s economy wasn’t large enough to warrant the inclusion. Nevertheless, cooperation between the BRICS continued and in 2014, the five states created the New Development Bank (formerly the BRICS Development Bank).</p>
<p>In the meantime, numerous other acronyms have been coined to describe other groupings of emerging markets, including the CIVETs (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt and Turkey), MIST (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey).</p>
<p>The appetite for further groupings continues, and in January 2016 the Financial Times published an article announcing ‘The Brics are dead. Long live the Ticks’. Incorporating Taiwan, India, China and South Africa, the TICKs grouping sets aside Brazil and Russia – both heavily reliant on commodity exports – in favour of technology-focused Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
<h4>Taiwan</h4>
<p><img alt=""Taiwan information"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2019-05-06-tta-05-rf__taiwan__967x375.png?la=en&amp;hash=40AADD063FA47D56B88B2790DD4247B0""/></p>
<p class=""source"">Source: CIA, Statista.com, Santander Trade Portal<em></em></p>
<h4 id=""capturing-growth"">Capturing growth</h4>
<p>While the acronym may not have captured the level of recognition achieved by BRICS, it nevertheless continues to fulfil a role in highlighting the relevant economies’ potential.</p>
<p>“Over the past decade, the acronym BRICS has received a lot of attention with economies like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa leading the growth in emerging markets,” says Varoon Mandhana, Senior Advisor, APAC Solutions, Treasury Services, J.P. Morgan. “With plummeting commodity prices and a slowdown in Brazil and Russia, TICKs economies came to the focus of many to capture the growth of high tech, entrepreneurial industries in emerging markets.”</p>
<p>Mandhana says that while BRICS and TICKs are just industry acronyms, “to some extent they capture business and investors’ sentiment towards underlying economic growth outlook of these economies.” He adds that in addition to Asia’s giants – China and India – “we also see significant opportunities in PIMs (Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia) where the demographics are getting better and potential growth is improving.”</p>

<h3>Chart 1: 2019 forecasted real GDP growth (%)</h3>
<p><img alt=""2019 forecasted real GDP growth (%)"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2019-05-06-tta-05-rf__2019-forecasted-real-gdp-growth__400x562.png?la=en&amp;hash=2A5BD8E5ACD2249F48E22FF4E90A19ED""/></p>
<p class=""source""><em>Source: J.P. Morgan Global Data Watch</em></p>

<p>Aziz Parvez, head of Asia Pacific Corporate Sales, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains that when the TICKs acronym was coined, the economies included “reflected the changes in global markets and in global demand shifting from trade in raw materials/commodities and energies to services, especially high technology ones.” He adds, “These changes are still relevant and we continue to see global investment channelling into high-tech industries and TICKs economies.”</p>
<p>According to Parvez, other macro-economic indicators also point to the relevance of these markets. “With a young population increasingly participating in e-commerce and online shopping, these economies are well placed to cater to this category of consumers,” he comments.</p>
<h4 id=""comparing-and-contrasting-the-ticks"">Comparing and contrasting the ticks</h4>
<p>Some have complained that the groupings invented in recent years are little more than a sales gimmick, and that the countries brought together are often at significantly different stages of development. Indeed, despite enthusiasm for the various groupings, some of the resulting acronym-focused funds have had a limited shelf life: HSBC Global Asset Management closed its CIVETS fund in 2013, and Goldman closed its BRIC fund in 2015. So do the TICKs really have much in common with each other, beyond their inclusion in an appealing acronym?</p>
<p>On one level, the four economies are fairly diverse: the populations of China and India dwarf those of their smaller cousins, for example. But Frederic Neumann, Co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, argues that Taiwan, India, China and South Korea “share as many features as divides them”. For one thing, he points out that both Taiwan and Korea are highly export dependent, with electronics playing a particularly prominent role. “That means their economies are exposed to the vagaries of the global trade and tech cycles,” he says.</p>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>Where technology is concerned, Parvez explains that South Korea and Taiwan “have been significant players in the global hardware production space in the information technology (IT) industry.” He notes that while South Korea specialises in handsets and liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, Taiwan specialises in notebook computers, motherboards, IC foundry and LCDs.</p>
<p>Parvez adds that China – thanks in part to Taiwanese investment – has surpassed Taiwan in hardware production to become the world’s second-largest hardware exporter. He also points out that both China and India have substantial software sectors, with India controlling the largest share of offshore software production worldwide.</p>
<h4>India</h4>
<p><img alt=""India information"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2019-05-06-tta-05-rf__india__967x374.png?la=en&amp;hash=B4E265E98337A3BE1B69F8D2EBD64DBF""/></p>
<p class=""source"">Source: CIA<em></em></p>
<h5>Demand</h5>
<p>Neumann notes that India and China are both “continental-sized” economies, as well as being relatively closed. “Here, domestic demand, whether consumption or investment, is the primary growth driver,” he says. “Both are also huge users of imported commodities, with their ups and downs having major consequences for global raw material prices. Taiwan and Korea are also highly exposed to swings in Chinese demand, with a large share of their exports heading to the Mainland.” Meanwhile, he says that India is not very exposed to China’s economy, “importing more from its large neighbour than exporting to it.”</p>
<p>While currently at divergent stages, Neumann says all four economies are important in their own right, with unique development stories. “Korea and Taiwan are some of the most export dependent economies in the world, sharing this feature with places like Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam,” he says. “India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, by contrast are currently more domestically driven.”</p>
<h4 id=""other-markets-to-watch"">Other markets to watch</h4>
<p>Emerging market acronyms are something of a moving target – so while there may still be life in the idea of TICKs economies, it is also worth asking which other markets might be included in future groupings.</p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Parvez says that other economies that could belong in this category are Thailand and the Philippines. “Thailand is actively developing high-tech industries and the profile of Thailand economy meets the priorities of the modern global economy,” he says. “While the Philippines is in early stages of its evolution, they have the advantage of human capital. This is also an economy that is tremendous potential for growth.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Steven Beck, Head of Trade and Supply Chain Finance at Asian Development Bank (ADB), argues that Vietnam may deserve a place in the latest acronym. “Our trade finance business focuses on the more challenging markets where the private sector has most trouble operating,” he comments. “Vietnam is one of our strongest markets, along with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But Vietnam is growing and reforming at such a pace that the private sector requires fewer of ADB’s AAA-rated guarantees and funding to conduct business there.”</p>
<p>Increasingly, Beck says, the private sector is comfortable establishing clean lines for Vietnam’s country and counterparty risk, meaning that fewer guarantees are required from ADB as the country graduates. “This is a good thing,” he comments. “We should sort out how to add ‘V’ into ‘TICK’, because ‘V’ could become the next ‘K’ within the next generation or two.”</p>
<h4>China</h4>

<h4 id=""opportunities-in-emerging-markets"">Opportunities in emerging markets</h4>
<p>With TICKs economies continuing to drive the region’s growth, Parvez says that a large number of global corporates are actively looking at entering these markets and setting up manufacturing units to cater to domestic demands and exports opportunities. “These countries have become key suppliers to the global market,” he says. “They not only provide the intellect and relatively cheaper labour, but also a large consumer base for the end products.”</p>
<p>With Asia being the fastest growing region in the world – and accounting for over 60% of global growth – it’s no surprise that MNCs are investing in APAC emerging markets as a longer-term strategy, argues Mandhana. He highlights some of the opportunities that corporates are focusing on across the region:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>China and India continue to be the key markets in which MNCs are investing, where real GDP growth is forecasted to grow at 6.4% and 7.2% respectively in 2019, compared to developed markets at 1.7% (source: J.P. Morgan Global Data Watch, 5th April 2019).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia and Vietnam are set to benefit from the US-China trade debate, particularly in low end manufacturing of ICT (information and communications technology) products, such as intermediate components and manufacturing of consumer goods like mobile phones and laptops (source: EIU). Malaysia and also the Philippines continue to be attractive locations for MNCs looking to set up shared services with increased investments going into both captives SSCs and BPOs (source: SSON).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indonesia, the largest economy in Southeast Asia, with a large and growing digital population, is providing fertile ground for e-commerce businesses growth.</p>

<p>Mandhana also notes that the evolution of payments infrastructure across emerging markets, and the rise of real-time payments, “will further help to increase B2C flows by improving the customer payment experience.”</p>
<h4 id=""overcoming-challenges-in-emerging-markets"">Overcoming challenges in emerging markets</h4>
<p>While the opportunities may be considerable, Asia’s emerging markets also present significant challenges from a treasury point of view. As Mandhana points out, these include the combination of multiple currencies, currency controls, complicated tax regimes and varied legal frameworks. “Another significant issue often faced by treasurers operating in APAC is how often regulatory changes can be introduced with little advance notice, or without any formal process for widespread notification,” says Mandhana, citing the example of India’s demonetisation, which “occurred overnight”.</p>
<p>Parvez, likewise, emphasises the challenges presented by these economies’ regulatory controls and currency restrictions, noting that corporates need to understand the relevant regulations and remain abreast with continuous changes. “They would also need to understand that the funds could get trapped and accordingly look at the right financing structure to support their offices in these markets,” he says.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mandhana notes that the region’s geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, with India, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand all set to hold elections this year – and, of course, the ongoing trade disputes between the US and China.</p>
<p>In this dynamic and complex regulatory and political landscape, treasurers need to keep their processes agile in order to be able to adapt to changes at short notice. “Establishing a treasury centre, or having a person based in the region in charge of treasury and tax that understands local nuances – alongside good two-way communication with head office – makes the region’s complexity more manageable,” says Mandhana. “Maintaining close relationships with regulators and banking partners is also imperative in order to gain insights into new regulatory changes as soon as they happen and be able to seek clarification on how the regulation applies in practice.”</p>

<p>
Regulation is often seen as something that must be done before the real business can get underway. Across Asia, this viewpoint is compounded by the fact that corporates are facing a complex and dynamic regulatory environment that can seem almost overwhelming for the uninitiated. But with a change of mindset, this challenging landscape can become genuinely beneficial, suggests Sandip Patil, Region Head, Global Liquidity and Investments, Asia Pacific at Citi.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id=""growing-ambitions"">Growing ambitions</h3>
<p>Managing business in Asia is all about growth. With virtually every industry in the region exhibiting this aspiration, many companies are finding out how difficult it can be to move from market to market, says Patil. Heterogeneous regulations, different customer buying behaviours and even variances within banking service delivery, are creating a series of unique environments through which treasury must navigate in its support of business growth. With a series of optimisation goals to achieve, each domain in which treasury moves sees regulation having a major influence on what can and cannot be realised from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Where the wording of individual regulations is often uncertain, understanding the “spirit of their intent” is essential, says Patil. Facing an interpretive element can force businesses into a cumbersome tactical reaction for each change, he adds. Over time, this approach creates inefficiencies eventually leading to KPIs falling behind competitor or industry best practice. Conversely, a positive approach and a firm grasp of the regulations in each jurisdiction – and the intentions behind them – can be a source of improved efficiency and long-term value for treasury and finance teams.</p>
<h3 id=""facing-complexity"">Facing complexity</h3>
<p>There are many verticals in the regulatory space and within each there will be sub-sets to which corporates must adhere to, varying from country to country. These rules can, for example, dictate the types of accounts that can be opened or whether funds can be co-mingled or not. Cross-border regulations may further stipulate, for instance, the movement of cash and capital thresholds. FX rules can also dictate matters such as currency convertibility and necessary permissions for movement.</p>
<p>With a noted trend for protectionism in certain markets, regulators are also steering corporates into new actions such as the mandating of local currency billing. In addition, the governance of data is rising up the agenda in many jurisdictions, driven in part by a focus on digitisation. This is driving businesses to review how they manage their infrastructure and flows, potentially curtailing outsourcing plans. Yet another regulatory domain that demands close consideration is that of taxation. Again, rules can differ considerably between jurisdictions, as they are subject to both global and domestic variables.</p>
<p>Given the regulatory complexity to which many corporates in Asia, especially those from overseas, are exposed to, failing to see beyond compliance is perhaps understandable. However, Patil notes a broad spectrum of corporate reactions to this topic; from the static to the highly evolved. Those that have taken little or no action are often encumbered with fragmented operations, he says. “Often, they find it a challenge to determine what steps to take, especially if they do not have a consistent treasury policy or model to help them form an effective response to regulatory issues.”</p>
<p>The most agile corporates have implemented appropriate organisational structures for their needs. Commonly, this appears as a regional treasury approach with local outposts under constant management. This will be guided by strong governance, trusted local personnel, and a willingness to engage with the authorities.</p>

<h3 id=""one-view"">One view</h3>
<p>Bringing the organisation together is key to success in a disparate regulatory environment, says Patil. In driving efficient working capital management and forming effective strategies around, for example, shared services, businesses can begin to understand what kind of legal entities are most appropriate to them.</p>
<p>From here, it becomes possible to build best-practice responses to matters such as cash repatriation, capital funding, expectations of returns on capital and comprehensive risk management practices. The role of the treasurer is therefore not only to understand the often highly nuanced applicable regulations, but also to bring this understanding to conversations with the wider organisation, generating a truly holistic and consistent outlook.</p>
<p>Delivery of the most efficient response will typically require the conversation to be extended to external stakeholders too, key amongst whom will be the organisation’s bank. The right banking partner, says Patil, will be able to engage treasury about what regulations exist and where, how best to interpret these, and how other businesses are responding so that vital benchmarking can be executed. This feedback must be delivered on a constant basis too, he adds, especially in rapidly evolving markets like China and India.</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-gain"">Corporate gain</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious area where corporates can derive regulatory advantage is through understanding of the evolving tax environment in Asia and implications on treasury management. Where centralisation through a payment factory or in-house bank is desired, regulations in jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand have all allowed government sponsorship for the onshoring of regional structures. Through this support, corporates have benefited from tax breaks and a de-cluttering of the rulebook affording them lower cost of funding, reduced operational cash requirements and opportunities to pay down expensive debt or repatriate cash to headquarters.</p>
<p>Although the Asian regulatory approach is still far from ‘one-size-fits-all’, and remains more restrictive than in Western financial centres, it is more open-minded today than ever before, says Patil. A bank such as Citi, with its long history, strong reputation for innovation, and on-the-ground presence in the region can be a proactive sounding board for ongoing local regulatory developments, to increase ease of cross-border business and help multinational clients operate more efficiently.</p>
<h3 id=""technological-approach"">Technological approach</h3>
<p>Whilst a strong partner is essential, the role of technology in enabling efficient operations in Asia’s complex and dynamic regulatory environment must also be acknowledged. This now extends beyond functions such as electronic clearing, into new endeavours such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, ‘Big Data’ analytics and APIs.</p>
<p>The bank has for some time been helping clients to digitise their processes and documentation, and build connectivity standards for their underlying systems and platforms. But it also extends its work with the authorities as part of the effort to develop appropriate ‘RegTech’. “The regulators are extremely keen on making sure their respective countries are seen as leading some of these digital practices,” says Patil. This, he notes, has propelled a notable evolution in the market around the use of the kind of advanced technologies mentioned above.</p>

<p>In fact, Citi has been working with several Asian authorities, advising on and helping to develop a regulatory sandbox approach. This enables businesses to explore and test new products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms for regulations such as KYC and AML, within a controlled real-world setting.</p>
<p>Given the progress being made, naturally the level of enthusiasm and uptake for RegTech is rising amongst the corporate community. “We work with some of the most sophisticated companies in any market and we are seeing much more demand from them,” says Patil. With a collaborative spirit operating between bank and client, he adds that the pace of development in the real world is helping many more clients take a step along this pathway.</p>
<h3 id=""rules-for-engagement"">Rules for engagement</h3>
<p>Corporates exhibit a wide range of readiness for handling regulatory change in Asia. Even within the inevitable diversity of maturities and needs, “the first step is knowing yourself”, says Patil. With every journey starting with a full understanding of the organisation, it will be necessary to map existing structures to what is needed. This should raise the issue of centralisation for financial processes, the learning of best practice, taking steps to mitigate any new process challenges, and, of course, securing C-suite buy-in for change.</p>
<p>The second step is knowing what is possible. No corporate can achieve this alone, states Patil. It will be necessary to talk to experts in the market, to learn all the local regulatory nuances, define a response and set benchmarks. Whether this is about establishing a major centralisation project or simply reducing the amount of local operating cash, the expert voice will help figure out the best way to do this at a country, regional or global level.</p>
<p>Regulatory optimisation can never be a one-off exercise, so the third requirement is to sustain the process of discovery, says Patil. In doing so, companies can ensure they are benefitting from changing regulatory conditions.</p>
<h3 id=""partner-plus"">Partner-plus</h3>
<p>There is a clear advantage for treasurers choosing to work with a bank capable of offering an up-to-the-minute understanding of the regulatory environment. But, says Patil, a bank such as Citi can go further, helping the client explore the full range of opportunities and offering help in forming the most appropriate response for the entire enterprise, not just treasury, not just locally, and certainly not just as a one-off exercise.</p>
<p>With 70% of the centralised liquidity structures of the Fortune 500 companies on its books, Citi knows how some of the world’s most successful businesses are optimising their operations in the face of the complex and shifting regulatory landscape that is Asia. Being part of that ecosystem enables the bank to provide trusted advisory to clients – shifting the regulatory viewpoint from one of compliance to one of opportunity for corporates’ growth and transformation.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Japan, the world’s third largest economy, is home to some of the most innovative companies on the planet. Yet the role of corporate treasury in Japanese companies remains largely siloed and operational. Treasury Today Asia finds out why this is the case and hears how the profession in the country might be approaching a new dawn.</em></p>
<p>Japan Inc. is thriving, driven by improved domestic growth, a broader uptick in the global economy and record earnings at overseas subsidiaries. This has seen the 200 companies listed on the SMBC Nikko Securities section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange report pre-tax profits of US$55bn between April and December last year – up more than 14% from the same period in 2016.</p>
<p>Increased profits are adding to the already significant cash war chest held by Japan Inc. Indeed, as of March 2017, Japanese companies, excluding banks and insurance companies, collectively held a record-high JPY189trn (approximately US$1.7trn) in cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheets. As of the end of the year, these same companies owned cash worth more than 140% of Japan’s GDP. This is more than three times higher than the 43% of US GDP equivalent held in cash by American companies.</p>
<p>Despite being built as a buffer against future economic crises, some commentators claim such a degree of cash hoarding is preventing Japan from reaching its economic potential. This is because corporates are not increasing wages, a move that would help boost domestic spending power and allow Japan to drive more sustainable economic development, rather than relying on exports.</p>
<h3 id=""stagnant-growth-of-treasury"">Stagnant growth of treasury</h3>
<p>Cash hoarding is also preventing corporate treasury departments in Japan from achieving their full potential. “The main job of corporate treasury in many Japanese companies is to obtain external funding for the business,” says Kaoru Ito, Director at Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. “The fact that many Japanese corporates have such high levels of cash reserves means that there is little need for external borrowing, however. Because of this, in the eyes of senior leadership, treasury is not a business-critical function within the organisation.”</p>
<img alt=""3rd largest economy in the world"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2018-03and04-tta-07-cyf__fact-01__3rd-largest-economy-in-the-world__311x44.png?la=en&amp;hash=5069D606CB75D317533F258B8A33948A"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0; "">
<p>With treasury in Japan not having the kick-start it has had in other parts of the world, the role remains largely operational, says Ito. “There are also few treasury subject matter experts in Japan as staff are often rotated in and out of the department every two to three years as part of a systematic job rotation programme. There are some exceptions to the rule, where treasury has broken down its operational silo and become more strategic, but these are rare.”</p>
<h3 id=""era-of-global-treasury"">Era of global treasury</h3>
<p>Corporate Japan is slowly waking up to the benefits a professional and strategic treasury department can offer. Ito notes that several high-profile financial incidents caused by overseas affiliate companies in recent years have made Japanese companies place a renewed focus on corporate governance and prudent treasury management.</p>
<p>Isao Kojima, Head of Transaction Services, Japan at J.P. Morgan, echoes this point, saying that corporate treasury in Japan has not become a strategic function in the way that it has in other parts of the world. However, he is gradually seeing more treasury departments step away from being process driven, involving themselves in the business and looking to mirror global best practice.</p>
<img alt=""Population"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2018-03and04-tta-07-cyf__fact-02__population-126451398-july-2017-est__210x125.png?la=en&amp;hash=F88E0DEC440C6265CFD4DDA4DBB23396"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;""/>
<p>For Kojima, treasury best practice means global visibility, control and centralisation, something that few treasury departments in Japan have had before. “Japan Inc. is quite unique in how it has gone global,” he explains. “Typically, Japanese companies created subsidiaries in growth markets and let them run themselves – intervention only occurred if there were serious issues.”</p>
<p>Although this approach has been successful for many Japanese companies, it has not necessarily been the most efficient, at least from a treasury perspective. “Treasury in Japanese companies is managed at a country level or regional level, but there is very little global oversight bringing it all together,” says Kojima. “This prohibits best practice and often results in less than optimal cash management arrangement and increased costs.”</p>
<p>The return of overseas talent and the current wave of Japanese corporates conducting overseas M&amp;A is transforming the thinking inside Japan Inc., says Kojima. “Our clients are aware that their businesses are becoming significantly more complex and they want that global visibility to optimise and control how global cash and liquidity is managed, as well as drive costs out of the business. Those that are slightly more advanced are also looking at managing FX risk and global funding centrally as well.”</p>
<p>Due to these trends, Kojima is seeing more and more Japanese corporates set up global treasury centres in Japan. “Many Japanese corporates have wanted to do this for some time, but there were several challenges that prevented efficient liquidity structures being created, such as clearing cut-off times, for example.” Improvements in the clearing system and innovation from banks through follow-the-sun and against-the-sun sweeping structures have changed the game, says Kojima. “Banks are now able to offer the efficient liquidity structures that allow Japanese corporates to manage the world from their headquarters and thus we are seeing an increase in activity.”</p>
<h3 id=""ups-and-downs-japans-post-war-economic-history"">Ups and downs: Japan’s post-war economic history</h3>
<p>Japan has a reputation for incredible efficiency. Just look at its rail network. The latest data available from the Central Japan Railway Company, one of the country’s main railway operators, shows the average high-speed bullet train arrives at its final stop just 0.9 minutes late. Compare this to the UK, where research shows that about 57 trains are significantly late (30 minutes to two hours) every day. Or New York, where commuters collectively spend 35,000 hours each day waiting on delayed trains.</p>
<p>Efficiency isn’t just evident in Japan’s transportation system: it flows through the very core of Japanese culture. This has had a big role to play in the country’s post-war economic success that has made Japan one of largest and most advanced economies in the world – a success that has been called the ‘Japanese Economic Miracle’.</p>
<p style=""text-align:center; margin-top:2em;""><img alt=""Major exports"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/201803and04tta07cyffact04majorexportsincludeautomobilesconsumerelectronicssemiconductorscopper437x14.png?la=en&amp;hash=595B8944E785728A264298096DE06B5E""/> </p>
<p>Many factors contributed to this economic miracle – not least the successful economic reforms adopted by the government post-war, pivoting the economy towards the production of raw materials and putting the country to work. Doing so rapidly converted Japan’s militarised economy to drive peaceful economic development, enabling some companies in the automotive and technology space to become world leaders.</p>
<p>Boosting this was ‘keiretsu’ – the formation of sets of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. This helped create harmony amongst corporate Japan, protecting companies from stock market fluctuations and takeover attempts thus enabling long-term planning in projects.</p>
<p>The forging of close ties with the United States also had a significant impact. The relationship saw Japan invited to participate in US-led free trade programmes. This gave companies the ability to thrive on the international stage with low tariffs, cheap access to oil and other raw materials needed for industrial development.</p>
<p>Because of these and other factors, Japanese industrial output reached pre-war levels by 1951 and exceeded them by 350% just ten years later. Economic growth was just as impressive, with Japan posting an average growth of 10% in the 1960s, 5% average growth in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s.</p>
<p>In the 1990s the tide turned, however, as Japan went from growth to stagnation following the Japanese asset price bubble’s collapse in late 1991. Throughout this period, commonly referred to as the ‘lost decade’, GDP fell from US$5.33trn to US$4.36trn in nominal terms, real wages fell around 5% and Japan’s stock markets hovered near record lows. Excessive business and consumer saving, an ageing population and monetary policy are just a few of the factors that contributed to the lost decade.</p>

<p>The lost decade became ‘Ushinawareta Nijūnen’ (which translates to ‘lost decades’) as the economy continued to stagnate at the start of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Since then, however, reforms implemented in 2012 by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe have turned the tide. Regarded as one of the biggest economic experiments the modern world has ever seen, Abenomics centres on three pillars: an increase in fiscal stimulus through government spending; an increase in monetary stimulus through unconventional central bank policy; and a reform programme aimed at making structural improvements to the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>Six years on, there has been much debate on the relative success (or not) of Abenomics. It certainly has not solved all issues; weak domestic consumption and huge debt levels remain. However, the economy is much stronger with aggressive monetary policy fending off the deflationary malaise of previous years. Indeed, Japan recorded seven straight quarters of economic expansion to the end of September 2017, its longest uninterrupted stretch of growth since 1994.</p>

<p>Japanese automobile giant Nissan is a company that is leading the way when it comes to treasury sophistication. Its multicultural corporate ethos has seen it adopt global best practices, unlike many other Japanese companies. This includes senior management recognising the value of a strategic treasury department. As a result, Nissan has built a 60-person strong treasury team at its headquarters in Yokohama. This supports regional treasury teams in North America and Europe and drives the strategic direction of the treasury globally.</p>
<p>“It makes no sense for there not to be a global treasury team based here in Japan,” says Nissan’s Senior Vice President, Global Treasury and Global Sales Finance, Rakesh Kochhar. “The job of the global treasury is not just to raise money and make payments – you can do this anywhere. It is about providing senior management with strategic advice around M&amp;A; it is about managing risks that span across the business; it is about working with sales and procurement to ensure that we are conscious about cash and making the right decisions. To do all of this you need to sit where the decision makers are.”</p>

<p>Thankfully, Japan offers all the ingredients required to make an excellent global treasury centre location: good talent, good systems and good banks, says Kochhar. In fact, having worked in other parts of the world, Kochhar is confident in saying that it is just as easy to run a global treasury from Japan as it is in any other liberal financial centre.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are instances where life as a treasurer in Japan is easier than in other key treasury centre locations. Kochhar highlights the regulation governing the asset-backed security (ABS) as one example. “This is an instrument we often use to raise funds. In Japan, I am able to complete a transaction in ten days,” he says. “In the US, it takes 30 days minimum because of various reporting that has to be done. This is just one example, but across various areas of finance I see Japan being an easier place to do business than the US.”</p>
<p>The need to be close to Nissan’s core banking partners also offers a compelling reason for the global treasury to be based in Japan. “We have a group of 18 banks globally, many of which are Japanese,” says Kochhar. “Whilst I have found that Japanese banks operate in much the same way as US or European banks, it is true that they place a greater emphasis on the relationship. Sitting in Japan, next door to their head offices, helps me craft these relationships and get the best price for funding.”</p>
<h3 id=""banking-on-technology"">Banking on technology</h3>
<p>Historically, Japanese banks – with their enormous balance sheets – have been famed more for their ability to lend to corporates around the world, and less for their transaction banking capabilities. This, however, is beginning to change as Japanese banks invest heavily in this part of their business to build up their transaction banking franchise around the world.</p>
<p>The country’s biggest lender, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), has been especially determined, with transaction banking being made part of the bank’s overall medium-term growth strategy. This has seen the bank make high-profile hires around the world, including ex-J.P. Morgan banker Ken Stratton in Singapore; Yong Lee Boon in Hong Kong, who arrived from Standard Chartered; Michael Hogan, who joined from National Australia Bank and will lead the team in London; and experienced ex-Wells Fargo GTS specialist, Ranjana Clark in the US.</p>
<img alt=""GDP – per capita (PPP) (2017 est.)"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2018-03and04-tta-07-cyf__fact-07__gdp-per-capita__133x133.png?la=en&amp;hash=609D3376AF9C3EECC847E02290F4F870"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;""/>
<p>Japanese banks are also serious about technology, especially in the blockchain space. Last year, news emerged of a consortium of Japanese banks that are planning to use distributed ledger to make domestic and international payments. Later in the year, more news emerged stating that Japanese banks plan to introduce a digital currency ready for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. ‘J Coin’ as it is known, is an electronic currency designed to pay for goods and transfer money using smartphones. It would be convertible into yen on a one-to-one basis, operating via a smartphone app and using QR codes to be scanned in stores.</p>
<p>More broadly speaking, digitisation is crucial if Japan is to achieve its economic ambitions in the coming years. “Japan’s declining birth rate and ageing population means that it is crucial that companies look to adopt new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence and robotics to create new growth industries,” says Masahiko Morio, Chief Manager, Economic Research Department at MUFG. “Technology can also help plug the gaps left by a shrinking workforce.”</p>
<p>To achieve this, Morio calls for the Japanese government to support innovation and industrial restructuring through growth strategies and regulatory reforms. “They should also consider establishing a regulatory sandbox and simplifying administrative procedures.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-bright-future"">A bright future?</h3>
<p>Japan as a nation certainly has lots to look forward to over the coming years, as it hosts the Rugby World Cup in 2019 and the Summer Olympic Games in 2020. Beyond that, Nissan’s Kochhar predicts a bright future. “The economy has been doing well in recent years,” he says. “And it will continue to do well because it believes in innovation and harnessing new technology.” This is reflected in a revised forecast from the IMF, predicting that Japan’s economy will grow 1.2% this year, up 0.5% from its October estimate. This is largely due to the broad-based global recovery gathering steam.</p>
<img alt=""Fortune 500 – 51 Japanese companies listed in the Fortune 500"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2018-03and04-tta-07-cyf__fact-08__fortune-500__149x140.png?la=en&amp;hash=8E1D11F82F57E798E19ED1926C387A57"" style=""float: left; margin: 1em 2em 2em 0;""/>
<p>Whilst global growth is benefiting Japan’s export-heavy economy, the world remains in an uneasy space and a reversal in economic trends could bring recession back to Japan. Domestic demand driven by consumer spending is highlighted as the key to creating more long-term sustained growth in Japan. However, at present, domestic consumption remains flat as wages in Japan have stagnated over the past five years, despite healthy corporate profits and a competitive labour market. Prime Minister Abe has urged businesses to up wages, but Japan Inc. is yet to respond with vigour.</p>
<p>Japan’s unbalanced demographics pose a further challenge. Indeed, Japan’s increasingly ageing population has the highest spending power in the country – but is reluctant to spend, stunting domestic consumption. The ageing population, combined with the record-low birth rate, may also bring labour challenges further down the line. To combat this, Japan is quietly opening up to increased immigration. Since 2013 the resident foreign workforce has in fact steadily risen, growing 40% since 2013 alone.</p>
<p>From a corporate treasury perspective, the influx of overseas talent can only be positive for the profession in Japan, says Kochhar. “Japan is a fantastic place to live and to work in treasury. Therefore, if the opportunity is there for treasury professionals from around the world to come to Japan to work, I would expect them to take it. In doing so, they will bring overseas expertise and raise the standards of corporate treasury across the country.”</p></img>


","Japan, the world’s third largest economy, is home to some of the most innovative companies on the planet. Yet the role of corporate treasury in Japanese companies remains largely siloed and operational.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pace of digital evolution in China is nothing short of remarkable. In an exceptionally short time, the country has transformed from being behind in the technological stakes to one at the forefront of innovation. It is now blazing a path for other markets around the world to follow. This is especially true for China’s financial services sector, where fintech is booming. Indeed, data from Oliver Wyman shows that in 2016, venture capital investment in Chinese fintech firms topped US$6.4bn, representing 47% of global fintech investment<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A variety of forces are driving the growth of China’s digitised economy. One of the most important is the regulator’s ‘light-touch’ approach to fintech firms, which allows them to experiment and quickly bring new solutions to market. This regulatory approach has been especially beneficial for China’s internet giants, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (often referred to as BAT) who have been able to develop a host of innovative financial solutions, such as WeChat Pay and Yu’e Bao.</p>
<p>These products have become widely popular in China because of the country’s expanding internet user base – in 2016, China had more internet users than the United States and the European Union combined. What is more, the majority of these internet users are tech-savvy and primarily use mobile devices, which have become vital tools in their day-to-day life.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-china"">Beyond China</h3>
<p>Although China is leading the way with regards to digitisation in Asia Pacific, digitisation activity across the entire region is vibrant. In Singapore, for instance, regulators are focusing on creating a pan-Asian digital ecosystem, especially around trade and payments. The city state’s aim is to solidify its position as one of the region’s leading financial centres.</p>
<p>India is another market taking notable strides forward. Comparably, India’s digitisation efforts are largely focused on removing friction in the domestic economy and enabling the country’s vast unbanked population to gain access to financial services. However, in India, it is the government, not private enterprise, leading the charge. This is evidenced through Modi’s Digitise India initiative that has given launch to Aadhaar – a unique identification number based on biometric information issued to residents of India – and a new Immediate Payment Service (IMPS). Banks and fintech firms are now leveraging these platforms to bring a wealth of innovative digital financial services to individuals and business in the country.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, all other countries in the region are pressing ahead and building faster payment rails. Indeed, by 2020, every country in the region, bar Bangladesh, will have a faster payments platform in place. These payment platforms will act as the backbone for further innovation from banks and fintechs.</p>
<h3 id=""the-payment-experience"">The payment experience</h3>
<p>As well as revolutionising the financial services industry, the rise of digitisation across Asia is transforming the business landscape. This has seen the emergence of a variety of businesses who solely operate online. These businesses are disrupting well-established industries such as transportation, hospitality and commerce. Likewise, more traditional businesses are also evolving their own offerings, building eCommerce business models to scale up, drive revenue growth and remain competitive.</p>
<p>To achieve this, companies are thinking through how they can market themselves to reach a wider customer base, chiefly by removing any friction when accessing products and/or services. Core to this is the payment experience. It is here that treasury plays a crucial role in understanding how consumers want to pay and then working to enable the business to collect using these preferred methods.</p>
<p>Accepting a wide variety of different payment methods can create challenges for treasury, potentially increasing internal complexity and costs. It is here that a bank such as Citi, which is deeply integrated into core markets across Asia Pacific, can add value by working with treasury teams to seamlessly embed these different payment types into their operations.</p>
<p>Once the efficiency is in place, treasury can leverage the wealth of data that flows through these digital payment rails. By harnessing this data, treasury can begin to build a rich understanding of customer behaviour. The business can then leverage this information to develop more refined and targeted sales strategies, potentially creating a competitive advantage for them.</p>
<h3 id=""stay-nimble"">Stay nimble</h3>
<p>Over the coming years, the opportunities for businesses to grow through digitisation in Asia Pacific will continue to emerge. Indeed, in China, McKinsey &amp; Co predict that internet applications will account for between 7% to 22% of incremental GDP growth through 2025 – this translates into RMB4trn to RMB14trn in annual GDP in 2025<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>. Treasury departments must therefore ensure that they stay abreast of the changes that are coming and be ready to make any necessary changes to their operations for the business to thrive.</p>

<h4 id=""question-1"">Corporates, what is your outlook for 2018?</h4>

<p><span>Randy Ou, Vice President, Treasury, Alibaba Group:</span> At Alibaba, we are very optimistic and excited about the year ahead. As an organisation, we are growing extremely fast and there are lots of growth opportunities for us around the world.</p>
<p>From a treasury perspective, these are exciting times because we see more and more new technology coming in, and stakeholders working together to make the industry more efficient. This will ultimately give treasurers tools that enable them to do their jobs better and support the business more effectively.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, Asian Regional Treasurer, General Mills:</span> I am new to the role at General Mills and have been tasked with building the Group’s Asia treasury operation. As a result, the last few months have been quite challenging: I’ve been learning about the business and have put in place a plan for how we can become efficient and enable the business to grow here in Asia.</p>
<p>In terms of the coming year, I am optimistic. Asia remains a growth area for our business and will therefore continue to be a key market. My focus will be on getting the basics right by putting in place new treasury platforms and creating a more streamlined banking group. Where treasury is concerned, we will basically be coming out of the dark and into the light.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, Vice President, Regional Treasury Asia Pacific, Deutsche Post DHL Group:</span> I concur with Randy and Chris, as I am also positive about the coming year. As an organisation, we have been very focused on the core pillars of our 2020 strategy. Treasury has an integral part to play in that and has been heavily involved in the areas of eCommerce expansion, particularly in emerging markets. This will continue into 2018.</p>
<p>On top of that, the more traditional treasury requirements will continue to hold my attention, such as the expansion of our payment factory across Asia Pacific. This is all about standardisation around payments and gaining greater visibility over our cash.</p>

<h4 id=""question-2"">What about the banks? What are your key priorities for 2018?</h4>

<p><span>Mark Evans, Managing Director, Transaction Banking, ANZ:</span> Our main area of focus is making sure that the data we have within the bank is robust, so that it can be applied in a variety of different ways to add value to our customers.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is a cost saving exercise which is designed to simplify and create efficiency in our back office. On the other, and most importantly, we are doing it so that we can understand our customers and their needs better. Once we have this information, we aim to provide customers with insights they might not otherwise have and help them achieve their objectives.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, Head of Transaction Banking for Asia Pacific, BNP Paribas:</span> Our priority remains putting our client interests first. Our focus next year – and over the coming years – is on the customer journey and making it more efficient and intuitive. In the next two to three years, we are investing €3bn in digital transformation globally and in reimagining our processes and how our clients interact with us. At the same time, we are working with our clients to co-create new solutions and add greater value to what they are doing.</p>

<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Asia Pacific Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi:</span> Facilitating our customers’ eCommerce ambitions is our number one priority in 2018. This is a huge growth area for the bank and it aligns with the revolution that Asia is going through at present, from people’s growing affluence and spending power to the emergence of faster payment systems. By 2020, every single country in Asia, barring Bangladesh, is going to have a faster payments system in place. This is game changing and creates a tremendous opportunity for our clients to tap into the spending power of people who have access to money but no means of shopping online. We want to facilitate this growth.</p>
<p>In addition, we will be focusing a lot on our client advisory services so that we can help corporates navigate the changing landscape and make more informed decisions. As is the case with all banks, we will also be simplifying our operations.</p>

<h4 id=""question-3"">To the corporates in the room, do these areas of focus align with what you want from your banking partners?</h4>

<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> I fully agree with the point about the rapid growth of eCommerce in Asia and this is a crucial area for our business. For treasury, a key objective of our eCommerce strategy is driving cash out of our processes, which is not easy in many markets, especially if there is not broad card penetration.</p>
<p>We are really looking to our banks to help us embrace the new wave of digital wallets. The challenge for our business – which in Asia Pacific spans 130 entities across 41 countries – is finding a provider who can support us with connectivity and standardisation across all these markets. We do not want lots of individual solutions.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> I agree, and this goes back to one of the key things that every treasurer is looking for: simplification. We treasurers are lazy and crave efficiency. We do not want these new technological trends to overcomplicate our lives.</p>
<p>On Mark’s point regarding banks knowing their customers, I think this is crucial. We want our banks to know which markets we are in, what we are trying to achieve and what the journey is – often this is not the case today. Once they have this knowledge, we can then plan together for how we best move forward. Going beyond that, we want our banks to tell us what we can do better. Suddenly it goes from being a buyer/supplier relationship to being a genuine collaboration.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> I completely agree with this. One thing we are seeing from our clients – and they are explicit about this – is that they want ideas, rather than just solutions. This is very different to what banks have traditionally provided.</p>
<p>We have developed a host of tools designed exactly for this need. As a result, we are able to take our clients’ KPIs, run some quick analytics on the data and tell them which solutions are available to help them meet their objectives. We are also able to benchmark their data against their peers in a variety of different ways.</p>

<h6>Randy Ou</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Randy Ou, Alibaba:</span> It is interesting to hear the banks’ plans for the year ahead because I see a huge opportunity for them to bring new solutions to market that will be readily adopted by corporates.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about fintechs and the exciting solutions that they are developing. But as a treasurer, I must make my manager comfortable with any solution that we adopt. Will they let me use a fintech company to process billions of dollars’ worth of transactions? This is a hard sell, no matter how impressive the solution. It comes down to trust.</p>
<p>This is where I see the greatest opportunity for banks, because if they can acquire, white label or develop solutions that offer the speed and convenience of the fintech solutions, then corporates may be more willing to adopt these. If a fintech company has a product we like, and a bank has a similar product, we will probably pick the bank.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> I agree. Many fintechs have very good solutions that work in certain markets, but they are often plug-and-play products. When you are a large organisation with shared service centres and a multitude of finance departments in different countries, that plug-and-play is not a natural way of operating and does not align with everything else within the organisation.</p>
<p>In the past, when we have implemented traditional payment solutions, the banks’ ability to deliver implementation teams and customer service has been very important. In my view there is an advantage there if the banks do not try to out-and-out compete with fintechs, but act as the facilitator and gateway to their solutions.</p>


<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> Could I just make one more comment on that? I think that banks got it wrong in terms of how to address the fintechs over the previous few years. We regarded them as disruptors that were going to ‘eat our lunch’.</p>
<p>What has changed in recent years is that we now see the value in fintechs and banks working together. As a consequence, we now speak to them and go, ‘OK, that is a really good idea, I can see the applicability of that. Now how am I going to roll that across 34 countries and 50,000 staff? And by the way, I am a regulated entity’. Many of them then look at you and go, ‘Sorry, how do you spell regulated?’</p>
<p>So therein lies the difference. I hope corporates are going to find that across the industry, we are starting to get it. The fintechs bring innovation that we are not necessarily equipped to do – we are banks, and that generally means that we are trusted, but it does not mean that we are the most innovative.</p>

<h4 id=""question-4"">With all that being said, how do you as corporates go about picking your banks?</h4>

<p><span>Randy Ou, Alibaba:</span> Aside from traditional factors like product, service, pricing and technology, one area that stands out to me is collaboration. I want my international banks to be ready and willing to collaborate with others in the ecosystem, such as other international and local banks. International and local banks should not be competitors in the B2B space; they should act together and then provide a good solution for the corporate treasurer.</p>
<p>To expand on this, what I am looking for is for my banks to have a platform strategy mindset, akin to what some internet companies have done. This means that we make a product or service that we feel is good enough and then we open it up to the world to connect to. We cannot and should not do everything by ourselves, and welcome industry players to participate together. This sparks innovation, drives scale and brings the whole world forward.</p>
<p>In the financial services industry, we find that this platform mindset is not there. Instead, banks tend to think they are a powerhouse or the best global bank. But you are competing with the future and you can’t remain that big – it is too costly. That is why I will prefer banks that have a platform mindset because I believe these will be the ones that win out in the years to come.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> I have been quite outspoken about this, the banks have all got the same products and capabilities. Therefore, over a period of time, it has become less about products and services and more about the relationship. Yes, we still talk about service and about pricing, but it is about the relationship.</p>
<p>Personally, I want a strong partner who understands my business and knows how to take it forward. I also want to be able to pick up the phone and say, ‘We have got this problem; how do you think we can move forward?’ I don’t expect an answer straight away, but I expect the bank to be able to say, ‘Well, Chris, let’s think about this, let’s brainstorm, let’s see how we can move forward.’</p>
<p>I am going to use the words ‘as a team’ because that is what it is. We are trying to get to the same point. You are trying to make money from me, I am trying to save money when using your services – but we are all trying to get to the same point.</p>

<h6>Stephen Hogan</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> I agree with Randy and Chris on both points. Given our large geographical scope, we have quite a big panel of banks who are supportive with their balance sheets. They are in for the long term and are showing their commitment.</p>
<p>When we are looking into cash management solutions it is about the banks’ geographical reach, what solutions they have and the relationship we have with them: these have always been important factors for me. I also want to work with banks that are well-aligned internally. This means that if I have somebody walking into a branch in Bangkok, the relationship manager in Singapore knows about it and so does the relationship manager in Frankfurt later that afternoon. The most successful banks I have worked with are the ones who have that clear communication.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> To Randy’s point about banks collaborating, I think one of the paths that will make it happen is regulation. It is unfortunate that this is the case, because the banks should have done it themselves. In Europe today, the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) is mandating open banking. Every bank has to publish an API, which is essentially the wires coming out of your account, and anybody is allowed to connect to it. And the API is a regulatory standard. Once you have this mandated connectivity, there’ll be a bunch of providers who’ll come in and create a platform.</p>

<h4 id=""question-5"">How do you go about bringing your different banks together, with their different geographic footprints? Chye Kin, how do you respond to what you have heard?</h4>

<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> It is about collaboration, co-creation and being business partners to our clients. I believe that a bank’s relationship managers are core to this as they are the ones who understand what the client is doing, and who propose solutions and bring ideas to add value to the client relationship.</p>
<p>Relationship managers are effectively business partners, and corporates expect them to intimately understand their businesses, industry sectors, strategies and objectives. We have a relationship management structure which mirrors that of our clients with global, regional and in-country teams to deliver a coordinated and strategic partnership to corporates. With our ‘One Bank for Corporates’ approach, our clients have access to global connectivity with local expertise.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> I think it is crucial to have relationship managers specialising in industry sectors as well, going back to the ‘knowing you’ theme.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> I agree that banks need to have the right mix of subject matter experts, whether they are focused on compliance or products, and also customer experts. I think the journey has been for relationship managers to understand that they are customer and industry experts, and it has taken the banks a while to understand that this is a skill. They may not be the best credit experts or M&amp;A experts, but if they can understand the industry and the customers, we have got enough expertise centres to be able to make music. But if you do not have somebody who can listen to the audience, you are not going to make music.</p>

<img alt=""Chris Emslie, Chye Kin Wee and Randy Ou"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/2018-01and02-tt-09-ttf__group-of-photos-01__625x194.jpg?h=194&amp;w=625&amp;la=en&amp;hash=031C1AC89BC73C158C75B59A7793F88C"" style=""height: 194px; width: 625px;""/> 

<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> For me, the relationship manager is that point of reference. Sometimes when something unexpected happens and you are in a panic, it’s comforting to be able to pick up the phone and speak to your relationship manager, who will take on board what you are saying and get the information you need.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> Banks have adjusted their coverage in recent years to reflect their clients more closely. Within our organisation this has certainly helped us be nimbler and support our clients better.</p>
<p>As both Chris and Stephen have said, human contact is key. While technology is the driver of change, human relationships remain critical in bringing value to clients. At BNP Paribas, we are a phone call away. We converse directly with our clients, not via automated machines. Treating our clients in a bespoke manner ensures we align as closely with them as possible, providing customised solutions for our clients’ needs.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> We do not make it easy for you and that is the beauty of it! Figure out those sets of rules.</p>


<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> The number of times you go in, you see the head office treasurer and the treasurer says, ‘right, that cash mandate is coming up, you have the chance to win the business’. And you go and see the regional treasurer and he says, ‘I will never change it – I come from that bank, I’m going to stay with that bank,’ so you go, ‘Oh dear!’</p>

<h4 id=""question-6"">On the subject of bank relationships, how big an issue is KYC, for both corporates and banks?</h4>

<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> It is a huge issue, but in order for the industry to deal with it we need to stop thinking that it is going to be down to the regulators, the banks or the end customers to solve this in isolation. We need a joined up collaborative effort to help the regulators understand that despite their intentions and desires, the current regimes are not resulting in the right outcomes and are instead creating a highly laborious, expensive and time-consuming box-checking exercise. This means that the whole point of KYC can often be lost.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> This point was raised at the recent Singapore Fintech Festival where the spokesperson from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) called for the banks to take a collaborative approach underpinned by technology. This obviously makes a lot of sense because compliance costs are being replicated five times over by all the banks and there is a lot of potential to cut these costs if the information is shared.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> Agreed. We will only solve the KYC challenge once there is an agreed-upon technological infrastructure in place that can help the whole industry manage it more effectively. What is the correct solution to do this? We do not know. In India for example, the government has launched a biometric platform. You also have what the MAS is doing with the MyInfo portal. Then there are third-party players with Thomson Reuters and Markit creating common utility platforms.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> Mark, do you feel that there are enough compliance experts within the banks and are they taking too cautious an approach to how they interpret the regulators’ guidelines?</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> Yes, we are all chasing the talent because it is a finite pool and the consequences of getting it wrong are so much bigger than they were before. As a result, over the past number of years there has been a real premium on compliance and operational risk expertise.</p>
<p>The second point is absolutely correct: banks are naturally cautious because there is zero tolerance for a breach. To a degree I think this is unreasonable, but the politicians and lawmakers have very few directions in which they can point the blame and the banks are the obvious ones. They do not want to necessarily hit a corporate unless it really has done the wrong thing.</p>
<p>The good regulators work collaboratively with the banks to understand what we need to achieve from a robust and sound financial system. That is in everybody’s interest. But that is the exception rather than the rule because as much as banks are chasing compliance expertise, regulators need commercial expertise. And that is not necessarily readily available either.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> To your point, Stephen, that compliance by itself is not a static topic: that is the challenge we have. One dimension is KYC, then there are the transactions – ‘know your transaction’ or KYT compliance – which add another level of complexity.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the regulation itself – it is how it is applied that can sometimes be challenging. I think Singapore is a regulator that is forward-looking and clear-minded. In other cases, the regulatory landscape is fast-changing. We must, therefore, take a cautious approach, but nonetheless still be pragmatic.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> I think it is clear that there is a need to move from the form of the regulations to focusing on their spirit and substance. This would remove a lot of the need for legalistic interpretation and go some way towards preventing regulations from inhibiting business.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> They certainly stop us from doing business today. That is the key issue and it makes our jobs a lot harder because it is incredibly difficult explaining to a business person that they can’t do business because they don’t have X, Y and Z.</p>

<h4 id=""question-7"">We have talked a lot about technology, but I am surprised that blockchain has not come up. Is this of interest at all?</h4>

<p><span>Randy Ou, Alibaba:</span> I believe blockchain presents a huge opportunity for banks and corporates. I see genuine applicability in areas such as payments, KYC, working capital management and even risk management. But the industry and banks are moving very slowly to adopt the technology. It is too slow.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> From our perspective, we are still in the infancy of exploring the technology. But it’s not just blockchain – we are eager to learn and explore all new technologies. It is exciting.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> Around two years ago, blockchain was the buzz word used in every presentation. Today we have reached the stage where there are genuine use cases and ways to apply the technology.</p>
<p>At BNP Paribas, we are working through these and seeing where it fits in our own internal processes and where it can deliver value to our corporate clients. In the transaction banking space, we have been working with our clients to co-develop new services based on blockchain. An example is ‘MyCollat’, co-developed with Sucafina (a Swiss multinational coffee merchant) for more efficient collateral management for commodity finance transactions. Another is ‘Cash without borders’, co-developed with the Panini Group (Italy) and Amcor (Australia), to allow real-time cash transfers within the BNP Paribas environment.</p>
<p>In my view, we are going to have to find ways of bringing new technologies such as blockchain through by intermediating between corporates and fintechs. It will be about collaborating so that we can bring the best solutions to market that offer the strongest value propositions to corporates – this is the direction we are heading in.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> I think Randy makes a very valid observation. Two things in response to that. Like everybody else, we have deployed several blockchains. There is one for security settlement, which is a clear use case because it requires reconcilement. We have deployed another one for inter-company nostros within the bank because it’s about having a single version of the truth.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge – or the biggest opportunity, depending on how you view it – is that blockchains cannot be internal and must be part of a wider ecosystem. For example, trade is ripe for the blockchain, but if it is really going to work then you must get so many parties, like customs and shipping companies, on board as well. The biggest value of the blockchain is in a multi-stakeholder ecosystem.</p>
<p>As a result, we are working on quite a few things, but it is going to take time for me to come to you and say, ‘Here’s the value’. Not because of the technology, but because we have got to get the multiple holders of the truth to agree what the truth should look like. That is the challenge.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> This is happening on multiple fronts. For instance, what Singapore is doing with its National Trade Platform is extremely interesting because they are trying to create an ecosystem. It’s extremely important to Singapore because of its historical existence as a key trading location. We’re excited to be part of this because we believe co-working with industry and government partners is where we can bring real value to our clients for the long haul.</p>
<p>So, the subject of this has been raised, we have had meetings with Singapore Customs, and then of course with the likes of the forwarding companies and so forth to link it up. But what is also interesting is the recent announcement about a link up with the HKMA around distributed ledger technology. Ultimately the success of all this is based on your ability to create an ecosystem.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> And rules and standards that everybody agrees on.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> And once it takes off, then you have positive momentum for creating value. Coming back to your point, Rajesh, it is all about creating that platform and then plugging as many users into it as possible.</p>
<p>The MAS is pushing for banks to invest in APIs that can talk together. But one of the concerns that banks all have is around cyber-security, so that is the push and pull that’s taking place. I think at some point we’ll all reach a certain level of comfort, whether it’s going to be in Singapore or Hong Kong – it has to take fruition somewhere, and momentum has to build from there.</p>


<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> We recently launched a very interesting blockchain-based solution that solved a major pain point for one of our customers around guarantees. The solution solves the customer’s problem, reduces their operational risk, reduces the bank’s operational risk and reduces the cost of delivery.</p>
<p>In this case, the upside for the customer is there and so is the upside for the bank, so there’s a win-win in that. But it was not just a proof of concept, it was a pain point that we identified and blockchain was the solution in that instance.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> Yes, and from a personal perspective that white paper is the most interesting use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology because I can see it’s adapted for a corporate.</p>


<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> And I would love to say, ‘I’m delivering that to you tomorrow’, but I cannot. We are working towards it: we need to bring some other banks along on the journey and get the regulators comfortable that we are sharing data and so on – but it is a step in the right direction.</p>

<h4 id=""question-8"">What about the negative side of technology, cybercrime? How high is that on the agenda?</h4>

</figure>
<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> For us it is extremely high on the agenda. If you had to rank our risks then cyber risk would be at the top – I think we are attacked about 100 times a day. To put this into perspective, I was in the organisation for one day and suddenly had a phishing attempt. How they did this I do not know; I didn’t have business cards, I didn’t have anything – but all of a sudden, I had an email account and the email came from the CEO down to me. So that is just where it is and for us that is a big focus at the moment.</p>


<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> Safeguarding our data and technology assets is paramount in our digitalisation journey. Forewarned is forearmed – target attacks have grown in sophistication, so even preparation is insufficient.</p>
<p>To be forearmed requires robust and practiced incident response capability. Apart from continuous investment in prevention and monitoring tools, the ability to respond and ensure business continuity should a breach occur is crucial – which is where our training and simulated exercises come in.</p>
<p>Equally important in this area is education. The top causes of cyber breach are human error, lack of staff awareness of security risks and failure to follow defined processes, so it’s important to educate both staff and clients around security awareness. Of course, there is the need to collaborate with fintechs for new security solutions.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> Corporates must have robust IT services to manage this threat. There must also be a constant education of the workforce – something that happens within our organisation. For instance, the IT department recently ran a test where they sent out phishing emails and monitored how people reacted. We were then told of the results, which really opened our eyes up to the threats.</p>


<p><span>Randy Ou, Alibaba:</span> Yes, I think cybercrime is high on treasurers’ agenda. That is why more and more corporates have started to embrace cloud services. The increasing complexity and costs of cyber-security makes corporates realise that this needs to be taken care of by professionals. Relying on internal IT departments will become less effective and affordable in the future.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> I think one of the biggest issues right now is that the cyber criminals attack the weakest link in the chain. So, you can have the strongest IT, but that may not immunise you. And I think the point is, when we get hit, we sometimes get hit because of a client’s laptop compromised in a car.</p>
<p>Each of our institutions could immunise ourselves individually, but the vulnerability is usually cross-ecosystem. What we have been doing a lot of is educating our clients that this is a workflow and that you can get hit anywhere. And I think that’s where we all need to collectively have much stronger responses.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> It’s the individual – the weakest link is the individual. And that is why, as you rightly say, we could have robust IT, we could have a couple of thousand people sitting in Malaysia monitoring the systems – which is the case in our organisation – but it takes one individual to click and let the criminals in undetected.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> Or to share a password just once.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> Yes, or use a USB that has been tampered with. There are so many ways that corporates can be attacked and that is why education is key.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> Our laptops in the future will not have USB port access anymore.</p>

<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> Yes, we are doing the same. We did an education session for one of our large corporates recently and said, ‘did you know that you’ve got people that actually never log out of the system?’ And they said, ‘well that can’t be true’. Well, one of the people in question was sitting at the table! What she did not realise was that just shutting the browser page was not enough to log out. This education session really opened her and her colleagues’ eyes to this issue. The tricky thing is that they have all been educated on this multiple times, but sometimes you just forget about it and you fall into a bad practice.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> People get lazy, that is the problem.</p>


<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> Yes, and we don’t want the criminals around the world to be the beneficiaries of the inappropriate use of the system. So collectively we must find ways to work together and combat this threat.</p>

<h4 id=""question-9"">What are your closing thoughts?</h4>

<p><span>Randy Ou, Alibaba:</span> It is exciting to see the changes happening in the industry, and technology creates a huge opportunity. We are very optimistic about the transformation happening in finance and this will improve not just individual banks, but the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>The question is, how do banks make this readily available to the clients in a cost-effective way? I think that is where the competition will be, and the ones who win will be the next generation of leaders in the financial services.</p>


<p><span>Stephen Hogan, DHL:</span> To sum up, for treasury in our Group and finance as a whole, we’re really expected to be influencing business decisions and driving business direction – that is a clear message from the Group CFO. To do this, we are very keen to take advantage of innovative technology, digitisation and new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>It is great to hear other corporates are heading in the same direction. It is also refreshing to hear that banks have moved on from where they were two years ago: they now understand that what corporates want is for them to embrace this and offer us value-adding solutions. This is manifesting itself in banks realising that they cannot do it all alone and looking to partner with others in the industry.</p>


<p><span>Chris Emslie, General Mills:</span> I think from our point of view it is always a good opportunity to get everybody’s perspective. We have our thoughts and the banks have their own; what is clear is that we’ve all got the same challenges and the same hurdles to overcome.</p>
<p>My key takeaway is that on both sides of the table we are trying to be enablers, not inhibitors. We are all trying to be good business partners and we are all trying to achieve value-add, whether that means getting the best solution on the treasury side, or giving the best solutions on the banking side.</p>
<p>That is the best way to sum it up: we are on the same path, just on different sides. Once we converge and collaborate, I think it will be far better.</p>

<p><span>Chye Kin Wee, BNP Paribas:</span> I am heartened to hear that the corporates are quite empathetic about the challenges we have. But I hope also we have brought home that uppermost in our mind is still the strong commitment to the client journey and to delivering a genuine value proposition to you.</p>
<p>Central to this is the commitment to co-work with all stakeholders. Against the backdrop of digital transformation and evolving customer expectations, financial institutions need to collaborate more closely than ever with each other, regulators and disruptors.</p>
<p>At the same time, what is needed is full commitment to balancing digitalisation with robust risk management and importantly, a people-centred, relationship-based approach to supporting our clients – the human touch remains key.</p>


<p><span>Mark Evans, ANZ:</span> It has been very insightful, so thank you for your candid comments. A few things that really stick out are that banks have an important role to play now and into the future, but we should stick to what we’re good at, and then work with others that can complement what we bring to you as the corporate, rather than think that we can solve all these things ourselves.</p>
<p>That is what you are looking for: a bank that gives a true relationship, not fair-weather bankers and not product push. You are after solutions and insights that add value to you, not just things that are of interest to us.</p>
<p>Most importantly, whatever we do, we must simplify ourselves, so you know who to go to and who can get you the answer to the question. You do not need an answer immediately, although there are time-critical moments, but you need to have confidence that the person you go to is your advocate within the bank and can find the answer.</p>


<p><span>Rajesh Mehta, Citi:</span> I would boil it down to just one thing, and that is that the biggest opportunities and the biggest challenges that the corporates have today cannot be resolved in any one place or by any one institution. The possibility of obtaining quick wins from low-hanging fruit no longer exists. The biggest value comes from working together and thinking differently about how to address old problems and drive the whole industry forward.</p>

","Over the past decade, treasury management in Asia Pacific has undergone an evolution as the role has become more strategic and more closely aligned with the business. With a variety of forces creating a host of new opportunities and challenges for treasury teams we wanted to discover what the future will look like. To do this, Treasury Today Group brought together six of the region’s most senior corporate treasurers and transaction bankers to discuss the big trends in corporate treasury at the 2017 Talking Treasury Forum in Singapore.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regional-focus/asia-pacific/ttf-cover-1920x1080.jpg,2018-01-01,Asia Pacific,False

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The AEC effectively spells the free movement of goods, services, skilled labour and investment – and our clients have been responding with gusto. It has triggered regional homogeny in trade and investment. The implementation of the Prioritised Key Deliverables under the Phnom Penh Agenda has resulted in tariff elimination on exports of ASEAN-originating products and the elimination of trade barriers between member states.</p>
<p>Intra-ASEAN investment is outpacing investment from Europe and Japan at US$22bn as of 2015, amounting to almost 20% of all FDI. At the same time, ASEAN GDP is set to more than triple by 2030, ranking it the world’s 3rd largest economy.</p>
<p>We are seeing increasing interest from corporates investing in markets like Vietnam and Cambodia. Despite the uncertainty in the ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Vietnam and Cambodia will continue to be attractive to manufacturers, especially with China’s operational costs becoming increasingly expensive.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, ASEAN presents glittering prizes for corporates; however, traversing the complex financial regulations and conditions does pose challenges.</p>
<p>Firstly, while national clearing infrastructure within ASEAN is fast developing – including Myanmar and Cambodia developing real-time gross settlement system, and Singapore and Malaysia having already established real-time low value settlement with FAST and FPX – cash and paper instruments are still commonly used in developing markets like Indonesia and Vietnam. Effectively, this means that many companies paying wages in developing markets are handing out cash.</p>
<p>There is a digital financial inclusion agenda under the ASEAN Connectivity Masterplan 2025, but it will take some time before we have a homogenous pan-ASEAN payment system like the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).</p>
<p>Secondly, foreign exchange regulations can pose roadblocks. Within ASEAN, treasurers need to contend with ten different currencies and its different exchange control regulations. A number of the currencies are non-tradable outside of their home market, and banks are required to ensure that corporates provide supporting documentation with purpose of payments for all foreign exchange transactions.</p>
<p>This restricts the free movement of cash and limits the use of liquidity management solutions to utilise excess trapped cash. For example, in Vietnam, the basic task of taking surplus liquidity out of the market could be hampered at a time when US dollar liquidity is limited, as businesses need to convert their Vietnamese dong to US dollar.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is no single regional or international bank that fully covers all ten ASEAN countries. Treasurers will probably need to use a number of banks to support the corporate cash management needs in ASEAN. Local banks may not provide SWIFT capabilities for account statement reporting or payments. Hence, certain business data might be missed out, limiting the overall visibility of cash and increasing the difficulty in managing working capital efficiently.</p>

<p>With recent geo-political events (Brexit, USA election results), protectionism is clearly here to stay. However, selected regional organisations like ASEAN have been making steady progress since their foundation in 1967. 2015 was a key milestone for ASEAN with the formal establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC).</p>
<p>The region has now been transformed into a dynamic and creative platform for trade and commerce. ASEAN economy as well as population is now the 3rd largest in the world, with more than 50% of the population under 30 years old.</p>
<p>The single market is one of the core pillars of AEC, efforts of which are clearly visible in at least two areas. First is the aviation industry with implementation of the ASEAN open skies policy. The second area where significant advancements are visible is the financial services industry. AEC aims for gradual removal of restrictions for ASEAN financial institutions (banks and insurance companies) allowing them to provide services across member countries with a simplified operating framework.</p>
<p>Given market demographics, AEC framework creates significant potential for insurance companies. A well-developed, open and integrated insurance sector signifies competitive markets with greater quality and lower-cost services for the customers to choose from, particularly for catastrophe insurance which is relevant in many ASEAN markets.</p>
<p>With a significant rise in intra-regional, as well as external partner trade, AEC has also created significant opportunities for improved treasury and liquidity management. Cash centralisation in a treasury centre has always been a key objective for corporate treasurers. Of equal importance to insurance companies is the efficient management of its cash, including in the investment process. Whilst Singapore has been the pioneer for establishing treasury centres with open capital flows and FX policies, others such as Malaysia and Thailand are now pursuing similar policy reforms. Not every country in the region might be in a position to become a financial centre, but some are offering substantial incentives for setting up treasury centres in their home market. However, the ASEAN region is still hampered by a diverse set of regulations which inhibit the transfer of funds across markets. In fact, most markets still do not allow local currency to be held offshore which severely limits the ability for liquidity management structures.</p>
<p>Following the EU experience, without a stronger agenda on currency and regulatory co-operation and implementation of liberal policies, the ASEAN integration agenda will likely be overridden by complex processes and tedious execution.</p>

<p>Almost a year after its formal establishment, there have been considerable and steady advances in applying key measures of the AEC Blueprint for economic integration, especially in the elimination of inter-regional tariffs. Unfortunately, there have been fewer tangible achievements around more challenging hurdles, particularly towards financial markets integration. The AEC still needs to strive for a more consistent set of operating rules across the region’s markets in areas such as standards harmonisation, compliance, liberalisation of foreign investment, intellectual property and labour mobility.</p>
<p>To promote more active penetration of the ASEAN financial markets by regional banks, the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF) was introduced to progressively remove restrictions to the provision of financial services by ASEAN financial service suppliers, and engender transparent supervision of Qualified ASEAN Banks (QABs) with single passports to operate in any ASEAN country.</p>
<p>However, the reality is that financial market and regulatory reforms have not lived up to the rhetoric.</p>
<p>This is not surprising given the differences in maturity of the financial systems of member nations. The nascent systems of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV) are ill-equipped to compete against the international standing of financial markets in neighbours like Singapore. These gaps also inevitably lead to some countries demanding more protectionism and time to develop and reform, resulting in different legal codes blocking major foreign participation and creating hurdles for financial integration. This is further exacerbated by ongoing global economic volatility and falling commodity prices that have made governments more defensive in protecting currencies and delaying foreign exchange liberalisation.</p>
<p>And while the freedom of capital to move across borders would bring about an increase in both out- and inbound FDIs and expand funding opportunities for corporates in emerging markets, ASEAN member states recognise that rapid capital account liberalisation could risk excess flows of capital. As such, restrictions around capital inflows and outflows between member countries remain to safeguard against potential macro instability and systemic risks.</p>
<p>Competition, rather than integration, also appears to resonate around certain aspects of corporate treasury. One such instance is the establishment of a shared regional treasury centre for MNCs that are expanding across borders and expecting to benefit from efficiencies with a singular ASEAN market. While Singapore is the premier regional treasury centre and should logically be promoted as ASEAN’s corporate treasury hub, a number of other countries such as Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines are competing to host regional treasury operations. This then delays the development of a primary ASEAN shared treasury centre if corporates are being encouraged by regulators to locate regional treasuries in different countries on different legal frameworks.</p>
<p>On the flipside, integration of AEC in an environment with global financial uncertainty and an incremental rate environment could be a boon. We are witnessing some treasurers already shifting from the US dollar to local bond markets as an alternative to bank financing for corporate expansion, bolstering cross-border flows and contributing to the maturity of regional bond markets. Additionally, challenging market conditions are compelling treasurers to transform businesses to differentiate against competition. Talent management is a key focus and greater ASEAN mobility can help smaller organisations find specialised treasury, cash, liquidity and risk management skills.</p>
<p>With government bodies attempting to protect domestic interest, full integration may not materialise for years as they focus first on national rather than regional market developments. Nonetheless, for corporates and banks to truly benefit, momentum for financial integration has to accelerate.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Last year was characterised by dramatic world events and considerable uncertainty – and these themes could continue to dominate the treasurer’s agenda in 2017. From political events to plugging the trade finance gap, what will treasurers be focusing on in the coming 12 months?</em></p>
<p>It’s fair to say that 2016 was something of a rollercoaster ride for treasurers around the world. As such, when asked to predict what shape 2017 will take, the word that first springs to mind is uncertainty. The events of 2016 will certainly lead to an adjustment for many in the year ahead. Treasurers will be keen to understand the impact of last year’s political and other developments, while monitoring new events with renewed caution.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the core priorities of corporate treasurers are the same as they have always been. A recent survey by Ovum found that treasurers’ priorities in 2017 included managing liquidity (a priority for 50% of respondents), cash visibility (27%), managing FX and credit risk (39% and 31% respectively) and data analysis to improve decision making (36%).</p>
<p>While the repercussions of recent and upcoming world events will loom large in the coming year, treasurers will continue to focus on the fundamental components of the job – and to ask how developments in technology can support them in increasing efficiency, reducing costs and making effective decisions.</p>
<h3 id=""changing-political-landscape"">Changing political landscape</h3>
<p>Where politics is concerned, the last year has been nothing if not surprising. On June 23rd, the world was shocked by the UK’s decision to exit the European Union. More was to follow with Donald Trump’s election victory in November, as well as the resignation of Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi in December, following the resounding defeat of his referendum on constitutional reforms. Following this wave of political upheaval, treasurers around the world will be watching events closely in 2017 – particularly the upcoming elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“With the geopolitical changes that are happening, we see that trade agreements that are being proposed will have an important impact on what 2017 – and beyond – is going to look like,” says Venkatesh Somanathan, Global Head, Supplier Finance Solutions at Deutsche Bank. “We are living in a period of slower economic growth, with some headwinds on the horizon, which means that some of these trade agreements may take some time to batten down. There may be a recalibration or a pivoting of some of these countries into different blocs of agreements.”</p>
<h4 id=""interest-rates"">Interest rates</h4>
<p>Recent political events have the potential to impact treasurers in a number of different ways. Speaking after the US election, Daniel Jefferies, Group Treasurer of Equiniti Group, said he will be watching the rates environment closely in 2017, particularly in light of Brexit and uncertainty in other economies around the world. “About six weeks ago, before the US election, we were looking at the scenario where base rate was looking to be bumping along the bottom at a few basis points out to 2020 and beyond,” he explained. “But even in the last six weeks, we’ve seen that rate kind of flatten out, and there’s more speculation now about rates potentially going up rather than down.”</p>
<p>Rick Martin, Group Treasurer at GasLog, is similarly interested in the impact of political events on interest rates in the coming year. “My prediction is that President Trump is going to do a ‘Nixon to China’ on domestic policy,” he says. “Meaning? Just like it could only be an ardent anti-communist like Nixon to welcome China back to the family of nations, it will take a Republican president to push through Congress the sort of fiscal stimulus that President Obama could only dream of. And with that, US rates head up, even a bit more than they already have.”</p>
<p>Any such developments in interest rates would be of considerable interest to corporate treasurers. “In the US, with rising interest rates, treasurers will be looking at their cost of funds and when is the right time to tap the market for funding, from banks or through bonds,” notes Matt Tuck, Head of Global Transaction Banking at Barclays Corporate Banking. “The as yet unknown impact of Trump is also hampering clear decision making.”</p>
<p>In Europe, meanwhile, Tuck says that investment decisions are becoming harder to make in light of forthcoming elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands, alongside the impact of the UK’s approach to Brexit on the wider economy and trade flows. “Whilst low interest rates in Europe seem to be here for the foreseeable future, the volatility created by unknown political outcomes will be weighing on treasurers’ minds, with continued uncertainty around FX post-Brexit,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""funding"">Funding</h4>
<p>The changing political environment may also affect companies’ funding decisions. While different companies have different priorities, Tuck says that a common theme has been to renew banking credit facilities early – in some cases very early – in order to lock in funding/backup at favourable margins and attractive structures.</p>
<p>“Issuing debt in the capital markets will also be at the forefront of treasurers’ minds; despite higher USD rates, long-term debt is still historically very cheap,” he says. “Treasurers are also very interested in new digital applications to improve processes and automation of cash management and trade. Part of this has been driven by some organisations employing smaller treasury staffs, with treasurers (like professionals in many industries) trying to do more with less.”</p>




<h3 id=""the-treasurers-view"">The treasurer’s view</h3>
<p>An Asia-based treasurer identified the following topics as areas of concern in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Europe.</h5>
<p>“Europe has several elections which have the potential to cause significant disruption to Europe and the euro,” the treasurer said. “What impact would Marine Le Pen have as French president? What if the Netherlands votes for the anti-EU candidate? What about Germany?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Hedging.</h5>
<p>The treasurer pointed out that there are many risks to hedge in the current environment – a task which may be made more challenging as a result of the move towards central clearing, as well as the higher costs and reduced availability of risk management tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Funding.</h5>
<p>In this environment, ensuring an adequate supply of funding will be key – a task that may present some challenges due to regulatory changes which make lending too expensive for banks. The treasurer also noted that “the rising interest rate environment (if, indeed, that is the consequence of Mr Trump’s election) will make bond financing more expensive and scarcer.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Market turbulence.</h5>
<p>The treasurer commented, “With all the changes in the markets due to regulations, we are likely to see more cases of markets failing. The sterling flash crash a few weeks ago was potentially the first sign of a – potentially worrying – trend. If, in fact, it was caused by banks withdrawing liquidity from the FX market and being replaced by hedge funds as providers of liquidity, then we can expect more cases of markets ceasing to function as algo traders dominate and abandon markets at the first sign of stress.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cash management.</h5>
<p>The treasurer also noted that cash management may have to be rethought. “The prospect of being charged for the privilege of leaving our cash with a bank changes one of the most fundamental parameters of cash management. The potential death of tools such as notional pooling does not help. At the same time, however, fintech may finally deliver alternative ways of paying suppliers and moving cash.”</p>

<h4 id=""managing-political-risk"">Managing political risk</h4>
<p>After the events of 2016, treasurers will be unlikely to make any assumptions about the outcome of upcoming elections and other political events. Nevertheless, predicting and mitigating political risk is a considerable challenge.</p>
<p>Paul Taylor, Managing Director, Regional Sales Head, GTS EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, points out that companies have different levels of exposure. “Multinationals with a broad exposure across multiple national, legal and tax jurisdictions have been reviewing their banking arrangements,” he says. “They are probably less keen on dealing with large numbers of counterparties now, because that’s more risk to manage. So they are looking at consolidating banking providers. They want very certain statements from their providers that those banks still plan to be there, and that they have a strategy in place to cover any sort of dramatic political challenge.”</p>
<h3 id=""supporting-trade"">Supporting trade</h3>
<p>The trade finance gap is likely to be an important consideration this year: the Asian Development Bank (ADB’s) 2016 Trade Finance Gaps Survey identified a trade finance gap of $692bn in developing Asia, including India and China.</p>
<p>Somanathan points out that this gap slows down trade growth. “You can attribute this to various things – the commodity cycle is one, but we also see that regulatory expectations applying to financial institutions increasingly require them to do a lot more in order to continue to do trade finance.</p>
<p>“While some banks address this by investing in technology and people, some others find it easier to limit their presence. Rather than being present in more countries, they find it profitable to get back to their home markets and focus on a smaller number of countries. This kind of response could further accentuate the problems which are slowing down trade growth.”</p>
<p>As such, Somanathan says that 2017 could be a crucial year in seeing how these trends play out. “The supply of trade finance to support trade might be something that we need to watch out for during 2017 – how it pans out, and how the market players are responding to these changes, will determine how we come out of this downward cycle.”</p>
<h3 id=""automation-security-and-technology"">Automation, security and technology</h3>
<p>Mark Smith, Global Head of Liquidity Management Services at Citi, says that investing in automation and security will be another priority for treasurers in 2017 – not only as a means of achieving efficiency gains, but also to increase the security of treasury operations. Last year’s high profile cyber-attacks have not gone unnoticed by treasurers, and many will be putting measures in place to minimise the risk of similar attacks on their own businesses.</p>
<p>“Automating manual processes brings a number of different benefits,” says Smith. “These include reducing errors and achieving a consistency of approach, as well as greater security compared to manual intervention. Automation also frees up different members of the corporate treasury team to focus on other areas, such as risk management and regulatory change.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, treasurers will be monitoring developments in technology and gauging which opportunities can be leveraged. “There is major awareness of disruptors such as fintech and blockchain, and appetite to learn more, but resource and funding is limited,” says Mitko Iankov, Head of Market Development – GTM Europe, Thomson Reuters. “We expect corporates to embrace big data in a much more comprehensive manner, by tagging and organising internal data, sourcing data externally to complete the picture, and by recruiting data scientists that can help take the corporate to the next stage of their digital evolution (Industrial 4.0).”</p>
<h3 id=""other-areas-to-watch"">Other areas to watch</h3>
<p>Aside from the changing political landscape and developments in technology, the following trends and topics are also likely to be significant in 2017:</p>
<h5>Regulatory change</h5>
<p>In keeping with the last few years, regulatory change continues to be a major area of focus – and this is set to continue in the coming 12 months. “One key theme for 2017 is managing regulatory change – and within that, tax changes,” comments Smith.</p>
<p>“This includes changes such as BEPS, the anti-tax avoidance directive and Brexit, as well as potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) following the election of Donald Trump in the US. It also includes regulatory changes around capital controls, including changing capital restrictions in China.”</p>
<h5>Relationships</h5>
<p>Jefferies says that in the current low rate environment, both banks and corporates are looking to get the most out of their relationships. “Certainly that’s what we do as well. We’re trying to align ourselves to the way that the banks are operating in order to develop the deepest relationships we can in areas such as operational efficiency, rates environment and foreign exchange.”</p>
<h5>Role of the treasurer</h5>
<p>According to Smith, treasurers are continuing to be more engaged in driving business decisions on topics such as how and where best to set up working capital frameworks and liquidity pools. “I certainly sense there is more engagement at a very early stage of setting up a growing business,” he says. “The treasurer, in many cases, is one of the first people sitting around the table and talking about the foundation in setting up the business, which is an exciting place for treasurers to be.”</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>While the core priorities of treasurers continue to be on managing cash, liquidity and risk effectively, the events of 2016 mean that treasurers are likely to be entering January with a greater sense of caution about the coming year. If treasurers took just one message from last year, it would be to expect the unexpected.</p>
<p>As Smith concludes, “There is an element of continuation in many of these themes. A number of new risks have come up over the last year, prompting companies to make sure that day-to-day activities are as automated as possible, and that their processes, controls and governance are fully bedded down. As different focus areas come along in 2017, it will be up to treasurers to make sure they are best placed to handle these.”</p>




<h3 id=""2017-whats-on-the-agenda"">2017: what’s on the agenda?</h3>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch has noticed five broad themes emerging from their client discussions around the world. Here, Paul Taylor, Managing Director, Regional Sales Head, GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch summarises what these are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Back to business.</h5>
<p>I feel that for many corporate treasurers, the last few years have been about regulation, responding to change and addressing financial risk. A lot of people are saying that they have realised this is the new reality: the world is constantly changing, and the changes can be quite dramatic, as we’ve seen this year. But they are realising that they can’t live in obeyance of that and are focusing on new projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Staying alive.</h5>
<p>Treasurers want to make sure they are managing compliance risk, political risk, regulatory risk, technology risk and counterparty risk. For example, they have seen several of their banking counterparties exit markets, products and clients this year. As such, they want to ensure that their banks will still exist – and that they will still want to continue serving them as clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increasing efficiency and reducing cost.</h5>
<p>In the last few years, we’ve seen a lot of treasuries centralising and adopting payment factories, shared service centres and in-house banks. We’ve people looking at the working capital cycle and figuring out how their companies can become more efficient. We’ve also seen more use of solutions such as e-procurement, virtual account management and supply chain finance. These are rapidly becoming core solutions, and increasingly, treasurers are proactive about using them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Supporting growth.</h5>
<p>With companies getting back to business, we have seen a big pick up in the M&amp;A cycle in 2016. We’ve had a lot of conversations in the pre- and post-M&amp;A integration space around treasury, with companies which are looking at acquisitions asking how they can get the maximum benefit from that integration.</p>
<p>At the same time, companies are moving into new markets and are dealing with increasingly global client bases. As such, they want a treasury set up which is geared towards easy market entry and easy treasury integration. This is an element of the treasurer’s life which might have seemed somewhat exotic five or ten years ago, but which is now very much part of the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Predicting the future.</h5>
<p>Treasurers are deluged with buzz terms such as fintech, blockchain, bitcoin and dematerialisation. But they are concerned about investing too early because, as yet, there is no interoperability between these solutions and no industry standard. They don’t want to back Betamax in a world of VHS; and on the other hand, they don’t want to miss out completely when others may be benefitting. The challenge is to be able to predict the future, and we find many clients coming to us for our insights, for validation, and, increasingly, to adopt or pilot those solutions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>The easiest place in the world to start a business and the second best generally to conduct business, New Zealand sure sounds like somewhere corporates should take note of. What it lacks in the size of market, it sure makes up for in growth opportunities, stability and transparency.</em></p>
<p>The country may have been the backdrop to many of the Lord of the Rings’ most dramatic landscapes, but the reality of doing business in New Zealand is no fantasy. The country repeatedly receives praise from various industry bodies for its ease of doing business (second globally, World Bank Group’s Doing Business Guide 2015), free economy (third freest globally 2015 Index of Economic Freedom) and lack of corruption (fourth least corrupt, Transparency International’s 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index).</p>
<p>Indeed, the country’s open economy is in its seventh year of expansion and looks set to carry this momentum throughout 2016 and beyond. ANZ forecast growth of 2.8%, 2.5%, and 2.6% for this year and the following two respectively. As Mark Butcher, Chief Executive at New Zealand Local Government Funding Agency, says: “Most countries around the world would love to have the low inflation, 3% forecast economic growth, a government in fiscal surplus and historically low interest rates that corporates in New Zealand enjoy.”</p>
<p>The country’s domestic credit ratings as of this year from Moody’s (AAA), Standard and Poor’s (AA+) and Fitch Ratings (AA+) all have a stable outlook and corporate balance sheets are in reasonably good health, Butcher adds. As such, international interest has been growing in recent years. The amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) in New Zealand has almost doubled since 2001 from NZ$55bn to NZ$100bn in March 2015, according to the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research’s Foreign Direct Investment in New Zealand report.</p>
<p>But, due to the fact that New Zealand is relatively small in the global context, the question for investors is “whether they want to spend the time getting involved in this part of the world when there are some major problems drawing attention throughout the rest of the world”, says Butcher. “Nevertheless, it is a well-managed economy and there are opportunities for investors.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-proven-track-record"">A proven track record</h3>
<p>For those who demonstrate willing though, what welcomes them is a stable opportunity with a proven track record. Although the current volatility in global financial markets, in addition to posing a threat to the country, is a reminder of how quickly sentiment can change, New Zealand has demonstrated its resilience to shock and aptness for endurance.</p>
<p>Since the global financial crisis (GFC), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand says a “partial” list of the threats faced includes: the tightening in global liquidity in the immediate aftermath of the GFC; the Canterbury earthquakes; 2012/13 drought; terms of trade that have fallen considerably from a 40 year high; the 70% peak to trough movement in dairy prices; the 75% fall in oil prices; record net migration and labour force participation; sizeable movements in the real exchange rate and annual house price inflation in Auckland that reached 27%.</p>
<p>Overall, the economy has come out the other side of all these exposures reasonably well. As such, it comes as little surprise that New Zealand is often hailed as one of the world’s top safe-haven economies.</p>
<p>And this track record is something which the country may need to rely on in the future, in order to bring further success. Several surveys have indicated varied outlooks for New Zealand, dependent on the sector and region. The agricultural sector, particularly dairy exports, for example, is extremely susceptible to external conditions such as deteriorating trade and therefore has faced headwinds in recent months, a consequence of which is a drop in business sentiment. For example, in Southland, a region with many dairy farms, 38% of consumers had a negative perspective towards the economic outlook in H215. Construction in urban areas, on the other hand, has seen widespread growth; this is mainly due to the major pipeline of construction work, particularly in Canterbury and Auckland.</p>
<h3 id=""ample-opportunity"">Ample opportunity</h3>
<p>Of course, New Zealand is renowned for its agriculture, but there are also opportunities in other fields. Information and communications technology, tourism, film and special effects production, biotechnology, agricultural research, and wood-based technology, for instance, reports New Zealand Now, an online government guide to immigration.</p>
<p>“New Zealand is moving towards a more balanced economy, away from a large reliance on agriculture. At the moment, there is a strong domestic demand – particularly through construction. Tourism continues to grow too, and there is a desire by government to drive high-value service industries such as software design,” says Todd Voice, Treasurer, Holcim Australia &amp; New Zealand.</p>
<p>Indeed, the country has demonstrated innovative spirit. Entrepreneurs are in abundance; the country’s top 100 high technology companies contributed NZ$9bn to the economy in 2015, with record growth of NZ$609m (up 7.3%), according to a Technology Investment Network report. New Zealand’s collaborative research and development (R&amp;D) environment is backed by a government that actively supports science and innovation as one of the core pillars of its formal Business Growth Agenda.</p>
<p>The government also actively encourages foreign investment as there is a light-touch approach to regulation (consent is only required for a limited number of investments, including assets of more than NZ$100m). Certain growth industries – like the film industry – are also supported with incentives and tax credits.</p>
<p>In general, New Zealand’s overall tax system is also supportive for corporates. In 2014, the US-based Tax Foundation ranks it as second in the developed world for its competitiveness, partly in recognition of the 2010/11 budget, reducing its corporate income tax rate to 28%, down from 30%. The thin capitalisation rules for foreign-controlled or owned companies are worth bearing in mind, though. As Voice explains: “There is a maximum level of debt to asset ratio that has to be complied with. If a corporate doesn’t comply, the interest on any debt in excess of that ratio is not deductible for tax purposes.”</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-environment"">Treasury environment</h3>
<p>In terms of managing any such controls, treasury teams in New Zealand are without a doubt hard-working. According to PwC’s New Zealand treasury management survey 2015 many organisations (83%), particularly in the small and medium-sized categories, have one or less full-time equivalent treasury staff member. The report notes that this finding came as “somewhat of a surprise” given the increased emphasis on risk management following the global financial crisis, but offers one possible explanation. A “unique treasury advisory and outsourcing services environment”, PwC says, exists in New Zealand where specialist external advisors and treasury outsourcing functions are available to fill any void in talent.</p>
<p>Other findings further suggest some perhaps unique treasury behaviour in the country. A significant portion (66%) of respondents have a single banking partner and, what’s perhaps more revealing, are comfortable with this position (91% see this arrangement remaining unchanged). In addition, 78% of respondents are still using spreadsheets as their treasury management recording and reporting tool. Thirteen percent use a TMS, and 11% use a system provided by a treasury outsourcing service provider.</p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules in terms of the number of banks corporates use nor their technology preferences, however. And Voice presents a somewhat different picture. “Whilst it is largely basic cash management techniques that are used – cash pooling, offset sweeps and supply chain finance, for example – most corporates are of a smaller size, so tend to keep it simple because the cost benefits of more complex structures don’t always stack up,” he says.</p>


<blockquote>New Zealand is moving towards a more balanced economy, away from a large reliance on agriculture. At the moment, there is a strong domestic demand – particularly through construction. Tourism continues to grow too, and there is a desire by government to drive high-value service industries such as software design.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Butcher concurs: “The average New Zealand corporate is typically New Zealand-owned or owned by an Australian entity or possibly a multinational. New Zealand isn’t the home base for many companies with large numbers of foreign subsidiaries, so there isn’t a lot of complex cash management that takes place.”</p>
<p>“Corporate treasury as a profession and discipline in New Zealand is very mature, though,” says Voice. Most medium to large corporates recognise the value that can be added by a good treasury function. Owing to the fact that the country is both an exporter and importer and exposed to exchange rate risk, even the smaller companies, Voice says, will require some level of treasury services. “It’s just that as a general rule, because the size of the corporates tends to be smaller, the treasury teams will be smaller. The activities could even be carried out as a combined role – by the financial controller, for example,” says Voice.</p>
<p>The size of the country can also impact expected salaries, as Voice explains they are typically lower than can be expected in high-demand places like London (<a href=""#table-1"">see table 1 for a guide</a>).</p>

<h4 id=""all-the-best-things-come-in-small-packages"">All the best things come in small packages</h4>
<p>The country’s small size isn’t much of a problem, however. New Zealand enjoys proximity to Asia’s biggest economies and currently has free trade agreements in place with: China, Australia, Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia, Brunei, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Singapore and Chile. In particular, New Zealand over the years has been boosting symmetry between financial markets, tax policy and the broader regulatory environment with its closest neighbour, Australia, to assist businesses operating across the two countries.</p>
<p>To put the country’s size into context, Butcher says, “New Zealand is an open economy and relatively small in size on a global scale. But the financial markets are actually mature and deep, relative to their size. The corporates and domestic markets here are very well-serviced”.</p>
<p>The capital markets “really punch above their weight”, he says, particularly when it comes to the debt capital markets. “You can get good volume transacted in terms of your debt issuance. It is also a really cheap place to borrow because while we’ve still got relatively high nominal and real yields we have tighter credit spreads relative to other markets.” This has resulted in New Zealand achieving a record year of corporate bond issuance for every year for the last four, he says. “The actual tenor of corporate bond or corporate debt issuance has moved longer as well.”</p>
<p>In terms of the banking sector, there are the four Australasian majors (ANZ, Bank of New Zealand, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank of Australia), a small number of Chinese and Japanese banks and two major international banks, HSBC and Citi. “This has shrunk considerably in the last 15 to 20 years,” notes Butcher. The domestic banks are full-service banks with all treasury products, but often have joint venture arrangements with some of the global banks to provide offshore services to corporate clients.</p>
<p>The presence of Japanese and Chinese banks is relatively new. “They tend to focus on trade finance, providing access to global networks and cross-border banking platforms,” he adds. “Some of them are mainly here to service their offshore domiciled clients back in their own jurisdictions and participate in domestic activity, but it is a bit selective.”</p>
<h3 id=""in-the-know"">In the know</h3>
<p>Treasurers in New Zealand certainly don’t have the luxury of being selective though, especially when it comes to up-to-date knowledge about what is going on in the global economy. Proximity to Asia, the country’s open economy and the fact it is very export-driven (exports account for around 30% of GDP), doesn’t come without issue. The country is exposed and vulnerable to changes elsewhere. A persistent slowdown in China, for example, is a concern for corporates. “Treasurers in New Zealand have to be very aware of events which unfold in other countries that can have a larger impact on the exchange rate, interest rate and commodity prices here than domestic factors do,” says Butcher.</p>
<p>This is, in fact, one of the biggest challenges in the country. “Keeping on top of everything, being across lots of different countries and markets and ensuring segregation of duties is difficult when, because of the small scale, treasury functions tend to be one or two staff. Everyone has to become generalists and keep an eye on everything,” he says.</p>
<p>Of course, this is something that the banks can help with. Working in the countries favour, however, is that it is relatively straightforward for corporates. “I would characterise New Zealand as a very easy place to do business,” says Voice, who also has experience working in Europe and Africa. “It’s also worth noting that New Zealand is internationally recognised as a place where you have a great lifestyle with access to numerous outdoor activities and an advantageous life/work balance.”</p>
<p>And quality of life is something which shouldn’t be overlooked. Nor is a country’s track record. Despite its exposure to the global economic climate, New Zealand weathered the GFC well, amongst other threats in recent years, and could be a place to take shelter in what looks set to be a stormy future. Contrary to the thought that major problems elsewhere in the world may draw attention away from the southwestern point in the Pacific Ocean that is home to New Zealand, these issues may actually draw corporates towards a country that is a rare stable offering.</p>

<h3 id=""asean-standing-at-the-crossroads"">ASEAN: standing at the crossroads</h3>
<p>Consisting of ten countries, ASEAN presents corporate opportunities and challenges in virtually equal measures. With almost 50 years of co-operation, primarily to sustain regional peace, the focus today is increasingly on economic development. When the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) was formed in 2015, one of its tenets was for the richest member nations to facilitate the growth of their emergent partners, eventually bringing all to par. But then ASEAN has always been about co-operation, says Melvyn Low, ASEAN Head and Singapore Country Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. “This has now become an officially stated aim.”</p>
<p>To expedite this desire, the trade development agenda, led by AEC, has two clear angles. The first is the development of intra-ASEAN trade. Much had been achieved pre-AEC so that today, most of the tariffs placed on the trade of goods, for example, have been removed. This has gone a long way towards driving intra-regional flow to its current figure of $2.4trn, explains Low.</p>
<p>The second angle of approach concerns the ASEAN’s relationship with the rest of the world. Again, the background work was already underway before AEC took up the mantle so that now free trade agreements (FTAs) have been negotiated with the likes of China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The next step for AEC, as Low sees it, is to create a broader reach across Asia, where current multiple bi-lateral agreements assume more of a regional trade bloc feel, this being executed under the auspices of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).</p>
<p>Two further items on the trade agenda are worthy of mention here, says Low. The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), an FTA between the US and 11 other countries including ASEAN members, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia. TPP’s survival is largely in the hands of the US electorate as the presidential candidates take differing views on its merit. The second item is the continued longer-term development of China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative which seeks to promote both land and sea-based connectivity and cooperation between the People’s Republic and an extended family of Asian and European nations. It encompasses a strong maritime and overland stretch across ASEAN, suggesting the development of a logistics infrastructure which, notes Low, “will help ASEAN become more connected to the rest of the world”.</p>
<p>As infrastructural and economic developments are enhanced, so too is capacity for ASEAN to play host to international corporates. MNCs are entering the region looking to boost their supply chains, manufacturing here and exporting onwards. But, Low notes, they are also motivated by the prospect of selling to a growing consumer market, itself driven by a burgeoning, 170 million-strong middle-income population.</p>
<p>Seizing opportunity is not often achieved without first meeting basic needs and, says Low, the lack of financial integration in ASEAN is a downside. ASEAN is characterised by different regulations, dislocated payments infrastructures and “vastly different” monetary policies. This will pose a challenge for corporate treasurers seeking to fund in-country investments and maintain cash flows. “The obvious first approach is to look for an ASEAN bank,” says Low. It must be able to operate in multiple markets and capable of supporting treasury needs on the ground.</p>
<p>In response to the clear need for domestic institutions with pan-regional capacity, ASEAN finance ministry representatives recently signed a new framework agreement laying the ground for the creation of Qualified ASEAN Bank (QAB) status. Open to all based in the region, the scheme allows domestic clients to expand cross-border in the company of a familiar partner.</p>
<p>However, the broader goal is to achieve deeper financial integration within ASEAN by 2025. This, says Low, will see the emergence of multi-national and global banks as key facilitators. Citi’s 100-year history in the region gives it a profound local knowledge of corporate and consumer requirements, enabling it to compete head-to-head with domestic players, helping incoming MNCs set up and establish operations.</p>
<p>But, he adds, Citi also has the power of its far-reaching branch and correspondent banking network, its single platform and a broad range of finance solutions to aid in-country, cross-border and, ultimately, global corporate trade. In addition, he says Citi is able to extend to clients, the advantages of its position as one of the region’s largest foreign bank tax payment agents.</p>
<p>ASEAN is on an upward curve, sustaining an average growth rate of 4.5%. Whilst other markets across Asia are strong competitors, Low states that ASEAN provides “a very welcoming environment in which to grow”. The traditional manufacture and export model is strong but fast-growing mobile and internet usage is placing ASEAN as “the next frontier for e-commerce”. Chinese giant, Alibaba’s recent $1bn takeover of ASEAN competitor, Lazada Group, speaks volumes about market expectation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the pace of development will quicken alarmingly, warns Low. This will open the floodgates for many more corporate opportunities. Treasurers operating in ASEAN need to be thinking and operating at “lightning speed”: for a foreign corporate, having the right global banking partner in place has never been more appropriate.</p>
<h3 id=""china-further-on-up-the-road"">China: further on up the road</h3>
<p>China is still going through changes. It has been aiming for the top spot as a trade nation for some time but what we see today is still a ‘work in progress’. The Peoples Bank of China (PBoC), alongside its foreign exchange regulatory agency, State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), continues to oversee internationalisation of the country’s currency and trading environment and it knows that to be the dominant global trading nation, its currency must be global too.</p>
<p>In recent times, RMB has gained significant ground. It is now easier to use for import/export transactions, enabling companies to bill in RMB for international trade. But, says Sandip Patil, Asia Pacific Head, Global Liquidity and Investments, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, it is important from a regulatory standpoint to promote RMB not only as a trade currency but also as a currency for investment and liquidity, and as a reserve currency, “so that it can attain true global status”.</p>
<p>It is making solid progress. Chinese authorities have, for example, created a number of experimental Free Trade Zones (FTZs) such as in Shanghai. These, notes Patil, give the full experience of free trade for all stakeholders and counterparties but also allow for rapid learning in a controlled environment. Such a move has gone a long way to making the international corporate community comfortable with trading in and out of China.</p>
<p>In a broader context, Patil observes many MNCs are keen to test China’s changing trade environment. They have started using RMB in their trade settlements and setting up RMB-denominated entities, using it as a working capital currency. Some have even set up netting centres, in-house banks and treasury centres.</p>
<p>“There has been a lot of successful experimentation,” comments Patil. “At Citi, we have many clients transacting on a daily basis, settling in China using sophisticated centralised treasury models.” These may be based in Singapore, Hong Kong or London, but their China business requirements, from a treasury, funding and FX perspective, are now being met. This, he declares, “is a dream come true”.</p>
<p>There are some key steps that will take this journey to the next waypoint though. Improving availability and access to both onshore and offshore liquidity is vital to make sure the markets remain stable. There is also a pressing need for deepening offshore markets – bond markets, in particular. “The deep, liquid onshore RMB market does not necessarily help foreign participation,” says Patil. An increase in the number of offshore players in the onshore market is desirable. A structure thus capable of providing significant liquidity will give corporates who want to use RMB “peace of mind”.</p>
<p>The offshore market exists because China’s capital account is not fully convertible. This means two versions of the same currency exist: official onshore yuan (CNY) and its offshore proxy, CNH. The payment exchange conversion rate is at par but differs when converting to another currency. This can create arbitrage and, for some, is unsettling. For Patil, co-mingling will limit disquiet.</p>
<p>Regulatory liberalisation is ongoing though and recent PBoC changes related to interest rates are a positive indicator. “As we see free market interest rates on both the liability and asset side, it will present a major boost to the money market infrastructure,” he notes. This will not only create further confidence amongst market participants but will also translate into more efficient products.</p>
<p>It is sometimes easy to forget that China is still an emerging market. Occasionally when exposed to such a risk, market jitters can shake corporate confidence. But look beyond this to China’s long-term sustained line of growth and a core strength that is “extremely positive” is seen. Furthermore, the anticipated changes in China will build upon current market confidence “taking RMB to the next level”.</p>
<p>When viewed in the context of a global slowdown, the strategic importance of China to many of Citi’s customers remains intact. Whilst the short-term ‘red flags’ consistent with operating in an emerging market must be managed, working capital management must remain in focus. In an effort to optimise funding and performance, he observes companies seeking to digitise cash flow cycles, deploying cash flow forecasting tools and improving their response to liquidity issues (in particular trapped cash). A move to cross-border lending, automated pooling in RMB, ‘on-behalf-of’ and netting structures, and offshore financing of mainland operations are also increasingly observable trends.</p>
<p>A number of international banks have, to a greater or lesser degree, the capacity to service corporate clients in this market. And whilst China has introduced the SWIFT-like Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) to tackle some of the fragmented offshore clearing seen today, Citi of course can boast an enviable clearing presence within China. But there is more to it than flexible technologies and a broad product set.</p>
<p>Indeed, given that the market is volatile and subject to many significant regulatory changes, there needs to be a connection between the client’s business on the ground and its strategic thinkers and key decision-makers. This comes from a well-developed advisory function. For Patil and Citi, having the depth of knowledge and understanding to help clients navigate and manage this growing space is what marks the difference between a functional bank and a global partner.</p>
<h3 id=""india-the-road-less-travelled"">India: the road less travelled</h3>
<p>In exercising a political and economic will to open up the country to trade, India is a country intent on fulfilling its potential. In the first phase of recent reforms, it sought to liberalise foreign direct investment (FDI) across multiple industries, and it swept out a lot of trade-related bureaucracy, bringing instead more clarity and predictability. It also kick-started a number of key infrastructure projects, tackled fiscal consolidation through strong discipline, and sought to bring the country’s current account deficit back into line.</p>
<p>As the second phase of reform swings into action, India is now focusing on driving forward the digital initiative. This, notes Debopama Sen, India Country Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, will have a direct impact on how corporates do business in and beyond the country. By building out the broadband and telecoms infrastructure, banking the unbanked and implementing the nationwide Aadhaar biometric ID programme, there is an opportunity to transform e-commerce and encourage growth within consumer facing industries and their supply chains.</p>
<p>The effects of reform are notable. In 2015, India was possibly the largest recipient of FDI globally with commitments of around $63bn, and annual growth of almost 30% between 2014 and 2016. Overall economic growth is 7.6%, expected to hit 7.8% by 2018.</p>
<p>Although in 2016 India is ranked 130 in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report, this has improved by 12 places since 2015. But the government target is to move into the top 50 in three years. Some major investments by large corporates have increased confidence in this respect – Foxconn’s May 2015 $10bn manufacturing plant for iPhones notable amongst these. Other household names coming on board include Amazon, Suzuki and Siemens. “There is optimism and faith in the measures being taken,” comments Sen.</p>
<p>It’s not all ‘green shoots’ though. Some of the challenges on the ground are still very much present. In the same World Bank report, India’s ranking for starting a business is 155; and ranking for resolving insolvency is 136. “The government however is resolute and the passing of an insolvency law earlier this year shows strong will”, notes Sen. In August too, after much debate, the Constitution Amendment Bill for Goods and Services Tax (GST) was passed. Once approved by 50% of the states, it will replace indirect taxes with a common approach. “For any corporate operating in multiple States – perhaps manufacturing in one and selling in another – it removes multiple points and different levels of taxation,” explains Sen. Economic research suggests GST will have a positive impact of between 1% to 2% of GDP.</p>
<p>Sen is keen to draw treasurers’ attention to the fact that the domestic Indian market is huge and consumer behaviour is rapidly changing. This has consequences. “In the last five years, from a small base of $4.4bn in 2010, we grew to a $22bn e-commerce market in 2015,” she notes. The expectation is that this will hit $100bn by 2020. The digital-savvy nature of the new Indian consumer is affecting purchasing and banking channels – and this is now reaching into business realms too. “The traditional distribution model of manufacturer to distributor to retailer to consumer is going through a transformation,” she explains. “Many consumer goods companies now want to reach end-consumers directly. Initially this was just to create awareness but now many of our clients are considering selling directly online.”</p>
<p>It is an approach that has necessarily forced new thinking on how corporate payments, cash collections and reconciliations are executed. If proof were needed, India’s 24/7 real-time inter-bank fund transfer mechanism, Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), launched in 2010, now clocks up around $3.5bn of small-value settlements per month and rising.</p>
<p>With ongoing legislative and regulatory reform, and changes in the consumer mindset and the digital infrastructure all coming together with great serendipity, treasurers must stay ahead of trends. This applies equally to both domestic and cross-border trade. Of the latter, there is a concerted government effort to drive up current export levels from $260bn today to $900bn by 2020. “This will primarily be achieved by looking at more trade partnerships across different countries, regions, and products,” says Sen.</p>
<p>These plans are ambitious and banking partners should be equipped to play their part. Their corporate clients need to stay abreast of domestic and global developments and be detailed on what these mean, and how they can be leveraged.</p>
<p>As part of its ethos of local involvement, Citi has a hands-on approach to delivery in this respect. It is, for example, at present partnering with the Indian Customs authorities and the Ministry of Finance on a major trade digitisation project. The administration has been “very receptive” to inputs from client workshops and research provided by Citi through its domestic and international corporate clients. It is this kind of two-way relationship, anchored by Citi’s long-term on-the-ground experience and knowledge, that Sen believes will prevail as India’s stock continues to rise.</p>


","When someone stops to look at a map they are seeking not only directions from where they are now but also the best possible route to their destination. For a country to gain such insight, it takes a skilled observer. Some of the best-positioned in this context are the bankers that serve the corporate community. The views represented here reflect this experience.",,2016-09-01,Asia Pacific,True

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In late 2015, Myanmar held its first election since a nominally civilian government came to power in 2011, ending over 50 years of military rule. The result was a historic victory for the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by the social democratic stateswoman and country’s most eminent political figure, Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>Long considered a pariah state while under the oppressive rule of the former military junta, Myanmar’s emerging political freedoms are mirrored by parallel reforms in the economic sphere. Both in political and economic terms, Myanmar is gradually ending half a century of isolation and central planning and becoming a more liberal country open to international investment. It is a trend which is set to open up a myriad of new opportunities for corporates in Asia, as well as a few challenges for their treasurers too.</p>
<h3 id=""a-new-era"">A new era</h3>
<p>Myanmar is one of the poorest and one of the most populous of the ten ASEAN member states. Yet the country, with its abundance of natural resources, including arable land, gold, timber, oil and natural gas, has much to offer growing international businesses.</p>
<p>The competitive advantages bestowed by these natural assets are strengthened by the fact that the country is now busy building industries almost entirely from scratch and, in addition, is seen as a gateway between Southeast Asia, China and India. No wonder foreign direct investment (FDI) rose to new heights during 2014-2015, as multinationals including Coca-Cola, Telenor, Colgate-Palmolive, and Mitsubishi laid bets on an emerging consumer boom. Overall, growth in Myanmar’s foreign investment has exceeded that of any other ASEAN country in recent years, albeit starting from a very small base.</p>
<p>Although the somewhat languid pace of political reform in the country has disappointed some commentators – last year’s historic election notwithstanding – progress is clearly being made on the economic front. The floatation of the kyat in April 2012 kicked off the country’s transformation in April 2012, followed shortly after by autonomy being granted to the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM). Certain regulations around banking procedures were relaxed in the wake of this development. Just recently, in March 2016, Myanmar’s first stock exchange, the Yangon Stock Exchange (YSX) officially opened its doors for trading, an event which Maung Maung Thein, head of Myanmar’s Securities and Exchange Commission, said, marked a “great day” for the country. “We can now proudly and mightily proclaim to the world that we are no longer a backward country,” he added in a speech to a crowd of business leaders.</p>
<p>The opening of YSX was but the latest development in a wave of economic changes that began under the presidency of the moderate reformist Thein Sein. These include new policies around anti-corruption, currency exchange, foreign investment laws and taxation. Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) formally began re-engaging with the country to finance the construction of new infrastructure and other development projects within the country.</p>
<h3 id=""banking-on-reform"">Banking on reform</h3>
<p>As of April 2015, Myanmar’s banking system comprised of four state banks, 22 private banks (nine of which are classified as semi government institutions), 42 representative offices of foreign banks and foreign finance companies.</p>
<p>Myanmar’s banking sector remains extremely underdeveloped and this naturally presents considerable challenges for the corporate treasurer. To begin with, the almost complete absence of modern banking infrastructure means the economy remains largely cash based. Transfers between businesses or individuals often require the physical movement of cash between branches of the same bank or branches of different lenders. Even something as simple as clearing a cheque requires a visit to the central bank, and verbal communication from the cheque writer’s bank that the person in question has sufficient funds in his or her account to honour the cheque. For treasurers used to banking in more developed parts of the world, this way of doing business can come as quite a culture shock.</p>
<p>“Right now there’s almost no interbank market in Myanmar,” says Wan Chun Shong, Treasurer at Malaysian automobile makers the Tan Chong Group, a firm which has been aggressively expanding into Myanmar since 2012. “It means moving money around is often very difficult. Even last week when I was visiting the country I saw people carrying sacks of cash between banks. Most financial transactions are still conducted on a cash basis – it is really quite amazing.”</p>
<p>But progress is being made on this issue, albeit gradually. The introduction of the CBM’s new clearing and settlement system, dubbed CBM-Net, in January 2016 has been described by pundits as a significant milestone in the country’s financial development, one which will make an “immense difference” to the day-to-day operations of banks. Under the new system, the central bank and Myanmar’s local and international banks are connected electronically, meaning instructions to debit or credit different accounts in different banks can be carried out instantly and automatically. Cheques can be cleared through a mechanised clearing house, which is connected to the CBM-Net system.</p>
<p>CBM’s long-awaited introduction is but the latest step taken towards establishing a more modern banking system. In 2014, the country began to allow a wider range of companies to operate in the country, awarding nine banking licences to foreign banks, including: ANZ, ICBC, Maybank and the Japanese mega banks. In March 2016, four more banks were granted licenses (Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, State Bank of India, Taiwan’s Sun Commercial Bank and South Korea’s Shinhan Bank) bringing to 13 the total number of foreign banks allowed to conduct business in the country.</p>
<p>“Allowing corporates like us to access the services of foreign banks is a very important development,” says Chun Shong. “We are now having conversations with our banking partners around access to various types of instruments such as letters of credit.”</p>
<p>The licences were somewhat limited in scope, allowing a bank to have just one foreign branch and only permitting activity with foreign corporates. Nevertheless, Asia’s corporate bankers feel the move could be instrumental in attracting greater investment from foreign corporates in the years to come.</p>
<p>“It removes one of the key barriers to entry,” Grant Knucey, former CEO Cambodia, Laos &amp; Myanmar at ANZ Banking Group told Treasury Today Asia shortly after the nine foreign bank licenses were awarded in 2014. “There is a real feeling among the corporate universe that without foreign banks in the market they will be unable to grow and execute their long-term strategies. I have no doubt that the extension of these licenses will encourage more companies to investment in Myanmar.”</p>
<p>Other industry experts agree with this assessment. There has been a significant wave of interest from foreign investors since 2010,” Abdul Malek Mohd Khair, Country Head at Maybank’s Yangong branch told Treasury Today Asia. “With the local banking sector remaining limited in its ability to fully serve the requirements of international companies, foreign banks are expected to play a more significant role, especially in the large scale project financing and foreign-related ventures. The dollar-based financing solutions from the foreign banks are one of the catalysts to the higher inflow of foreign investment into the country.” But the benefits do not stop at what foreign banks can offer corporates: there is also the impact on the local banking sector to consider. “The entry of foreign banks also brought about the sharing and transfer of best practices to the country,” he adds “especially to the local banks and Central Bank which will eventually level up the banking sector and bring about growth.”</p>
<h3 id=""inviting-investment"">Inviting investment</h3>
<p>Foreign investment already seems to be on an upward trajectory. The lifting of economic sanctions in 2013 began a flood of investment from foreign companies. In 2014, Myanmar received just over $4bn in FDI. By the end of the following fiscal year, that number had doubled to $8bn as foreign firms won oil and gas concessions and, reflecting the improving geopolitical environment, international hotel chains started moving in.</p>
<p>According to PwC’s Myanmar Business Guide, the sectors currently seeing most FDI include infrastructure (roads, power plants, telecommunications and logistics, in particular). After decades of underinvestment, infrastructure is a sector the current administration is very keen to encourage foreign companies to finance. As highlighted by a recent report by the Asian Development Bank, Myanmar’s underdeveloped transport infrastructure “provides poor access to markets and services” and “hampers business development”. “This means increasing transport investments to the equivalent of 3% to 4% of gross domestic product from little more than 1% in recent years,” says Peter Brimble, ADB Deputy Country Director in Myanmar. “Private sector resources will need to be mobilised given the immense funding requirements.”</p>
<p>Recent political developments should ensure the upsurge in FDI continues to pick up steam in the years ahead. “FDI is expected to get a lift from the successful political transition following national elections in November 2015, with investment flowing into newly established special economic zones and rapidly expanding transport, telecommunications and energy sectors,” ADB wrote in the report.</p>
<p>Talking to corporate treasurers working in Myanmar, however, one does get the sense that they feel the country is moving in the right direction. Much remains to be done, however, to reform an economy isolated for the best part of five decades. “We believe that outlook is promising,” says Chun Shong. “The business environment is still in a sort of preliminary stage of development, and so it remains very challenging. But Myanmar has only just begun to open up and liberalise, so there are a lot of things that we are expecting to change and to improve.”</p>
<h3 id=""treasurys-wish-list"">Treasury’s wish list</h3>
<p>What areas are treasurers most keen to see improvement in? What do they regard as being the biggest impediment to them executing their responsibilities at the present time?</p>
<p>“I think that one of the biggest constraints facing treasurers right now are the rules around US dollar transactions,” says Chun Shong. Although foreign companies operating in Myanmar have been permitted to transfer funds back out of Myanmar since the passing of the 2012 Foreign Exchange Management Law, bureaucratic obstacles remain in place for money being transferred in and out of the country. That means intercompany financing, relied upon by the Tan Chong Group in the absence of developed capital markets, can be especially onerous. “It is a challenge because when we are sorting USD funds for offshore out of Myanmar, approval is required from both the CBM and the Ministry of Commerce. Similarly, for my company here in Malaysia to lend into the company operating in Yangon in Myanmar, we have to get approval from the central bank because it involves capital restrictions.”</p>
<p>Keeping idle liquidity in Myanmar to a minimum is very important though, given the dearth of practicable short-term investment options in Myanmar at the present time. Besides short-term bank deposits there are no instruments, like money market funds, for instance, that treasurers are known to use in more developed markets. “If your trapped cash here is too big, you are going to have a problem,” Chun Shong observes.</p>
<p>With Myanmar opening its doors to international businesses, the regulatory environment around foreign exchange is developing quickly and sometimes changes – not always of a positive nature – are enacted at very short notice. Events late last year offer one such example of this. Fearing the destabilising economic effects of unchecked dollarisation, Myanmar’s CBM has recently attempted to curb the use of US dollars. In October 2015, just a few weeks before the country’s historic elections, the CBM announced the cancellation of foreign exchange licences to thousands of businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and airlines.</p>
<p>Naturally, such developments continue to make Myanmar a challenging place for corporates, and especially for those involved in managing the treasury operations. “At the end of the day, I need to do my job,” says Chun Shong. “Faced with all these constraints it can be very difficult for treasurers in Myanmar at the moment – you end up doing pretty much everything on a cash basis. So I would like to see trade liberalisation – to allow us to buy US dollars easily.”</p>
<p>But top of Chun Shong’s wish list of reforms is further improvements to financial infrastructure and the regulation of institutions that operate within it. “The authorities need to build a functioning interbank market, and they need to improve the regulation of the banks operating in the country,” he says.</p>
<p>Chun Shong knows that the prospects for seeing such changes largely rest on what happens in the political sphere. The economic reforms we have seen since 2011 are unlikely to have occurred without the political reform that ended both the country’s international isolation and five decades of military rule.</p>
<p>Today, further reform seems only likely to take place if the country continues its transition to democracy. If that happens “everything else should fall into place,” says Chun Shong. “There’s a new government in place now, and we are expecting things to get better.”</p>

<p><em>In recent years, China has taken great strides to reform its economy and liberalise the market and we are now arguably entering the final stages on this journey. In this article, a number of experts give their opinions on what they expect the future to hold for China both on a macro-level and also in terms of corporate treasury operations.</em></p>
<p>It was Chinese philosopher Laozi who said “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,” alluding to the fact that even the longest and most difficult ventures have to begin somewhere. For the Chinese economy this proverb has rung true in respect of its transition from a planned to a market orientated economy.</p>
<p>China took its first steps towards financial reform in the late 1970s through incremental economic reform that helped generate high growth, improve living standards and also eliminate supply shortages. Such was the success of these reforms that in 1993 China decided to abolish its planned economy altogether and fully chart a course towards a market driven economy.</p>
<p>The rest is history: China has become the world’s second largest economy, a manufacturing hub, a mega trader, and overall a country with substantial economic and political might. However, we are now arguably beginning to enter the last mile of China’s journey, and if the first step was tough, the last, if recent events are anything to go by, may be the toughest yet. And as China moves closer to the ‘new normal’, corporates, perhaps more than ever, need to keep a close eye on what is happening.</p>
<h3 id=""boom-or-bust"">Boom or bust?</h3>
<p>At the forefront of many business leaders’ minds may be the economic health of the country. Much has been made of the slowing GDP growth, volatility in the stock markets, the debt-to-GDP ratio, as well as a host of other performance metrics that seek to provide insight into the well-being of the Chinese economy. Yet, as Gordon Orr, Senior Advisor at McKinsey states in a recent article: “In debates about whether growth is a percentage point up or down, we often lose sight of the absolute scale of China’s economy.” And as Orr goes on to point out: “China’s economy is today made up of multiple sub-economies, each more than a trillion dollars in size. Some are booming, some declining. Some are globally competitive, others fit for the scrap heap. How you feel about China depends more than ever on the parts of the economy where you compete.”</p>
<p>That being said, overall GDP growth remains a key focus in discussions around China, perhaps because even half a percentage point shift accounts for such a huge number in real terms and creates ripples that extend beyond its borders. The news therefore that in Q415 China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in 25 years, at a rate of 6.8%, again brought up questions around if it is heading towards a hard landing.</p>
<p>For Kelvin Lau, Senior Economist at Standard Chartered, there is little need to worry about such an event primarily because, just as Orr alluded to, of the diversity of the economy. “Whilst we have seen a slowing in the GDP numbers, if you look at the month-by-month numbers we are beginning to see signs of it bottoming out,” explains Lau. “If you take this one step further and begin to look at the individual parts of the economy, then of course there are some aspects that are struggling, but on the other hand there are many that are starting to bottom-out, like services and retail.”</p>
<p>For Lau, this is to be expected and highlights the success that China is having in rebalancing the economy to one less reliant on areas such as investment, real-estate and manufacturing, to one driven by consumption and services. But China cannot be complacent, and to continue to strive towards its goals Lau argues that further policy easing is required. “This should be monetary easing in terms of reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cuts and on the fiscal side the government should look at tax cuts and fast tracking key infrastructure projects.” Overall his message is positive. “Over the next five years we expect to see China deliver 6.5% growth – enough to meet the ambitions to double the size of the economy outlined in 2010 – this is a long way away from a hard landing.”</p>
<p>That being said, this isn’t a view shared by all. For some the risk of a hard landing is still very real. “The risk has not diminished and is, in our view, increasing,” says Chris Leung, Executive Director Group Research at DBS. “The reason being that many structural problems, such as overcapacity and resource allocation, remain unresolved and are deepening.”</p>
<p>Despite this view, there is hope that this can be avoided. “There is an increasing popularity of supply side economics within the Chinese government,” explains Leung. “This shuns short-term demand-side stimulus. Rather, it emphasises tax reduction, deregulation, and innovation to sustain long-term economic growth. Although these steps are positive there is still plenty of work to be done. For instance, allowing non-performing loans to surface to enable the banking sector to function normally, allowing the exchange rate to shoulder some of the pressure, moving ahead with state owned enterprise (SOE) reforms and quicken service sector deregulation.”</p>
<p>Although many have accepted numerous aspects of China’s ‘new normal’ there may be less understanding that policy responses from the Chinese government are also changing. This change in thinking was encapsulated by the remarks made by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who in January stated that market forces will play a role in solving many of the structural issues in China, including leaving those businesses which are unable to compete to die out – a marked policy change from previous years where the government would typically intervene.</p>
<p>Overall, whether China is heading for a hard landing or not comes down to a matter of perspective, but what might be more important for corporates in the short term is adjusting to China’s change in macro management philosophy. “Those who don’t will be caught off guard,” stresses Leung.</p>
<h3 id=""the-road-to-reserve"">The road to reserve</h3>
<p>On 11<sup>th</sup> August last year, many market participants were caught by surprise by China’s sudden devaluation of the RMB – the biggest in two decades. The 1.9% downward move by the central bank sent shockwaves through financial markets and shone a spotlight on the Chinese economy, which some market commentators argued was perhaps weaker than the numbers let on.</p>
<p>Yet, despite recent bumps in the road, China’s strategy around its currency, and in particular its ambition of making the RMB globally recognised, can largely be seen as a success. Significant work has been done by the Chinese government to promote the currency and make it easier to use on and offshore. This includes the creation of RMB hubs in various countries around the world, improvements in infrastructure through the creation of CIPS, and regulatory relaxation, in particular the ability to pool and sweep the currency cross-border. The result according to Lum Yin Fong, Managing Director Global Transaction Services at DBS is a greater usage of RMB by corporates. “We have definitely seen an increase in the use of RMB as a payment currency and in trade,” she says. “In fact, recent SWIFT data shows that the RMB has surpassed the Japanes yen to be the fourth most used payment currency, it is also the second most used currency for trade transactions. Now with the recent announcement that RMB is being added to the SDR basket of currencies we expect an increase in RMB usage, not just in trade, but in other areas as well.”</p>
<p>It is not only China that has been on a journey in regards to the RMB. Corporates with operations in, and even outside the country, have also been closely tracking the currency’s rise. “When China first began to liberalise its economy the concept of using RMB as a functional currency sounded interesting to many of our clients, but for the most part few of these had any need to use the currency outside of China,” says Sridhar Kanthadai, Regional Head, Transaction Banking, Greater China &amp; North Asia at Standard Chartered. “Yet in recent years, more and more corporates have been asking us about the RMB and how it can be used and managed both on and offshore.”</p>
<p>Indeed, many of these conversations have been with Chinese corporates, for which the RMB is their natural currency. But, Kanthadai has also been having many conversations with multinationals around adopting the RMB as a treasury currency. “Many Asian companies that don’t have a bias towards the US dollar are looking at the RMB as an alternative option, as are some European companies,” he says. “US companies, as you may expect, are a little slower but the pace is beginning to build.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-bright-future"">A bright future?</h3>
<p>Moving forward, it would be hard to argue that the RMB will not continue to gain in popularity amongst corporates around the world. “If you look at the proliferation of offshore clearing centres, the access to liquidity, the deepening of the financial markets – FX, hedging products, investment products, dim-sum bonds – I think the market has developed to a point that it can be considered a broadly usable currency not just in China but also in trade with China,” adds Kanthadai.</p>
<p>That being said, China hasn’t yet reached the finish line and there remains lots of work to be done. As Miguel Otero-Iglesias of the Elcano Royal Institute highlighted in an op-ed for the Financial Times, the currency only represents around 1% global reserve assets and is eighth in terms of international bond issuance and ninth in global currency trading. And whilst the numbers on the trade side look impressive, 80% of RMB trade is conducted with Hong Kong and as he states: “Perhaps more importantly, in most international trade contracts the RMB is the medium of exchange and not the unit of account. In other words, the Chinese currency is the means of payment, while the dollar remains the invoice currency, which is much more important because that is where the exchange rate risk lies.”</p>
<p>Otero-Iglesias goes on to say that perhaps the main reason for these less than impressive figures is down to confidence and the fact that China still highly regulates the capital account and conversion of its currency. A nod is also made to the lack of transparency around its political and legal frameworks.</p>
<p>If confidence was already limited then the recent bouts of currency volatility, beginning on 11<sup>th</sup> August 2015, may have spooked people further. But, for Kanthadai, it should be seen as an opportunity to begin looking at the RMB as a market based currency that will continue to face two-way volatility. “China can, and will continue to, promote the currency through infrastructure developments and policy changes, but for confidence to really be installed in the RMB it needs to be seen in a different light, akin to other major currencies.”</p>
<h3 id=""spreading-its-wings"">Spreading its wings</h3>
<p>A potential key driver in both the RMB’s continued assent and the overall fortunes of the Chinese economy is the government’s belt and road initiative. The strategy looks to reawaken the historical routes used by silk traders between China and neighbouring countries on three continents, and export China Inc. to the rest of the world on a massive scale.</p>
<p>It is a complex, multi-faceted and highly ambitious project and as yet hasn’t been fully outlined by the Chinese rule makers. It is therefore unsurprising that some commentators are cautious about its overall ambitions, with some going as far to say that we are entering a period of Chinese hegemony. Some argue on the contrary. As Xu Sitao, Chief Economist at Deloitte China points out: “Contrary to conventional wisdom, China’s belt and road initiative is neither a scheme to export China’s excess capacity south and west, nor a grand scheme to exert geopolitical control over the regions concerned. Quite simply, it is an effort to boost regional connectivity in ways that would help China manage certain domestic economic challenges. If China can do this while exporting its growth model to partner countries, the initiative could be considered a success.”</p>
<p>Although the overall ambitions seem opaque, one area that does seem clear and that corporates certainly will be paying attention to is the role that the belt and road initiative can have in boosting the use of the RMB. For DBS’s Leung, it may have particular significance: “To finance infrastructure spending, Beijing is encouraging Chinese banks to extend credit to project participants – most likely in the Chinese currency.” Moreover, the strategy also looks to boost China’s overseas direct investment. “Recipient countries would use RMB to purchase capital goods, construction materials and services from the mainland. The circular nature of these flows will further raise RMB settlement for China’s exports. Closer trade and business ties with China would increase regional demand for the RMB.”</p>
<p>Whilst in its nascent stages of development, the belt and road initiative seems to be having some impact already. Recent research from merchant bank Grison’s Peak highlights that outbound policy loans, equity investments and M&amp;A activity has reached its highest levels in seven years. Yet, the path ahead may be a difficult one, especially for those companies that have had little experience operating outside of their home markets.</p>
<h3 id=""a-much-improved-treasury-environment"">A much improved treasury environment</h3>
<p>As many Western corporates will testify to, moving out of your home market and into unfamiliar waters creates many challenges, especially around achieving standardised processes. This challenge is amplified in the treasury department, which has to adhere to the differing regulatory regimes as the business moves from country to country.</p>
<p>For nearly two decades it was China that caused a headache for international treasurers, with its tight regulatory regime and opaque internal mechanisms. Yet steps taken by the government in recent years have certainly improved things, with treasurers afforded more freedom to manage their cash and liquidity, both onshore and cross-border. Achieving standardisation, best practice and integrating China into global treasury operations is starting to become a reality.</p>
<p>“The relaxation of many rules and regulations has enabled our corporate clients to strive towards centralising and standardising their processes,” says Yigen Pei, China Country Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “As a result corporates are frequently coming to us and asking what they can do and how they can look to implement solutions such as shared service centres, cross-border pooling structures, payment on behalf of (POBO) and receivables on behalf of (ROBO).”</p>
<p>Things look set to further improve given the recent moves by the Chinese regulators to free up interest rates. For corporates, investing in China has therefore become more like investing in other parts of the world. This should also enable corporates access to cheaper and more flexible funding options. Moreover, in levelling the banking playing field DBS’s Lum believes that corporates will be afforded even greater access to best-in-class products and services. “Corporates will gain from having more options, banks will need to innovative in order to stay competitive and support their customers.”</p>
<p>Although treasurers in China are now operating in a greatly improved environment, there remains a need to pay attention to the changing regulatory environment. “Whenever you operate in a foreign market you have to adapt to the local context,” says Pei. “In China, the regulations are changing so quickly that it is important to stay close to them in order to know what you can and cannot do. This also gives you a chance to be part of new regulation formation as they are being developed.” Many companies have successfully demonstrated the benefits of this approach including Adam Smith Award Winners Intertek and BASF.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all these improvements, the last mile is often the hardest. Treasurers across the board will hope that recent issues such as restrictions on liquidity management, imposed limits on FX transactions and government induced volatility are unintended consequences or necessary evils of China’s rapid development and not the beginning of a new set of challenges to contend with. One thing is for sure, the world, and in particular the world of corporate treasury, will be watching China’s next steps with a keen eye.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>India has long been considered a country of enormous opportunity, but in recent years numerous factors have prevented it achieving its full potential. Change, however, is in the air and India may soon be ready to take its seat at the economic top table. What does this all mean for the business and treasury landscape in the country? Treasury Today Asia investigates.</em></p>
<p>In 2016, the IMF predict that India will grow faster than any other major emerging economy at 7.5%, eclipsing the 6.3% predicted of China in the same year. If correct, this will prove a big boost to the Modi government which entered office with a promise to transform and grow India’s then troubled economy.</p>
<p>In his first 12 months in charge Modi took a number of small, but significant steps in the right direction, to modernise, liberalise and open up the economy to more foreign direct investment (FDI) and make India a more business friendly location. For instance: the red tape has been loosened and many permits required to do business can now be obtained online, there has been increased spending on India’s infrastructure, corporate tax is due to be cut an unprecedented 25% over the next four years and investment limits on sectors including insurance and defence have been lifted.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems that this strategy is working. India is not just growing at a great pace, it is also proving to be the world’s most popular investment location. According to a Financial Times study between January and June 2015, the country garnered $31bn of FDI, surpassing China ($28bn) and the US ($27bn).</p>
<p>And India, it seems, is set to continue in this positive direction, despite the strong economic headwinds being felt across emerging markets. The reason for this, according to Indian Finance Minster Arun Jaitley, is because the country is a net importer of commodities, unlike many other emerging economies that are net exporters. As a result India, in recent years, has saved $44bn from the drop in oil prices. This dynamic has also enabled India to build its foreign exchange reserves to an all-time monthly average high of $328bn. India’s strong fiscal position was echoed by ratings agency Moody’s that said: “India is less exposed to global risks because of its more resilient economic growth and the impact of positive policy reforms momentum.”</p>
<p>Despite this, it hasn’t all been positive news for Modi. A number of the government’s larger economic initiatives – such as amending the land acquisition act, standardising tax and revising the labour laws – have hit roadblocks and will require more support before they are passed through parliament. Therefore, according to numerous commentators, India still has some way to go before it can reach its full potential.</p>
<h3 id=""the-financial-sector"">The financial sector</h3>
<p>A key component in India’s journey will be the financial sector which is widely regarded as being fairly well developed and is dominated by local state owned lenders such as the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Bank of Baroda. Just under 40 foreign banks are present in the market, these however have a limited share of the total banking assets (around 5%). The rest of the sector comprises privately owned banks and rural or regional lenders.</p>


<blockquote>There is an over reliance on the banking system for addressing the funding needs of corporates which then puts pressure on banks in times of distress. Alternative financing mechanisms are still evolving.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Harish Barai, Senior Deputy Manager, Corporate Finance – Treasury, Larsen &amp; Toubro</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Given the dominance of the state owned banks, the government looms large over the financial industry. Yet the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which regulates the sector, has become increasingly independent in recent years and no longer sets the rate of interest banks charge. It does, however, play a role in dictating where the banks cash must flow – notably into priority sectors such as agriculture and infrastructure projects. As a result, the state owned banks have invested heavily in many unprofitable projects, and as the Financial Times recently reported, have been left in aggregate with an alarming level of bad or doubtful loans which may perhaps limit their willingness to lend moving forward.</p>
<h3 id=""limited-financing-options"">Limited financing options</h3>
<p>Corporate treasurers in India are certainly keeping a close eye on what is happening in the sector, and for good reason. As Harish Barai, Senior Deputy Manager, Corporate Finance – Treasury at Larsen &amp; Toubro explains: “There is an over reliance on the banking system for addressing the funding needs of corporates which then puts pressure on banks in times of distress. Alternative financing mechanisms are still evolving.”</p>
<p>One of the alternative mechanisms still evolving is the capital markets which are considered undeveloped. This has been cited by numerous bodies as a serious impediment to companies who require access to low-cost finance.</p>
<p>The reasons for the slow growth of the capital markets in India is multi faceted. Firstly, the government is a large issuer in the country and can often crowd out the private sector, particularly as banks are required to hold a large portion of government paper. Also, in recent years, a large number of Indian corporates have entered into unprofitable public/private partnerships and taken on a lot of debt. As a result, a number of these companies have been downgraded by the ratings agencies, again limiting their ability to tap the domestic capital markets – particularly as the shallow investor base is unwilling to take on such risk. “Discussions around development of a proper bond market has been around for quite sometime and regulators are trying hard to push through, but the turn of economic cycle and loss of confidence is complicating matters further and shying investors away,” adds Barai.</p>
<p>In an attempt to diversify their funding needs some Indian corporates, in particular the highly rated names, have looked overseas to raise funds. “The desire by Indian corporates to use international capital markets has been because dollar funding has been cheap,” says Muzammil Patel, Partner at Deloitte India. “Even when corporates considered the fully hedged landed cost of issuing abroad, it has tended to be cheaper than the rupee cost of credit. And although the arbitrage is reducing, it still exists.”</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers will however be encouraged to hear that companies can now raise funds overseas using the rupee. The so called Masala Bonds look set to help internationalise the rupee and also deepen the financial system. The current RBI’s norms allow an Indian entity to raise a maximum of $750m per year through Masala bonds with a minimum maturity of five years. For corporates, the ability to issue such a bond will not only shield the Indian entity against the risk of currency fluctuation, but also allow for a more diversified range of funding sources and perhaps even lower costs moving forward.</p>
<h3 id=""an-increasingly-sophisticated-environment"">An increasingly sophisticated environment</h3>
<p>Whilst there may be questions around the health of certain aspects of the financial sector and limited funding options available, there is better news on the cash management front as corporates operating in the country have access to many of the products they would expect to receive in more developed markets. As Dhiraj Bajaj, Head of India Corporate Sales, Bank of America Merrill Lynch explains: “The financial sector in India is in a constant state of evolution, led not only by the RBI, but also by the government, participating banks and the large local and multinational corporations. This evolution has resulted in improvements in the payments infrastructure and broadened the range of innovative working capital funding options.”</p>
<p>The developments in the payments infrastructure now mean that corporates have multiple choices in executing local currency domestic payments with same day value. This is largely on account of the multiple payment platforms supporting low value and high value payments within the country. “Encouragingly, local banks have rapidly adopted core banking infrastructure ensuring that the end consumer can participate in all forms of wire transfers, minimising the usage of cheques in the country,” adds Bajaj.</p>
<p>These movements have enabled corporates to develop centralised models facilitated by the use of sweeping and pooling arrangements. Larsen &amp; Toubro for instance have adopted this model. “Our cash flows back to the head office banks and we utilise technology to ensure that we have high visibility in order to avoid running idle balances,” says Barai.</p>
<p>To date, however, corporates have been unable to extend their centralised operations further and implement more advanced concepts such as multi-entity pooling or a full in-house bank structure. “The former has been difficult to implement because of the Companies Act and Income Tax Act which create arms-length, accounting and taxation related issues around these structures,” adds Deloitte’s Patel.</p>
<p>Whilst advanced solutions are becoming more common in the India market, Deloitte’s Patel highlights one area where banks need to improve. “Whilst there are many sophisticated products and services available in the market, many banks fall short when it comes to helping corporates find a solution and implement these.” Patel believes that this is because until recent years, discussions had largely been focused on credit; extra services were then bundled in for free with this. “The desire from corporates to pay for that next level of service has therefore perhaps been lacking and the banks haven’t yet seen a need to invest in this. Given that today many corporates are highly leveraged and have less appetite for credit, I expect to see this service element increase exponentially from banks.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-evolving-role-of-treasury"">The evolving role of treasury</h3>
<p>It will come as no surprise to hear that the growing sophistication of products being offered to corporates in India runs parallel to the developing role of the corporate treasurer. As a recent study by Deloitte titled ‘2015 India Corporate Treasury Excellence’ highlights, the top three priorities for corporate treasurers in India today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Controlling working capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing financial risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing and managing liquidity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst the study highlights that these core treasury competencies will remain vital in India moving forward, it also draws out the fact that the role of treasury is becoming increasingly strategic, particularly around the areas of managing risk, funding long-term growth and acting as a financial advisor to the business.</p>
<p>The role has certainly evolved lots since it began its journey in the 1990s. “Corporate treasury became a big focus for corporates in the late 1990s and early 2000s because the FX rules in India were relaxed,” says Patel. The RBI also became more pragmatic and pushed through a host of reforms that also make it easier to take hedging positions. “As a result of this there was considerable innovation from the banks and corporate treasury became a core corporate discipline in the mid-2000s.”</p>
<p>At this time the role was very markets focused and it was therefore largely populated by ex-bankers with an external facing skillset. “As the profession has evolved it has become far more inward looking and treasurers in recent years have paid particular attention to understanding their liquidity flows, exposures, how their activity reflects on the P&amp;L and a whole host of other internal pieces,” says Patel. “The market element still exists but this inward facing analysis is something that drives the profession forward.”</p>
<h3 id=""challenges-for-corporates"">Challenges for corporates</h3>
<p>Despite the positive steps that have been taken by the regulators, the financial sector and by corporate treasurers themselves, there remains some key challenges that are having to be dealt with. According to the Deloitte survey, Indian corporates are wrestling with the economic headwinds being felt by companies around the world. The understanding and navigation of changes in global regulation is another shared challenge with the wider corporate community.</p>
<p>The survey also highlights some challenges that remain more prevalent in India than perhaps in other more developed markets. One for instance, is gaining a clear view on their exposures. A key reason cited for this was the lack of adequate information from business units. Of course, many corporates around the world have utilised technology to provide this visibility, but this doesn’t seem to be the case in India. “Treasury technology is not as developed in India as it should be,” says Patel. “Treasurers have therefore been unable to use their company ERP to begin undertaking some of the treasury processing. A lot of data that is required for treasurers sits in this system and I know that many would like to use this as their treasury management system, but this has not yet happened.”</p>
<p>Fraud and managing fraud risk is another challenge that while not unique to India is certainly amplified in the country. In fact, a study conducted in late 2014 by global accounting firm Grant Thornton highlighted that instances of fraud in corporate India had increased in the past two years, with over 75% of those surveyed believing that cases of fraud had either increased somewhat or significantly. The move away from paper based transactions as mentioned earlier by BAML’s Bajaj is certainly helping in this regard. Despite this a staggering 71% of the Grant Thornton survey respondents believe that incidents of fraud would continue to rise over the next five years.</p>
<h3 id=""evolving-regulation"">Evolving regulation</h3>
<p>Many of these challenges which corporates face in India are largely a result of the country’s stringent regulatory environment and the well-publicised red tape. Overall, the Deloitte study highlights that corporates appear content with the level of regulation but the laws impacting cash pooling and inter-company funding remain a key challenges. As BAML’s Bajaj explains: “Repatriation of trapped cash in light of the dividend tax implications and repatriation of profits by a multinational company is an issue for many corporations. Equally, restrictions around notional pooling limit the ability for interest optimisation for local currency balances held in the country.”</p>
<p>More broadly than these treasury specific restrictions, the red tape in India has meant the country has often been regarded as an extremely difficult and unfriendly place to do business. In many instances it still is, as highlighted by the fact that India was ranked 130<sup>th</sup> out of 189 economies in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business survey in 2015.</p>
<p>But, as previously mentioned, change is occurring. The Modi government are taking significant steps to encourage greater investment in India and turn the country into the world’s next key manufacturing hub through the Make in India initiative – a national programme that is designed to facilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance the skills of the workforce and ultimately build a best-in-class manufacturing infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is already having a positive impact as Larsen &amp; Toubro’s Barai explains: “One year from now it will be very easy to do business in India – the regulators are removing lots of the restrictions for both foreign and domestic companies. Before the Modi government came in, forms were being submitted to government agencies and they just sat there not being processed. Now we see these move through at much greater speed and it is my belief that in the next year or so India will substantially move up the ease of doing business rankings.”</p>


","India has long been considered a country of enormous opportunity, but in recent years numerous factors have prevented it achieving its full potential. Change, however, is in the air and India may soon be ready to take its seat at the economic top table. What does this all mean for the business and treasury landscape in the country?

<h3 id=""china-moving-up-a-gear"">China: moving up a gear</h3>
<p>Given the level of chatter around China’s economic reform it would be easy to feel it was entering the last mile on its journey to become the global economic superpower. But the People’s Republic is in no rush to push itself prematurely into this position. Its chief authorities – the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) – are fully aware that rushing headlong into Western-inspired reform is inadvisable.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that the country has failed to make phenomenal progress in recent times in the internationalisation of the renminbi (RMB) and in the breaking down of trade barriers that would otherwise restrain its development. China is fully cognisant of the needs of its own people in terms of the development of social reforms which might otherwise be stifled by an unbridled push towards a free economy.</p>
<p>The journey of RMB has been long and arduous, taking in three broad stages of development, notes Amol Gupte, Region Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Asia Pacific, Citi. Its arrival as a trade currency has been largely successful (a quarter of all Chinese imports are already denominated in RMB). But its capital convertibility is still at an initial stage and the third phase of becoming a reserve currency is best described as ‘just off the starting blocks’ – joining the IMF’s list of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) will not take effect until October 2016. “Becoming a meaningful reserve currency is some way off,” Gupte believes. “The level of adoption of RMB will be determined by the extent of confidence that the Chinese government is able to create in the ease of using this currency.”</p>
<p>For RMB to gain traction, it must attain the ability to be freely-denominated, it must be easy to transfer in and out of China, and there must be capacity to co-mingle the two unitary expressions of RMB (CNY in China and CNH in Hong Kong). ‘Ease of use’ also means establishing a regulatory environment conducive to commerce and creating a general setting which market participants are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Many commentators such as Gupte also argue that there is a need for China to open up its capital account, creating and developing its offshore financial markets so investors can hold RMB-denominated assets overseas. China’s clearing infrastructure must facilitate easier movement and settlement of RMB across the world too. This, notes Gupte, is where the multi-bank China International Payment System (CIPS) project has a key role to play, enabling banks to offer their worldwide client-base settlement in RMB. The importance of ensuring deep liquidity in RMB both onshore and offshore must also be attended to. Only a handful of countries (eg Hong Kong and Singapore) have so far used the currency swap lines that the Chinese government has opened up to enable market players – tier one banks such as Citi – to indirectly benefit from that liquidity.</p>
<p>Intrinsically linked to the development of China as an economic force is its way of approaching governance, land reforms, income inequality, healthcare, pensions, education, the environment and a host of other internal matters. These will all at some point intersect with and influence the financial flows of the country. China is undergoing a monumental shift in its economic philosophy: an expectation of rapid change is perhaps to ignore these fundamental concerns. “For an economy like China, its sheer size and the fact that it is centrally controlled, means it can only slowly open up,” notes Gupte. “I do not for one minute believe that large volatile swings are in any way beneficial to its progress. But the Chinese model of governance means it is sometimes difficult to predict future changes or how those changes align with the needs of Corporates in China.”</p>
<p>As corporate treasurers recognise that they have a meaningful portion of their balance sheet in RMB, they will need to understand the influence of reform on their supply chain, in terms of their clients and suppliers. At the very least treasurers must understand how to link onshore domestic flows into offshore flows. “Just a couple of years ago money in China was effectively trapped cash,” notes Gupte. “Today, the regulations allow RMB to be moved in and out under certain defined processes.”</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the pace of reform, corporates operating in China should make it a priority to stay ahead of the curve, understanding where they can leverage and optimise. Working with a bank such as Citi, which is on the ground and engaged with local regulators, can provide both a broad and focused view of change as it happens.</p>
<h3 id=""india-firing-on-all-cylinders"">India: firing on all cylinders?</h3>
<p>India’s delivery of the goods, both figurative and actual, is tied to its will to change. With an economy expected to grow in 2016 at 7%, it is one of the few emerging market countries of meaningful size and potential that has shown any real spark in recent months, notes Gupte. Higher public and private investment continues apace and domestic consumption is rising rapidly as inflation falls (helped by plummeting commodity prices). Its current government has a progressive stance on facilitating growth through legislation. India’s proposed (and somewhat radical) move towards a national Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be a major boost but it has to be passed into law amidst some serious opposition. It is currently levied on the movement or transfer of ownership of goods and services by individual States. The efficiency of a unified approach is predicted to boost GDP by 1-2%.</p>
<p>The country has engaged in recent times in a number of liberalising reforms allowing, for example, the issuance of rupee-denominated bonds in overseas markets (so-called Masala bonds). It has also opened up to foreign direct investments in sectors such as defence, railways, construction and insurance. However, the real test of the success of these measures is whether the money actually flows in and thereafter keeps coming: as these are very recent changes the waiting game has only just started. In India, the future efficacy of planned changes has been supported by a wealth of underlying grass-roots work in the country. Plans for financial inclusion include a scheme to issue a unique identification (or ‘Aadhaar’) number to all citizens (as at December 2015, 940 million had been issued). As the world’s largest ID project it is being used to provide access to various government services and other activities such as bank account opening (more retail banking, small banks and payment bank licences have also been issued) and hence the participation of millions more in the advancement of the economy.</p>
<p>India’s progress in the e-commerce space has seen online market growth of 35%. The authorities have just approved the involvement of the major international players in this sector, some of which (Amazon, for example) are now locally incorporated. The further permission by Indian authorities for single-brand retail firms to join the e-commerce revolution adds to the forward momentum of this economy.</p>
<p>For all this effort, Gupte argues that the major changes that must happen in India to fully establish – and maintain – its credibility are the passing and implementation of the GST Bill and changes to the existing Land Acquisition Act. The latter is intended to send the message to investors that the administrative burden of infrastructure investment in India is being lifted. Such projects are also top of the agenda. Road, rail, sea and airports provide for the free movement of goods, services and people, and will lift the economy. This is why the government is so focused on highways projects and the quadrilateral high-speed railway connecting all economic centres of the country. “These are real game-changers,” he comments. However, he adds that there is constant need to tackle endemic corruption. “In a country with high economic disparity, that’s large and fragmented it is idealistic to think corruption can be removed completely but it must be dealt with as it impedes meaningful growth.”</p>
<p>As in China, corporate treasurers operating in India need to keep ahead of the game, observing the changes and staying in touch with those with access to the authorities. The wise practitioner will also pay close attention to, and learn how to leverage, India’s digital agenda which, says Gupte, is moving “at an incredible pace”. There are two good reasons for this. Firstly, it can deliver benefits on the expense line – there is plenty of scope to optimise: India has for a long time been perceived to be an entirely paper-based market for trade and commerce settlement but today, more than 90% of the value of settlements in India are electronic. Secondly, the shift in consumer behaviour towards the digital economy means different sales models should be investigated, leveraging data analytics to change the game in terms of market share and competitiveness.</p>
<h3 id=""patience-is-a-virtue"">Patience is a virtue</h3>
<p>There may be a sense that progress is slow in India because the high expectation felt when the Modi government swept to power in 2014 (based on the guiding principle of “minimum government and maximum governance”) is taking longer to materialise. But it is essential to take the longer-term view, Gupte suggests. India has made significant movement in the right direction over the past decade or so and continues to do so. Indeed, viewing China through the same long-view lens reveals a country that has made sweeping changes that could barely have been anticipated a decade ago. Indeed, as he concludes, “we are sometimes consumed by our own expectations, but both countries have made phenomenal progress”. For treasurers, following this evolution, with the guidance of a well-chosen partner, is the route to leveraging such growth.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""question-1"">What are the big issues facing corporates operating in Asia right now?</h4>

<p><strong>Carole Berndt, Head, Global Transaction Banking, ANZ:</strong> From my perspective, the topic that I see corporates discussing a lot at the present time, and this has been particularly evident at recent conferences, is how they should be reacting when banks change their strategy.</p>
<p>Whilst this is certainly not a new discussion given the focus on Basel III, the cost of capital, evolving regulatory environments and banks evaluating their geographical focus, the reality has really hit home over the past 12 months as a number of banks have pulled out of particular markets and scaled down their product suites.</p>
<p>The challenge therefore for the corporate treasurer in my opinion is how do they create a nimble treasury environment that delivers the economies of scale, drives efficiency through the standardisation of processes all whilst working with fewer banks and mitigating the risk of being dependent on one key supplier.</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Region Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Asia Pacific, Citi:</strong> In addition to what Carole rightly just said I would add that, if you take an external perspective, the world has changed significantly in the last 12 to 18 months. I think corporates are clearly concerned by and are grappling with the evolving macroeconomic environment and this is something that is not going to go away in the short term.</p>
<p>A lot of this is driven by what is currently happening in China. The country has achieved 30 years of really massive, double-digit growth and consumed a lot of commodities. The structural shift that we see occurring however means that growth is slowing and that it will no longer consume commodities at the rate it once was, this has significant implications on downstream corporates.</p>
<p>When what is happening in China is combined with commodity prices sinking to dramatic lows, exports failing to pick up, other domestic economies in APAC struggling and interest rates have risen in the US, there is a lot that corporates need to consider and factor into their cost structure and risk.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, Head of Global Transaction Services, DBS:</strong> I would echo what Amol is saying. China’s slowdown, Indonesia’s slowdown, volatility in equity markets, currency fluctuations and the decline in commodity prices are all clearly having a direct impact on corporates and their supply chains. Moreover, I think companies are still grappling with what the internationalisation of the renminbi (RMB) means for their businesses and the path it will take going forward.</p>
<p>Treasurers are also contending with new technology and making the right calls in this regard. Clients are requiring technology more than ever to help navigate through quite difficult waters, particularly in APAC.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, Managing Director and Head of Treasury Services, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan:</strong> In the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions, corporates are increasingly looking to their banks for support and advice. Our clients expect us to have an intimate level of detail about the regulatory landscape and how best to navigate it.</p>
<p>Clients regularly ask us very specific questions about the impact of regulatory changes in certain countries, such as how they can better manage their cash flows across the region as a result of the changes, and ultimately what all these changes mean for them. Very often, the debate around regulation is focused on banks, but as the requirements of regulators continue to evolve, they are increasingly influencing the strategic thinking and decisions of corporates.</p>


<p><strong>Ivo Distelbrink, Asia Pacific Head of Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch:</strong> The conversations that we are having with our clients centre around how we can help them think through and facilitate some of the fundamental changes in their commercial business models. Today you have e-commerce, mobile payments, mobile wallets, the cloud, big data: all redefining how our clients do business across industries.</p>
<p>These changes are having and will continue to have a profound impact to how treasury is done. So for us, right now, it is key to be reviewing with our clients established processes and established relationships; to optimise platforms and introduce digital technology; to make sure that treasury can facilitate and successfully enable new emerging business models.</p>

<h4 id=""question-2"">Technology is a major driver in every industry. In the banking industry, there is a lot of talk about blockchain and distributed ledger which is proving a challenge. How does this affect corporates?</h4>

<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> For as long as I have been in banking, technology has been a key driver of change. In reality, banks could not exist or function in the way that they do today if they hadn’t been at the forefront of innovating and pushing the development of new technology. So whilst we talk about FinTech and the impact startups may bring – which could be significant in the transaction banking world – we have to remember that banks themselves at their very core are FinTech companies.</p>
<p>When we look at new technologies such as distributed ledger technology, there is a plethora of solutions looking for problems. That said, we are experimenting with the application of such technologies across the payments and trade businesses, which I believe will ultimately give corporates more choices, as well as the potential to lower the cost of operations and enable near real-time transactions across borders.</p>
<p>It is a really interesting and rapidly changing landscape. There are a lot of assumptions being made too early around how the distributed ledger technologies may pan out, but, overall this is a really exciting time to be in this industry because of the extent of change that’s likely to take place.</p>

<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> You look at the commentary around FinTech and it often suggests that traditional banks are doomed. But if you look back over the history of banking, and specifically transaction banking, it is not that long ago we were all talking about the internet and how that was going to change banking, and that banks could not adapt.</p>
<p>If you look at the industry today, I agree with John, we are a FinTech orientated industry, banks are technology. What is happening now is just the next phase of this evolution. The challenge is how to merge the opportunity that technology provides with the regulatory constraints, this is the real challenge.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> When it comes to technology, trust is critical. While everyone agrees that it improves connectivity, removes barriers and when done correctly improves the efficiency of a business, I believe there must be a high level of trust between the client and the bank. Someone recently commented that they were not concerned if their customers paid by cash, a cheque, or by wire transfer, so long as they were able to collect. And as a bank, it’s our job to provide this service efficiently and clients must trust us to deliver this.</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> I don’t see FinTech as something on the outside that is going to eat into traditional banks. Technology is an enabler for banks, and it is only a matter of time before banks come together and embrace the new wave of FinTech to see what else they can do to elevate the quality of services and value that they provide to their clients. I am not suggesting that we replace what banks have built, in terms of SWIFT, over decades. But there is potential to try something in parallel on the back of this technology.</p>
<p>For now, banks continuously invest in the next generation of technology infrastructure. Citi has been looking at distributed ledger technology for the last few years with a skilled team. We have up and running three separate systems that deploy blockchain distributed ledger technologies. They are all within our innovation labs so there is no real money passing through these systems. We also have an equivalent to bitcoin, again within the labs, so we can mine what we call a “Citicoin”. By exploring disruptive new technologies, we can help clients to understand the potential of digital money and how we are, and should be, digitising them, where their experiential value promises to take us and what security, technology, regulatory and financial considerations they pose along the way.</p>


<p><strong>Ivo Distelbrink, BofAML:</strong> I do think distributed ledgers are a huge opportunity to do things better, cheaper, faster, both for us as banks ourselves, as well as for our clients. Yet, it requires, over time, agreed protocols and open source code, so that all participants run in the same direction when it comes to developing distributed ledger applications.</p>
<p>As long as we do that, I believe the potential and the opportunity to be immense and, in that case, I don’t think it is the banks who are nervous about the challenge. I think the established infrastructure players should be and are nervous right now.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> Technology reduces barriers to entry. There used to be a period when if you wanted to become a transaction bank it was a big task to build a mainframe, develop bespoke host-to-host connectivity and clearing system connectivity.</p>



<blockquote>My advice to corporates would be: work out who your real bank friends are. The current environment, for both corporates and the banks, means that relationships are going to become increasingly important, because everything else is commoditised. It is these relationships that are going to help better align the treasurer to the business and make the department more relevant.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Carole Berndt, Head, Global Transaction Banking, ANZ</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>This isn’t the case today. ANZ for instance has only been in the market for eight years but technology has enabled us to be very nimble, and in a very short period of time, reach peer capability with banks who have been here a lot longer. Whilst on the one hand that is great, we all need to be conscious of it, because reducing barriers to entry in the current market environment means there will be more competition, and we need to think about how our strategies play out in this environment.</p>
<h4 id=""question-3"">So what is the advice to corporates right now? There are new technologies as well as lots of new national payment infrastructures in APAC. Should corporates be quizzing you on your blockchain technology, or should they just wait and see what develops?</h4>

<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> My advice to corporates would be: work out who your real bank friends are. The current environment, for both corporates and the banks, means that relationships are going to become increasingly important, because everything else is commoditised. It is these relationships that are going to help better align the treasurer to the business and make the department more relevant.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> Corporates are increasingly looking towards technology to provide them with the necessary business solutions and I am regularly asked how much J.P. Morgan is investing into our technology in the region. It’s essential that corporates sit down with their banks to discuss the banks’ own technology strategies. Corporates should also work with their banks to ensure that optimum technology is being employed to further enhance their own supply chains.</p>

<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> This point is really important, because corporates also need to know where that money is being invested. In recent years, as an industry globally, perhaps particularly amongst the global banks, a significant amount has been invested in risk resolution and compliance, so the question corporates should ask is how are banks channelling investment into the future as well as into the development of new technologies?</p>
<p>Corporates, as always, need to ensure that their banks are investing in the future, and that their transaction banks will be there for them in terms of driving technological and market infrastructure change.</p>

<h4 id=""question-4"">What about the new payment infrastructures that technology is enabling?</h4>

<p><strong>Ivo Distelbrink, BofAML:</strong> Our clients clearly welcome the speed of faster payments but what they value even more is the 24x7 window. In addition to this, clients also value the richer information and data that is enabled by these new clearing systems. With this data, treasurers can improve end-to-end reconciliation and optimise flows.</p>
<p>So there is more to these new systems than speed and in fact, at some point, the industry and our clients will have to ask ‘when is fast, too fast?’ Do corporates really want instant irrevocable credits? The reality is that many probably do not often want this and for very good reasons.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> In my view, what is going to be important for us as an industry is that new payment systems will drive convergence of high and low value payments. New real-time payments infrastructure will also start to blur some of the distinctions between cross-border and domestic payments.</p>



<blockquote>China’s slowdown, Indonesia’s slowdown, volatility in equity markets, currency fluctuations and the decline in commodity prices are all clearly having a direct impact on corporates and their supply chains. Moreover, I think companies are still grappling with what the internationalisation of the RMB means for their businesses and the path it will take going forward.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">John Laurens, Head of Global Transaction Services, DBS</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>As an industry, we have some work to do to make sure that we don’t have a broad array of domestic standards emerging. The challenge is how does one achieve standardisation across newly developed national payments infrastructures, all of which have been driven by governments or regulators to deliver 24 by 7 convenience at low cost to the consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> In terms of what I would say to corporates, I would break it up into three big buckets. Firstly, given the external environment a lot of corporates are focused on profitability. The first reaction when this happens is for corporates to cut expenses, but I think it is a great time to look at capital structuring and take a long-term view to decide what to do when times are tough. We therefore see a lot of clients doubling down on their efforts on bringing far more efficiency into their working capital cycle.</p>
<p>The second area I suggest keeping an eye on is regulations. Whilst these can be challenges they also provide an opportunity, especially regarding what is happening in China. For example, the benefits of unlocking all of that trapped cash that has been building up in China are also felt offshore. With ongoing deregulation, companies are increasingly able to have those revenues sitting inside their global cash pool.</p>
<p>Finally, the last big area is around cyber-security. There have been some very high-profile incidents in recent months and it is easy to think that these will always happen to somebody else. But, it is something that every corporate should have close to the top of their agenda.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> I agree. Data and cyber-security are very important, especially when treasurers are looking to drive efficiency and mitigate financial risks. It can be easy to forget about the information security piece. When corporates are looking to drive down costs, they need to be aware of how the changes may impact their data security.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> There are also other factors. I had an interesting discussion with a corporate the other week. We have been talking working capital as long as I have been in the industry. That’s a good couple of decades. And we always talk about optimising it and this treasurer was saying: “Look, I really appreciate everything you are doing and the focus on working capital, and I had this great project and I have really improved it. But, the other day, it was completely blown out of the water.” And I said “how did this happen?” to which he replied “you know, someone in our procurement department decided to change the way that we ship our goods. Instead of airfreighting them, to save money they now ship them by sea. That has added 60 days into my working capital cycle.” So it is interesting, we always think about it in the context of the banking arrangements, but there is a far broader discussion including something as simple as transportation.</p>

<h4 id=""question-5"">How much are treasurers getting involved in the business as a whole in APAC? Is treasury getting out there and working with the other parts of the company on taking advantage of changes?</h4>

<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> They are front and centre. For instance, we work with a consumer company in India. They now have data on 100m individual shoppers, and their buying behaviour. This is the type of information technology and data that can then be utilised by treasury and the wider business. Treasurers are now thinking about what this means to their cash management collections and how they can get more data and pass this onto the front office for them to take marketing decisions.</p>


<p><strong>Ivo Distelbrink, BofAML:</strong> The commercial business models of corporates are changing; these changes are clearly changing the priorities and responsibilities of corporate treasury. A treasurer’s focus on working capital is business as usual and will always be there. But, the strategic treasurer is now working with CEOs and heads of strategy to understand how to facilitate new business models.</p>
<p>In this light, questions now being asked are: can corporate treasury manage positions 24/7, across currencies and time zones? Can corporate treasury monetise mobile wallets, gift cards, loyalty points and so on and so forth, beyond simply managing cash? Can corporate treasury use big data to make better funding decisions? With such questions treasury has well and truly moved beyond managing day-to-day working capital into the C-suite, actively driving the redefinition of commercial business models.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> The corporate treasury has always strived to be more than its central function as a utility to the company, and to become a strategic advisor to commercial business lines. This is an evolution that has taken place over recent years. But, given the extent of change today, be it regulatory or technological, there’s never been a better time for treasurers to play the strategic role they have always sought to play in their organisations.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> I have recently come from Europe which has a strong consumer protection environment, and increasingly so. I actually think there is a tsunami of regulatory change headed our way, focused on protecting the consumer that will impact banking and will impact the corporates who work in the consumer space.</p>
<p>For instance, the actions by European governments regarding bank behaviour, how they charge, and the speed of payments. I think Ivo made a very good point, is immediate real time payment a good thing? The regulators certainly think that for the consumer, it is. These trends lead me to believe that we are going to face some challenges as governments focus on increasing consumer protection in the financial world. I think it is the second wave of the impact of the GFC (Global Financial Crisis).</p>

<h4 id=""question-6"">Regulation has come up several times. How does a corporate client stay current when they are operating across the region, with multiple jurisdictions and the possibility of a second wave of regulation coming through? Should corporates be looking to their banks to keep them up to speed?</h4>

<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> Keeping our clients up-to-date with regulatory change is an important part of our role. We are constantly seeking to build deeper relationships with our corporate clients and offer our expertise and knowledge to them through multiple channels. Nevertheless, treasurers also need to have an independent perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> A bank’s compliance department can add a tremendous amount of value in these conversations as they help us to navigate through the regulations. However, we have to be careful because while we can advise our clients, we don’t have the fiduciary responsibility to make decisions for clients.</p>

<h4 id=""question-6"">It is a difficult line to walk, isn’t it?</h4>

<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> It is a difficult line. The securities business has done this effectively for a number of years as they have had people who are able to advise their clients around what is happening in various settlement systems and what’s happening on securities.</p>
<p>I think the cash management industry needs to step up in this area and offer further advisory services. We have the access to regulators that clients don’t necessarily have, so they increasingly look to us for advice. This is especially true in markets like China where banks are key to any proposition – regardless of cross-border sweeps, two-way structures, or a cross-border loan – the regulator would want to see the corporate and their bank. It can be a fine line.</p>



<blockquote>Data and cyber-security are very important, especially when treasurers are looking to drive efficiency and mitigate financial risks. It can be easy to forget about the information security piece. When corporates are looking to drive down costs, they need to be aware of how the changes may impact their data security.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> I echo what Di and Carole said, banks absolutely play a big role, but corporates also need an independent view. The discussion is also broader than regulation, it covers tax as well. Corporates need to form their own view on what they can and cannot do because their entities’ structures, their location, the way they fund themselves, the way they borrow between entities, all have profound tax and cost implications.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> I’d echo these sentiments, the key word is advisory. In the transaction banking space, if you are not engaging your clients in an advisory capacity today, then you are not going to be delivering value to your customers or competing very effectively in the market. It is what customers are looking for.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> There’s a lot of conversations about transaction banking becoming commoditised but I don’t believe it is. Being a trusted advisor means treasurers should be able to look us in the eye and know that we will treat their business like it’s our own and always deliver what they need to the highest possible standards. I don’t believe you can commoditise this.</p>

<h4 id=""question-7"">We touched on cyber-security which is an important element in trust and that is something we should discuss.</h4>

<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> Cyber-security can be broken into two components: cyber-attacks and wire fraud. Wire fraud has become much more prevalent. We used to be more concerned about manual payments but now we spend a significant amount of time ensuring that our straight-through payments are safe.</p>
<p>We are starting to see banks come together in the US to discuss this, which is a very positive development. I would like to see greater collaboration in Asia where we can hold these conversations and share best practice as to how to mitigate cyber threats. It is also vital that we work to educate corporates and each other as an industry. Protecting the industry is critical.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> One must also consider that often when a corporate has suffered cyber-attacks there is a large element of human error. So, yes, we must make sure that systems are safe and secure. But, there does need to be an increase in ownership and awareness around the manual processes and the people management that makes the technology to protect corporates from cyber-crime. This whole debate is as much about human behaviours as it is about systems and technologies and these very sophisticated scams.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> Education is vital. The majority of wire fraud that is identified is caught typically because something has been spotted as being unusual or out of the ordinary. The more that banks can do to heighten awareness in this regard is vital. It is not just a technological-driven solution set. There is also a human aspect to it.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> To be a contrarian, we talk about mobile technology. Is a treasurer really going to sit on the tube on a Monday morning and be on their mobile phone to rush through authorising payments? Because that is going to increase the potential for them to miss these nuances and patterns. It is an interesting debate, technology is going to make treasurers more mobile but, if not implemented correctly, it is also going to expose a lot more, I believe.</p>


<p><strong>Ivo Distelbrink, BofAML:</strong> We have a responsibility right now to educate our clients around cyber-fraud and cyber-security. Many clients just still do not have the understanding and the awareness over where and how cyber-fraud can enter into their systems. Moreover, some of the younger generation just don’t care; they are digitising their entire lives and they have no issue with digitising money as much as they digitise their social life and everything else around them. I believe we have a responsibility to educate those who do not know or do not care. There is a responsibility to educate those who aren’t yet fully aware. It’s an ongoing effort. It’s important.</p>

<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> While banks have taken significant steps to bolster cyber-security efforts, they will continue to be challenged by the speed of technological change and the increasingly sophisticated nature of threats. Acting quickly against cyber-crime is essential. One way Citi does this is through the use of the “cyber-kill chain” methodology. The methodology enables us to tag information as it is collected so that we can identify an attack in the earliest stages – when an attacker is trying to discover a vulnerable spot in a particular system. By identifying and countering an attack early, we are able to mitigate the threat before it fully develops, and also use the information gained to spot future threats.</p>

<h4 id=""question-8"">There’s a lot of advisory work going on here as part of the client relationship.</h4>

<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> It’s certainly one of the best parts of the job.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> And as our industry evolves, you have got a commodity product. You try and add value. You try and move up the value chain. And that is what we are all doing.</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> But it is not a commodity product. I mean I always tell everyone, commodity industries you work at 2% and 3% margins. This industry is not working at 3% margins.</p>



<blockquote>I don’t see FinTech as something on the outside that is going to eat into traditional banks. Technology is an enabler for banks, and it is only a matter of time before banks come together and embrace the new wave of FinTech to see what else they can do to elevate the quality of services and value that they provide to their clients.</blockquote>

<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> Proprietors and treasurers of SMEs are just as interested. There is a lot being done in terms of providing advisory through a number of different channels, such as through social networking to share information and best practices. Advisory at a large corporate level requires bespoke one-to-one engagement with the treasurer, but there’s no less importance and demand from SMEs for mass market packaged advisory. This could range from online working capital advisory services through to networking events.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> I would love to hear from the three of you about how important the advisory piece is down at MME/SME level. Is there that real desire for information around fraud?</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> Huge.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> Absolutely.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> Are you seeing it more in that space versus your large corporates?</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> I wouldn’t say it is different but, I just think that the relationship value for advisory in that segment is significantly high.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> And they are smaller, so they have fewer avenues, such as associations, available for them to access information. The role of a banking partner, therefore, is arguably more important.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> You can’t just be advisory in this relationship. There are some basic capabilities you have to bring to the table and, when I think about our value proposition to clients, it really is to deliver mobility, security and value for their cash. And that’s part transaction and it is part advisory.</p>

<h4 id=""question-9"">We talked earlier about the need to stay abreast of developments in terms of of regulations. Something that is particularly important in China. What would your advice be to companies operating in China?</h4>

<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> I recently visited China for the first time in a business context for eight years. And what surprised me the most was how normal it has become. It doesn’t look or feel as different any more. Also in some of the key areas we have discussed – such as the mobility of cash and security of cash – it has become very similar to experiences found in other countries.</p>
<p>In Europe, you hear a lot of noise about the slowdown of China. But, we are talking about a slowdown to 6% in one of the world’s largest economies. Europe’s been living in stagnant growth for a long time. So despite this I don’t think China is any less relevant than it was before. I think it is very important for corporates whose business requires them to be there and to be relevant there. I think the banking environment has changed a lot. But it is becoming, to a degree, mainstream and I think the story now turns to some of the emerging Asian countries and regions like the Greater Mekong.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> Although given the extent of change and change that’s to come, I do not think we can yet refer to doing business in China as normal.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> Near normal. In the sense that it is clearly heading on that path in terms of its structural changes and as it moves from a centrally controlled economy to a market-based economy and in the way in which it allocates capital in that market.</p>
<p>As we have seen in recent months this has created hiccups along the way, and it will continue to do so. In terms of working with customers in China, corporates need to be particularly aware of who their commercial counterparties are and be very rigorous in terms of selection.</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> I think China is at a very early stage of its journey. If you consider what is happening with the RMB and its evolution, it can be viewed in three stages. One is just making the RMB a trade currency. That box is checked and it has happened. A quarter of Chinese imports and exports are already denominated in RMB. The second stage is capital convertibility. That is still at an infant stage. The third phase is the currency becoming a reserve currency, and with the inclusion of the RMB into the SDR currency basket, this stage is also beginning to evolve.</p>
<p>More broadly, if you consider what is happening domestically, interest rates have been relaxed, and will slowly be liberalised in practice. Interest rate liberalisation will curb the shadow banking industry, which arose because companies couldn’t get any yield on their deposits with banks.</p>
<p>All of this is going to change, and to John’s point, China is going to become a far more market-oriented economy and as all of that happens it has massive implications for our corporate clients. So I think it is incredibly important to stay very close and up-to-date on what you can do and what you cannot do in that market.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> Yes, I agree, it is early stages. When you go through capital account convertibility with clients and begin to execute against that, the outcome can be very different to what you expected initially because the interpretation by various government circles around the country or the various agencies you deal with, can change. It is very complex.</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> It is a massive market, right? For many multinationals, it is larger than their home market.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> They have got more cash there than they have elsewhere.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> Trapped cash.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan:</strong> But, in China, technology is not being applied as readily as in other markets such as India where we are seeing huge steps being taken around the clearing system.</p>


<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> The whole e-commerce environment in China is just exploding and the extent of payment flows and opportunities coming on the back of this is huge. So, in my view, we have seen a considerable amount of technology adopted in China and this will continue. I see China playing a leading role in that respect globally.</p>
<p>Overall, what is happening in China is remarkable. China is doing exactly what the world is asking of it, from progressing its export-led manufacturing industries to developing its services economy or building out its middle classes to further drive domestic wealth creation. Clearly, such progression drives structural changes and market volatility along the way, but the opportunity for corporates is very significant going forward. You have to take a longer-term view.</p>
<p>Also, on the other hand, something we must not lose sight of, is Chinese multinationals expanding out across the world. The ‘One Belt, One Road’ is a new phase of development for the transaction banking industry globally, as Chinese corporates head outside of China taking the so called “redback” with them as they invest in and develop their businesses globally. It’s a hugely exciting time to be working with Chinese MNCs.</p>

<p><strong>Ivo Distelbrink, BofAML:</strong> I absolutely agree with that. There is still a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding around China. Chinese business, Chinese culture and the Chinese view are still poorly understood. But, the Chinese are very pragmatic and absolutely committed to the financial and institutional reforms required to continue to make this transition and the transition under way, as John mentioned, is massive.</p>
<p>For one, the way the Chinese are embracing technology and their digital economy is market-leading in many ways. Many of our traditional GDP growth measures are failing to capture the transformation that China is going through. I think China is doing all the right things and I believe that China will remain a very exciting growth market for very many years to come for our clients.</p>

<h4 id=""question-10"">What about the trends in trade? Is there anything new to say?</h4>

<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> For me, it would be the acceleration from traditional trade to open account trade and supply chain finance, which is gathering pace. The really interesting thing that may happen in the trade space, if you like, the Holy Grail for trade, is its long awaited dematerialisation. Distributed ledger technology could open the way to finally grasp the Holy Grail of widespread digitised trade, something that has been talked about for decades with little substantive progress. But that’s a subject in its own right.</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> I would say we need to look at a longer period of history, around the last ten years. You have had intra-Asian trade go from 40% to 60%. It is a big shift. So 40% of all Asian trade went into Asia, that 40% has gone to 60% which means a lot of Asian companies have gone global and in this process it is just natural to go to your neighbouring proximity markets first, rather than going far away. And that has driven this whole phenomenon of intra-Asian trade. On the back of intra-Asian trade, you have a lot of local and regional banks who have followed those clients.</p>
<p>And if you think about the transaction banking business, I think about it at two levels. One is the cash business with extremely high entry values, and you think about that plain vanilla trade business it has got incredibly low entry barriers. You can just walk in with a lot of cheap capital on the table, which is what a lot of banks have done in the last ten years, and built a lot of really poor returning trade books. My view is we will now see a transition in terms of where these banks get far more focused on returns. And I think to John’s point, banks will focus more on the high value-added, the more intellectual property side of the business which is the whole understanding client ecosystems, doing more supply chain. We are entering a period of change in my view in the way trade is done in the region.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> We are a very large trade bank and very focused on the corridors that support our clients’ activity. But if I was to say one thing about trade, I think Amol’s point around returns is very important. I think we are seeing a fundamental shift from trade being used as a funding vehicle to increasingly being used as a risk management vehicle, and particularly as it relates to supply chains and business continuity.</p>

<h4 id=""question-11"">As a corporate plans for the years ahead in APAC, what should they be doing and thinking? In a few words, what is your advice?</h4>


<p><strong>Ivo Distelbrink, BofAML:</strong> Think big. The world is old, indebted and unequal. APAC is diverse, dynamic, innovative and competitive.</p>


<blockquote>The commercial business models of corporates are changing; these changes are clearly changing the priorities and responsibilities of corporate treasury. A treasurer’s focus on working capital is business as usual and will always be there. But, the strategic treasurer is now working with CEOs and heads of strategy to understand how to facilitate new business models.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p><strong>John Laurens, DBS:</strong> We remain at the very beginning of the Asian century and, despite recent slowdowns and market volatility, Asia will remain the centre of global economic growth. This is driven by the size of population in the region, the demographics of that population, continued massive urbanisation, investment in infrastructure and the creation of wealth and the middle classes.</p>
<p>If you have a global growth strategy, you need to be in Asia. My view would be to pay close attention to these macro trends and invest in them. Asia is where the growth will continue to be. Corporates should choose their transaction banker carefully, and ensure it is one that is deeply committed and knows the region.</p>


<p><strong>Di Challenor, J.P. Morgan</strong>: For me, the key is around embracing technology. The average age in India is under 30, so it’s essential that you examine whether you have the right strategy in place to capture that wallet. You need to be conducting business in these countries if you are to have a long-term future in the region. I have been in Hong Kong almost 12 years and in this time, it is amazing how much it has changed and what our clients are now thinking about doing in the region.</p>
<p>Banks, however, do need to come together to deal with various threats in our industry around cyber-security and corporates should be challenging banks to work together on these matters. Corporate treasurers should also be challenging their banks to adopt new technology and drive SWIFT in a way that enables inter-operability, not just between banks but across countries. That is where I truly believe we have to go.</p>
<p>It is often asked if Asia will ever become like EMEA and I always answer ‘no’. But, why have we not used technology to drive the same advantages that corporates have received in EMEA? I would say that corporates need to be pushing their banks to do more.</p>


<p><strong>Carole Berndt, ANZ:</strong> All the points around Asia continuing to be very relevant and important to most corporates are absolutely valid. But, Asia is not just one homogenous group of countries; it is really three distinct regions. Greater China is one that we have talked a lot about. We have also talked a bit about India. I would also advise corporates to keep an eye on some of the emerging ASEAN countries. What was once made in China is now made in Cambodia, made in Laos, or other emerging economies. So it is vital to keep an eye on these.</p>
<p>The point about technology is also extremely important and it is vital to be nimble in that context, because it is the best tool corporates have to protect them against the headwinds. Treasurers need to work out who their best friends are and to build strong relationships with banks that are investing in the geographies that are important to their business. If corporates do that, I think they will put themselves in a safe place in terms of business continuity, and ensuring the mobility and security of their cash.</p>


<p><strong>Amol Gupte, Citi:</strong> A lot of valid points have already been made but I would like to highlight that Asia follows a secular trend and it is well on the way in this respect. For example, in the 1980s Asia’s contribution to world GDP was 15%. It is now 25%. In another 35 years, it will be half of the world’s GDP; this is a vast development. So when I think of what is happening right now and the turbulence in the region, it is not a big air pocket and it will pass.</p>
<p>Overall, when I think about the change currently occurring – whether it is on technology, whether it is what is happening in terms of digital money, regulatory changes, currencies, buying behaviours, business models, e-commerce – I truly believe that it is a fantastic time for corporates to actually double down and invest for what looks to be a very bright future in the region.</p>

<!-- 
		<h4>Amol Gupta&#44; Region Head&#44; Treasury and Trade Solutions&#44; Citi Asia Pacific</h4>
		<h4>What is your current job and what took you into banking?</h4>
		<p>I am currently heading Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions across 18 countries in the Asia Pacific region. In this role&#44; I lead the strategic direction and development of Citi’s comprehensive suite of treasury and trade solutions in Asia Pacific for Local &amp; Multinational corporations&#44; financial institutions and public sector organizations. This covers payments&#44; receivables&#44; liquidity management and investment services&#44; working capital solutions&#44; commercial and prepaid card programs&#44; as well as trade finance and services.</p>
		<p>I decided on banking as a career after university for the broad canvas it offered&#44; as well as being a fast growth industry at the time. The fast paced and competitive nature of the industry was also a big attraction to me.</p> 
		<h4>Can you tell me a little bit about your background&#44; your experience and how this prepared you up for your current role?</h4> 
		<p>I have spent more than 26 years in Citi&#44; serving the bank in a variety of roles in product management&#44; relationship management and sales. I spent my first six years in Consumer Banking in Sales&#44; &amp; then in Treasury. The last 20 have been in Transaction Banking in India&#44; then later in the Europe&#44; Middle East and Africa region. Most recently&#44; I ran the Treasury and Trade Solutions business in North America&#44; and three years ago&#44; it made sense to round out my experience and come to Asia.</p>
		<p>Throughout my career in Citi&#44; I have had the great opportunity of working in different businesses across multiple geographies and cultures&#44; cutting across product lines&#44; client segments and in both emerging and developed markets. I have learnt a lot&#44; including managing different types of issues&#44; and these experiences are irreplaceable; they can’t be found in a management textbook or classroom.</p> 
		<h4>What do you like most about your current role?</h4>
		<p>Asia Pacific is a culturally diverse region and extremely exciting from a business growth standpoint – there are the global powerhouses like China and India&#44; the international financial centers of Hong Kong and Singapore&#44; developed markets like Australia&#44; South Korea&#44; and the emerging economies like Vietnam&#44; the Philippines&#44; Thailand&#44; Indonesia. This brings a lot of dynamism to my role as this is where global multinationals want to be&#44; and where the new Asian multinational is being born.</p> 
		<p>We are seeing an increasing trend of Asian champions putting their globalization plans to fruition. As they continue to grow&#44; they have a greater demand for a banking partner with strong global and local networks&#44; and the ability to provide deep liquidity and innovative market-leading solutions. Citi is the natural choice for many of these new multinationals&#44; and it is extremely exciting and satisfying to partner them on their globalization journey.</p> 
		<h4>Who’s influenced your career most (and why)?</h4>
		<p>Throughout my career and my personal life&#44; I have learnt and drawn inspiration from different people&#44; be it my team members who work for me&#44; my peers&#44; my bosses or my friends and family. I believe that people have different strengths&#44; and I try to imbibe different strengths from people whom I interact with.</p> 
		<h4>If you weren’t in your current role&#44; what would you be doing?</h4>
		<p>I am an avid soccer fan. Therefore&#44; if I wasn’t a banker&#44; I would have liked to be the manager of a professional soccer team. It would be an interesting and enriching career as it involves using short term tactics&#44; long term strategy&#44; critical and analytical thinking skills&#44; managing and building talent&#44; motivational psychology and the thrill of the win!</p>
		<h4>What’s the best piece of advice you could give someone?</h4>
		<p>I would advise people to go long on career diversity and be brave to challenge the status quo. Do different things across the spectrum of banking&#44; whether it is in different products&#44; functions or geographies. Explore opportunities that come your way and do not get too comfortable in one role. You are capable of much more than you think you are!</p>
		<h4>What’s your favorite quote or motto?</h4>
		<p>One of my favorite quotes is “Winning is not everything&#44; but wanting to win is” by legendary American football player and coach Vincent Lombardi&#44; considered by many to be one of the best coaches of all time. He is certainly no stranger to victory&#44; having led the Green Bay Packers to 5 NFL Championships and two Super Bowls during his tenure. This quote resonates with me as it speaks about the pursuit of excellence and the desire to triumph.</p>
		<h4>What’s the skill you’d most like to have and why?</h4>
		<p>Improving the decision making in a group is one skill I constantly try to improve. How do you get those quiet thinkers&#44; but with great content&#44; to contribute? How do you try to ensure diversity of thought? How do you try to not let the loudest voice drive the decision making and how do you get to a better decision as a group versus an individual?</p>
		<h4>What’s your all-time favourite book (and why)?</h4> 
		<p>One of the books I really enjoyed reading is One Hundred Years of Solitude by acclaimed Colombian author and Nobel Laureate&#44; Gabriel Garcia Márquez. It is a chronicle of life and death&#44; and many call it his masterpiece.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Founded in 1967, the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) aims, as set out in the ASEAN declaration in 1967, are: to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region; to promote regional peace and stability and to provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities, amongst other social and sustainability goals.</p>
<p>These aims have always faced challenges – least of all because of the region’s enormous scope. ASEAN covers about 3% of the total land area of the Earth and the ten countries account for around 8.8% of the world’s population. Inevitably, this means the region exhibits considerable diversity which can throw up problems for corporates operating there. But whilst the varied business landscape means expected net returns are more dependent upon a company’s treasury performance, it is anticipated the countries will have a combined gross domestic product of $2.1trn once the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is instituted. ASEAN therefore represents an attractive prospect and, without a doubt, investors are increasingly appreciating that the challenges are outsized by the potential rewards. For instance, the European Union (EU), according to the European Commission’s annual trade and investment publication released in July, is the largest investor in Southeast Asia and, after China, the region’s biggest trading partner. Given recent volatility in the country, it is likely more and more corporates will be looking beyond China. “The new norm in China is a lower rate of growth. Thus, attention is turning to ASEAN,” explains Victor Penna, Managing Director Global Head of MNC Sales and Treasury Solutions for Standard Chartered.</p>
<h3 id=""country-specific-trends"">Country specific trends</h3>
<p>Multinationals are keen to tap these markets as a major part of their global expansion plans. “This is evident in ASEAN’s foreign direct investment inflows, totalling $122bn in 2013, which soared 25% on average over the past 14 years,” explains Melvyn Low, ASEAN and Singapore Country Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions for Citi. Investors within the region are also looking for opportunities. As of June this year, ASEAN investors spent $54.6bn towards projects in Vietnam. Top investors were: Singapore ($32.2bn), Malaysia ($12bn) and Thailand ($6.8bn). In fact, the Q3 2015 Business Optimism Index by Dun &amp; Bradstreet indicated that business confidence in Vietnam improved by 16% in one quarter, and 46% of respondents anticipated better business conditions for the final quarter of the year. Optimism amongst other countries in the region (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), however, has been dampened by currency volatility, the report notes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, disparity is nothing new for corporates in the region. Taking the financial sector as an example, Penna explains: “As you move into the different countries, the development of financial services varies a lot.” Whilst the likes of Singapore and Thailand embrace transparency and boast mature banking sectors, Myanmar is in its infancy and the country is only just seeking its first credit rating (it is predicted 10% growth in 2015, however). It is in the transition to market economy and has to avoid the pitfalls – corruption, inflation and rising living costs – other more developed countries in ASEAN have, by and large, successfully side-stepped.</p>
<p>“Singapore, for instance, is the regional hub for ASEAN where the financial markets are very well-developed. Malaysia too is quite advanced and has become more open in the past three or four years. Then there are the more restricted and under-developed markets such as Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia. Thailand and Indonesia fall somewhere in between where there is a reasonable level of local services,” Penna says.</p>
<h3 id=""creating-regional-unity"">Creating regional unity</h3>
<p>Despite the prevalence of regional inconsistency, change is afoot in the form of the AEC. Envisioned to transform ASEAN into a region with free movement of goods, services, investment, skilled labour and freer flow of capital, AEC progress “has been ongoing for many years,” says Leslie Choo, General Manager and Vice President, ASEAN and Greater China, for payments provider ACI. The charter, signed by all members of ASEAN in 2007, set out the goal of achieving regional economic integration by the 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015, a date brought forward from the original 2020 aim. “The AEC could be set to change the game plan for ASEAN,” says Choo.</p>
<p>The removal of restrictions on trade, investments, capital flows and people would provide huge opportunity for the countries, the corporates operating there and the banks lending to them. The upsurge in intra-ASEAN trade has already been the biggest story over the past few years, and AEC looks set to accelerate this further. However, the region has a patchy history with such inter-country agreements, explains Neil Katkov, Senior Vice President Asia for Celent. “Although everyone hopes it will bring a lot of benefits to the region – and it certainly has that potential – it’s not a sure thing.” Historically, multilateral negotiations have been prone to deadline slippages and corporates cannot be certain of the end-of-year goal.</p>
<p>When it comes to expectations, some lessons have been learnt from the European continent’s troubles. For instance, prevailing opinion seems to be that conditions are not right for a single ASEAN currency union. Instead, in the absence of one currency, the aim is “to have one foundation for multiple currencies, which must be formed to override the inefficiencies created by diversity for corporates doing business,” explains Choo.</p>
<p>An increased level of trade liberalisation in ASEAN is much more likely than any movement towards a currency union. And the roots from which the AEC could flourish are certainly growing. Manufacturing, for example, is moving away from China due to increasing costs with many corporates choosing countries within ASEAN as new manufacturing locations. Moreover, Choo believes that once the AEC gains traction, “there will be huge interest for countries like Japan or China to tap into the region as well,” he says. Indeed, some co-operation already exists with ASEAN Plus Three (APT), a forum that coordinates ASEAN and China, Japan and South Korea which can be built on as ASEAN becomes more of a global player.</p>
<h3 id=""payment-and-banking-considerations"">Payment and banking considerations</h3>
<p>“Payments infrastructure is one of the key areas for the formation of AEC. It will be a necessary criteria for countries to allow businesses to attach to, and benefit from, the community,” explains Choo. Some countries have already been leveraging a faster payments infrastructure – Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST), formerly known as Giro 3 (G3), is a real-time payments initiative built on ISO 20022 in Singapore, for instance – yet “there’s not really a linkage between countries.” For a pan-ASEAN clearing and settlement system to work, other countries would need to modernise their domestic payment infrastructures and this will inevitably take some time. Change is on the horizon, however, as Singapore has indicated from day one that FAST would be able to process cross-border payments within ASEAN and connect these clearing houses together one day.</p>
<p>It is hoped that an integrated banking sector would encourage the emergence of globally competitive ASEAN-based banks as well as improve the overall stability of the region’s banking sector – an advantage which will be felt by the larger corporates and SMEs alike. Indeed, “businesses in the region are driving the ASEAN payment network,” explains Choo, and notable progress is occurring. For instance, the recent announcement regarding UnionPay International (UPI) and the Thailand Bankers Association signing a chip card standard license agreement in August. The agreement will push forward nationwide chip migration of debit cards and ATM machines in Thailand; upgrading from the use of magnetic strips in cards to chips compatible with international UPI standards will lay a solid foundation for innovative application and value-added services.</p>
<p>If more countries could move towards using a standard that everyone understands, that would be a huge step forward for the region. A wider adoption of ISO 20022, Choo cites as an example. In 2013, Thailand’s Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) and SWIFT signed a memorandum of understanding to promote the adoption and use of ISO 20022 amongst the financial industry in the country and region. In ASEAN, SWIFT has been working with financial institutions and governments to standardise financial connectivity and messaging. Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand already have their real-time gross settlement (RTGS) on SWIFT. Some of the smaller economies are inevitably taking longer to migrate to a common standard.</p>
<p>But regional developments are by no means limited to the payments space. International banks will also be trying to increase their competitive appeal when the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF) is implemented (anticipated by 2020). This is because, under ABIF, regional ASEAN-based banks will be re-classified as local banks across the ten countries, rather than being treated as foreign banks when operating in a neighbouring country. It is a landmark agreement to allow member nations’ banks to operate in each other’s markets.</p>
<p>ASEAN is dominated by large global banks, but they depend on local banks in each country for the last mile of delivery. Under ABIF, they could face stiff competition from local and regional players. Especially given that, in the last four years or so, local banks have been trying to provide more transaction banking services themselves. “In most cases, they start out with online cash management but some larger regional banks are putting in place fully-fledged services,” adds Celent’s Katkov.</p>
<p>Malaysian-based Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (HLFG), for instance, has been scouting for merger and acquisition opportunities amidst ABIF integration plans in order to expand its presence. The bank has made it known it is on the lookout in emerging high-growth markets, such as Indonesia and Thailand, as part of a strategy to be of greater relevance and significance, regionally. “Many of the players in the market have great hopes for these initiatives (AEC and ABIF) and are already moving to expand in advance of them and certainly putting in place plans to take advantage of the agreements,” says Katkov. “There is a lot banks can do right now to expand their business without waiting for any formal inter-country agreement.” Citi, for example, has already been working with leading companies in the fast-moving consumer goods, healthcare and insurance sectors. “In fact, the rise of multinationals’ investments into ASEAN has resulted in a greater need for transactional banking support for their in-country operations to seamlessly connect with their regional treasury centres and global headquarters,” says Low.</p>
<h3 id=""stumbling-blocks"">Stumbling blocks</h3>
<p>Whilst business sentiment is generally positive in ASEAN, and there are currently many encouraging developments in the region, implementation has made it hard for corporates to plan for the future. “The number of concrete measures towards this economic community that have been implemented is very small,” says Penna. What’s more, integration for the region is not likely to stop with the AEC either as more trade, security and political unifications are anticipated.</p>
<p>Instead, corporates would do well, according to Penna, to focus on the reality that the region’s opportunities come part and parcel with challenges around regulatory change and operational complexity meaning treasurers need to be agile in their approach. As a result of local preferences and cultural sensitivities, they cannot rely on a one-size-fits-all strategy in the region. “Restricted markets are part of the norm in Asia and the challenge for corporates is understanding regulations and restrictions on a country-by-country basis,” Standard Charterd’s Penna explains. In terms of being able to do cross-border lending and what capital account and FX restrictions are in place, it’s quite a mixed bag. “On one end of the spectrum, you have open markets such as Singapore and, on the other, there are restricted countries like Vietnam. All the others sit somewhere between those bookends.”</p>
<p>When change does occur, corporates may have to prepare in an atmosphere of uncertainty. Malaysia, for instance, introduced a consumption tax (to replace its previous sales tax and service tax) in April this year, but the details took a long time to be finalised. Moreover, Indonesia is looking closely at transfer pricing. Although developments, such as these, need to be kept a close eye on, it’s not all bad news: Vietnam is set to reduce its corporate income tax rate to 20% from 22% in January 2016. Increasingly, countries in the region are avoiding using tax incentives for short-term investment, but are taking steps which help corporates navigate what is a complex landscape. For example, the Economic Development Board in Singapore, the Malaysia Investment Development Authority and the Board of Investment in Thailand encourage sensible – and hopefully repeat – investment in their countries.</p>
<h3 id=""harmonisation-the-end-goal"">Harmonisation: the end goal</h3>
<p>Such institutions help investors, but there is a lot corporates can be doing to overcome regional nuances, explains Penna: “It goes back to good old-fashioned treasury risk management. For example, when buying a substantial asset in a market which is quite restricted, ask yourself if it’s possible to borrow in local currency in order to create a natural hedge between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.”</p>
<p>And corporates are willing to take this on; as Low explains, the heightened momentum over the AEC has been a catalyst for foreign direct investments. Many multinational and large companies are making decisions now to invest and grow in the ASEAN markets in the next five years, and overall integration within ASEAN is beginning to help corporates obtain faster financing, improve trade document transfer and increase transparency, allowing for better governance and risk management. Whether the whole of ASEAN can exceed the sum of its parts remains to be seen. However the AEC pans out, “harmonisation is a great dialogue for the ASEAN countries to be having because it certainly supports any AEC-type initiative, perhaps even more than the international accords themselves,” concludes Katkov.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>ASEAN presents rich growth potential. With a combined population of over 600 million, the region’s GDP is projected to reach $3.2trn by 2019. Significant consumer growth will drive expansion, with GDP expected to increase by 5.4% annually over the next four years<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Unlike Africa’s growth, which is heavily driven by infrastructure investment, ASEAN’s rising middle income classes are expected to spur huge consumer demands. Therefore, multinationals (MNCs) are keen to tap these markets as a major part of their global expansion plans. This is evident in ASEAN’s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, totaling $122bn in 2013, which soared 25% per year on average<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> over the past 14 years. The inflow of FDI into ASEAN has already surpassed China’s.</p>
<p>The AEC’s objective is to create a single integrated market across the region’s ten countries. This promises to bring significant growth opportunities for ASEAN nations and companies operating in the region – enabling easier movement of goods, services, investment, capital and people. As trade barriers gradually come down with greater regional co-ordination, we expect marked growth in intra-Asia trades, and the emergence of new corridors for ASEAN-China, ASEAN-US, and ASEAN-Japan trades. These opportunities offer new ways for companies to co-ordinate supply chains, or open doors to new markets for established products.</p>
<h3 id=""creating-cohesion-from-diversity"">Creating cohesion from diversity</h3>
<p>How will the world look with the formation of the AEC? It is early days and questions remain, but the relentless pace of progress continues and new policies brought forward by the AEC will allow nations to reposition themselves by designating investment in certain chosen industries that leverage their expertise and their people’s skillsets. An AEC passport will also allow freer flow of human resources, meaning a greater mobility of talents and intra-region knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>ASEAN nations have already committed investments to develop comparative advantages and augment each country’s expertise. In the long run, diverse specialisations will play to the region’s collective strength as an economic community. For example, Singapore is positioned as the region’s biotechnology hub, while Thailand is focused on becoming a world leader in the automobile and information technology (IT) space.</p>
<p>Each country’s industry focus will hinge on which multinationals they attract to locate their base there. Samsung has made significant investments to expand its mobile phone production in Vietnam. Moreover, the company’s recent investment, making Malaysia its largest offshore base outside Korea, could propel the nation’s IT industry developments. Similarly, multinational companies are starting to make strategic assessments for their ASEAN game plan to determine positioning, investments, and resource allocations. Deciding which ASEAN countries to invest in depends on a host of factors. Many US companies with business process outsourcing and call centre services naturally gravitate towards the Philippines, with its large English-speaking domestic labour force.</p>
<h3 id=""building-competitive-advantage"">Building competitive advantage</h3>
<p>Many multinational and large companies are making decisions now to invest and grow in the ASEAN markets in the next five years. They tell us they need solutions today, before the dust over AEC settles. Despite the fact that payment and regulatory barriers remain in place for now, Citi has already been working with leading companies in the fast-moving consumer goods, healthcare and insurance sectors to expand their operations and optimise their treasury structures as they grow in ASEAN. In fact, the rise of MNC investments into ASEAN has resulted in a greater need for transactional banking support for their in-country operations to seamlessly connect with their regional treasury centres (RTCs) and global headquarters.</p>
<h3 id=""banking-on-deep-roots"">Banking on deep roots</h3>
<p>Since opening our first branches in the ASEAN region in 1902, Citi now has 55 branches covering 22 cities across eight countries and has worked with ASEAN governments to develop their financial infrastructure. This head start has enabled us to continuously introduce market-leading solutions and infrastructure ahead of the curve. Citi also operates one of the largest correspondent bank networks across the region, covering key markets such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. We have set up 8,000 and 6,000 collection points in Thailand and Indonesia, respectively.</p>
<p>As MNCs expand across ASEAN’s fragmented markets, their treasury management requirements become more sophisticated. Hence, they see value in leveraging Citi’s globally consistent, locally compliant capabilities including cross-border payment solutions for imports, customs duties and corporate taxes, supply chain financing programmes, and corporate card solutions. Through our e-banking platforms such as CitiDirect, companies connect with their regional and global treasuries seamlessly.</p>
<p>Citi’s ASEAN strategy is to leverage our deep roots in the region, sound understanding of local nuances, and unmatched global banking infrastructure to provide value-added solutions that help companies to grow their business – improving efficiency of their finance operations and driving profitability in an increasingly competitive and volatile environment. The ability to provide country insights, digital solutions and working capital advisory is highly valued by clients.</p>
<h3 id=""whats-next"">What’s next?</h3>
<p>While ASEAN works towards the goal of freer movement of labour and capital, and tighter integration, the free flow of resources will happen gradually, step by step, sector by sector. Nevertheless, the heightened momentum and rhetoric over the AEC has been a catalyst for foreign direct investments.</p>
<p>For companies focused on global expansion, ASEAN has become an increasingly important strategic opportunity. Treasurers need not wait till all business, regulatory and technology frameworks are in place to capitalise on the region’s growth potential. Monitor the competition now and explore the potential cost efficiencies of integrating operations across the region. Treasurers can leverage advanced analytics tools to track payment trends and trade flows, gaining industry benchmarking insights for their businesses in ASEAN.</p>
<p>The Asia growth story is about more than China and India – ASEAN’s growing economic prowess will add new opportunities for sales, investment and engagement within the wider region, and expand its influence on the world stage.</p>

<p>The Chinese currency’s adoption in commercial flows for goods and services also continues its strong momentum. Initial pilots with intercompany flows have expanded to third-party payments and collections in RMB. There are clear financial and operational advantages for onshore parties, from reduced hedging and transaction costs, simpler documentation requirements and faster payment cycle times. Commercial discounts are becoming the norm for settlements in RMB, according to market sources. Entire industry sectors transacting in foreign currency with China could benefit by redenominating flows in RMB.</p>
<p>RMB hubs serve as conduits for transactions between counterparties onshore and offshore for both commercial trade and financial purposes. Hong Kong has maintained its competitive edge with the largest pool of liquidity from retail and wholesale RMB deposits and financial products in RMB. Initiatives such as extended clearing hours for real-time gross settlement in Hong Kong to cover business hours in Europe and North America, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, denominated in RMB, supports continuing growth in value and volume of RMB transactions.</p>
<p>Some of the hubs will play a role in facilitating specific RMB flows in their respective markets. The RMB leg of foreign exchange flows in London may be convenient to settle through that city’s hub, if London’s financial community fully supports it and participates. Likewise, the flows through the Luxembourg hub might be highly correlated to the investment funds business.</p>
<p>The challenge for China is the RMB user-experience. While economic considerations will be the main drivers, the RMB also needs to be as user-friendly as other currencies for adoption to continue. Provided that simple and clear payment instructions can be exchanged, processing time frames and value dates are defined and respected, the risk factors are clear, and transaction costs are minimised, adoption of the RMB should continue.</p>
<p>There is great anticipation from all parties for the China International Payments System (CIPS), which is expected to streamline the current process for global payments denominated in RMB by connecting to the China National Advanced Payment System (CNAPS), a domestic payments infrastructure platform. It is likely to reduce the flows through all but the largest hubs. The launch date for CIPS has still to be confirmed, but People’s Bank of China and other Chinese banks are working diligently to upgrade CNAPS and simplify and standardise the routing instructions. The RMB needs operational efficiency as part of its global march towards internationalisation.</p>

<p>The RMB is now the most active currency used by Asia for payments with China and Hong Kong. From 2012 to 2015, the Chinese currency moved from position number five to the top currency used in Asia Pacific to do business with Greater China. On average, 31% of payments in Asia Pacific with China and Hong Kong are now made in RMB. This growth is driven by the increase of RMB usage in most Asian countries to trade directly with China and Hong Kong. The new appointments of four clearing centres (South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia) within the region should also have a positive impact on RMB adoption, solidifying the important role of the currency within Asia Pacific but also abroad. Overall, the RMB remains the fifth most active currency for global payments, accounting for 2.07% of payments worldwide in 2013.</p>
<p>International usage of the RMB is in its early days. However, there are many benefits to be achieved through the liberalisation and promotion of the use of RMB beyond China’s borders. Chinese corporates, in particular SMEs, can use RMB for cross-border trade instead of a foreign currency and avoid FX costs and exchange risks. In addition, foreign corporates paying in RMB can do business with more corporates in China, thus increasing the overall size of trade.</p>
<p>Large corporates can manage their RMB more globally and, over time, diversify their assets and protect against depreciation of one currency. From a macroeconomic point of view, a third ‘world currency’ could be beneficial – particularly one from Asia, in which countries could hold their reserves, especially as trade between Asian countries increases. During the recent financial crisis, banks in some Asian economies that use the US dollar experienced liquidity issues because of the increased cost of funding.</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese FX market has expanded rapidly amid China’s partial relaxation of its capital account and a jump in offshore RMB trading. The Chinese authorities have provided intraday funds of up to RMB 10bn to authorised institutions participating in RMB business in Hong Kong to ease concerns about CNH liquidity upon the launch of the HK-Shanghai Connect. This, along with the ‘dim sum’ bond market, has further opened up Chinese onshore equity and bond markets. These moves have led to greater international flows into RMB, driven by institutional investors and this jump in the volume of liquidity and foreign-market players has coincided with a reversal of bets on the Chinese currency as a one-way appreciation play.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Looking to the Western world, use of the RMB from a payment perspective is showing strong growth and rightly so – the benefits can be plenty. Potential price discounts continue to be the primary reason corporates choose to denominate their trade settlement in RMB. And according to HSBC’s recent RMB Internationalisation Survey, some corporates are already enjoying meaningful discounts.</p>
<p>This year’s survey also revealed two more drivers behind the decision to settle cross-border transactions in RMB. Firstly, more corporates are getting requests from their trading counterparts in China to settle in RMB. Previously, Chinese corporates were reluctant to consider their home currency but over the past few years, there’s been a marked improvement in Chinese companies’ understanding of the benefits of receiving payments in RMB. Thus, requests from trading counterparts in China are becoming an additional driver for Western corporates to consider RMB trade settlement.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is an increased interest in using the RMB to carry out and settle cross-border trade deals due to the associated reduction in FX risk and costs at both ends of the buyer/supplier chain. Using RMB becomes quite obvious when coupled with a potential pricing discount from a Chinese supplier as they can get rid of the FX premium built into the US dollar pricing. From an overseas buyer’s perspective, if they are managing FX in offshore markets, they will have access to more sophisticated hedging products and greater pricing transparency if they agree to settle in RMB.</p>
<p>Of course, the RMB’s journey to becoming an internationalised currency has not always been smooth – but the challenges can largely be categorised into three main obstacles.</p>
<p>One consistent challenge is educating global companies about the benefits of using RMB. Outside of China and Hong Kong, companies often have a lower understanding of the increasing liberalisation of the RMB. Indeed, one of the misconceptions we seek to address is that the aim of promoting the RMB is to replace the dollar as a settlement currency for trade. In reality, banks are providing RMB settlement as an additional currency option for companies to consider. For example, when Western corporates get a dual quotation from their Chinese supplier, their bank should be able to advise them on which currency is of greatest commercial benefit for them.</p>
<p>From an end-to-end operational perspective, preparing a company for the flexibility of RMB adoption means they need to take action on RMB settlement today, to ensure they are RMB-ready. Each business operation is different and being RMB-ready opens up opportunities for the future.</p>
<p>Another issue for corporates to consider is whether price discounts are available with their buyer/supplier relationship. Sometimes receiving dual quotations from Chinese suppliers typically used to pricing in dollars can be problematic. Price discounts might not be available in all instances and it is important to partner with a bank that is strongly positioned both within and outside China and that can undertake a benefit assessment with each client.</p>
<p>The good news is that recent changes are making trading in RMB increasingly easy. The Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ), for example, provides benefits for settling RMB with international markets with further streamlined processes, as well as providing SFTZ entities the choice between a CNY (onshore) or CNH (offshore) foreign exchange rate. Another upcoming change is the introduction of the China International Payments Systems (CIPS). Currently, due to local clearing systems being used to settle cross-border payments, RMB cross-border payment processing isn’t considered internationally standardised. CIPS is an important infrastructure development for RMB clearing globally and is expected to launch in the later part of this year.</p>
<p>Finally, the potential inclusion of RMB into the IMF’s special drawing rights (SDRs) is increasing confidence in holding and using the RMB for trade settlement, investment, financing, and for reserve purposes.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>With the exception of Australia and New Zealand, Oceania is ranked by the UN as a developing region. Of course, discussion of Oceania would not be complete without mention of the region’s only developed countries, but this article endeavours to focus on the local highlights and Australia and New Zealand’s business connections with the rest of the region.</p>
<p>The collection of island countries has experienced diverse economic development paths. For many of these developing nations, agriculture, fishing and tourism are key industries. Eighty percent of Vanuatu’s population and 70% of Fiji’s works in agriculture, for instance, and canned tuna accounts for 93% of exports in American Samoa. Other major exports from the region include coconut oil, palm oil, coco and sugar, but natural resources of lead, zinc, nickel and gold are also mined on some islands.</p>
<p>There have been some rather interesting exports over the years too. Tuvalu, for instance, hit the international news in 1998 when the country sold its internet suffix (.tv) to a Californian company for an advanced payment of $50m (£33m). As more than half the country’s GDP at the time and with the promise of more revenue to follow, the ten-square-mile island made quite a splash at the start of the internet boom. Such opportunities are not regular for these isolated islands, however.</p>
<p>Indeed, many countries lean on the region’s front-runners Australia and New Zealand – among other donor nations and organisations – for foreign aid. Australia and New Zealand often have arrangements together (in the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau, for example) and are typically the largest aid donors. But the political landscape is changing slightly, notes Deva De Silva, Senior Country Officer for IFC in East Asia and the Pacific. “China is also now an important donor and development partner for some of these countries.”</p>
<h3 id=""regional-patchwork"">Regional patchwork</h3>
<p>The economic landscape of Oceania exhibits not only variation between the region’s developing and developed countries but variation between the island nations themselves. Nauru, for instance, has been forecast impressive growth rates of 10% and 8% for 2014 and 2015 respectively. Although the smallest island country in the world (with a population of approximately 10,086), it is now on the global radar because of infrastructure developments. The Regional Processing Centre (RPC), originally reopened in 2012 for asylum seekers looking for refugee status in Australia currently employs around 200 Nauruans and is set for expansion. Thus, a boost to consumption, expenditure and growth is predicted.</p>
<p>With one of the largest populations in Oceania, PNG is also one of the fastest growing economies in the world with predicted growth rates of 6% for 2014 and 21% for 2015. The bright future for the country’s economy is driven by liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to Asia. A $19bn LNG plant in PNG’s highlands began production in April last year and is expected to produce 6.9m tons of LNG per feed. With two more gas projects being developed, PNG could become a crucial energy producer for Asia.</p>


<blockquote>It’s a tough region as the countries are small and all far from global markets. Isolation makes the economies quite weak and poor infrastructure often gets highlighted as the key limitation for private sector growth.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Deva De Silva, Senior Country Officer, IFC in East Asia and the Pacific</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Across the rest of the region, other instances of growth include tourism for the Cook Islands where economic growth has been linked to a 11.2% increase in visitor arrivals between 2011 and 2013. Similarly, Fiji – the only country amongst the pacific island nations not included in the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) aiming to help the world’s poorest countries – beat expected number of arrivals in 2012 by over double, with around 600,000 tourists visiting. In fact, Fiji acts as a regional hub and is a focal point for business activity in the Pacific region. Fiji’s international airline, Fiji Airways, operates 400 flights a week throughout the Pacific. The country also offers international shipping services and three international submarine cables land in Fiji.</p>
<p>However, evident of the disparity between island countries, other countries struggle to optimise their potential. Tonga, for instance, is a relatively poor nation with a narrow industry base focused around farming of a limited range of crops and Kiribati experiences problems transporting goods due to its 33 islands being spread over a vast distance.</p>
<h3 id=""developing-economies-the-challenges"">Developing economies: the challenges</h3>
<p>As such, growth for the majority of these developing Pacific countries is no easy task. De Silva explains that “it’s a tough region as the countries are small and all far from global markets. Isolation makes the economies quite weak and poor infrastructure often gets highlighted as the key limitation for private sector growth.” Economic stability is also vulnerable to external shocks – largely due to the nations’ limited resources.</p>


<blockquote>Opportunities for growth are set to expand as more companies and investors see the region’s potential.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>One example of this vulnerability is the natural disaster which recently struck Vanuatu. “There was a category five cyclone there in March this year – which is both a tragedy and a logistic challenge for businesses,” explains Michael Murphy, CEO for mobile communications provider, Digicel Pacific. “We managed to get our mobile network back up within five days but I think a lot of people forget that in this region we have very different terrains. Building locations and connectivity into these markets is very challenging and will remain so until the infrastructure starts to improve over a longer period.”</p>
<p>Moreover, ANZ notes several challenges associated with doing business in Oceania’s developing countries: the limited avaliability for overseas businesses to own land in Samoa; the 820 indigenous languages spoken across PNG and the corrupton that can exist within parts of the public service, as well as in PNG’s business environment; and stringent controls over cross-border payments from Fiji are but a few examples.</p>
<h3 id=""what-needs-to-done"">What needs to done?</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, opportunities for growth are set to expand as more companies and investors see the region’s potential. As De Silva explains: “Although they are not always seen as strategic countries, there are donors from across the globe investing in Pacific island countries. It is amazing that some of these countries – even the smallest with only 30-50,000 people – will have up to 40 active donor partners.”</p>
<p>In addition, privatisation of public utilities by many of the governments in Oceania is opening up opportunities for forward thinking companies. Digicel Pacific, for example, has taken on the challenge of establishing operations in the region (described by Murphy as “up mountains and down rivers”), and, according to De Silva, “has absolutely changed the landscape in terms of telephone usage, the efficiencies of telephone usage, the cost of usage and its reach.” The telecoms company now boasts expansion over six pacific countries (Vanuatu, Samoa, PNG, Tonga, Fiji and Nauru), including 4G in two markets.</p>
<p>Before Digicel, each of these six countries had government-owned single monopoly telephone operators which were inefficient, costly and limited to urban areas. Certainly, the dialogue around private sector investment in such areas is increasing and De Silva predicts in the next few years that “we will see the Pacific governments pursuing private sector investment as a priority for economic sustainability and growth.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-helping-hand"">A helping hand</h3>
<p>South Pacific Business Development (SPBD) is one example of an organisation assisting companies in the region with the identification of opportunity and provision of financial support at the other end of the scale of opportunity. Inspired by the pioneering organisation in microfinance, Grameen Bank, SPBD targets the base of the economic pyramid in four pacific island countries: Samoa, Tonga, Fiji and the Solomon Islands. “The top 20% of the population in the South Pacific have most of the wealth, education and business connections meaning a lot of the existing financial services and development is channelled through them. But if you are going to achieve improvements to the quality of life for the masses, then you need to do it through a vehicle like us,” explains Greg Casagrande, Founder and President of SPBD.</p>
<p>“Due to the small-sized nature of Oceania’s developing economies, there are very few formal waged employment opportunities. SPBD enables individuals to be self-employed, invest in capital equipment and increase their productivity to enhance their income.” By providing training on loan applications, granting those loans without the requirement of collateral and maintaining ongoing business guidance, SPBD “empowers people at the grass roots level through getting them established privately.” That, according to Casagrande, “is what’s sustainable and scale-able.” Indeed, such opportunities help leverage a business environment where the private sector can flourish.</p>
<h3 id=""doing-business-in-oceania"">Doing business in Oceania</h3>
<p>Problematic for both corporates and entrepreneurs alike, however, is the limited access to finance in Oceania. With the exception of Fiji, in the majority of countries, less than 20% of the population have access to finance. “The banking sector faces the same challenges that a corporate would because of limited access to actual infrastructure,” explains Murphy. Moreover, “traditional banks that demand collateral or formal wages end up excluding 80% of the population from any sort of financing,” says Casagrande.</p>
<p>Reliance on cash is particularly problematic for entrepreneurs as they have to travel long distances to deposit money at distant bank branches. But a new trend has been emerging where banking services can be available at their fingertips using technology. Several initiatives have launched where payments and transfers can be completed using mobile phones – so although consumers and businesses may be geographically remote, they can be connected to their banking provider. Money can then be withdrawn from electronic funds transfer machines or at local shops operating as agents for the banks. Currently, BSP, ANZ and Westpac are all implementing electronic and/or mobile banking platforms.</p>
<p>For larger corporates, research must be undertaken into which banks can support their local needs. ANZ, for example, has a regional operations hub in Fiji’s capital city, Suva, and operates branches with corporate services in many of the island countries.</p>
<h3 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>The reliance on external support and investment, as discussed earlier in this article, is recognition of the tough conditions that economic and social development face in the small island countries of Oceania going forward. Although the majority of Oceania’s nations are likely to remain aid-dependent for some time, the nature of dependency has the potential to reach a point at which financial assistance could support budget implementation by governments, rather than dominating it.</p>
<p>The reason – change is beginning to occur: “A while back, the governments in the region seemed happy enough to receive aid and manage bilateral relations. In the last five years, however, we have seen a marked improvement in the way governments are engaging with the importance of the private sector,” explains IFC’s De Silva. Pacific governments seek (increasingly so) to build a greater capability to respond to operational and business challenges, attracting investor attention along the way.</p>



<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Top tips for Oceania’s future</h2>

<p>In order to increase the region’s appeal, Casagrande has the following recommendations (or rather, wish list):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Maintaining security.</h5>
<p>Ensuring there is peace on the islands is extremely important to their future economic well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increasing skill levels.</h5>
<p>Trying to further enhance educational opportunities for everybody would increase the notably low skill levels in the Pacific Islands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Further disseminate laws.</h5>
<p>Promoting transparency and the effective function of the central banks would improve the attractiveness of the business environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Investment-friendly tax systems.</h5>
<p>Amongst the pacific island countries, there are some high withholding taxes that can go up to 35%. Building a more attractive tax regime would incentivise investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Changing property rights.</h5>
<p>Currently, it is difficult to get clean title as a lot of land is communally held. This is a concept many overseas investors find challenging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Improving air connections.</h5>
<p>There is a surprising lack of direct flight connections between the islands. In fact, Tokelau is only accessible by boat twice a month from Samoa and travellers face a 26 hour journey – even in good weather!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the capacity for economic management within Central Asian countries was limited; development strategies were centrally planned in Moscow.</p>
<p>It comes as little surprise, then, that these five countries faced economic shocks when transitioning from central planning to independence. Due to new national borders, mismanagement problems and evolving issues with supply links and demand sources were faced – and in the end, each country chose a different transition path to market economy.</p>
<p>Tajikistan’s economy, due to waging a civil war, underachieved for the most part of the 1990s. However, recognition as one of the stand-out global improvers in the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Doing Business 2015 report indicates promise. The report also acknowledges the government’s Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported strategic priority to remove binding constraints to private sector growth as a positive move.</p>
<p>Whilst the Kyrgyz Republic claimed, in 2011, the first peaceful transition of power in the region, its economy has been hindered by corruption and stagnation. The National Sustainable Development Strategy, launched in 2013, aims to build a stable economic growth by 2017. In line with this, ADB announced a $22m grant to address major gaps within the education system in 2015.</p>
<p>Favourable world market conditions for its major export (cotton) and well-governed macroeconomic management ensured Uzbekistan experienced limited economic decline after Russian rule. Recent agriculture growth (nearly 7% in the first half of 2014) is typical of the economic volatility experienced throughout Central Asia. The countries are dependent on a limited number of exports and trade partners. Thus, are vulnerable to changes in demand and other external factors – the weather that produced recent record grain harvest in Uzbekistan is not consistent, for example.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan’s economy has more than doubled in size; GDP per capita rose from $1,515 in 1992 to $11,935 in 2012 – largely due to access to vast amounts of oil resources. But, to achieve the country’s objective of joining the 30 most developed countries by 2050, Kazakhstan must diversify. That said, the country is embarking on major reforms to education and negotiating an accelerated schedule for further integration into several free trade agreements.</p>
<p>In Turkmenistan, the economy is similarly dominated by rich oil and gas reserves, as well as crops. Historically, it hasn’t benefited to the extent that Kazakhstan has due to an absence of adequate export routes. Numerous governmental obstacles also hinder international business activity. However, the National Socio-Economic Development Programme for 2011-2030 does intend to modernise infrastructure and promote FDI.</p>
<h3 id=""regional-economy"">Regional economy</h3>
<p>The combined economies grew by an average rate of 9.7% during 2001-2005. Nevertheless, recent predictions suggest that growth may be over-reliant on volatile sources (commodity exports and remittance flows). Subdued economic activity in Russia – a main trading partner – has resulted in weaker-than-expected growth predictions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of 5.5% in 2014-15 for the Caucasus and Central Asia region, down from 6.6% the previous year.</p>
<p>The IMF’s Regional Economic Outlook suggests four steps that could help minimise the vulnerability faced by the commodities-based economies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Carrying out bold structural reforms to develop worker talent, increase competitiveness, and create an environment conducive to private sector-led growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting inclusive growth through better access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and a deeper, more stable financial system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a diverse and dynamic non-oil tradable sector to diversify the region’s economies and reduce their dependence on oil and gas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuing broad-based, balanced trade integration at both the regional and multilateral levels.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=""progress-in-the-region"">Progress in the region</h3>
<p>As a whole, all of the Central Asian countries are intensifying efforts to expand trade links, increase production and encourage the diversification of commodities-based economies. Indeed, a number of projects, with the shared goal of broader participation in global value chains, do exist. The Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), for instance, has aided communication, trade facilitation and trade and energy policy among Central Asian countries and Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, PRC, Mongolia and Pakistan since 1997.</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Between 2001 and 2014, CAREC invested $24.6 billion in infrastructure and trade, noting that regional co-operation is expanding the commercial opportunities available; trading regimes are being simplified and policy barriers are being broken down.</p>
<p>Reducing reliance on oil and encouraging further diversification of exports would reduce exposure to volatility, increase employment and work towards sustainable growth. “Medium-term economic prospects hinge on the region’s ability to expand production of goods and services for domestic and foreign markets,” reports the World Economic and Financial Surveys 2014 Regional Economic Outlook.</p>
<h3 id=""financial-landscape-and-payments"">Financial landscape and payments</h3>
<p>Looking at the treasury landscape in the region, this too is distinct between the countries.</p>
<p>In Uzbekistan, an established two-tier banking system is headed by the Central Bank of the Republic Uzbekistan, responsible for supervising more than 30 banks and financial institutions. It focuses on: the creation of well-capitalised banks, attracting FDI, avoiding single major shareholder banks, introducing effective payment systems and the cash management of the public budget and of state reserves. In terms of payments, the popularity of payment cards is rapidly increasing; the use of cheques rapidly declining.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Kazakhstan’s two-tier banking system (including 38 commercial banks) is currently experiencing turmoil. Nearly three-quarters of loans are non-performing, a legacy of the pre-crisis property boom. When it comes to payments, the popularity of payment cards has rapidly increased – particularly debit cards which experienced a 36.3% increase in circulation from 2013-2014. Direct debits are widely available but usage is limited.</p>
<p>Tajikistan has a two-tier banking system composed of The National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) and 14 banks (one state bank, nine joint stock banks and four foreign banks). The four largest control 76% of total assets. They are all under the supervision of the NBT with the principal objective of maintaining price stability. A national strategy of poverty reduction is devoted to boosting entrepreneurial activity and expanding micro-lending in the country. Like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the popularity of payment cards is increasing in Tajikistan – but at a slower pace.</p>
<p>The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic supervises 24 commercial banks. Similarly to Tajikistan, the country’s financial landscape has seen growth in the micro-financing and a main objective of the national bank is the maintenance of inflation levels. Further modernisation of payment systems is planned to enable populations, in both cities and rural areas, access to banking services. Accordingly, the popularity of payment cards has rapidly increased – particularly debit cards which experienced a 59.8% increase in circulation from 2012-2013.</p>
<p>In Turkmenistan, banks, including commercial banks, are controlled by the state. There are six state banks and two commercial banks. These commercial banks are prohibited from providing services to state enterprises. With no capital market in the country, the financial system significantly hinders the flow of financial resources.</p>
<h3 id=""making-headway"">Making headway</h3>
<p>Integral to its economic development, Central Asia is making headway in business regulatory reform. The World Bank’s Doing Business 2015 guide reports that, combined with Europe, Central Asia had the largest share of economies making it easier to do business in 2013/14 – 85% implemented at least one regulatory reform.</p>
<p>Looking forward, improvements in the business environment, greater transparency and the countries’ efforts to unlock their land-linked potential, should help them work towards sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Based in Beijing, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) has responsibility for monitoring the country’s balance of payments and foreign exchange positions. Its duties include: participating in the drafting of laws concerning foreign exchange administration, monitoring external credit and debt and cross-border capital flows and managing the foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves and other foreign exchange assets belonging to the State.</p>
<h3 id=""how-the-safe-came-into-being"">How the SAFE came into being</h3>
<p>Until 35 years ago, there was no state authority specifically tasked with the management of foreign exchange in China. In fact, the Bank of China had for a long time looked after the country’s foreign exchange management. But in the spirit of Chinese economic reform under Deng Xiaoping, in February 1979, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) put forward a reform programme for Bank of China that would see the creation of what we now know as the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.</p>
<p>The overall aim of Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms was to open the country up to the outside world and to reverse the Maoist commitment to the ideal of self-reliance (although many were opposed to this radical change in cultural values). China was keen to purchase foreign equipment and technology in order to modernise its economy, but this so-called ‘opening up’ also led to foreign exchange inflows through tourism, exports, and arms sales. The PBoC quickly recognised the importance of establishing an entity to deal with the new foreign currency flows the country would be exposed to and the decision was taken to create the State Administration of Exchange Control (renamed in 1996 to be the State Administration of Foreign Exchange) as a separate entity from the Bank of China, although both would still be part of the larger PBoC.</p>
<p>In March 1979, the Chinese authorities also introduced a foreign exchange retention system as a means of providing incentives to exporters. Under this system, domestic exporters were permitted to retain a certain portion of their foreign exchange earnings, which could be used to import goods over and above the state import plans. Nevertheless, the official exchange rate that the country operated under made exporting expensive, and it became clear that something needed to change.</p>
<p>Soon, the authorities introduced a RMB Internal Settlement Rate (ISR) effective from 1<sup>st</sup> January 1981. According to a paper by Lin Guijun, School of International Trade and Economics, University of International Business and Economics, Beijing and Fulbright Scholar, Department of Economics, Columbia University, New York, “The ISR would cover trade-related foreign exchange transactions. At the same time, the authorities also retained the more appreciated official exchange rate to cover mainly non-trade foreign exchange transactions such as overseas Chinese remittance, tourism, expenditure by foreign diplomatic and business representative offices in China and Chinese diplomatic and business offices abroad, foreign investments, and foreign trade transportation and insurance charges. The adjustments to the official exchange rate were determined by the changes in the value of a basket of currencies.”</p>

<h4>Major functions of the SAFE</h4>

<p>The ISR was operational until 1984, when the challenges caused by a dual exchange rate system became too much and the Chinese authorities gave in to pressure from the International Monetary Fund to abolish the ISR. This marked the beginning of the next round of reform, which although too wide-reaching to explain in this article, saw the establishment of a foreign exchange swap market in China.</p>
<p>A series of further reforms saw the country work towards current account convertibility, whilst also laying some of the groundwork for capital account convertibility. In 1994, for example, China reformed its foreign exchange system, combining the renminbi exchange rates, and launching the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CEFTS) – a unified inter-bank foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Then, on 1<sup>st</sup> December 1996, after a series of pilot schemes, as well as the promulgation of the “Regulation on Foreign Exchange Sale, Purchase and Payment,” China formally accepted Article Eight of the IMF’s Agreement on International Currencies and Funds, and realised the goal of current account convertibility. To mark this milestone and herald the beginning of a new era, the State Administration of Exchange Control was renamed the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.</p>
<p>Since then, we have seen a greater variety of financial businesses being established in China. New sub-sectors have also been introduced into the Chinese financial industry such as consumer credit, securities investment funds and investments linked with insurance.</p>
<h3 id=""then-and-now"">Then and now</h3>
<p>Today, the SAFE is a deputy-ministerial-level state administration. Apart from its Communist Party of China (CPC) Committee, the SAFE Head Office consists of eight functional departments. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>General Affairs Department (Policy and Regulation Department).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance of Payments Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current Account Management Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capital Account Management Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supervision and Inspection Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reserves Management Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human Resources Department (Internal Auditing Department).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science and Technology Department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also four institutions affiliated with the SAFE, including the Central Foreign Exchange Business Centre, Information Centre, General Services Centre, and the Editorial Office of the Foreign Exchange of China journal.</p>
<h3 id=""branch-network"">Branch network</h3>
<p>According to its website, the SAFE sets up branches and administrative offices in different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities either directly under the Central Government or with a vice-provincial status. In addition, the SAFE establishes a number of central sub-branches and sub-branches in some cities and counties across China. As of the end of 2013, the SAFE network consisted of the following:</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the SAFE has a subsidiary in Hong Kong called the SAFE Investment Company which was formed in 1997. Another avenue for managing the country’s growing foreign currency reserves (<a href=""#chart-1"">see Chart 1</a>), the fund is able to invest in a wide variety of instruments including foreign and domestic equities and fixed income securities.</p>
<p>SAFE also has subsidiaries in Singapore, London and New York. The newest of these is the US branch, which analysts believe invests mainly in private equity, real estate and other alternative asset classes.</p>

<h3 id=""people-behind-the-institution"">People behind the institution</h3>
<p>In early 2014, the financial press was shocked to learn that Zhu Changhong, an American-trained fund manager who returned to his native China to help invest the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves, had left his position as Chief Investment Officer at the Beijing office of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.</p>
<p>One of Zhu’s main tasks had been to assist with finding alternative investments that offered similar safety and security to US Treasuries. The Wall Street Journal, reporting on Zhu’s departure, noted that “In June 2010, just after Zhu started at the agency, about 45% of China’s reserves, or $1.11 trillion, were invested in US government bonds, according to an analysis by ChinaScope Financial, a provider of financial data. Since then, China’s overall purchases of US debt increased, but Zhu steadily helped reduce the percentage devoted to Treasuries to about 35%, or $1.29 trillion, in September 2013, the most recent figures available.”</p>
<p>Although both sides declined to comment on the departure, some analysts cited internal politics as a catalyst. And Yi Gang, Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) and Administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), is no stranger to this. Professor Yi Gang has long argued that China should slow the growth of the country’s foreign reserves or even reduce them. He has suggested allowing the market to play a bigger role in determining China’s exchange rate, for example. But these suggestions have largely fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Other key members of the SAFE’S Management Team include Deng Xianhong, Fang Shangpu, Wang Xiaoyi and Li Chao – all of whom have the title ‘Deputy Administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)’. Finally, Yang Guozhong is the Head of the Discipline Inspection Group of the CPC Leadership of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Their biographies (which can be found on the SAFE’s website <a href=""http://www.safe.gov.cn"">www.safe.gov.cn</a>) certainly make for impressive reading.</p>
<h3 id=""behind-closed-doors"">Behind closed doors</h3>
<p>What this management team discusses inside the SAFE is, unsurprisingly, largely secret. While the size of the country’s foreign exchange reserves may be public knowledge, for example, analysts can only speculate on how they are invested. One area where there is a great deal of communication around the SAFE’s activities, however, is on updates to often highly detailed rules and regulations. Treasurers operating the region will be more than familiar with the institution’s circulars which inform them of the latest changes.</p>
<p>And in recent months, some of these changes have been extremely high profile. As of 1<sup>st</sup> June 2014, for instance, companies based anywhere in China can establish, with relative ease, centralised foreign currency cash management programmes. While MNCs who accumulate foreign currency onshore previously had the ability to perform two-way transactions independent of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ), the latest measures ease the documentary burdens that were limited to approved companies.</p>
<p>Now, there is no longer a need for each individual entity to submit supporting documents to the SAFE for each and every trade transaction. Instead, qualified multinationals in China can set up a payment-on-behalf-of (POBO) or receipt-on-behalf-of (ROBO) structure simply by filing a single request at their local SAFE branch. The local SAFE branch co-ordinates the filing with the SAFE HQ and certification process in the specified time frame.</p>
<p>This easing of the rules was seen as a huge step forward – not only for the corporates, but also for the SAFE – which is often criticised for its slow and onerous procedures and for stretching the ‘phase by phase’ approach to deregulation too far. But in the SAFE’s defence, with the significant burden of responsibility on its shoulders, it is understandable that the regulator wants to be thorough – and the detailed nature of the SAFE’s rule changes is often easier for treasurers to follow than the somewhat ‘grey’ announcements from the PBoC.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of the SAFE therefore requires patience and understanding. It also requires a good relationship – the SAFE (and the PBoC for that matter) operates in consultation with banks and corporates. Therefore, having the right lines of communication, whether through your bank, or direct with the regulator, can be a significant advantage in building an effective treasury function in China.</p>
<p>As PWC says in its guide to doing business in the country, “Companies in good standing with SAFE may have better insight into managing the approval process and may be able to contribute to new policies as they are developed and introduced. In addition, as the government is inclined to experiment with new liberalisation policies, working closely with SAFE may provide some perspective, in assisting SAFE in its reform efforts, while also improving treasury’s effectiveness.”</p>

APAC treasury in 2015: all change?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>The start of a new calendar year always comes with a wave of optimism and enthusiasm. In recent years, however, this has often been quickly extinguished as the reality of global conditions strikes home and corporates are faced with new and increasingly difficult challenges. Indeed, 2014 was full of economic, infrastructural and political developments that stretched the patience of treasurers in APAC.</i></p>
<p>One of the big stories was the slowdown in economic growth across many of the region’s key economies, not least China and India. In China for example, the forecasted 7.4% growth rate, while still impressive, has raised certain questions around the reform agenda and its continued trajectory. With a geopolitical environment that looks increasingly uncertain, it’s not difficult to imagine treasurers, ever watchful for signs of heightened volatility in financial markets, heading into 2015 with a slight sense of trepidation.</p>
<p>“I think the macroeconomic issues are the ones that most treasurers will wake up thinking about on 1<sup>st</sup> January,” says Paul Taylor, Regional Sales Head, GTS EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We’ve heard talk in recent weeks about a cooling in the global economy; we’ve seen what’s happened to the price of oil and what that has done to currencies globally, which has in turn had a knock-on impact upon currency valuations. I don’t think anybody can ignore what is happening on that level at the moment.”</p>
<p>Another topic that treasurers will no doubt be focused on as we head in to 2015 is the negative impact that regulation might have on their operations – and ultimately, on the company’s bottom line. In APAC, the headache of regulation is of course exacerbated by the non-uniform approach across the region. There is hope, however, that plans to create an integrated ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015 will solve this issue for a large portion of the region.</p>
<p>The creation of the AEC should also provide new impetus to trade among and with ASEAN communities, which can only be a positive development in what is proving to be a rather sluggish time for global trade (read more about this in our trade article where we look in depth at <a href=""http://treasurytoday.com/2015/01/the-new-trade-paradigm-in-asean-tttr"">the new trade paradigm in ASEAN</a>.)</p>
<h3 id=""what-matters-to-you"">What matters to you?</h3>
<p>Away from the macro view, treasurers will naturally be focused on making their day-to-day operations run as smoothly as possible. Nowhere is this more evident than in the results of the latest Treasury Today Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study, where treasurers in the region were asked to rank their treasury department priorities for 2015, with 1 being the most important (<a href=""#table-1"">see Table 1</a>).</p>

<h3 id=""cash-and-liquidity-concerns"">Cash and liquidity concerns</h3>
<p>Although the top issues remain largely the same as the previous year’s results, with an inevitable focus on working capital, funding and cash management, there are a number of nuances worth highlighting. For instance, does the fact that ‘cash management/cash pooling structures’ have dropped from being the top priority in the 2013 study to the third priority in the 2014 study reflect the fact that regulators in the region – notably China – have made significant moves to improve cross-border liquidity and therefore this will not be such an issue in 2015?</p>
<p>According to the experts, the answer is ‘yes and no’. First of all, “It is important to note that any regulatory changes that have taken place at the end of 2014 in China will not truly be actioned by corporates until 2015,” says Mahesh Kini, Asia Pacific Head of Cash Management Corporates at Deutsche Bank. “The move to allow cross-border RMB sweeping is a good example: all of the activity around designing and implementing solutions on the back of this will continue into 2015. In fact, the majority of the pipeline will be Q1 and Q2 2015, so this will be a large area of focus.”</p>
<p>And as Amol Gupte, Region Head, Asia Pacific, Citi Transaction Services, adds: “When it comes to trapped cash, much progress has certainly been made by the regulators in China, but there is still a lot more that needs to happen before cash can flow freely across borders. For example, CNY and CNH are different currencies with different rates and yield curves, and the extent to which corporates can borrow offshore to name a few, these need to be standardised before we can truly see the end of trapped cash.”</p>
<h3 id=""banking-on-change"">Banking on change</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, it is interesting to see that ‘bank relationships’ has jumped from being the eighth concern in 2013 to the top priority in 2014 – even above ‘funding/credit lines’. This suggests that corporates in the region are now starting to be more strategic about their bank relationships, and having more open conversations around wallet share. In fact, 40% of respondents to the 2014 study said that their lead cash management bank receives between 30-50% of their total cash management wallet.</p>
<p>That said, we cannot ignore the impact – whether direct or indirect – of regulation on banking relationships. According to a speech at a recent conference by Alan Verschoyle-King, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sales and Client Management for BNY Mellon’s Treasury Services, “Global regulatory reform continues to be the largest driver of change and concern within Asia’s banking industry, with many banks struggling to understand the impact of and meet the new requirements.”</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not just APAC-specific regulations that matter. “Given the size and global reach of the US economy, US regulations, in particular OFAC (The Office of Foreign Assets Control), Dodd-Frank and FATCA (The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), have the most substantial direct impact on Asian bank operations, business development and their working relationship with partnership banks,” he said.</p>

<p>So how is this impacting the treasurer? Well, “To meet the new standards, banks are building higher capital and liquidity buffers, as well as re-evaluating their business models with many institutions choosing to focus on their core strengths and key markets. Others are under intense pressure to consolidate and streamline to position for future growth and, in some cases, survive. Whilst consolidation presents opportunities for stronger regional banks to emerge, the reality is many local banks within Asia Pacific remain too small to effectively compete on a local, regional or global scale.”</p>
<p>In short, treasurers are having to carefully re-think their bank allegiances in light of a number of banks retrenching because of regulatory pressures. Domestic and regional legacy relationships are also being reviewed as these might not represent the optimal long-term play in the new regulatory environment, although this largely depends on each company’s situation of course.</p>
<h3 id=""containing-risk-leveraging-technology"">Containing risk, leveraging technology</h3>
<p>Going back to the treasury priorities list, the increased focus on risk is also worthy of note. Counterparty risk did not even feature in the 2013 list, nor did security and fraud. Both have risen up the corporate agenda, thanks to headline-hitting scandals. Furthermore, there is a growing global trend for both regulators and consumers to hold corporates accountable for the actions of the third parties that they choose to interact with – whether these be customers, suppliers, banks, or vendors.</p>
<p>In addition to introducing stricter due diligence processes and internal controls, many companies are revisiting their technology infrastructure – not only to plug any potential security gaps but also to leverage the benefits of straight through processing, analytical programmes, best execution platforms and trends such as big data.</p>
<p>“We believe that ongoing technological innovation and digitisation will be essential to help clients better adapt their operating models to the current trends and shifting market demands. The focus will be on developing treasury management e-solutions that deliver impactful results – making our products simpler, more convenient and flexible, and allowing companies to have improved visibility over their treasury flows in ways that were not previously possible,” notes Citi’s Gupte.</p>
<p>It’s about enabling treasurers to become much more efficient and getting instant access to information, as well as how to get better insights of data analytics to make better informed decisions, he explains.</p>

<p>It is not only treasurers who are taking advantage of evolving technology though – regional payments authorities and governments are too. “On the subject of technology, the region is migrating from paper to electronic payments,” says Kini. “Corporates are increasingly transitioning their payment ecosystem to ‘pay electronic’ – even in countries that tend to use cheques. This is riding on the back of the new payments infrastructure that countries are introducing.”</p>
<p>Patricia Lim, Head of Cash Management, Asia Pacific RBS, is slightly more conservative in her outlook, although she too sees that governments are being more proactive around e-payments: “Many APAC countries are still predominantly cash and cheque-focused – India, Indonesia and Thailand are prime examples here.  As we stand today, electronic payments and collections can only be carried out effectively in countries such as Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. This is because the government in these countries promote e-payments and have spent a lot of money developing their e- payments systems. For example in Singapore, the Association of Banks in Singapore has launched a new electronic funds transfer service, known as FAST (Fast And Secure Transfers).</p>
<p>For treasurers, the benefits of this innovation will be far-reaching. As Kini notes: “The systems can now carry information that helps to identify who is paying, which then helps to reconcile at an invoice level. We believe that e-invoicing will therefore be an increasing priority for the finance function in 2015 and beyond. On the back of this, we are likely to see more 24/7 real-time clearing systems being built too.”</p>
<h3 id=""shared-service-centre-shifts"">Shared service centre shifts</h3>
<p>Another key trend in 2015 will be the continued march towards centralisation – and the establishment of shared service centres (SSCs) says Gupte. “Centralisation remains a key priority for corporates in the APAC region. As we see it, there are four stages to centralisation: operations; standardisation; balance sheet centralisation (funding centrally/pooling) and finally, the in-house bank. The majority of our clients are at the ‘centralising balance sheet’ stage and are looking to implement regional pooling structures and SSCs,” he comments.</p>
<p>And some interesting geographical dynamics are happening in that SSC space. “With ASEAN Economic Community 2015 plans coming into effect, corporates will be looking for opportunities in the region, such as the relaxation of the rules around the movement of liquidity. We will also likely see certain ASEAN countries position themselves as sophisticated hubs to host treasury centres – such as Malaysia– or even to host cross-border structures, something that Hong Kong and Singapore have traditionally dominated,” Kini notes.</p>
<p>“The Philippines is one place to watch,” he adds. “It is an investment grade country, with a young, skilled population. It will increasingly develop into a business process outsourcing (BPO) location and we will see more and more corporates use it as an ASEAN hub.”</p>
<p>Lim, on the other hand, highlights a trend towards near-shoring of SSCs by European and US MNCs.  ""A number of multinational companies are now looking to move their shared service centre (SSC) or treasury centre back to Europe or the US from China. Labour and the cost of living used to be cheap in China, but this is no longer the case in the central and south region.” she explains</p>
<h3 id=""embracing-change"">Embracing change</h3>
<p>All of this gives treasurers much food for thought throughout the next 12 months but, unlike previous years, the tone heading into 2015 is largely positive. While the year ahead of us will undoubtedly challenge the profession at one point or another, the collaborative and more transparent environment that we are now operating in promotes proactivity.</p>
<p>So, rather than simply doing the minimum to meet necessary compliance project deadlines, or to ensure your data is secure, why not use such triggers as an incentive to review and improve existing practices, processes and policies instead. After all, being open to change is the best way to stay ahead.</p>

<p>A little over 130 years after Captain James Cook’s taking possession of the east coast Australia in the name of Great Britain, six colonies that were created in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries federated in 1901 and the Commonwealth of Australia was born. Australia quickly made the most of its natural resource wealth, developing its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, before becoming an internationally competitive, advanced market economy.</p>
<p>One of the most biologically diverse countries in the world, Australia is home to 10% of the world’s biodiversity. It is also the driest inhabited continent on earth, making it particularly vulnerable to the challenges of climate change.</p>
<p>Although it emerged from the 2007/2008 financial crisis less damaged than some other developed economies, Australia has recently been hit by a slowdown in exports, particularly in mineral and commodity exports, which is the country’s largest export sector. A Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics report published in September 2014 forecasted a 1.2% drop in resources and energy export earnings in the period 2014-2015, to A$192 billion (from A$195 billion the previous year).</p>
<p>Despite rising export volumes, the drop in overall exports has been fuelled by falling iron ore and coal prices, stagnating growth in China (a key export partner for Australia), and a weakened Australian dollar.</p>
<p>“The slowdown in exports has been more about prices than about volume,” Felicity Emmett, Senior Economist at ANZ tells Treasury Today Asia. “We have seen a very large fall in the iron ore price this year, from over US$135 at the beginning of the year to around US$80 now. Iron ore alone represents around 20% of Australia’s exports, so this fall in prices has had a material impact on overall export receipts and has seen the country’s trade deficit widen sharply in the last few months. Export volumes are still growing quite strongly and contributing to economic growth – net exports look set to make another solid contribution to growth in 2014.”</p>
<h3 id=""an-economy-in-transition"">An economy in transition</h3>
<p>Looking beyond this commodity export slump, the Australian economy is undergoing something of a transition. As the country’s mining boom tails off, the question is whether other areas will step in to fuel growth.</p>
<p>“This will be an important issue for the Australian economy over the next couple of years,” says ANZ’s Emmett. “Mining investment grew very strongly until recently, from 2% of GDP in 2005 to around 8% in late 2012. This increase was largely made up of a small number of very large, multi-billion dollar projects, especially in the liquefied natural gas sector. Now those projects are coming to completion, we will see mining investment step down very sharply over the next few years, which will act as a real headwind to growth.” The country’s current high export volumes reflect the end product of the mining investment, but other sectors will ultimately have to pick up some of the economic burden. “There will now be a transition from mining growth to non-mining growth – that’s why interest rates are quite low, and are expected to stay low for well into 2015,” adds Emmett.</p>
<p>Dale Luong, Group Treasurer at Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API), is optimistic Australia’s economy can cope with the transition. “The mining investment boom has been the real impetus for economic growth in Australia over the last ten years, and we have seen continuous growth in the Australian economy during this time,” he says. “Even with the slowdown in exports, provided that slowdown is controlled, we shouldn’t see too much of an impact on the economy other than that of a normal transition between industries. As the mining sector cools down, the industrial and services part of the economy will take some of that slack.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There will now be a transition from mining growth to non-mining growth – that’s why interest rates are quite low, and are expected to stay low for well into 2015.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, mining has shaped Australia’s economy in modern times, having both positive and negative effects. In an August 2014 research paper, Australia’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), said the mining boom had “substantially increased Australian living standards.” By 2013, “we estimate that it had raised real per capita household disposable income by 13%, raised real wages by 6% and lowered the unemployment rate by about 1¼ percentage points,” said the RBA. However, mining has also had negative impacts on the Australian economy. “The boom has led to a large appreciation of the Australian dollar that has weighed on other industries exposed to trade, such as manufacturing and agriculture,” explained the central bank. It also said the phenomenon known as the ‘Dutch disease’ – that is the deindustrialisation that sometimes accompanies resource booms – had not been strong in Australia’s case.</p>
<p>Australia has very close links with other countries in the Asia Pacific region, and is a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). China is its main trading partner for both imports and exports by some distance. Its top export partners are China (29.5%), Japan (19.3%), South Korea (8%), and India (4.9%), while its leading import partners are China (18.4%), the US (11.7%), Japan (7.9%), and Singapore (6%). Its close trading relationship with China was given a boost in 2013 when an agreement with Beijing allowed direct convertibility between the AUD and the RMB.</p>
<h3 id=""banking-and-payments"">Banking and payments</h3>
<p>Australia has 21 domestic banks, eight subsidiaries of foreign banks, 41 branches of foreign banks and 15 representative offices of foreign banks. Furthermore, there are nine building societies and 85 credit unions operating in the country. The Australian banking system is highly concentrated and is dominated by the ‘Big Four’ of (in descending order of total assets) National Australia Bank (NAB), Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and Westpac. These four banks account for approximately two-thirds of the banking sector’s total assets. Regulation of the sector by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is separate from the central bank, and this regulation stipulates that a merger of any of the four largest banks is not permitted.</p>

</figure>
<p>Electronic credit transfers account for more than a quarter of all cashless payments in Australia and is the dominant cashless payment instrument in terms of value. Credit transfers accounted for 51.4% of the total value of cashless payments in 2013. Cash remains an important payment medium in Australia, particularly for low‑value retail transactions. Cheque usage has declined by approximately 64% over the past decade due to the increasing preference for electronic payments for both high-value and low-value transactions. The vast majority of cheques are now used for company-to-company transactions or personal transactions.</p>
<p>Direct debits are processed via BECS on a next-day basis and accounted for approximately 9.6% of all cashless payments in 2013 and 37.8% of the total value. In 2013, the volume and value of direct debits processed increased 9.4% and 0.7% respectively on 2012 figures, to 807.53 million transactions, with a total value of A$5,897.64 billion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were approximately 38.1 million debit cards and 15.6 million credit and charge cards in circulation in Australia the end of the first quarter of 2014. Debit and credit card transactions accounted for 40.2% and 23.01% respectively of all cashless payments in 2013.</p>

<p>There were approximately 38.1 million debit cards and 15.6 million credit and charge cards in circulation in Australia at the end of the first quarter of 2014. Debit and credit card transactions accounted for 40.2% and 23.01% respectively of all cashless payments in 2013. In value terms, however, they accounted for just 1.2% and 1.7% respectively. There are two debit card systems in Australia: The EFTPOS system accounts for approximately 85% of the country’s debit card transactions. EFTPOS Payments Australia, a company owned by its 14 founding members, has commercial responsibility for managing and promoting the national EFTPOS network (composed of seven proprietary networks). Australia’s national ATM network is composed of ten proprietary ATM networks; and the system operating under the Visa and MasterCard brands.</p>
<p>RITS (Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System), Australia’s national real‑time gross settlement (RTGS) system, is operated by the RBA. Final settlement of payment system obligations occurs through transactions on exchange settlement accounts (ESAs) at the RBA. More than 90% of interbank payments, by value, are settled on an RTGS basis.</p>
<p>Electronic payments are supported by Australia’s real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system supported by the central reserve bank. At the time of writing, more than 70% of daily transactions are processed through this system.</p>
<p>APCA (Australian Payments Clearing Association Ltd) is responsible for supervising and co-ordinating four different clearing systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HVCS (High-Value Clearing System), an electronic high-value exchange and multilateral net settlement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>APCS (Australian Paper Clearing System), an interbank paper-based exchange and settlement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BECS (Bulk Electronic Clearing System), an interbank bulk electronic exchange and settlement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CECS (Consumer Electronic Clearing System), an exchange and settlement system for card-based EFTPOS and ATM transactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plans are also in place to introduce a real-time payment system for retail payments in 2016.</p>
<p>RITS settles interbank obligations arising from participants’ transactions in Austraclear and the Australian Stock Exchange’s Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System (CHESS), both of which are securities settlement systems. In addition, RITS effects the final settlement of participants’ net balances originating from the country’s other clearing houses.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h3>
<p>API’s Luong says corporates in Australia can expect more or less the same suite of cash and liquidity management services from most banks as their counterparts in Europe or North America. “The Australian market is very well serviced not only by its local banks but also by branches or subsidiaries of foreign banks.”</p>
<p>Notional pooling is allowed between resident and non-resident companies, and cross-border notional pooling is permitted although not widely practised. Cash concentration is also allowed between resident and non-resident companies, and cross-border sweeping is permitted and offered by the larger commercial banks. Cross-border payments are routed via SWIFT and settled through accounts held with correspondent banks abroad.</p>

<p>Electronic banking is offered by Australia’s leading banks, and the Australian Bankers’ Association (ABA), with the aid of the banking community, has developed and established bank-independent electronic banking standards. These standards apply to EFTPOS terminals, ATMs, automated telephone banking and internet banking. Some of the services offered include balance and transaction reporting and domestic and cross-border payment initiation.</p>
<p>Despite its relatively sound banking system and developed payments infrastructure, few MNCs have chosen to establish an Asia Pacific treasury hub in Australia, largely for logistical reasons. “Although the payments system is very strong and robust, the location and time zone often don’t align well with a central treasury operation being based here,” says API’s Luong. “Corporates typically base their regional treasury centres in South East Asia for example, rather than Australia.”</p>
<p>The Australian dollar (AUD) has a free-floating exchange rate, and both domestic currency accounts and foreign exchange accounts can be held by Australian residents domestically and abroad; resident domestic currency accounts are freely convertible into foreign currency via licensed dealers. Non-resident bank accounts are permitted in foreign and domestic currencies, and non-resident domestic currency accounts are also freely convertible into foreign currency via licensed dealers.</p>
<p>Taxation is handled by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and only the federal government taxes corporate income – corporate tax is levied at a rate of 30%. There is no state or municipal tax on corporate income.</p>
<h3 id=""attractive-environment-for-business"">Attractive environment for business</h3>
<p>The spectre of household debt that continues to blight many economies (such as the Eurozone) is not, for the moment at least, a threat to the nation’s economic growth. “Household debt as a proportion of income has been fairly steady at around 150% of household income, which is quite a high level in international terms,” says ANZ’s Emmett. “But many households have been paying off debt at a very rapid rate, and households are paying on average more than A$9,000 extra on their mortgage repayments each year. New housing finance has grown strongly over the past few years, but because people are still paying down debt, credit growth has remained relatively modest so we have not seen household debt as a proportion of incomes pick up at all.”</p>
<p>She adds that this modest level of household debt could in fact be overstated owing to the high proportion of households in Australia who have offset mortgages, which distorts the figure. However, house price inflation is a concern. “The central bank is certainly not concerned about the level of indebtedness of households, although they are starting to worry about house prices in Australia, particularly in the Sydney area, where prices went up around 18% over the last year. A lot of that was driven by investor activity, and the reserve bank is concerned about speculative elements in the housing market, although overall house price growth in an aggregate sense is not at a worrying level,” she says.</p>
<p>“There are certainly a lot of reasons why corporates would want to do business in Australia,” says API’s Luong. “We have a stable political environment, which is a key factor in encouraging business activity, and a fully unrestricted currency which is the fifth-most traded in the world.”</p>

A new ‘superhighway’ for RMB payments,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that the Chinese renminbi is on its way to becoming a major global currency. While the authorities in Beijing continue to liberalise the regulation controlling the flow of currency in and out of the country, the redback has risen (according to SWIFT data) to become the seventh most-used currency in the world in goods and services payments, overtaking 22 currencies in the past three years. Just two years ago, RMB-settled trade only accounted for 1% of China’s trade. Now it accounts for around 10%.</p>
<p>Clearly, RMB is becoming increasingly important: both to China’s international trade ambitions and the rest of the world’s trade ambitions with China. The growing expectation is that the currency will soon be able to attain the status, currently enjoyed by the US dollar, as the world’s reserve currency. However, there is one thing that the renminbi lacks compared with the dollar and other major currencies: a quality payments system in line with established international standards.</p>
<p>“Now that RMB has consolidated its position as a globally used currency, we expect the industry’s attention to shift to discussions on the best architecture for RMB cross-border transactions so the market can reach levels of operational efficiency, risk and liquidity management on par with other globally traded currencies,” Franck de Praetere, Head of Payments and Trade Markets, Asia Pacific, at SWIFT said in a statement earlier this year.</p>
<p>Prataere makes a good point. At present, multinationals trading cross-border with onshore Chinese entities face a number of challenges resulting from the poor efficiency associated with the country’s current patchwork of local payments systems. The root of the problem was that the current systems require a lot of manual intervention at nearly every stage of a transaction. For example, when a Chinese business sells something to an offshore entity, the name of the Chinese seller has to be converted into four-digit codes supported by ISO 20022 and then back to Chinese again for processing. While most global transaction banks use international messaging standards, one-to-one comparisons were not possible under the original CNAPS infrastructure. In addition there are also a host of difficulties in processing non-Latin characters in international transactions and, for European counterparties, the delays caused by time zone differences. With shortcomings such as these it is perhaps no surprise that businesses complain of the price of transactions in China and the time it takes to process them.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities, aware of these challenges, now realise that the renminbi will never reach the status of an international currency unless the payments infrastructure in China is overhauled. That, it seems, is the rationale behind the plan to introduce the Chinese International Payments System (CIPS), announced by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) in April 2012, and the Chinese National Payment System, ‘Mark II’.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-to-grips-with-cips"">Getting to grips with CIPS</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with CIPS. The proposed payment infrastructure has four key elements, each of which should help to make trading renminbi in and out of China more efficient. First and foremost, the new system will provide a renminbi clearing and settlement network that’s fully integrated with the onshore financial system (see Chart 1), thereby enabling cross-border RMB clearing among both onshore and offshore participants. Secondly, the system will be multilingual and apply international reporting standards. Thirdly, it will be able to handle payments across a total of 17 different time zones across every continent simultaneously. And finally, it will run on SWIFT ISO 20022 XML standards, which will allow for optimal mapping between SWIFT message formats and the various CNAPS message formats.</p>

<p>CIPS was originally scheduled for roll-out in 2014; however, the project has been beset by both technological challenges and policy disagreements over how much currency users should be allowed to move in a single day, without undermining the country’s strict capital controls. As such, the roll-out is not expected to arrive on the market before 2016 at the earliest.</p>
<p>“China has been investing tremendous efforts on country clearing infrastructure. Thus we don’t foresee any critical issue to launch the system,” says Cathy Dou, Head of Global Transaction Services, China at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill). “A phased approach may be adopted considering the large geography and complex situation, but we believe the new system will run smoothly when it is eventually launched, based on past experience of successful CNAPS and BEPS implementation.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-new-cnaps"">The new CNAPS</h3>
<p>In the meantime, the PBoC will be focusing its attention on completing the migration of its domestic payment system to the second generation of CNAPS, which it began piloting back in 2010. Like CIPS, the launch is already behind schedule, having been announced for roll-out in 2012. The latest information suggests that it will be fully operational at some point in 2014, although there remains a lack of clarity over the exact timing.</p>
<p>“It will not be a ‘big bang’,” Frankie Au, Head of RMB Products, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered told Treasury Today. “I think over the course of the next year we will see some banks in China begin migrating to the platform. But it will still take some time for the market to get used to the second generation of the platform.”</p>
<p>While CIPS will cater specifically for international transactions, the focus of the next generation of CNAPS will be on improving the infrastructure around the onshore use of renminbi. Development of the original CNAPS began back in the early 1990s but was not launched until 2005. CNAPS, a central bank-operated RMB clearing system, was designed to modernise the domestic payment system in China, handling both bulk electronic payments and large-value fund transfers. Unlike the various systems it replaced, CNAPS did not differentiate between intra- and inter-bank payments, local or national, and enabled an integrated national payments structure providing same-day settlements.</p>
<p>However, CNAPS’s design was, naturally, influenced by the realities and demands of the Chinese economy at that time and, as might be expected in a market changing at such a rapid pace, new demands and realities began to emerge almost as soon as the system became operational. For all its advantages over the systems it replaced, the first generation CNAPS suffers, amongst other things, from a lack of reliable data and information transparency. In order to address these concerns, the PBoC began work on an upgrade in 2010.</p>
<p>Enhancements to the functionality and security level of the existing system will be key features of the new system in development. In addition, CNAPS 2 will, like the forthcoming CIPS infrastructure, introduce ISO 20022-based standards and formats that will support a larger number of transaction types. Once the system has been fully rolled out the hope – or indeed expectation – is that, with a broader number of transaction types supported, banks will be able to greatly enhance the cash management services they provide to corporates.</p>
<h3 id=""stp-at-last"">STP at last?</h3>
<p>So when it does finally arrive what exactly will the arrival of CIPS and CNAPS 2 mean for corporates in China or those offshore but trading with onshore Chinese entities? The hope is that the introduction of a system running on ISO 20022 – which can support an unlimited number of character sets – will eliminate the need for manual intervention and allow corporates in the region to finally achieve end-to-end straight through processing (STP) on their renminbi transactions.</p>
<p>This hope may, however, be misplaced – at least for the immediate future. Unfortunately, before the transactions can be settled, banks will be required to add codes detailing its purposes.</p>
<h3 id=""offshore-hubs-and-the-rmb-superhighway"">Offshore hubs and the RMB superhighway</h3>
<p>While we have been waiting for the PBoC to announce that the new systems are fully operational, other new solutions for international RMB clearing have arrived on the market. In the past year, we have seen the establishment of a host of RMB ‘clearing hubs’ in Europe, as cities such as London, Frankfurt, Paris and Luxembourg compete for a share of the growing volume of RMB-denominated transactions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the development of these clearing hubs, companies in Europe will no longer need to route RMB payments via other financial centres, a development which should, at least hypothetically, mean lower costs when transacting with Chinese onshore counterparties. Also, with the hubs addressing Europe’s time zone disadvantage, the settlement process itself should be much more expedient.</p>
<p>Cheaper and faster payments are something corporates will surely embrace with open arms. Of course, as good as all this sounds, it does raise questions as to the future of the offshore clearing centres that have sprung up in nearly every corner of the world in the past few years. After all, with a direct link between the onshore market and the rest of the world, will these centres not become obsolete?</p>
<p>“For offshore banks, CIPS will allow them to access the RMB clearing system directly, engage in inter-bank clearing nationwide and transact inter-bank bond transactions real-time with counterparties. Therefore, for China’s big clearing banks, and RMB offshore centres like Singapore, CIPS might impact their privileged position,” says BofA Merrill’s Dou.</p>
<p>Others, however, believe CIPS will mostly complement, rather than replace the offshore centres. They say that rather than thinking of CIPS as a replacement, one should look at it as a ‘superhighway’ connecting these dispersed hubs, and fast-tracking their transactions back to the onshore market. To take the analogy a little further, just because a government has built a superhighway to speed up transportation between cities, doesn’t mean that the roads within the cities are now suddenly no longer needed.</p>
<p>Each of the markets in which offshore clearing hubs have been established have their own specialisation and should continue to attract a share of the global renminbi business. “In international payments and transactions the role of common global standards is very important in supporting the development of the RMB currency internationally. But CIPS doesn’t necessarily take away the need for having some of the offshore centres as well,” says Michael Moon, Head of Payments and RMB, Asia Pacific at SWIFT.</p>
<p>Singapore, for example, seems like a natural hub for South East Asia. France, similarly, is an important player in a number of the African markets that have become valuable trading partners of China’s in recent years. There will also be opportunities, he adds, to get involved in different types of transactions – such as securities – besides plain vanilla payments. “That way they can move up the value chain as well. There is plenty of room in the RMB market for different types of services and infrastructure,” Moon adds.</p>
<h3 id=""redback-released"">Redback released</h3>
<p>Evidently, the CIPS and CNAPS 2 payments systems are developments that corporates and transaction bankers have high hopes for. China does, of course, have a bit of a patchy record when it comes to big infrastructural changes such as these. To expect that things are going to change overnight may, then, be a little over-optimistic.</p>
<p>But once the PBoC eventually manages to get the new systems in place and fully functioning without any hiccups, there is every reason to believe it will mark the start of a new era with RMB, by then, well on its way to becoming the global reserve currency so many experts have prophesised it will be.</p>

<p><i>After nearly a decade of dizzying growth, Asia Pacific economies are now entering a challenging phase. Although growth rates in the region remain at relatively strong levels, events like the ongoing normalisation of US monetary policy, real estate concerns in China and an anaemic recovery in much of the developed world are now weighing heavily on the region’s prospects.</i></p>
<p>Much of the Asia region is also in a state of political flux. In just the past year, the political backdrop has changed considerably with new governments elected in India and Indonesia, a radical set of fiscal and monetary policies known as ‘Abenomics’ introduced in Japan and, perhaps most significant of all, a programme of economic liberalisation continuing to gather pace in China.</p>

<p>Against this uncertain political and economic backdrop, corporates in Asia have become increasingly focused on achieving better control and visibility over liquidity. Here, treasurers are looking for the means to overcome ‘trapped cash’ issues so they can move liquidity more seamlessly between Asia’s tightly regulated markets and the other markets they operate within globally.</p>

<p>This is particularly true of multinationals in China where treasurers have long aspired to be able to manage liquidity there in the same way that they do in other parts of the world. Thanks to a raft of recent reforms from the PBoC and SAFE, they are now close to realising that ambition. Today, firms operating in the country are increasingly able to release their trapped cash by using a range of new schemes that give them the ability to integrate renminbi into their regional or global cash pools.</p>

<p>“I think that the pace of regulatory change has begun to accelerate over the past few months,” says Munir Nanji, Asia Pacific Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “There is certainly a lot more transparency now than a year ago. Now our clients in China who have substantial revenues in the local currency are able to mobilise their previously trapped liquidity and use it across the world, as and when they need it.”</p>

<p>China is the largest, most significant market to embark upon a programme of financial deregulation, but it is by far from being the only one. “We see the same thing in a host of other countries,” says Nanji. “Whether it is India, Vietnam or Indonesia, treasurers are asking us how they can centralise cash management and achieve better control over the money that is sitting in their various accounts. Essentially, it is about improving the way liquidity is collected globally and overcoming trapped cash issues first and, secondly, accessing structures that optimise the way in which money is distributed within countries.”</p>

<p>These are the broad, overarching trends that Citi is seeing at the regional level in Asia. If one looks more closely at the different business sectors within the region, however, each presents their own unique challenges and opportunities which the treasurer must understand and embrace. Help is at hand, however. As this article details, whatever sector your company operates in, Citi has both specialist advice and a range of innovative, tailored solutions that treasurers can draw upon to help them address the challenges they face and, ultimately, build a more efficient treasury.</p>
<h3 id=""industrials-sector"">Industrials sector</h3>
<p>Over the course of the past decade commodity prices have sky-rocketed. Companies operating in the industrial sector saw their business costs rising, and they responded by looking at ways to improve operational and liquidity efficiency within their organisations.</p>
<p>Today, most analysts agree that the commodity super cycle is nearing – or has perhaps even passed – its peak. But the focus on liquidity from companies in the sector is not letting up, says Jason Batman, Asia Pacific Industrials and Energy, Petroleum and Chemicals (EPC) Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solution at Citi. In fact it is, if anything, growing stronger. “In this sector, the treasury function is really taking control of liquidity across the region and, wherever possible, making sure that subsidiaries are borrowing from an internal source, rather than an external banking source,” he says.</p>
<p>What are treasurers in the industrials sector doing to realise this objective? Batman says he is seeing an increasing number of businesses in this sector working to establish optimal regional treasury models or in-house banking structures to manage and take control of their working capital and internal funding requirements across the region. Of course, with the restricted nature of some Asian markets, in-house banks may not enjoy full access to liquidity in every instance. But whatever the regulatory nuances of certain markets, Citi offers clients a liquidity management platform that is globally consistent and locally compliant – whether it is physical zero or target balancing, notional pooling, or delivering liquidity flows to the in-house bank. For example, the automobile industry is a diversified multi-layered financial and operational ecosystem. Deep and diverse supply chains combined with complex distribution structures means that any changes in process and systems can have huge business repercussions in the supply chain. One insight borne from our analysis across the auto sector is the potential for treasury to support delivery of subsidiary funding. Subsidiaries in the enterprise operate very distinctly, and have varying working capital cycles from each other, and therefore traditionally have been managed separately. Today with treasury advancement and use of information and technology – coupled with Citi’s liquidity platforms – treasurers are well equipped to meet their liquidity efficiency goals.</p>
<h3 id=""technology-and-telecommunications"">Technology and telecommunications</h3>
<p>“The business model in the telecoms sector is evolving,” says Manash Dasgupta, Asia Pacific Consumer and Healthcare, and Technology, Media and Telecom Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. In Asia, as in other parts of the world, the sector has gone through significant consolidation in each market. The companies remaining therefore tend to dominate their domestic markets, and as a result are limited in their options when it comes to expanding the core business. The solution is to explore innovative ideas to provide value added services to their consumers in established markets as well as look for investments in newer emerging markets. That might mean moving into new products and services such as mobile wallets for consumers or facilitating B2B payments worldwide. “Telecom companies have evolved to becoming providers of communications and connectivity infrastructure for their clients around the world in addition to providing mobility and fixed line services in their home markets,” notes Dasgupta.</p>
<p>As a partner bank for the largest technology companies globally, Citi is well placed to respond to changing business needs in this sector. Risk management is one of the key areas where technology companies have found this expertise particularly valuable. As companies expand their range of products, markets and services, trading partners naturally expand in tandem. But new trading partners will mean new counterparty credit risks to manage. The evolution of business models in this sector has therefore brought about a steady growth in demand for trade related services that help to mitigate risks, support trade flows as well as provide financing as required. Citi has invested significantly in technology that helps to digitise the process for trade services such as export letters of credits, document preparation outsourcing, and issuance of standby letters of credit. Digitisation has supported the growth in volumes as well as provided the required scale that companies need as they expand operations. In addition to large well established brands, there are many new emerging market entrants in the technology segment who have partnered with Citi as they aspire to expand globally. “Without the established brand, the global presence or the marketing muscle, new entrants need financing to bring on board distributors who will sell their products,” says Dasgupta. “So there is a real need, not only for Citi clients to be adequately resourced, but also for the customers of our clients to be adequately financed to support growth strategies”.</p>
<p>Competitive pressures have significantly impacted margins across the technology ecosystem. Citi has partnered with their large customers to support and finance the supply chain to ensure sustainability and margin protection. These initiatives been particularly helpful for smaller suppliers who are often challenged by credit squeeze and seasonal liquidity challenges. Most large businesses, says Dasgupta, make an effort to ensure that payments terms are such that their key suppliers are able to continue operating profitably. A significant number still end up being squeezed, however.</p>
<h3 id=""public-sector"">Public sector</h3>
<p>The role of public sector organisations is changing. Globally, there are a multitude of financial challenges for governments, not too dissimilar to those that we see confronting private businesses. In the wake of the financial crisis, governments in Asia – and across the world – recognised the need for economic stimulus to help the rebuilding of their recession hit economies. This has led to a double-edged sword for government departments who are seeing taxpayers demanding greater value from their public services yet are hamstrung by budgetary pressures intensifying as governments look to reallocate financial resources elsewhere. Damian Macinante, Asia Pacific Public Sector and Non-Bank Financial Institutions Sales Head at Citi, explains that these pressures are encouraging public sector organisations to look for ways to drive down costs by improving the efficiency of financial management.</p>
<p>Best practices in the private sector, where corporates have proven success in delivering efficiency gains in treasury, cash and liquidity management, have provided an example that banks like Citi are encouraging the public sector to follow. “Today the public sector in Asia is looking closely at liquidity management efficiencies, and supply chain financing to extract greater value from their budgetary allocations,” says Macinante. Securing sustainable improvements in these areas does, however, require far reaching changes from within. As such, Citi advises its public sector clients not only to look at the liquidity management and SCF solutions that are being deployed to great effect by their corporate clients, but to also work on improving the operational processes behind them. “We see a lot of governments assessing what they can do around automating their purchase order and invoice approval processes because historically that has been very manual and paper-based,” says Macinante. The value creation can then be accelerated with group procurement and logistics, shared service centres and actively managing the cash flow.</p>
<p>The benefits can be substantial and are often felt in every area of treasury operations but you have to start with the basics. “That is also key to implementing some of these other services as well,” Macinante adds. “After all, it’s pointless having a SCF programme in place if your terms are 60 days and it takes you 55 days to approve an invoice.”</p>
<h3 id=""correspondent-banking-sector"">Correspondent banking sector</h3>
<p>“We operate in a world of growing complexity. More than ever the rate of regulatory change, globalisation and digitisation is requiring banks in Asia to re-evaluate the way in which they price and deliver services to their consumer and institutional client base alike,” says David Cavanagh, Asia Pacific Correspondent Banking Sales Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi.</p>
<p>Access to global networks is critical in meeting the demands of a customer base with growing cross border requirements. Keeping pace with the rapidly changing environment means many banks simply cannot afford to ‘go it alone’. More and more, leveraging off a partner bank’s infrastructure rather than building “in-house” is viewed as a more efficient option.</p>
<p>Cavanagh adds, “Banks still compete aggressively for client wallet, but there is a growing acceptance that opportunities to partner together can deliver superior outcomes for themselves and most importantly the clients they serve. Citi assumes a leading role within this ecosystem. We work with our financial institution (FI) clients by making available our network in the support of cross-border trade flows as well as facilitating the execution of payments to beneficiaries globally. This in itself is critical in supporting our FI clients, however it is no longer all, or even the most critical value we provide them. Banks in Asia are looking for correspondents that don’t just process their flows. Ever greater value is now placed on a partner bank’s ability to provide training and the transfer of best practices. This can include new product training, benchmarking services and more and more often, regulatory guidance.”</p>
<p>As a global provider of correspondent banking services to financial institutions in over a 160 countries, Citi brings a depth of experience and expertise obtained over decades of commitment to these markets. It is this scale, network and experience that allow our clients to build operational efficiency, extract incremental value out of transactional flows, and deliver a differentiated client experience to their customers.</p>
<h3 id=""the-right-benchmarks"">The right benchmarks</h3>
<p>“The depth of sector knowledge and expertise at Citi is one of the qualities that really sets the bank apart from its competitors. Understanding all the trends within different industries is important since it helps the bank to better help its clients,” explains Nanji.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of deep sector knowledge that we can take from one customer in a sector to another in the same sector,” he says. Clients who use Citi’s Innovation Lab, for example, are able to access data analytics that can show them what solutions and products worked for other businesses in the same industry. “We can benchmark clients across an industry and show them how their peer group is operating. This is something we find our clients really value. If you show treasurers how the best-in-class are bringing down cash conversion cycles, for example, very often the next question they ask is how they can do that. That’s why we spend a lot of time talking about best practices at a sector level.”</p>
<h3 id=""next-frontiers-in-sector-expertise"">Next frontiers in sector expertise</h3>
<p>The global rise of Asian companies and the expansion of Western multinationals into the region have accelerated the development of sophisticated and innovative digital solutions, reflecting the transnational nature of their treasury and finance demands. Enhanced client experience, advanced data analytics and interactive tools will be the next frontiers for treasury management. Nanji says, “This is already happening at Citi as we help clients stay ahead of competition and augment their strategic treasury management capabilities.” As an example, leveraging big data analytics, Citi’s Trade Financing Interactive Solution – the first of its kind in the market – enables companies to visualise their supply chain, benchmark working capital metrics against competitors, and quantify the financial benefit of their Supply Chain Financing programme.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Cambodia is located in the south of the Indochina Peninsula, neighbouring Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. It was previously known as the Khmer Empire when it ruled over South East Asia between 802 and 1431. Today, the country is regarded as one of the emerging nations in the region.</p>
<p>Cambodia has however faced difficulties over the past 60 years following its independence from France in 1953. Political instability, civil war and a bombing campaign devastated the country and its population through the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century – prohibiting its development.</p>
<p>The instability has largely disappeared and the country is now in better shape, and is looking to use its natural resources and economic potential to end its dependence on foreign aid. The country also hopes to encourage more foreign investment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Cambodia still has many challenges to overcome but has been granted a ‘B2’ rating by Moody’s with a stable outlook. Moody’s cites a healthy outlook for economic growth, limited vulnerability to fiscal and external funding stress and ongoing fiscal consolidation from fiscal stimulus as the key drivers for this.</p>
<h3 id=""business-environment"">Business environment</h3>
<p>According to data collected by the World Bank for its Doing Business 2014 report, starting a business in Cambodia requires 11 procedures, takes 104 days and costs 150% of income per capita. Only five countries rank lower in terms of ease of setting up a business.</p>
<p>The report states that Cambodia made starting a business even more difficult last year by introducing a requirement for a company name check at the Department of Intellectual Property and by increasing the costs both for getting registration documents approved and stamped by the Phnom Penh Tax Department and for completing incorporation with the commercial registrar. Cambodia also performs poorly on contract enforcement (162<sup>nd</sup> of the 189 economies surveyed), although it rates above the regional average and 42<sup>nd</sup> overall on access to credit. On average, Cambodian firms pay total taxes amounting to 21.4% of profit, which gives it a global taxation ranking of 65.</p>
<p>The 2014 Index of Economic Freedom allocates Cambodia an economic freedom score of 57.4, making its economy the 108<sup>th</sup> freest of the 178 rated nations. Its overall score is lower than in 2013 and below the regional average.</p>
<p>Since Cambodia’s economic freedom was first assessed in the 1997 index, its overall economic freedom score has improved by only 4.5 points, with advancements in trade, monetary and investment freedom largely offset by significant declines in business freedom and freedom from corruption. The index states that ‘substantial challenges remain, particularly in implementing deeper institutional and systemic reforms.’</p>
<h3 id=""uneven-advance-to-asean"">Uneven advance to ASEAN</h3>
<p>Cambodia is preparing for the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community, but needs to step up reforms to improve the transparency and reliability of its regulatory systems to encourage more investment according to a report produced in April 2014 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in collaboration with the Institute of South East Asia Studies (ISEAS).</p>
<p>“Cambodia is doing well with preparations for the ASEAN Economic Community because it has always been an open and outward-looking economy, but it needs to catch up with the implementation of e-customs, the national single window (which enables cross-border traders to submit regulatory documents to a single entity) and the ASEAN single window border procedures,” says Jayant Menon, lead economist at the ADB.</p>
<p>In March 2014 The Cambodia Daily quoted Chuop Narath, deputy director of the department of employment and manpower at the Ministry of Labor as saying that Cambodia was not ready to join the single regional market and production base.</p>
<h3 id=""exports-drive-growth"">Exports drive growth</h3>
<p>An IMF report released in February 2014 observed that economic activity was robust in 2013 driven by healthy exports and tourism. Real estate and construction also expanded rapidly, supported by fast credit growth and foreign direct investment which remained strong, partly as a result of factories relocating from China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Private sector credit has grown by approximately 30% per annum over the last three years thanks to ample liquidity – including bank funding from abroad – and heightened competition in the banking system.</p>
<p>The IMF describes the introduction of negotiable certificates of deposit as a welcome first step toward market-based monetary operations, although it warns that establishing an interbank and foreign exchange market would be needed to begin addressing dollarisation, including allowing more exchange rate flexibility.</p>
<p>‘The transition to risk-based supervision and the rapid expansion of the banking system continue to put additional burden on the supervisory capacity and in this context, the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendation of imposing a moratorium on new bank licenses remains appropriate,’ states the IMF.</p>
<p>With the current account largely funded by external aid and foreign direct investment and annual inflation remaining around the historical average of 5%, no immediate macro-financial risks seem to threaten growth prospects, although the rapid bank credit growth of recent years underscores the need for policy vigilance.</p>
<p>Services remained the largest source of growth from the supply side, expanding by an estimated 8.4% in 2013. Bank credit to wholesale and retail traders increased by 24.5% to $2.5 billion and to real estate by 36.5% to $251m. Tourist numbers were up 17.5% to 4.2 million.</p>
<p>Industry grew by an estimated 10.5% on strong demand for Cambodian garments and footwear in the EU. Exports of garments and footwear to that market surged by 26% to $2 billion and those to the US rose by 6% to $2.1 billion according to customs data.</p>
<p>Construction and rice milling also contributed to industry growth. Bank credit to construction rose by 29% to $577m and exports of milled rice almost doubled to $262m, although floods in September and October 2013 damaged crops.</p>
<p>In May 2014, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a $75m senior loan with Cambodia’s largest bank, ACLEDA Bank, to address the rising financing requirements of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the country.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s level of financial services is one of the lowest in Asia and the Pacific. While MSMEs account for 99% of private companies and 73% of all jobs in the country, they have very limited access to bank financing. According to the country’s central bank, 84% of MSMEs are financed through the informal financial sector, where interest rates are as high as 10% per month.</p>
<p>ACLEDA, which has an extensive branch network in rural areas, will use the loan to broaden its lending base and extend its services to underserved communities.</p>
<h3 id=""political-paralysis"">Political paralysis</h3>
<p>Inflows of net foreign direct investment reached $1.3 billion in 2013, though that figure represented a decline from 2012, partly a result of political tensions after Cambodia’s most recent national elections. Cambodia has long been blighted by political unrest. Following the national elections in July 2013, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) rejected the results, claiming widespread irregularities in the election process.</p>
<p>Subsequent demonstrations by the CNRP were replicated by other aggrieved sectors, such as garment workers and victims groups protesting human rights abuses. This led to a virtual ban on assembly for opposition groups and the government produced a series of laws that raised concerns over restriction of dissent and separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary.</p>
<p>In July 2014 the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) and the CNRP announced a deal that would enable the opposition party to take its 55 seats in parliament, ending nearly a year of political deadlock and reassuring investors.</p>
<p>Tim Meisburger, regional director for elections and political processes at the Asia Foundation suggests that the political impasse created an opportunity for reform that has not existed in Cambodia since the early 1990s. “Since opposition political parties are unlikely to be able to convince the current government to hold early elections, their next chance will be national elections in 2018. In those elections they may win the big prize in the winner-take-all system. Or they may not, as four years is a long time and in that time voters may swing back towards the CPP, or that party might refuse to give up power.”</p>
<p>Given these factors, opposition parties might be willing to trade the uncertain possibility of 100% of government power under the current system for early elections for provincial governors and some level of election system reform that would guarantee them a significant share in government power at the local and national levels and with the possibility of winning a majority in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>“The ruling party might also be willing to deal,” says Meisburger. “History suggests that eventually there will be a change in government and the results of the last election suggest that the desire for change – any change – is growing. If that trend continues the governing party will have an increasingly harder time winning the next elections and a loss will mean either they lose 100% of government power or reject the results with potentially disastrous consequences that spell the end of the party completely.”</p>
<p>Alternatively, the CPP could lead a reform process that would bring about political decentralisation and election system reform.</p>
<h3 id=""moribund-markets"">Moribund markets</h3>
<p>With a stable exchange rate based on sound macro-fundamentals for the past decade, an inflation rate that has stayed within a manageable level of 4% for the last five years, consistent improvement in government revenue collection and a reduced budget deficit, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) says growth momentum is expected to continue in the medium term.</p>
<p>However, the size of the Cambodian stock exchange illustrates how far the country lags other frontier markets in South East Asia. The exchange was only inaugurated in July 2011 and there are just two listed companies, while the relatively small scale of most Cambodian companies means there is limited demand for bond issues in the range of $50m upwards. The first two offerings combined were worth less than $40m.</p>
<p>While Cambodia and Laos have just five listed companies between them, its neighbour to the east (Vietnam) has more than 650 public companies. Indeed, one of the two companies listed in Cambodia and the most recent addition to the bourse is actually Vietnamese – textiles firm Grand Twins International (Cambodia). The only other listed entity is Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that Hong Sok Hour, CEO of the exchange has said that around ten companies are exploring a listing and that there would likely be one more before the end of 2014, while noting that the process of preparing financial statements continued to be a challenge.</p>
<h3 id=""developed-banking-sector"">Developed banking sector</h3>
<p>The commercial banking sector is regulated by the NBC, the sole regulator of financial institutions in the country and the regulatory environment is pretty sophisticated, explains Patrick Smith, Cambodia-based head of law firm DFDL’s Japan desk and deputy head of the firm’s banking and finance practice group.</p>
<p>“There are quite a few commercial banks licenced to operate in Cambodia and many foreign banks have established subsidiaries, branches or representative offices, although the NBC has stated that it would be unlikely to issue any further banking licences in the near future.”</p>
<p>There is currently no Islamic banking activity in Cambodia, but this is expected to change in the near future in line with other Asian countries.</p>
<p>Recent entrants include Japanese banks SNBC and MUFG, although the representative offices of these banks are not allowed to do banking business in Cambodia – only branches or subsidiaries are able to obtain a banking licence. A favoured method of entering the market is to acquire positions in existing commercial banks.</p>
<p>Overseas banks in Cambodia are sometimes allowed to service companies who are based in their home country, particularly those from Vietnam, China, Japan and Korea, which from a treasury perspective means that international companies can access banks from their own jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“This is not an option for corporates based outside Asia, but the banking system in Cambodia is well-capitalised and it is relatively easy to obtain finance at reasonable rates,” says Smith. “The laws relating to lending are transparent and there are few restrictions in terms of what banks can or cannot do.”</p>
<p>Lending is conducted at fixed rates of interest in US dollars rather than the local currency and the almost total absence of floating rate lending means hedging is largely redundant. However, there is currency risk and DFDL has acted for a number of hedging counterparties in Cambodia in relation to currency swaps and forwards.</p>
<p>“However, there are options for treasurers looking to do business locally in terms of finance, if not in terms of asset allocation,” adds Smith. “There is an established payments infrastructure – most large scale transactions are denominated in dollars. Payments in and out of the country must be made through an authorised intermediary, but this is typically a commercial bank with which a treasurer will already have a relationship.”</p>
<p>Cambodia has a foreign exchange law, but it can only be applied by the NBC during times of economic or financial crisis to control currency movement for a period of up to three months. That law has been in effect since the late 1990s but was not exercised either during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 or the global financial crisis of 2007-08.</p>
<p>According to Grant Knuckey, ANZ CEO Cambodia, the country is developing rapidly and strengthening ties to the larger ASEAN market are creating a lot of opportunities for businesses.</p>
<p>“The business banking environment is promising and highly competitive, particularly when compared to other emerging markets. We have seen a significant inflow of new banks to the market over the last three years and as a result, the price of liquidity has dropped considerably – certainly below the level one would expect in a single-B jurisdiction. Corporates would absolutely see it as a ‘buyers’ market’ from a price and terms perspective, which is driving a lot of investment into the country.”</p>
<p>He also suggests that there is a significant opportunity for growth of financial markets in Cambodia, in terms of both debt capital and equity capital. “Debt capital markets are yet to establish, partly due to the availability of bilateral credit and partly due to the relatively small ticket size. At the top end of the corporate market this looks likely to change soon, as debt levels get beyond the capital constraints of local banks.”</p>
<h3 id=""local-treasury-presence"">Local treasury presence</h3>
<p>When asked whether there are any capital restrictions or controls that affect companies in Cambodia, Smith refers to the requirement for banks to report large transactions in compliance with anti-money laundering laws or the central bank’s review of capital inflows and outflows. However, this is a reporting obligation on the part of the bank which is not dissimilar to that in effect in many other countries.</p>
<p>“The companies we deal with typically have treasury staff based in Cambodia, even those with regional treasury centres in locations such as Singapore,” Smith concludes.</p>
<p>Knuckey acknowledges that Cambodia’s system-level payments environment still has some way to go before it is a full, real time gross settlement environment like most of its peers in the region. “But in terms of bank-to-corporate payments systems, the environment is good and our clients here in Cambodia have access to the same payments and cash functionality (including host-to-host solutions) as clients in more mature markets.”</p>
<p>He describes Cambodia as one of the most liberal capital regimes in the region. “Movement of capital is relatively unrestricted, particularly inbound. Outbound, there are some minor restrictions on banks, but these don’t apply to corporates.”</p>
<p>As a result, the vast majority of companies are locally managed “although some blue-chip multinationals will manage via their regional treasury centre in a site such as Singapore,” he concludes.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Anne Rodrigues"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/09/2014-09and10-tta-02-qa-anne-rodrigues-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""anne-rodrigues"">Anne Rodrigues, President, Malaysian Association of Corporate Treasurers:</h5>
<p>The governments of the ten countries that make up the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) subscribe to the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). The AEC will see the integration of all ten ASEAN economies into “a single production base with free movement of goods and services, capital, investments and skilled labour.” The deadline for the integration has been set at 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015.</p>
<p>The full realisation of such an economic community will bring considerable economic benefits to corporates who operate within it, as it will see the creation of an entity with a combined population of around 600m, a GDP of $2.4 trillion, making it the seventh largest trading economy in the world. Additionally, if we include a free trade area (FTA) with dialogue partners (Australia, New Zealand, India, Japan, China and South Korea) and also FTAs with the EU and US, the benefits would be even greater. From these corporates will be able to obtain considerable benefits from economies of scale as well as cross border synergies from ASEAN integration, not to mention a rising of the levels of efficiencies and reduction in all manner of costs with the reduction in tariffs, related administrative and banking costs, as the theory of competitive advantage kicks in. Overall, the full realisation of AEC as envisioned will definitely result in an overall ease of doing business within the region.</p>
<p>The task of implementing the AEC in accordance with the ASEAN Economic Blueprint, which is a master plan for the establishment of the AEC, is entrusted with the ASEAN secretariat. The update provided by the secretariat in July 2013 stated that the implementation rate of the AEC Blueprint was 79%.</p>
<p>I believe that corporates in the region, particularly in the case of Malaysia, who are involved with operating businesses and trading within the ASEAN region are not yet fully aware of the potential impact and benefits of AEC implementation for whatever reason. This could be because of insufficient focus and publicity by the entities involved or because there are other more pressing issues to be tackled, or even a lack of conviction that such a blueprint will finally take off.</p>
<p>Likewise, in respect of the progress of a Pan ASEAN clearing and settlements system, there has been very little information forthcoming from the ASEAN Secretariat and a more detailed framework for banking under the AEC scenario has yet to be disseminated.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of David Morton"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/09/2014-09and10-tta-02-qa-david-morton-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""david-morton"">David Morton, Regional Head of Corporate Banking – Asia Pacific, Commercial Banking, HSBC:</h5>
<p>Anything that brings together larger groupings of businesses and populations on a single or common regulatory framework, normally leads to greater efficiency and reduced operating costs for businesses. This is especially true in Asia Pacific, a region containing 17 contrasting countries growing at different rates and operating under different political systems. The further integration of the ASEAN region and the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) therefore has the potential to offer a number of benefits to corporates with operations in the region.</p>
<p>The major benefits which further ASEAN integration may bring, include; further trade and investment liberalisation, the ability to transfer funds across border more efficiently and without delay, the ability to take advantages of developments such as RMB internationalisation which the ASEAN region will be heavily involved in and also take advantage of the new technologies developed in the region which can be utilised by treasury. In addition, the region and its benefits are not just open to large multinationals. SMEs will also be able to take advantage of ASEAN at the same speed, if not quicker, than large multinationals.</p>
<p>However, a pan-ASEAN clearing and settlement system is currently not something which corporates will readily be able to benefit from, as all parties are still a long way from reaching an agreement. While some countries have taken steps to pave the way for this, such as Singapore launching its FAST payment system, and we expect further countries to adopt similar methods as a way to modernise their own domestic payment infrastructures there is still a significant amount of work to be to create a pan-ASEAN system and this will take some time.</p>
<p>To take full advantage of ASEAN integration it is vital that corporate treasurers stay close to development in the region by keeping up to date with releases from the official bureaucratic sources within the region. Corporates should also look to their home embassies and government trade organisations who will also release information. The challenge for the treasurer however lies in being able to filter the plethora of information to ensure that what they are looking at is up to date and relevant to their operations.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits which further ASEAN integration can offer corporates, there are a number of challenges they may continue to face. These include: cash remaining non-transferable, both in and out, in a number of countries, there being degrees of non-convertibility across the region, continuing complex regulatory frameworks and a lack of harmonisation in technological systems making integration of these challenging. While we are hoping that many of these issues will be resolved in time, the challenge remains that legal harmonisation may not keep up with rapid technological and regulatory change.</p>
<p>The deadline for the integration of the AEC is 31<sup>st</sup> December 2015 and while we remain optimistic, the reality is that historically multilateral negotiations are prone to deadline slippages. We are also currently seeing a trend in the establishment of bi-lateral agreements between nations in the region, compared to a ‘big-bang’ regional agreement. The danger of this is that over time this may make it harder to reach common agreement on issues in the region.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Usama Delorenzo"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/09/2014-09and10-tta-02-qa-usama-delorenzo-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""usama-delorenzo"">Usama Delorenzo, Director, Asia Policy and Advocacy, SWIFT:</h5>
<p>The debate surrounding ASEAN integration is dense and comprises of a swathe of studies, reports and other documents categorised broadly under terms such as ‘regulation’, ‘industry segments’ and ‘regional financial infrastructure options’. These collectively outline the vision of ASEAN and the nations within it. For many, this information can be impenetrable and the true facts can be hard to attain. So what does ASEAN integration mean for those organisations that either have or are looking to have business operations there?</p>
<p>For us, what ASEAN integration creates is a single window – a harmonised and standardised community with an integrated and connected ecosystem in which corporates can freely operate efficiently and effectively. The overall benefits for corporates stem from a number of different concepts and initiatives – which all contribute to this overall goal.</p>
<p>Firstly, standardisation across the region is vital and in the last year or two Asia Pacific as a region has taken great strides towards this. In the ASEAN region more specifically, ISO 20022 has been selected to facilitate payments across the region and also to be the recognised standard for the bond market. The specifics of exactly how it will be used are still unclear and currently being decided upon by both banks and central banks. The adoption of ISO 20022 as a standardised financial messaging format across the region can offer corporates numerous benefits including local language support and the ability to carry more reference data, standards which cater to the diversity of the ASEAN region. The adoption of ISO 20022 will also assist with the creation of a regional clearing and settlement system and a fully integrated financial system.</p>
<p>Secondly, further ASEAN integration offers corporates numerous benefits surrounding trade. Again looking at the idea of a single window, the integration of the ASEAN region aims to allow corporates to obtain faster financing, improve trade document transfer and increase transparency, allowing for better governance and risk management. The use of technology and a shift to Supply Chain Finance (SCF) oriented transactions will allow corporates to greater leverage the trade benefits which ASEAN integration brings.</p>
<p>These benefits are not only open to large multinationals, but also to SMEs. For example, we have seen the ASEAN trading link recently created by the ASEAN Exchanges, a collaboration of seven exchanges from Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia designed to create more investment opportunities and to attract more investors into ASEAN capital markets. The ASEAN trading link offers a gateway for easier access to the exchanges which can be utilised by SMEs and other similar companies allowing them to trade in other ASEAN capital markets just as easily as they do in their own.</p>
<p>Overall, the future of corporate treasury in the region depends on the development of its financial market infrastructure. Currently, many corporates lean towards Singapore as a base for their treasury operations as it has the healthy advantage of being both the region’s financial and commercial centre. However, as other countries emerge, such as Malaysia and Thailand which are growing quickly, we may see these become more appealing to corporates as locations for their treasury operations.</p>

Payments systems in the Middle East and Africa,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h4 class=""fn"">Murali Subramanian</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Head of Transaction Banking</h5>
<img alt=""Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank"" class=""logo org"" height=""27"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/adcb-logo-2014-90x27.png"" width=""90""/>

<p>The Middle East and Africa region is experiencing a rise in the sophistication of its payments systems. Indeed, a large number of countries in the region have moved to implement real-time gross settlement (RTGS) value systems, which function together as the backbone of the region’s payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>A significant part of this transformation has taken place over the last decade, with the World Bank and several other multilateral agencies, such as the African development Bank, as well as a number of foreign consulting companies with clearing and payments system expertise acting as key drivers of this transformation.</p>
<p>South Africa has traditionally been one of the pioneers of advanced payments systems in Africa, while Saudi Arabia has been the forerunner in the Middle East; the UAE has also joined the payments infrastructure vanguard of late. In the Middle East, there remain relatively few countries that have not implemented RTGS systems. These include Syria and Yemen, which has received little foreign direct investment compared with neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>“The development of payments infrastructure goes beyond bulk clearing using RTGS systems, however. There is also increasing use of direct debit transfers, faster payments, and imaging clearing of cheques, which are all in various stages of development across the region,” says Murali Subramanian, Head of Transaction Banking at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-is-king"">Cash is king</h3>
<p>While the speed and ease by which money can be electronically transferred has improved, cash remains the predominant means of payment, and in some countries looks set to remain so for some time to come. “Cash continues to be significantly used in all the economies in the region, even in the countries that are successful RTGS adaptors,” says Subramanian.</p>
<p>In Egypt, for example, cash accounts for around 93% of transactions. In the UAE and Saudi Arabia it represents around 80%. Despite the ongoing popularity of cash, cards are slowly making inroads. “Any future displacement of cash in favour of non-cash transactions will likely be driven by credit and debit cards,” says Subramanian.</p>
<p>The scope for mobile payments to take off in the region is also great, given the enormous penetration of mobile phones in the Middle East and Africa. And mobile payment technology has already started to thrive in countries where the traditional branch banking infrastructure is subject to instability.</p>
<p>“Non-traditional technologies are being used in some countries to supplement deficient clearing system infrastructure. The popularity of M-Pesa in Kenya is a prime example of this,” says Subramanian.</p>
<p>The M-Pesa mobile payments service, through which transactions such as value transfer remittances and domestic payments can be made, was launched in 2007 by mobile phone network operators in Kenya and Tanzania. Now more than half of all payments made in Kenya go through the system. Part of the reason for the service’s success is that users are not required to have a bank account.</p>
<h3 id=""impact-on-corporates"">Impact on corporates</h3>
<p>Subramanian says one effect of this payments evolution on corporates is they are starting to recognise and harness the value of physical cash.</p>
<p>“The ability to handle receipts and deliver cash is important. While corporates in the developed world do not emphasise cash handling capabilities or outsource it completely, this outsourcing capability is being developed differently here,” he says.</p>
<p>For example, security companies like Group 4 have started to take on an entire end-to-end operation from collection to value in an account in the Middle East. In sub-Saharan African countries, where for infrastructural or regulatory reasons this might not be possible, outsourced collections could be the solution.</p>
<p>Subramanian says this payments evolution is also creating scope for the use of new technologies such as image-based cheque clearing. However, he warns that corporates should carefully examine the currency control regulations in a particular country in the region before establishing operations there. “In many countries this is not an issue, but in some – Egypt, for example – this can be a sticking point,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""choosing-a-partner"">Choosing a partner</h3>
<p>Corporates looking for a banking partner in the region essentially have two choices: a global bank or a local bank. Global banks can offer the advantages of a multi-country presence, consistent standards of operation, a common point of reference, and uniform pricing, among others.</p>
<p>However, the global banks can have limited branch networks in some Middle East or African countries. “One branch per country is typically the model for global banks operating in the region,” explains Subramanian.</p>
<p>The bigger economies in the region often have large banks operating at a standard more or less comparable to Western banks. “What many corporates operating in the region tend to do is keep a global overlay bank for their international cash pooling and basic treasury activities, while using a big local bank to do everything else they wish to do in-country, such as supplier financing, collections, reconciliations, employee services and cash collections,” says Subramanian. “This can be the best of both worlds,” he concludes.</p>

<p>Known as the Pearl of the Orient Seas, the Republic of the Philippines is an archipelago, consisting of 7,000 islands, sitting to the west of Vietnam in the Pacific Ocean. Approximately 100 of these islands are inhabited, hosting a population of just over 100,000.</p>
<p>From 1521 the Philippines was a Spanish colony, until 1898 when the country was sold to the United States. Then, following World War II, the country was granted independence and, for a time, was regarded as the second wealthiest nation in East Asia. Subsequent political instability and economic mismanagement, however, caused the economy to stagnate and other Asian nations began to overtake.</p>
<p>The economy began to pick up again in the early 1990s, until the 1997 Asian financial crisis hit. Due to the conservative nature of Filipino economic policy at the time, the crisis had a lesser impact than it did on the nation’s South East Asian neighbours. In fact, following the Asian crisis the Fillipino economy has boomed, expanding at an annual rate of around 5% since 2006.</p>
<h3 id=""standing-out"">Standing out</h3>
<p>In 2013, the GDP of the Philippines increased 7.2% – its highest increase since 2010 – at a time when regional growth was largely cooling down. As a result, many analysts referred to the country as South East Asia’s ‘rising star’. A number of factors have contributed to the economy’s growth, including an increase in exports, primarily in the electronics sector, and the country’s expanding service industry which has seen it become the world’s number one location for outsourced call centres.</p>
<p>Another key factor in the country’s economic growth is domestic consumption, which in 2012 accounted for 70% of the economy. This has been fuelled by remittances from the legions of overseas Filipino workers (OFW’s). In 2012 it was estimated that 11% of the population worked abroad and their remittances contributed around $225 billion, which according to Standard Chartered, constituted 8.6% of the nation’s GDP. These remittances have also brought currency stability and allowed the government to build up healthy foreign reserves, permitting the nation to navigate relatively unharmed through global financial shocks.</p>
<p>With increased investment and industrialisation supporting domestic demand and the flourishing services industry, the Filipino government is aiming to achieve GDP growth between 6.5% to 7.5% in 2014. Both the World Bank and the IMF forecast that the Philippines will achieve the lower end of this target, projecting slightly slower growth of 6.6% and 6.5% respectively, primarily due to the damage caused by Typhoon Haiyan in late 2013.</p>
<h3 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h3>
<p>While the Philippines may be top of the class in South East Asia due to its economic growth, there are challenges that the country is yet to address. Unemployment is a key issue and skills shortages and a small, labour-driven manufacturing sector haven’t helped the government translate the booming economy into jobs. For example, in 2013, 7.3% of the population was unemployed while the underemployment rate stood at just under 20%. These figures have caused large parts of the population to live in poverty; 24.9% in the first half of 2013, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.</p>
<p>The nation’s underdeveloped infrastructure also poses a challenge to the continued growth of the Filipino economy. In late 2013, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies claimed that the country’s infrastructure was the second poorest in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This was further emphasised in the fallout of Typhoon Haiyan, as the lack of surfaced roads, ports and power lines, made it difficult for people to receive aid. Warnings have been given by economists who suggest that the Philippines must improve its infrastructure to sustain the economic growth it has seen in the last few years.</p>
<h3 id=""investment-grade-status"">Investment grade status</h3>
<p>On a more positive note, a further boost was given to the Filipino economy in 2013 as Fitch, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s all awarded the country investment-grade status. Moody’s, the last to upgrade the Philippines, reported that recent economic performance, improved fiscal management, political stability and improved governance all contributed to the upgrade.</p>
<p>The benefits which the upgrade may bring to the country include increased foreign investments, greater levels of tourism and lower borrowing costs. As the Philippines continues on its upward trajectory, the global research department at HSBC has predicted that if the country follows its current path, by 2050 it will rise 27 places to become the 16<sup>th</sup> largest economy in the world.</p>
<h3 id=""financial-sector"">Financial sector</h3>
<p>The financial sector of the Philippines is widely perceived to be in a stable and healthy position. This was confirmed in 2013, as the central bank of the Philippines, Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP), declared that it had seen a positive performance based on its KPIs. These include stronger profitability, firm liquidity positions, improved asset quality and higher capitalisation. Outside parties also recognised the strong performance of the sector, such as Moody’s, who gave the sector a positive outlook and which has thus far been maintained throughout 2014.</p>
<p>The performance of the financial sector is beginning to offer benefits to corporates operating in the country. “We have seen the banks develop a strong appetite for offering corporate loans in recent months,” says Robert Martinez, Assistant General Manager and CFO at Getz Brothers. “Corporates are now being wooed by financial institutions that are competing against each other to provide the best rates.” Over the past year, interest rates on corporate loans have been steadily declining for corporates in the Philippines, from around 6% to 8% twelve months ago to currently around 3%. It is primarily the local banks which are most bullish in offering the best rates. “While this is still relatively high compared to Europe and the United States, this is a marked improvement for the Philippines,” says Martinez.</p>
<h3 id=""the-local-advantage"">The local advantage</h3>
<p>Both local and international banks in the Philippines offer a range of services to corporates operating in the country, such as trade services and cash management products. However, as in many South East Asian countries, local banks tend to have an advantage when it comes to corporates’ domestic operations because of their branch network.</p>
<p>For example, Getz operates a Post Dated Cheque Warehouse with BDO, one of the largest banks in the country. “We use this bank to pay our suppliers but also for collections customers across the country,” says Roberto Velilla Jr, Assistant Financial Controller at Getz Brothers. “Thanks to the wide BDO branch network, which penetrates even the smallest municipalities, our sales team are able to collect the cheques and then deposit them into the local BDO branch.” Foreign banks sometimes struggle to offer corporates the same network and therefore their use may be somewhat limited in this regard.</p>
<p>Rather, corporates rely on the international banks for the provision of outward facing products and services. These include remittance collection from any offshore operations and payments to overseas suppliers. Furthermore, international banks can offer support to foreign multinationals who are establishing operations in the Philippines. However, in May 2014, the Philippines House of Representatives approved a Bill which would begin to allow foreign banks full entry into the country, owning up to 100% of the voting stock and the ability to invest this into new bank subsidiaries and opening branches. Falling in line with ASEAN regulation, the aim of the bill is to consolidate the banking sector through encouraging foreign banks to purchase weak banks and strengthen the sector. The international banks are also expected to bring new technology and resources to assist with corporate operations and growth in the country.</p>
<h3 id=""exchange-controls"">Exchange controls</h3>
<p>“PHP’s convertibility has a direct impact on corporates operating in the country and certain restrictions can be an issue,” says Johnson Sia, Head of Financial Markets, ING Bank Manila. Traditionally the Philippines have stood on a very conservative base regarding the management of foreign exchange. However, in recent years the BSP has taken steps to liberalise the foreign exchange controls which tie in with their commitments to the ASEAN 2015 Economic Blueprint.</p>
<p>Residents are able to purchase up to $60,000 or equivalent in foreign currency daily without supporting documents. However this does not include currency for servicing trade obligations, loan repayments or investments. “Because of this, whenever we purchase a foreign currency through the banking system, even a small amount such as $2,000 to pay off an import, we have to produce several supporting documents,” says Velilla Jr. “These then have to be registered with the BSP who then either approve or reject the transaction.”</p>
<p>Royalty remittances are also subject to regulation from the BSP – these are required to be completed on a quarterly basis. When completing these, the BSP requires the submission of all financial statements and several other tax documents before the remittance can be completed. The BSP requires this because the transaction essentially involves the purchase of foreign exchange.</p>
<h3 id=""hedging"">Hedging</h3>
<p>Hedging is common practice in the Philippines and there are a number of products available for corporates both onshore and offshore. “Currency hedging is available via both deliverable and non-deliverable forwards; options and other more exotic structures are also available, although these are much less liquid,” says ING’s Sia. “Deliverable, onshore forwards would normally entail underlying documentation as required by the Central Bank; while the offshore non-deliverable market offers an alternative hedging tool. However the pricing and liquidity conditions of both instruments vary according to market conditions.”</p>
<p>“At Holcim we hedge against our imports,” says Michelle Ann Palad, Treasury Officer at Holcim Philippines. “However, we are only able to use forwards on a percentage of our underlying trade documents, such as invoices and bills of lading. Therefore, we are only able to mitigate the risk upon this percentage, causing a loss from the inception of the trade until the time the handover is complete.” This also means that corporates in this situation cannot hedge against their projected cash flow, meaning that only part of the exposure can be hedged, creating risk.</p>
<p>ING’s Sia added that interest rate hedging is also available, although a commonly accepted short-term interest rate benchmark is still evolving. Most public issuances are at fixed rates, while banks could offer both fixed and floating rate for bilateral loans.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-landscape"">Treasury landscape</h3>
<p>“The cash management techniques which are available to corporates operating in the Philippines are generally basic compared to neighbouring nations,” says Holcim’s Palad. For example, notional pooling is prohibited both domestically and cross-border, while cross-border cash sweeping is allowed – but not widely practised – due to the restrictions on transfer limits cross-border. This poses a challenge for multinational corporates who normally pool excess funds in other jurisdictions by swapping local currency into USD and visa versa, as they will not be able to do this.</p>
<p>Overdrafts are also prohibited in the Philippines and therefore corporates are unable to offset negative and positive balances. “The view of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is that if a corporate has an overdraft and also holds another account which is net positive, then you are effectively taking a loan,” says Martinez. In the Philippines, every loan transaction is covered by a promissory note which is subject to the payment of documentary stamps, so in the eyes of the Bureau of Internal Revenue by doing this the corporate is trying to avoid tax. Corporates therefore use zero-balance sweeping as an alternative to notional pooling and this is a principal liquidity management technique.</p>
<p>As companies in the Philippines expand, there may soon be a drive towards implementing more sophisticated tools into the treasury. “I think we will begin to see the demand for more effective treasury services grow,” says Martinez. “As we do, treasurers will have to look at more sophisticated cash management tools and technologies to provide value add and further enhance the businesses expansion and growth.”</p>
<h3 id=""bank-account-management"">Bank account management</h3>
<p>In the Philippines many of the large local banks are owned by groups of companies. For example, BDO is owned by the SM Group of Companies, a large Filipino conglomerate, with interest in retail, real estate and tourism. “If a corporate has dealings with these companies it will be required to open an account with their bank,” says Martinez. Many corporates in the country therefore find themselves with a large volume of bank accounts, many of which are obsolete.</p>
<p>While many of these banks offer electronic banking services to corporates, there is no standardised platform and all banks have their own proprietary system. Corporates therefore have an issue with oversight and management of these accounts. “I am running out of passwords,” says Holcim’s Palad, “but more importantly the lack of a standardised platform makes it difficult to have full visibility over our cash. If we must continue this way then then it would be very beneficial if platforms could be standardised to allow for improved oversight and management of the accounts.”</p>
<h3 id=""payment-systems"">Payment Systems</h3>
<p>Currently, cash is the primary payment method in the country, especially for low value retail payments. On the corporate side, however, cheques dominate the payments landscape and they are the most popular form of cashless payment countrywide. “Currently this is acceptable for corporate needs in the country,” says Rafael J. Consing Vice President and Treasurer at ICTSI. Cheques drawn within the Greater Manila region are cleared within three days while cheques issued elsewhere take seven days to clear. “However most corporates have in place a credit facility, such as bills purchase, which allows them to obtain instant funding and not have to wait for the cheque to clear,” says Palad.</p>
<p>“Cheques are a safe form of payment and there is little risk exposure when dealing with large companies,” says Velilla Jr. “However there is some exposure when dealing with SMEs and we have encountered some instances of bounced cheques.” Interestingly, being responsible for a bounced cheque is a criminal offence in the Philippines, which can lead to lengthy legal procedures.</p>
<p>Electronic payments is an area which many corporates would like the Philippines to develop, similar to the country’s regional neighbours. While the ability to conduct electronic payments already exists in the country, the cost is too high for it to be a viable option for corporates. This pertains to the average daily balance which has to be maintained in the account – which can range from PHP 500,000 and above. While these payments are often waived for multinationals due to collateral business, it remains a burden for SMEs operating in the country.</p>
<p>“E-payments also pose a problem when looking to obtain official receipts from the supplier for the payment. Corporates are required to have these official receipts for VAT purposes and also as support documents when registering the payments with the Bureau of Internal Revenue,” says Palad. “It would be beneficial if the cost was reduced,” he continues. “Electronic payments would be more efficient, safer and also bring us in line with other countries in the region. However, the conservative nature of the Philippines and the fact the banks would lose a degree of profit means that it remains to be seen how long this transition will take.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-future"">The future</h3>
<p>On the treasury side, more work is still to be done to bring the country in line with other developing Asian nations. “While we have some improvements in the country,” says Palad, “we need to begin to streamline our operations and reduce our banking partners in order to make treasury a more effective tool for the business. More liberal regulations will also help with the development of treasury in the Philippines.” This includes further liberalisation of the PHP which would allow corporates to work with external partners more efficiently and expand their operations. If these improvements occur, Martinez sees a positive future for treasury operations in the Philippines. “As regulations liberalise and companies grow more rapidly, the focus will move ever increasingly onto treasury to support this growth.”</p>

Unleashing the dragon: capital account liberalisation,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>China’s economic might is indisputable. At the end of 2012, it was the world’s largest exporter and the second largest economy. Of the major global economies, it is also the fastest-growing by several percent. And yet, until now, the development and opening up of its financial system has not matched China’s growth as an economic and trading powerhouse.</p>
<p>Its share of world financial integration, excluding reserves of less than 2%, makes a stark contrast against the country’s 10% share of world GDP. Its banking system, the largest in the world by total assets, is also one of the most sheltered to foreign exposure. Furthermore, the renminbi (RMB) is only starting to be traded outside of China – before 2010, Chinese companies were forbidden from paying import or export bills in RMB.</p>
<p>However, plans to open up the country’s capital account – which will effectively allow foreign investors to put money into China and the Chinese to invest overseas – could have major implications for the country itself and the rest of the world.</p>
<h3 id=""steps-thus-far"">Steps thus far</h3>
<p>The acceleration of capital account liberalisation was one of the pledges set out in China’s 12<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan, which was approved in 2011 and covers the period 2011-15. Indeed, China has been taking steps to deregulate its capital account since the early 1980s. But it is only in recent years that Beijing has redoubled its commitment to this opening up, thus boosting the momentum of reforms.</p>
<p>China took steps towards larger-scale capital account opening in 2002 with its Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, which allows licenced overseas investors to trade in RMB-denominated shares. This was followed up in 2007 with the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme, which allows capital raised from Chinese investors to be invested abroad.</p>
<p>Given the scale of the financial resources effectively locked up in China, the impact on financial markets, both in China and internationally, of liberalising China’s capital account could be significant. Gross national savings in China are set to reach almost $5 trillion in 2014 (compared with $3 trillion in the US), and this wealth could be channelled to acquire a large portion of global financial assets in the long term if the capital account is opened up.</p>
<p>Before large-scale liberalisation is implemented, a pilot programme has been put in place to monitor how corporates adapt to the measures.</p>
<h3 id=""pilot-scheme"">Pilot scheme</h3>
<p>In late 2012, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) initiated a pilot scheme by which 13 Beijing- and Shanghai-based companies, including the China treasuries of Caterpillar, Intel, Samsung and Shell, could set up a cross-border FX cash pool. A second batch of companies, in other regions beyond Beijing and Shanghai, was added to the pilot in 2013.</p>
<p>“Capital account liberalisation is an important part of the RMB’s journey towards internationalisation – an idea which has been around in the market for some time now,” says Anthony Lin, China Head of Corporate Bank, Trade Finance and Cash Management for Corporates at Deutsche Bank. “We see the pilot scheme as a big move. It’s really the first strong signal from Beijing about capital account deregulation,” he adds.</p>
<p>The launch of the SAFE pilot programme allowed foreign currency, two-way cash pooling, as well as centralised payment and collection on a company’s current account. It also technically allowed netting for trade settlement to take place, explains Lin. Before the 2012 pilot scheme, cross-border cash pooling was a technical impossibility in China, so now the ability to pool cash is undoubtedly the biggest boon to treasurers to come out of the deregulation process so far. “This is definitely seen as a positive development by corporate treasurers, some of whom were very keen to take part in the pilot and get a first-mover advantage. It gives corporates opportunities to better integrate their cash pool in China with the rest of the world. You improve efficiency, and enhance your risk management, fully integrating the China business with the global franchise,” says Lin.</p>
<h3 id=""free-trade-zone"">Free Trade Zone</h3>
<p>Linked closely to the capital account liberalisation plans is the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ). Launched in September 2013, the SFTZ is a testing ground for a number of China’s economic reforms. One of Beijing’s key goals in setting up the zone is facilitating foreign investment into China and Chinese investment abroad. The SFTZ is often spoken about in the same breath as capital account deregulation, as RMB convertibility and unlimited foreign currency exchange are permitted within the zone. “The SFTZ and the regulation around it is another big step to supporting capital account liberalisation. Indeed, we are seeing the establishment of semi-capital account convertibility in the zone,” says Deutsche’s Lin.</p>
<p>One advantage of the SFTZ is that it allows companies to further expand their business in China. “Companies in the zone now face a significantly simplified documentation process, which is very important when you come to the execution of some transactions,” says Lin. “There is also a smoother channel for direct investment. Companies are required to file a single registration, whereas before they had to order pre-approval from SAFE.”</p>
<blockquote>

<p><cite>Anthony Lin, Deutsche Bank</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as reducing the burden of bureaucracy, the SFTZ is, along with other regulatory changes, helping MNCs deal with the challenge of trapped cash in China. For example, full two-way cash sweeping is being trialled in the zone and is expected to be rolled out nationwide in the not-too-distant future. To find out more about trapped cash in China, see our <a href=""/2014/05/the-end-of-trapped-cash-in-china-ttpv"">Point of View</a> feature.</p>
<p>Foreign companies in the zone are also allowed to convert 100% of their registered foreign currency capital at any time, subject to certain supervisions. Again, this was not possible under the former regulatory regime. “Corporates will have much better management of their capital from an exchange risk and timing perspective as a result,” adds Lin.</p>
<h3 id=""playing-it-safe"">Playing it SAFE</h3>
<p>Although some ambiguity is inevitable with any new regulation, it appears that SAFE is largely taking on board the needs of corporates as it proceeds with the reforms. Li-Gang Liu, Chief Economist, Greater China at ANZ, believes the regulator’s willingness to listen to companies has been key in expanding the pilot to the wider market. “In the very beginning when the programme was announced, it was launched as a pilot programme because SAFE wanted to see how enthusiastically MNCs would take this opportunity. It then quickly spread to other corporates who had been waiting to pool cash,” says Liu. “SAFE understands corporates’ challenges – partly because it listened to a number of MNC treasurers’ suggestions before the pilot was launched.”</p>
<p>Lin agrees that SAFE’s approach to keep corporates in the loop as it proceeds with the deregulation is working so far. “The regulators have demonstrated they know the market and understand customer needs very well. They are very open-minded,” he says. “They welcome new ideas, and we’ve spent a lot of time bringing clients, and their new ideas, to the regulators. Not every single idea will get through, of course, but through this process, it helps regulators to understand the actual market situation.”</p>
<p>Deutsche’s Lin thinks the measures instigated by SAFE could encourage more MNCs to set up treasury functions in China, but cautions there is more to it than capital account liberalisation. “These measures have made it more attractive for MNCs, and corporates are generally very excited about the direction things are going in. But there are still many other factors that companies will consider when they’re setting up treasury operations, such as the FX environment, interest rates, logistics, and tax, and these other factors also need to be developed together with the regulators,” he says.</p>
<p>ANZ’s Liu, on the other hand, believes the issue is not attracting more MNCs to China, but better connecting the treasuries of those already there with their central offices abroad. “Most of the big MNCs already have treasury operations in China. The key is whether their operations in China can now be easily linked with their treasury operating centre in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, or wherever that may be. SAFE is attempting to allow just that kind of linkage, with fewer restrictions, with the liberalisation measures,” he says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If China proceeds to liberalise its capital account over the next decade or so, it has the potential to be a force for growth and stability not just in China but also for the international monetary and financial system.”</p>
<p><cite>John Hooley, Bank of England</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""complex-business"">Complex business</h3>
<p>Given the scale of the task, deregulating China’s capital account will not always be plain sailing, nor will it be fast. “Everyone involved understands that this is essential, but it is also a very large and complex process, and it should be no surprise if you don’t get everything you want from it in one go,” says Lin. “If you expect everything to happen overnight, then you’ll be disappointed. The regulators are taking a step-by-step, progressive approach to implementing it, and the development of the SFTZ has created an environment that allows more aggressive liberalisation in a managed manner, but it will take time.”</p>
<p>Not only is the process complex, but Beijing is moving into the unknown. Regulators may need to seek advice from outside. “This will not be a trivial task. Given that Chinese capital account liberalisation could lead to dramatic changes in the global financial landscape, policymakers will be facing uncharted territory. To succeed, policy co-operation between national authorities is likely to be necessary, both to increase understanding of the risks and to develop common policy approaches,” writes Bank of England’s John Hooley in a Q4 2013 quarterly bulletin.</p>
<p>Beyond the initial complexities, deregulation also poses a larger macroeconomic risk. If liberalisation continues at its current pace, and as a result large portions of the world’s financial assets are acquired by Chinese owners, future unexpected shocks to China’s economy – which, with a closed capital account, would be dealt with domestically by Beijing – could have serious repercussions for the world economy. China should also take note of other countries’ experience with capital account deregulation; as such a move has often historically been followed by exchange rate or banking crises. However, these crises have not always occurred in the immediate aftermath of the liberalisation – indeed, in the cases of Japan and the UK, it was a full decade after the reforms were put in place.</p>
<p>Some observers feel China is not ready for full capital account liberalisation, given the underdeveloped nature of its financial markets. And there is the risk that if China opens up its capital account too much, too soon, it will be hit with a significant liquidity shortage. After all, with such a heavy reliance on domestic deposits, moving just a small portion of those funds overseas could pose significant problems to its large but China-focused banking system.</p>
<p>However, under certain conditions, Chinese companies may prefer to keep their money at home. Liu points out that many corporates in China have recently chosen to keep their RMB onshore, as a response to the RMB’s steady appreciation against the dollar and the high-yield on RMB bonds, adding that Chinese corporates with funds abroad have repatriated the money for investment for the same reason. He says that it may take some time before a reverse flow – that is, corporates sending RMB abroad for investment – takes place.</p>
<h3 id=""incremental-benefits"">Incremental benefits</h3>
<p>Despite the risks, if handled correctly, the benefits of capital account liberalisation could be huge, not just to China. “If China proceeds to liberalise its capital account over the next decade or so, it has the potential to be a force for growth and stability not just in China but also for the international monetary and financial system,” says Bank of England’s Hooley.</p>
<p>With the 12<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan approved in 2011, and the first SAFE pilot schemes coming into effect just over a year later, the effects of capital account liberalisation are likely to be felt incrementally. “We have probably already started to feel the impact, albeit slightly,” says Liu. “This is a continuous process, alongside the SFTZ experiment. We expect China’s capital account liberalisation to accelerate, to the point where the RMB could be a freely convertible currency by 2020, by which time the capital account could be mostly open,” says Liu.</p>
<p>He also believes that given the scale of the financial resources within China, some of those funds will eventually work their way out of the country. “It’s inevitable that there will at some point be a capital outflow from China because the reserve is currently huge. Chinese corporates and residents have very little foreign currency exposure and they cannot diversify their home-bias at the moment. If the government can actively encourage this capital outflow, there could be a very large initial movement from China to the rest of the world, and to some extent countries with close trade relationships with China could benefit from such a capital outflow.”</p>
<h3 id=""forward-looking"">Forward-looking</h3>
<p>This will be an extremely interesting space for treasurers to watch going forward, and not just those with operations in China. After all, once the dragon has been allowed out of the box, and the capital starts to flow from China to the rest of the world, the global financial system may never be the same again.</p>

<p>Like many economies in South East Asia, Malaysia boomed during the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, transforming from a primarily agrarian economy to a multi-sector economy dominated by manufacturing and exports. The Asian financial crisis of 1997, however, put a halt to Malaysia’s development, damaging its economy and sending it into recession. Thankfully though, driven by exports and government spending, Malaysia recovered more quickly from the crisis than neighbouring countries, growing steadily though the 2000s and only suffering a slight recession at the tail end of the financial crisis in 2009.</p>
<h3 id=""current-economy"">Current economy</h3>
<p>Malaysia is now home to an open, stable and vibrant economy which, according to statistics from the country’s central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, grew by 4.7% in 2013. Inflation in the country is low, as is unemployment, with per capita income averaging around $10,000, which is $5,000 shy of the World Bank’s threshold for a high-income nation. Growth is predicted to continue in 2014 due to an increase in domestic demand, continued foreign direct investment, and a greater demand for exports.</p>
<p>Indeed, exports continue to be the main driver of the Malaysian economy, contributing $247 billion in 2012, according to CIA statistics. Electronic equipment, palm oil and natural gas comprise some of Malaysia’s key exports with Singapore, China, Japan and the United States among its main trading partners. In recent years however, the government has looked to diversify the economy to maintain growth and strengthen its position through increasing domestic demand and relying less on its exports and natural resources.</p>
<h3 id=""20-20-vision"">20/20 vision</h3>
<p>Malaysia’s goal of becoming a fully developed nation was revisited following the recent global financial crisis as the nation looked to get back on course to meet its 2020 target. As a result, the wide-ranging New Economic Model (NEM) was introduced in 2010 to achieve this. At the heart of the NEM is the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) implemented to attract $444 billion in investment and create 3.3 million new jobs by 2020. The ETP is also intended to strengthen the commercial environment and make Malaysian businesses globally competitive. This will be achieved by increasing competition, improving standards, reforming public finances and service delivery, changing the government’s role in business and developing human capital.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the plan was immediately evident as, eight months after its launch, the Malaysian government announced that the country had received MYR 170 billion ($55.84 billion) in investment and that it expected to create 362,396 jobs.</p>
<p>To achieve developed nation status by 2020 the NEM called for 6% year-on-year GNI growth. However, in 2012 Malaysia only posted a 4% GNI increase, 2% lower than its target of 6%. Despite this disappointing growth, the government believes that Malaysia is “on the right track to hit high-income status by 2020”.</p>
<h3 id=""trouble-spots"">Trouble spots</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, the country faces some challenges ahead. Malaysia has continually run a budget deficit since 1998, which currently sits at 4.5% of the country’s GDP. The rate of this debt has been increasing since the global financial crisis as government investment has increased in an attempt to stimulate the economy. The government has expressed a desire to reduce the deficit to 3.5% over the coming year.</p>
<p>The Asia Foundation, a non-profit international development organisation, highlights another worry for the Malaysian economy, claiming that it risks falling victim to the middle-income trap. A lack of innovation, low investment in technology, declining standards in education and stagnating productivity are cited as areas of concern for Malaysia. A RBS report issues a similar warning, highlighting that the country faces future economic problems as it has exhausted its fiscal flexibility.</p>
<h3 id=""financial-sector"">Financial sector</h3>
<p>On a more positive note, the World Bank has recently given Malaysia’s financial sector a vote of confidence. Citing it as stable and well capitalised, the World Bank believes the sector’s growth can continue over the coming years. Following the 1997 financial crisis, a Financial Services Master Plan (FSMP) was introduced with a view to creating a modern, healthy, forward-looking financial sector. This has seen the sector greatly improve, adopting global standards of supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>In 2011, the government released a blueprint for the financial sector leading up to 2020. The blueprint calls for the further development of the sector in order for it to become more competitive, dynamic, inclusive and diversified over the coming years. Further regional and international integration is also called for to allow the financial sector to meet both domestic and international needs. The overarching goal of the blueprint is to drive the sector beyond being an enabler of growth and to becoming a catalyst for growth.</p>
<p>Thus far, the development of the financial sector has created a banking landscape shared by both local and global banks. “Local banks tend to be used by corporates primarily for vanilla products,” says Anne Rodrigues, President of the Malaysian Association of Corporate Treasurers (MACT). “Global banks, on the other hand, are quite active in hybrid products, especially those which involve cross-border interactions.”</p>
<h3 id=""islamic-banking"">Islamic banking</h3>
<p>Malaysia is also host to one the world’s foremost Islamic financial sectors alongside the GCC nations. The first Islamic bank in Malaysia was established following the Islamic Banking Act of 1983. Since then, the liberalisation of Islamic finance and the welcoming business environment has only seen the sector increase in strength. Islamic institutions in Malaysia now account for around 25% of all financial assets in the country.</p>
<p>According to the Malaysian International Islamic Finance Centre, the country’s Islamic banking sector outpaces the regular sector with average yearly asset growth of 18.6%. This is shared amongst a diverse range of banks including foreign-owned subsidiaries which can offer corporates in the country a diverse range of Islamic financial products.</p>
<h3 id=""capital-markets"">Capital markets</h3>
<p>A 2014 study by the International Organisation of Securities Committees (IOSCO) highlights the strength of the Malaysian Stock Exchange. The IOSCO study concluded that the development and increased regulation of Malaysia’s capital markets was beginning to attract long-term investment. IOSCO Chairman Greg Medcraft cited the Malaysian capital markets as a “great template for emerging markets.”</p>
<p>“The robustness of the capital markets,” says Krishna Chetti, CEO of BNP Paribas Malaysia, “can be attributed to the market acceptance of clearly defined, stable and transparent guidelines in addition to continuous stakeholder investment allowing for orderly market activities.” The strength of the Malaysian capital markets means that it is not only domestic companies which use them. “In recent years, foreign corporates have also commenced tapping debt and equity funds from the Malaysian capital markets,” says Chetti.</p>
<p>“The Malaysian capital markets certainly offer what corporates require,” says Mohamed bin Derwish, General Manager of Corporate Finance at Telekom Malaysia. “They have grown substantially since the 1990s and are now very large and deep.” Indeed, statistics released last year by the Securities Commission highlight that, since 2000, the size of the market has tripled to RM 2.5 trillion, or 264% of the country’s GDP. In 2012, Malaysia was the fifth largest IPO destination in the world and the fourth most active corporate bond issuer in Asia.</p>
<p>With greater integration of the ASEAN region and the creation of the ASEAN economic community, Derwish expects the capital markets to further improve. “There are already programmes in place for the integration of ASEAN and going forward the tapping of funds and liquidity will increasingly become cross-border,” he says. “Malaysia will be well equipped to take advantage of this.”</p>
<p>The development of the Malaysian capital markets has also been boosted by the growth of Islamic bonds, known as Sukuk. Malaysia is currently the world’s primary issuer of Sukuk, accounting for 60% of the global total as of June 2013. “Sukuk are popular with corporates in the country and over the last year the majority of issues have been Islamic,” says the MACTS Rodrigues. “Many companies in the Middle East are also using Malaysia to issue Sukuks. Malaysia’s lower funding costs are one of the main drivers of this.”</p>
<p>Malaysia is keen on growing its Sukuk market, introducing the Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 to further strengthen Islamic financial institutions. “Being a conducive environment for Sukuk transactions, I believe that Malaysia has what it takes to attract more institutions from all over aiming to tap Malaysia’s Islamic finance marketplace and the pool of liquidity,” stated Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin in 2013. For Yassin, future growth depends on expertise, Sharia governance and practices, and improved legal and regulatory frameworks.</p>
<h3 id=""payments-systems"">Payments systems</h3>
<p>“The payments systems in Malaysia,” says Abdul Raof Latiff, Head of Treasury Services, ASEAN, J.P. Morgan, “have come a long way.” The legacy system in Malaysia during the ‘80s and ‘90s comprised a multi-state clearing system which has now been replaced with a single clearing zone. “This has made payment execution in the country much faster and more efficient for banks and their clients from both a time and cost perspective,” says Latiff. Improved cross-border payments have also been on the central bank’s radar and recent developments have seen the real-time electronic transfer of funds and securities system (RENTAS) extend its services to include the renminbi, further facilitating regional trade and allowing corporates to reduce settlement risk for renminbi transactions.</p>
<p>Malaysia has also looked to adopt new payments technology. One recent example of this is the central bank’s adoption of SWIFT as its access channel to connect to RENTAS. “Malaysia keeps a watchful eye over developments in the payments space and looks to keep improving,” says Latiff. “Due to this, Malaysia now has an advanced payments system compared with developed countries.”</p>
<h3 id=""drive-towards-electronic-payments"">Drive towards electronic payments</h3>
<p>In 2013, 1.6 billion financial transactions were carried out via electronic means in Malaysia, according to statistics from the central bank. The government is looking to further increase this over the next few years, creating a cashless society by developing the payment infrastructure – allowing annual savings of up to 1% of GDP.</p>
<p>“The policies which are being introduced to reach a cashless society are very aggressive,” says MACT’s Rodrigues. “Cheques currently make up 2% of the GDP and they want to eradicate this completely.” In 2013, 204 million cheques were issued according to the central bank and the aim is to reduce this to 100 million by 2020. To achieve this, charges associated with issuing cheques have increased to 50 sen (cents), as of 1<sup>st</sup> April 2014. This cost is set to rise until 2020 when it will match the cost of providing the service, currently 3 MYR ($0.93).</p>
<p>“The move towards a cashless society will certainly benefit corporates in the country,” asserts Rodrigues. “Some of these benefits include improving the efficiency of working capital and use of the balance sheet. There will also be a reduction in idle cash and delays in payments (which cheques can cause).” BNP Paribas’s Chetti agrees, highlighting that, “improvements in e-transactions have aided corporates in their daily tasks such as reconciliation and reporting.”</p>
<p>As the move to cashless payments gathers pace, companies may need to make some alterations to their operations. “At Telekom Malaysia we are working with our procurement department to ensure our vendors have the correct banking structure for electronic payments,” says Derwish. “Around 50% of our payments are already made electronically. We want to increase this to 80% over the coming year to reduce the cost of making payments.”</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-landscape"">Treasury landscape</h3>
<p>“The development of corporate treasury in Malaysia means that on the spectrum between Indonesia, Hong Kong and Singapore, Malaysia would be somewhere in the middle,” says Rodrigues. “The movement of cash in Malaysia is smooth and both netting and pooling arrangements are permitted both in-country and cross-border, due to the lifting of foreign exchange controls.”</p>
<p>“At Telekom Malaysia, we have been able to adopt the best international standards, we have taken advantage of cash pooling and we now centralise our operations and carry out inter-company lending from within the group,” says Telekom Malaysia’s Derwish. Through synchronising the company’s cash management system with their financial services, Telekom Malaysia has been able to create more efficiency and streamline its operations. “We are now able to fully maximise the use of money within the group and meet group demands on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>Over the last decade, many Malaysian companies have grown to have large international operations and so the development of corporate treasury has followed this growth. “Traditionally,” says J.P. Morgan’s Latiff, “the primary issue for a treasurer was ensuring their company was able to conduct its day-to-day business. Little time and money was spent on technology and the design of the treasury.” As companies in the country are expanding however, many treasurers are now looking at ways that they can improve their treasury operations. “They typically only begin to focus on this as they grow and become more operationally complex,” says Latiff. “At that point, it’s a question of how they can get back to basics around visibility, control and efficiency of their cash, leading to better yields. To achieve this, companies are increasingly looking towards different models of centralisation through which they can potentially consolidate their accounts and streamline credit relationships, for example.”</p>
<p>With the growth of Malaysian companies across borders, another area which Latiff highlights as being important for corporates is maximising their yield in foreign countries. “Many Malaysian companies conduct overseas business in the ASEAN countries and many of these are restrictive,” says Laftiff. The inability to repatriate cash easily in many of these countries often leaves it trapped. “Our customers are therefore asking for ways in which they can make the most of their money in these countries.”</p>
<h3 id=""regional-treasury-management"">Regional treasury management</h3>
<p>Traditionally a hub for shared service centres (SSC), Malaysia has recently begun to take steps to promote itself as a Regional Treasury Centre (RTC) to compete with Singapore and Hong Kong. To initiate this drive, the 2012 Malaysia budget, which focused on national transformation, contained tax incentives to entice corporates to locate their RTC in Malaysia. As part of a wider strategy to bring more investment into the country, the incentives include a 70% tax exemption for five years on income from qualifying treasury services, such as cash management and investment, rendered to related companies. Also a withholding tax exception and stamp duty exemption is offered, among other incentives.</p>
<p>To obtain the benefits of the incentives however, a company has to have at least three related foreign companies and derive 80% of its treasury income outside Malaysia. “For Malaysian companies like ours,” says Derwish, “we are unable to benefit from the incentives. We have therefore begun discussions to extend to Malaysian-based operations as well.”</p>
<p>Traditionally corporates may look to the well-established treasury centres of Singapore and Hong Kong. However Rodrigues believes that “Malaysia does have one key edge over these being an established manufacturing centre. This means Malaysia already has a large number of multinationals based in the country. It would therefore make sense for these companies to base their RTMC where their manufacturing centre is,” she says. “It may be because of this that we see a number of MNC’s in the manufacturing industry start looking toward relocating to Malaysia.”</p>
<p>“Malaysia also has the advantage of providing stability, politically and economically,” says BNP Paribas’s Chetti. “Coupled with the push to become a leading international and regional Islamic finance hub and the incentives offered by global corporates who establish their operations in the country, it shows that Malaysia is committed to establishing itself as a prominent treasury destination.”</p>
<h3 id=""outlook"">Outlook</h3>
<p>Last year, telecommunications group Axiata became one of the first companies to establish a RTC in Malaysia. On the whole however, companies have been slow to adopt Malaysia as their RTC, something which Rodrigues puts down to the infancy of the incentives. “We also have strong competitors in Singapore and Hong Kong,” highlights Rodrigues, “Malaysia must therefore continue to review and renew its incentives to see how it can encourage MNCs treasuries to use the country.” In doing so, Malaysia can continue to develop its financial sectors and infrastructure, further raising its appeal and enhancing its position as a hub of treasury operations in the region.</p>
<p>“Overall,” says Rodrigues, “I see corporate treasury becoming an increasingly vibrant industry in Malaysia over the coming years.”</p>

<img alt=""J.P. Morgan"" class=""logo org"" height=""19"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jpmorgan-logo-2014-95x19.png"" width=""95""/>
<p>Email: <a href=""mailto:hooiching.wong@jpmorgan.com"">hooiching.wong@jpmorgan.com</a></p>
<p>Website: <a href=""http://www.jpmorgan.com/ts"" target=""_blank"">www.jpmorgan.com/ts</a></p>

<p>Did you know that more than 200 of the world’s leading multinationals have Shared Service Centres (SSCs) in Malaysia<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>? If you want highly competitive running costs and personnel capable of managing high value treasury activities, why not join them?</p>
<p>Oil, pharmaceuticals, banking, agribusiness, insurance, automotive and more – it’s hard to find an industry sector not represented by a global multinational’s SSC in Malaysia. While other countries may be grabbing the SSC headlines, Malaysia has been building a strong case for itself with a highly skilled workforce, attractive incentives, low financial risk and business efficiency. Little wonder that some 60,000<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> people in Malaysia now work in SSCs, with a significant proportion of those working in treasury and finance roles.</p>
<h3 id=""ideal-demographic-growing-value"">Ideal demographic, growing value</h3>
<p>Much of the SSC activities in Malaysia over the past eight years or more have been driven by leading US and European multinationals. However, they are now being joined by a growing number of top tier corporates from Malaysia, as well as from other parts of Asia. In many cases, many of these corporations are now looking to extract more value from their current operations by running customer-facing and strategic finance activities. Some are also either in the midst of or have expanded their scope of centralisation to include the establishment of Treasury Management Centres (TMCs).</p>
<p>While the initial points of attraction for some of these companies may be cost management and standardisation, for some time, there has been a growing realisation that establishing an SSC in Malaysia can offer substantive advantages further up the value pyramid. Previously, SSCs in Malaysia typically focused on IT outsourcing such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, enterprise applications or IT consulting services, before subsequently adding business process outsourcing such as Accounts Payables and Receivables, contact centre, and legal services. Now, there is increasing emphasis on the top of the value pyramid with knowledge process outsourcing services, such as treasury forecasting, risk management, market research, customer analytics and engineering services.</p>
<p>This is in part due to the efforts of the Malaysia Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC) which actively encourages companies to bring higher value-add and more complex processes to the country. This is in line with the Malaysian government’s objective of becoming a developed country by 2020.</p>
<h3 id=""all-the-skills-you-need"">All the skills you need</h3>
<p>Malaysia’s citizens certainly have the necessary capabilities to handle such higher value activities. For instance, the citizens of Kuala Lumpur have a literacy rate of 97.5% and the city is home to 13 tertiary education institutions, 79 high schools, 155 elementary schools and 136 kindergartens<sup id=""fnref:3""><a href=""#fn:3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup>. Language skills are essential in SSCs that may be servicing multiple countries. Not only does Malaysia have 7.4 million citizens who speak English of a high standard<sup id=""fnref:4""><a href=""#fn:4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup>, the population’s other first languages include those common in major markets in the region, including Hindi and Mandarin, whilst secondary languages spoken include Thai, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese<sup id=""fnref:5""><a href=""#fn:5"" rel=""footnote"">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id=""maximise-value-minimise-cost"">Maximise value, minimise cost</h3>
<p>Malaysia has further advantages as an SSC location in terms of both the cost of skilled personnel and the business environment more generally. A similar situation applies to treasury roles. For instance, according to research by Robert Walters Global Salary Survey 2014, current salaries for treasury managers in Singapore range from USD 95,000 – USD 158,000, compared with just USD 45,000 – USD 58,000 in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>The costs of housing an SSC also favour Malaysia. For example, the average total cost of leasing prime net usable space including rent, maintenance costs and tax is USD 4180 in Kuala Lumpur versus USD 11,220 in Singapore<sup id=""fnref:6""><a href=""#fn:6"" rel=""footnote"">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the availability of suitably skilled personnel, this highly competitive cost base represents an important opportunity for corporations looking to establish an SSC or TMC in Asia. Rather than just traditional “back office” activities, customer-facing functions such as Accounts Receivables can be operated efficiently and reliably in Malaysia. Furthermore, higher value functions, such as hedging, cash forecasting and liquidity management can also be viably undertaken – and at a very competitive cost.</p>
<h3 id=""elbowing-the-competition-aside"">Elbowing the competition aside</h3>
<p>Malaysia’s business environment ranks well globally. For eight years running, Malaysia has been one of the top three global shared services outsourcing locations in AT Kearney’s Global Services Location Index<sup id=""fnref:7""><a href=""#fn:7"" rel=""footnote"">7</a></sup>. Furthermore, one of the three primary factors in the Kearney rankings is business environment, which assesses how conducive a location is to business. Malaysia scores particularly strongly in this regard, ranking appreciably higher than countries such as India and China and even approaching the scores of developed markets such as the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Malaysia makes a compelling value and performance case for any regional or global corporation considering the implementation of a Shared Service Centre (SSC)/Treasury Management Centre (TMC) in Asia, for processing or for corporate treasury activities respectively. A location in the heart of Asia, reasonable costs, the availability of suitably skilled and bilingual treasury/finance personnel, and a government keen to deliver a business-friendly environment, will give Malaysia a clear SSC/TMC edge for many corporations.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Malaysian government is leading the introduction of new and advanced technology, and in this regard, the country ranks in the top ten ahead of most other Asian countries and even above some developed economies such as Australia<sup id=""fnref:8""><a href=""#fn:8"" rel=""footnote"">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In terms of labour market and business efficiency, Malaysia also performs strongly. In both cases it ranks fourth – ahead of multiple developed economies such as Germany, The Netherlands, the UK and the US, as well as China, India and other smaller Asian countries<sup id=""fnref:9""><a href=""#fn:9"" rel=""footnote"">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Malaysia is making a targeted pitch for SSCs, with 25 designated areas accredited by the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) Malaysia<sup id=""fnref:10""><a href=""#fn:10"" rel=""footnote"">10</a></sup> for these around the country. All of these areas meet the infrastructure needs of global as well as regional SSCs that conduct large scale financial processing or mission critical treasury activities, such as high quality fiber optic connectivity. Furthermore, MDeC provides a bill of guarantees, which includes providing competitive financial incentives such as ‘pioneer’ status, which includes 100% tax exemption for up to ten years. In addition to these national initiatives, individual states within Malaysia are making their own promotional efforts to attract SSC business.</p>
<h3 id=""a-warm-welcome-for-tmcs"">A warm welcome for TMCs</h3>
<p>Whilst Malaysia’s initiatives to attract SSCs have already reached a considerably high profile, as part of its strategy of bringing in jobs of higher skill levels and value-add, the country is also providing incentives for TMCs as well. Approved TMCs are given a 70% exemption on certain statutory income arising from treasury services rendered to related companies for five years.</p>
<p>Statutory income includes all fees and/or management income from providing qualifying services to related companies in Malaysia and overseas. Amongst others, these comprise revenue arising from lending/financing, placement of surplus funds and group risk management activity such as FX, interest rate, market and commodity risks.</p>
<h3 id=""maximise-the-value-of-global-banks"">Maximise the value of global banks</h3>
<p>While Malaysia clearly has much to offer corporates looking for a location for a global or regional SSC, maximising the value achieved by one and ensuring its smooth implementation is not a trivial matter. This is an area where a bank with a global perspective and connectivity can add significant value. In the case of an Asian corporate looking to implement its first SSC, a global bank can share the best practices that it sees being used by global multinationals, thus providing a valuable benchmark.</p>
<p>Such calibre of a global bank adds a different sort of value when a US or European multinational looks to establish an SSC in a location such as Malaysia. In such instances, the value comes from the bank’s global network and its technical expertise in helping such multinationals consolidate their banking providers consistent with the corporation’s global treasury strategy and business needs. This is difficult to achieve with a local bank which lacks the wide global network required to extract the maximum value from standardisation of processes and connectivity.</p>
<p>In the case of both Asian and global multinationals, another area where a bank with a global perspective can add value is in the validation of project roadmaps, often provided by external consultants. These roadmaps lay out the steps and process changes required to establish an SSC or TMC, but for a variety of reasons, may not be entirely feasible. A suitably qualified global bank can assess the practicability of these roadmaps and suggest appropriate refinements or amendments that will ensure a smooth transition. Concurrently, it can also assist in other areas, such as reviewing treasury management policies or recommending the most efficient way to aggregate surplus liquidity resulting from SSC operations, into a regional or global liquidity management structure.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Malaysia makes a compelling value and performance case for any regional or global corporation considering the implementation of an SSC/TMC in Asia, for processing or for corporate treasury activities respectively. A location in the heart of Asia, reasonable costs, the availability of suitably skilled and bilingual treasury/finance personnel, and a government keen to deliver a business-friendly environment, will give Malaysia a clear SSC/TMC edge for many corporations.</p>
<p>Yet attractive as all these factors are, in isolation, they are not enough. Maximising the value of this benign landscape requires the support of a banking partner that has the global perspective to assist the corporate client in the realisation of global best SSC practice. Furthermore, this has to be delivered in the context of a wider appreciation of the client’s holistic needs and how a regional or global SSC in Malaysia can deliver optimal support for these.</p>

The role of shadow banking,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Warnings about the impact of shadow banking, where non-bank intermediaries effectively carry out traditional banking functions, on the Chinese economy have come from a variety of sources. For example, last July the IMF said it was ‘increasingly urgent’ for China to shift away from its credit-intensive growth model, which it said was ‘not sustainable and is raising vulnerabilities’.</p>
<p>Many analysts and industry commentators have also made their viewpoints clear. Wei Yao, China economist at Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking, says conditions are ripe for defaults, with slowing credit growth, elevated costs of funding, waning economic momentum and tighter financial regulation. Elsewhere Thomson Reuters refers to the implications of a rebound in China’s average inflation rate, as the government could increase the deposit rate to curb inflation. A higher interest rate would reduce the net interest margin, thereby reducing the amount of funds flowing into shadow banking products and increasing the risk of a funds shortage.</p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, Nomura blames shadow banking for deepening income inequality and facilitating wealth transfer from the poor to the rich. Because many products are only available to high net worth retail investors, only the wealthy can take advantage of the implicit government guarantee, while the government will likely have to pick up losses (at least from local government financing vehicle-related investments) using public funds. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s recent decision to bail out investors in its ‘Credit Equals Gold No. 1’ investment scheme has added to the sense that savers are effectively being insured against the effects of bad investment choices.</p>
<p>The role of shadow banking in China only appears to be increasing. The Financial Stability Board’s 2013 global shadow banking monitoring report refers to a 42% increase in assets of ‘other financial intermediaries’ in China in 2012. According to analysis from Crédit Suisse, core Chinese shadow banking products were worth RMB 22.8 trillion ($3.72 trillion) at the end of 2012, accounting for 44% of GDP and half of all new credit issued. Crédit Suisse likens some of these shadow banking products on offer to the collateralised debt obligations offered in the US before the financial crisis, albeit without established regulation and with even less surveillance.</p>
<h3 id=""a-positive-role"">A positive role?</h3>
<p>However, a document circulated by the Chinese government in December refers to the emergence of shadow banks as an inevitable result of financial development and innovation and says that as a complement to the traditional banking system, shadow banks play a positive role in serving the real economy and enriching investment channels for ordinary citizens. The document also states that ‘at present’ the country’s shadow banking risks are under control, although guidelines from the State Council call for tighter regulation of banks’ off-balance sheet lending and say that trust companies – the biggest non-bank players – should return to their original purpose as asset managers and not engage in ‘credit-type’ business.</p>
<p>In a new report on the sector, XTEChina Consulting principal Tim Summers states that shadow banking probably does not pose a big threat to public finances right now, but that it may become a source of systemic risk if its rapid growth continues. “The main risks resulting from shadow banking are liquidity risk due to maturity mismatch, credit default risk from loans to weaker companies or projects and the exacerbation of already high corporate overstretch as shadow banking helps plug cash holes. There are few tools available to clearly identify or quantify these risks,” says Summers.</p>
<p>He warns that while part of the demand for informal lending reflects growth potential from innovative or emerging companies, it also reflects a deteriorating environment for at least some corporations in China. “Cash flow pressures for many Chinese companies have grown over recent years. This means a growth in demand for credit, whether to invest in new capacity in an effort to grow out of crisis or simply for bridging loans to help manage cash shortfalls.”</p>
<p>The shadow banking sector provides at best short-term benefit to borrowers who cannot obtain funding from the conventional banking sector for them to buy time to avoid a liquidity crunch, says Peter Wong, founding chairman, International Association of CFOs and Corporate Treasurers (China) and convenor, Hong Kong Association of Corporate Treasurers. “Lenders/investors and financial intermediaries are not assured a sustainable return as borrowers face very high interest costs. The social and economic costs for misallocation of capital will likely outweigh short-term expansion in loss-making fixed asset investment.”</p>
<p>Wong expects increased competition resulting from interest rate liberalisation and deleveraging to force banks to apply sound credit risk management to improve lending margins. “In addition, development of the capital market – including reopening the A-shares IPO; promoting the RMB corporate bond market (especially the high yield segment); and increasing the role of professional/institutional investors will provide the much needed long-term funding and reduce the refinancing risks of bank loans.”</p>
<h3 id=""chasing-shadows"">Chasing shadows</h3>
<p>One of the key questions going forward is whether Chinese regulators have the resources to properly police the shadow banking sector. Wong observes that there are already restrictions on shadow banking loans disguised as wealth management products, with banks distributing such off-balance sheet products facing reputational risk and compliance risk of misrepresentation as well as potential sanction by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC). “Other shadow banking lenders will be discouraged by a deteriorating credit outlook and will find it harder to obtain cheap funding in a tight money supply situation,” Wong adds.</p>
<p>“The process of forcing the state-owned banks to increase their lending to businesses may take longer to achieve as they enjoy certain legacy advantages not accessible to smaller banks or newcomers, such as a sizeable deposit base from state-owned enterprises, lower funding costs with implied government support and comprehensive location coverage nationwide,” he continues.</p>
<p>In early January 2014, the CBRC said it would implement a limited licence regime and set up three to five private banks on a trial basis in an effort to deepen reform in the domestic banking sector. It also said that it would explore lowering the threshold for foreign banks to enter the industry.</p>
<p>“The intention is for the new privately financed banks to fill some of the gap left by reduced shadow banking activity, although certain conditions will need to be put into place including a credible nationwide deposit insurance scheme, further development of the wholesale funding market and improved connectivity and accessibility of multi-bank ATM networks,” Wong acknowledges. “That will provide a much more level playing field to newcomers on sourcing funds and service delivery.” As an economist at the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation (MAPI), which is focused on increasing productivity and innovation in manufacturing, Yingying Xu is well placed to comment on the impact of shadow banking on commercial enterprises doing business in China.</p>
<p>She explains that shadow banking initially boosted export activity because most exporters are small- and medium-sized private businesses and the state-owned banks are mandated to lend to large businesses and state-owned enterprises. “It is only in the last three to four years that the exponential growth of this type of lending to local government (for infrastructure construction) has started to cause concern.”</p>
<p>The issue that has made the largest contribution to the growth of shadow banking in China is the cap on lending and savings rates, which is controlled by the central bank. The state banks will not lend to small businesses because they cannot charge them higher rates than large corporations who have a lower risk profile. Therefore, small businesses have to rely on informal lending for financing, for which they pay higher interest rates – which attracts funding from both formal financial institutions and savers.</p>
<p>“Savers have limited investment options,” says Xu. “The stock market has been depressed for several years and is blighted by insider trading, which has destroyed public confidence, so savers are looking to channel their investments into the informal lending sector.”</p>
<p>“Stronger supervision and regulation will help to contain shadow banking in the short term and will not necessarily have a direct impact on formal lending. But to solve the root cause will need more radical policy change (such as interest rate liberalisation) and that can impact formal lending.”</p>
<h3 id=""reform-needed"">Reform needed</h3>
<p>It has been suggested that Chinese regulators might be given additional resources to properly police the shadow banking sector, but Xu notes that the central bank has moved more rapidly over the last 12 months to liberalise the financial sector, for example by allowing the larger banks to relax the lending rate cap, ending the lending rate floor and allowing the inter-bank rate to be determined by markets.</p>
<p>“However, if the government maintains caps on lending rates and subsidises loans to state-owned enterprises there is no incentive for the banks to lend more to small businesses. One of the major elements that is missing from the liberalisation agenda is reform of state-owned enterprises.” Privately financed banks would probably have more control over the interest rates they charge, but they would not address the problem of interest rate caps within the state banks, she adds.</p>
<p>“Without meaningful reform on liberalisation of interest rates, private banks wouldn’t be able to charge higher rates to riskier borrowers and wouldn’t be able to compete on a level playing field with state-owned banks to attract savings either. The Chinese banking system does not currently allow for proper risk assessment and it is unclear what regulations the privately financed banks would have to comply with. There is risk assessment in state-owned banks, but it is still at an early stage of development.”</p>
<p>According to Chris Devonshire-Ellis, Chairman of Dezan Shira &amp; Associates (which provides tax advice to foreign direct investors across Asia), a local government default this year would not be a surprise and he also refers to similar concerns around some of the smaller local banks. “We have seen this before. The government of Guangdong defaulted on its Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation vehicle in 1999 leaving investors (many of them foreign) out of pocket to the tune of $4.4 billion. Beijing refused to bail them out and I can see this happening again.”</p>
<p>He is not convinced that shadow banking has produced any benefits to the Chinese economy. “While it is true that financing has been obtained, much of it is at high rates and I suspect much of that credit has gone on vanity projects and ‘white elephant’ infrastructure. China has a massive property bubble as a result and while the Chinese have continued to target and measure in simple GDP growth terms alone, this has led to many local governments and even state-owned enterprises investing in pointless projects just to keep their GDP rates high and at targeted performance levels.”</p>
<p>Devonshire-Ellis claims that limiting the growth in loans created outside formal channels without significantly affecting the flow of credit into the economy can only be achieved at a cost. “This will manifest itself by institutions such as local government funds and trusts (as well as some banks) going to the wall. That will be a wake-up call that financing has to be provided by state channels, but the issue here is that even these are notoriously inefficient. China needs to liberalise its banking and financial sectors to sort this out, so there needs to be a dual effect – some sharp and painful lessons followed by reforms.”</p>
<p>He believes China will appear rather less capitalist by the end of this year, but this does not mean that the state will automatically pick up the bill. “The people who invested in schemes like ‘Credit Equals Gold No. 1’ are wealthy Chinese – I think the Communist Party of China will just tell them to swallow their loss. If they complain they will likely face investigation as to how they accumulated their wealth. So the party will nip protests in the bud and blame a few corrupt bankers, businessmen and officials in the normal manner.”</p>
<p>Devonshire-Ellis says increasing business lending by state-owned banks will require reforms at state-owned enterprise-level as well as in the financial and banking sectors. He expects the government to use what will be a messy period as an excuse to push through reforms in the wake of what he believes is going to be a series of bankruptcies during 2014, although these will be restricted to smaller banks and governments. “Then they will have a reason to push through the reforms that to date they have only been talking about. It will be a fait accompli by the reform faction over the traditional hardliners with their vested interests.”</p>
<p>He is not optimistic that privately financed banks will become a major force, although it is possible that reforms and mergers could lead to the creation of some larger banks from what have until now been relatively small players. He also expects to see foreign governments or even banks take equity positions in some of these new institutions.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect the CBRC to lower the entry threshold for foreign banks, but I do expect it to reform market entry and what these banks can do. This would also extend to insurance companies – China desperately needs to get its welfare system onto an insurance-based model and this will be part of any financial reforms, quite apart from the banking sector and easing out all that bad credit and failed schemes.”</p>
<h3 id=""an-alternative-source-of-finance"">An alternative source of finance</h3>
<p>In addition to the property sector, shadow banking has been utilised by industries with excess capacity (including coal mining and steel) as such businesses have faced difficulties getting loans from the formal banking system, explains Wang Ming, Director of Shanghai Yaozhi Asset Management. “The financial sector may be the most ‘damaged’ as shadow banking comes with notable default risks. The rescue of investors in the high yield trust distributed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to fund a family-run coal miner is a fresh warning.”</p>
<p>Ming believes that it will be hard for the government to limit the growth of shadow banking as such a move would be very likely to seriously affect the property sector and slow down China’s economic growth significantly. “Privately financed banks could fill a small part of the gap left by shadow banking, but I don’t think they could do a lot since sectors financed by shadow banking commonly face larger default risks and the new banks are unlikely to ignore these risks.”</p>
<p>He describes lowering the entry threshold for foreign banks as a long-term target for the CBRC. “I don’t think such a move could take place this year or next, as the regulator needs to protect small banks (including the new privately financed banks) from competition from more experienced foreign banks.”</p>
<p>Despite the dire warnings, it appears that shadow banking will remain a significant component of China’s financial system for the foreseeable future. The authorities appear content to maintain current levels of lending, so the challenge for its practitioners will be to stay one step ahead of the regulators to deliver useful financial innovation while seeking short-term profit through regulatory arbitrage.</p>

<p>Dubbed the East Asian miracle in the early 1990s, due to its substantial economic growth, Thailand was considered one of the success stories of the region. During this period, the economy took great strides from its humble agricultural background as Thai society relocated to work in the newly developed industry and service sectors. In the late 1990s, however, cracks began to appear in the economy as the Asian financial crisis hit. This resulted in the virtual collapse of the Thai economy, brought on in part by the very policies that facilitated Thailand’s growth.</p>
<h3 id=""current-economy"">Current economy</h3>
<p>Since the 1997 financial crisis, Thailand has undergone a transformation and now boasts a pro-investment, free-enterprise economy built on a solid infrastructure. Driven by a strong export market, which in 2012 accounted for 75% of its GDP, the Thai economy has recovered well. Manufacturing and agriculture provide the bulk of Thai exports, with the nation’s key trading partners including Japan, China, the United States and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, over the past year there has been a slowdown, which saw the Thai economy enter a recession in the first half of 2013. This was due in large part to tough global economic conditions which led to a decline in demand. Although this trend reversed in the second half of 2013, with increased demand leading to positive growth – and further growth is predicted to continue in 2014 by the Bank of Thailand (BoT) – Thailand’s economy remains heavily reliant on exports, which may pose a challenge to sustainable long-term growth.</p>
<p>An additional challenge facing the Thai economy is political instability – which has blighted the country since a military coup in 2006. Tensions reached the fore during the country’s political crisis of 2008-2010 and both consumer and investor confidence were badly affected. Political tensions surged again in 2013 and have spilled over into 2014, with mass demonstrations and protests on the streets of Bangkok. Jim Foley, Managing Director, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions, Thailand, believes that “the current wave of political uncertainty again poses a danger because it affects the confidence of both local Thai corporates and offshore investors.” The overriding concern is that a continuation of political instability may ultimately deter potential investors and existing businesses may relocate.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a report by The Economist Intelligence Unit points out that the “shortage of labour – both skilled and unskilled – has been a chronic issue for businesses in Thailand”. Despite a low unemployment rate, the report highlights the onset of an ageing population as a key reason for this shortage. Foley recognises this is a challenge, however is keen to put forward a more tempered view: “it is not at a point of crisis,” he says. “Companies can still get workers, but it is becoming more of an issue.” A solution to this may come with the further integration of the ASEAN region and the free flow of labour into Thailand. That said, Foley warns that “this could heighten the problem if members of the workforce choose to leave Thailand for other ASEAN destinations.”</p>
<p>Environmental risk is another challenge that faces corporates operating in Thailand as demonstrated by the floods of 2011. The economic loss caused by the disaster was vast: the World Bank reported it to be $45.7 billion between July and December 2011, with the biggest hit being taken in the manufacturing industry. Since the event the Thai government has invested in water management and flood preparation projects as a means to alleviate the issue, however, in 2013, 17 factories again had to be closed in the industrial zone due to flooding.</p>

<h3 id=""asean-overview"">ASEAN overview</h3>
<p>Thailand is the second largest economy in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is on course to become a key part of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). Looking ahead it is likely that the further integration of the region will prove increasingly important for corporates operating in Thailand. For example, The 2014 American Chamber of Commerce ASEAN Business Outlook Survey stated 70% of companies operating in Thailand see ASEAN integration as helping their company do business in the region. A further 73% said that ASEAN will become more important to their companies’ worldwide revenues over the next two years.</p>
<p>A 2013 Study by the Economist Corporate Network cites economic growth rates, the size and spending power of the consumer population and the growing presence of business customers in the region, as the most attractive points of ASEAN integration. Furthermore, ASEAN will benefit more than just foreign MNC’s looking to invest in the region, many local Thai companies are keen to take advantage of the integration as they believe they have reached their growth limit in the domestic market.</p>

<h3 id=""financial-sector-reform"">Financial sector reform</h3>
<p>A review of the Thai financial sector following the 1997 crisis concluded that it was weak and poorly regulated, and that this had assisted in deepening the crisis. The Thai government has since moved to resolve this issue, launching a three-phase final sector master plan (FSMP) with the aim of making the sector more efficient, competitive and transparent. Here follows a brief outline of each phase:</p>
<h4 id=""phase-i"">Phase I</h4>
<p>Designed to overhaul the commercial banking licence system, phase I was completed in 2009 replacing the legacy system with a streamlined four licence structure. As a result of the changes a number of institutions surrendered their licence, having to either reapply or merge with another bank in order to re-obtain a licence. The reforms have led to “the significant consolidation of the Thai banking sector,” says Foley. To illustrate this, 83 financial institutions operated in Thailand in 2003, which by 2010 was reduced to just 38. “The reforms have made the banks stronger,” says Foley, “and can now benefit larger corporates by offering more operations and greater branch coverage.”</p>
<h4 id=""phase-ii"">Phase II</h4>
<p>Designed to build on the improvements made during phase I, phase II has looked to reduce system-wide operating costs while increasing competition and allowing for greater financial access. New providers have been permitted to enter the market and current banks have been allowed to expand their services. Investment is also being made in the technological infrastructure and in risk management which aims to further strengthen the sector.</p>
<h4 id=""phase-iii"">Phase III</h4>
<p>Scheduled to begin in the next few years, phase III will evaluate the results of phase II and build recommendations based on this.</p>
<p>Although the process is still ongoing, the FSMP has already achieved a number of its objectives including improving the infrastructure of the financial sector. Since 2010, Moody’s has declared the system stable, stating that “Thai banks are well positioned to withstand potential asset-quality challenges because of their strong capitalisation levels and increasing provisioning coverage.” “Thailand now has an efficient financial system,” agrees K. Wanida, Vice President Finance at PTT Group, “with good risk management and corporate governance, which is strong and not burdensome for the country and supportive of economic development in both normal and crisis scenarios.”</p>
<p>The strengthening of the financial sector has improved the operating environment for corporates in Thailand. Local banks now have an extensive branch network, which is important for day-to-day processes and “their increasing strength has allowed companies in Thailand to grow locally and offshore like never before,” says Foley.</p>
<p>The entrance of foreign banks into the Thai market has also given corporates greater choice in terms of relationship, solutions and technologies. Thai energy company PTT now uses both international and local banks depending on the services required. “Companies operating in Thailand now have a greater access to diversified financial services appropriate to demand,” says PTT’s Wanida. “There has also been a reduction in the costs of financial services.”</p>
<p>The single lending limit employed by the BoT, which caps commercial banks’ lending to 25% of their risk capital, still remains an issue for companies who require large amounts of funding, however. The PTT Group for example, which has 300 firms operating under its umbrella which require large capital investment each year has faced issues regarding this. To solve this issue, in 2013 PTT set up an in-house bank to secure financing. The in-house bank, which is located in Singapore, due to its greater regulatory flexibility, will not only solve this issue but also benefit in terms of financial costs and returns on investments.</p>
<h3 id=""trapped-cash"">Trapped cash</h3>
<p>Like many countries in South East Asia, Thailand has capital controls regulating the inflow and outflow of investment in the country. The nature of these controls makes trapped cash an issue for corporates operating in the country. This was highlighted in a recent EuroFinance Corporate Treasury Network Survey where Thailand was ranked sixth globally, and first in South East Asia, among geographies where trapped cash is a concern.</p>
<p>“The primary reason for this,” says Gourang Shah, Managing Director, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions, Singapore “is that corporates are unable to freely carry out cross-border inter-company lending in Thailand. Treasurers are therefore unable to include Thailand as part of their global cash pooling structure, making it difficult to move funds in and out of the country on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>Inter-company lending is not the only issue regarding trapped cash in Thailand. “Corporates need a large amount of documentation, which can include approval from the BoT before they can remove any significant amount of cash out of the country,” says Foley. “For example, any payment over $50,000 in and out of Thailand needs not only full documentation surrounding the payment but also a physical affidavit signed by the company.” Furthermore, profits made offshore have to be repatriated within 360 days.</p>
<p>Over the past year, a number of Asian nations have begun to relax their capital controls relieving the issue of trapped cash. “Thailand is lagging behind the pack on this front,” says Shah, “and unlike some of the other markets, Thailand has not yet been fully opened up and special approval is still needed to move funds out of Thailand.”</p>
<p>“The problem for Thailand,” explains Foley, “is that the majority of these measures were brought into law due to the 1997 crisis and although the BoT wants to change these and bring in new investors, it requires an act of parliament, which slows the process.”</p>
<p>Escaping the cash trap in Thailand is therefore a difficult job for any corporate operating in the country. There are, however, some simple steps that can be taken to assist. “Ensure open dialogue with your bank, legal/accountancy advisors and potentially the BoT and be transparent about your proposed operations,” advises Foley. “If you are a newcomer to the market, start these conversations very early and ensure that you create a structure which will allow you to release your money easily in the future.”</p>
<p>“Paying dividends more frequently is another way to alleviate some of the trapped cash issues in Thailand,” advises Shah. “Although this may not be something a company wishes to do regularly it is becoming an increasingly popular method of escaping the cash trap.”</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-treasury-in-thailand"">Corporate treasury in Thailand</h3>
<p>Large multinational companies that operate in Thailand generally employ a similar structure to those in other markets. They typically operate from a regional treasury centre which is based outside of Thailand, in countries such as Singapore or Hong Kong. “Thailand currently doesn’t offer the right incentives for corporate treasurers,” says Shah. The capital controls on cross-border inter-company lending and the limited liquidity in foreign currencies locally inhibit corporates to operate their regional treasury out of Thailand. I therefore don’t foresee Thailand becoming a big treasury centre for multinationals in the near future.”</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, local Thai companies base their treasury operations inside the country and manage operations from there. However large Thai companies are increasingly looking to move their treasury operations outside the country. “The capital controls and regulations in Thailand are driving this trend,” says Shah. “The move to an open market will allow companies to create and utilise a global cash concentration centre, which they would find challenging to do in Thailand.”</p>
<p>“This however isn’t for everybody,” he adds. “What is being discussed is how Thailand can become a viable cash concentration and treasury centre itself.” Thailand currently employs a withholding tax of 10% on dividends paid to non-residents and 15% on royalties and interest paid to non-residents which Shah believes is “one of the big deterrents to establishing a global cash centre in Thailand and is something which needs to be reviewed by local regulators.”</p>
<h3 id=""payment-methods-and-settlement-systems"">Payment methods and settlement systems</h3>
<p>Paper is still king when it comes to business-to-consumer and business-to-business payments in Thailand. Although electronic payments are becoming increasingly popular in the country, there are still challenges. For instance, “you have to give beneficiary advice separately – the clearing systems for GIRO or ACH have no facility for exchange of name or reference details,” says Foley. In other words, the infrastructure for paperless payments exists – it just hasn’t been properly turned on yet.</p>
<p>“It still takes two days to get value across electronically, bank-to-bank,” continues Foley. “Because of this, many companies have an account with the majority of banks in Thailand. Customers are therefore able to make payments into an account of the same bank and sweep the funds from there.”</p>
<h4 id=""bank-of-thailand-automated-high-value-transfer-network"">Bank of Thailand automated high value transfer network (BAHTNET)</h4>
<p>BAHTNET is Thailand’s real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) for transferring high value amounts. Established by the BoT in 1995 the system is designed to reduce cost and systematic risk. Operated using SWIFT or the BoT’s own web portal, BAHTNET allows both domestic and cross-border payments. By design, high levels of liquidity are needed to operate the system. “It is reasonably expensive to use,” advises Foley, “but it does work and is part of the core payment infrastructure.”</p>
<h4 id=""imaged-cheque-clearing-and-archiving-system"">Imaged cheque clearing and archiving system (ICAS)</h4>
<p>The Thai government has recently revamped the country’s cheque payment and clearing system. Replacing the legacy cheque clearing system ICAS is a centralised cheque clearing system implemented nationwide in 2013. The system was built to shorten the cheque clearing cycle to one day nationwide and to enhance the efficacy of the process overall and meet international standards. “This is a fantastic system,” says Foley, “however they have not yet changed the legacy environment of having 71 clearing zones. This means that for any payments issued outside of the same clearing zone there is a 0.1% charge on the face value of the cheque presented.”</p>
<h4 id=""bulk-payment-system"">Bulk payment system</h4>
<p>Operated by the national transaction management and exchange (NITMX), the bulk payment system allows for preauthorised inter-bank transactions that are large in volume and have a recurring payment period, such as wage payments. Membership of the NITMX is not restricted to local banks, allowing foreign banks, who are often preferred by large multinationals operating in Thailand, to gain a large share of the payments market, despite the restrictions they operate under.</p>
<h3 id=""payment-systems-roadmap-2012-2016"">Payment systems roadmap 2012-2016</h3>
<p>A payments systems roadmap for 2012-2016 was created by the BoT following an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the Thai payment systems alongside a comparative study of other countries’ systems to establish a framework for future development. Its vision is to ensure that Thailand provides payment mechanisms which facilitate efficient, stable and safe economic activities in both the public and private sphere domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Comprised of three key objectives, the roadmap seeks to enhance the efficiency of the Thai payment systems, firstly seeks through development and promotion of access to the electronic payment systems to ensure that these are prepared for the integration of the AEC. Secondly, the roadmap seeks to reduce the risk associated with foreign exchange settlements and when using BAHTNET. Finally there will be a focus on increased consumer protection and the overall building up of confidence in the payment systems.</p>
<p>In October 2013, as part of the roadmap, ISO20022, the most advanced financial messaging standard, was adopted allowing for faster payments and better cash visibility for corporates in Thailand. Last year also saw a cross-border payment versus payment (PvP) link between BAHTNET and Hong Kong’s US dollar real-time gross settlement system announced. Set to launch in 2014, the link will allow for reduced risk in foreign exchange transactions and promotes safer and more efficient payment flows. Furthermore, Thailand is also monitoring global trends and is preparing its payment system to handle the use of the renminbi for international trade in the future.</p>

Vietnam,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>A socialist state, the country’s government has been gradually moving away from a centrally-planned economy since 1986 in a programme known as Doi Moi. In January 2007, Vietnam joined the World Trade Organisation and was an official negotiating partner in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in 2010. Anyone who has visited Vietnam will understand that agriculture plays a significant role in its economy, however the share that agriculture has of the country’s economic output has been shrinking. In 2000 a quarter of the country’s output was agriculture-based, a share which fell to 22% in 2012. Industry is taking up the slack, increasing from 36% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 41% during the same period.</p>
<p>Overall, Vietnam’s GDP grew by 5% in 2012, which was the slowest rate of growth for the country since 1999. The country’s export-oriented economy was hard hit by the global recession but exports did bounce back in 2012, increasing by more than 18% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Speaking in Vietnam’s capital city, Hanoi, in March 2013, European Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, said the policy of Doi Moi had moved Vietnam from “rigidity and control to openness and flexibility – allowing room first for domestic private enterprise, then for foreign investors and gradually for a greater role of market forces in the economy”. The greater openness had led to an average growth rate of 6.5% between 2007 and 2011 and significant declines in poverty and the rise of Vietnam up the ranks of global economies, he added. For example, Vietnam now is second only to Singapore in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) in the ASEAN region, relative to GDP.</p>
<p>FDI in Vietnam has risen steadily during the past decade and in the past year has soared by 65.5%. Vietnam’s General Statistics Office (GSO) announced in October that FDI inflows had reached $19.2 billion, surpassing the government’s target of $13-$14 billion. The largest share of investment (from a total of 52 countries) came from Korean investors, who contributed $3.6 billion in the past year. Singapore with $2.7 billion was next, followed by China, Japan and Russia, which collectively contributed $4.4 billion. “As some businesses struggle to be economically viable in China – where costs have risen and the Renminbi has strengthened – they are turning to Vietnam,” says Andrew Dyer, Head of Transaction Banking Sales, Asia Pacific at ANZ Group. “Production in Vietnam is fairly low cost and there is a young workforce. In addition the logistics are good and the infrastructure and supply chain is superior to neighbouring countries.”</p>
<p>However, Dyer says money is not freely moveable across borders so there are no notional pooling or sweeping products. “It is similar to China about ten years ago; some contract manufacturers will operate very lean companies in Vietnam, keeping their invoicing and other treasury activities offshore,” he adds.</p>
<p>During the past year the pace of foreign-funded projects also increased, according to the GSO with more than 1,000 approvals for new ventures and a continued contribution of $6.2 billion to ongoing projects. Manufacturing and processing proposals received the greatest share of interest from foreign investors and represent 77% of contributed capital.</p>
<p>Two large infrastructure projects during 2013 attracted significant FDI inflow: a thermal power plant that attracted nearly $2 billion in total investment in a joint venture between the Government’s General Department of Energy and Singapore’s Sembcorp and a $1.2 billion integrated circuit project funded through FDI contributions from Korean company Samsung. The power plant is considered essential to ensuring a power supply to support Vietnam’s economic development.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, multinationals Nestlé and Starbucks hope to cash in on the Vietnamese coffee drinking tradition. Vietnam is the world’s second biggest producer of coffee beans behind Brazil, with more than 90% of production exported. At the start of 2013 US-based Starbucks opened its first outlet in the country. Nestlé has also targeted the coffee market in Vietnam, having invested in coffee factories in the country.</p>
<p>“Generally Vietnam is a challenging business environment, but many FDI firms are doing very well, a number of Vietnamese firms are doing well, although many Vietnamese state-owned enterprises and SMEs are facing real difficulties,” says Herbert Cochran, Executive Director of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City. “The business environment is pretty good for FDI firms, which account for about 40% of domestic industrial production and two-thirds of all non-oil exports from Vietnam. However, it seems to be quite difficult for SOEs and also for Vietnamese private companies, 66% of whom have reported losses in 2012 and 2013, according to news reports.”</p>
<p>Several US-based multinationals, particularly in the consumer goods arena, have taken the lead in investing in Vietnam, he adds, with such companies investing between $200m to $500m each. For many of these companies Vietnam is their fastest growing market globally. “Moreover, US foreign direct investment in higher value-added modern manufacturing is increasing, led by Intel’s investment of $1 billion in an assembly and test facility in Saigon Hi-Tech Park and scores of other smaller investments.” The American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam has a ‘manufacturing committee’ with about 20 companies involved in modern manufacturing. These companies are successful, and more are coming, says Cochran. One company that opened operations in Vietnam five years ago now employs almost 1,000 people, exports about $50m worth of goods per year and is looking for new land to expand because it expects to triple its business in the next three to five years.</p>
<p>Cochran says American Chamber of Commerce cooperation with and support of Vietnam’s government and business has led to a substantial increase in bilateral trade during the past ten years: from only $1.5 billion in 2001 when a bilateral trade agreement went into effect in December of that year to $9.7 billion in 2006 when Vietnam achieved WTO Accession and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with the US (December 2006). More than $28.7 billion worth of trade is projected in 2013. If present trends continue, bilateral trade could reach $50 billion by 2020, says Cochran.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Autumn Economic Forum of the United Nations Development Programme in September 2013, Bakhodir Burkhanov, the Programme’s Deputy Country Director for Vietnam, said the country had maintained macroeconomic stability during 2013. But he warned that the slow progress on structural reforms in the banking, public investment and state owned enterprise (SOE) sectors had been an impediment to economic growth. He added: “Investor confidence remains subdued, with growth of labour productivity slowing from 5% annually between 2000 and 2007 to 3.5% between 2008 and 2011. Vietnam has dropped ten places to 75<sup>th</sup> in the 2012-13 edition of the Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum, and slipped from 116 in 2010 to 123 in 2012 in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index. Poverty reduction and human development progress have also slowed down.” To tackle these problems he suggested a greater focus be placed on examining the social impact of reform options and on the institutional framework to support reform initiatives.</p>
<p>A study by AmCham into American companies’ perceptions of doing business in ASEAN countries found the main sources of dissatisfaction in doing business in Vietnam were caused by corruption (70%) and infrastructure (65%). On the plus side, 59% of companies appreciated the availability of low-cost labour and availability of trained personnel (43%) – <a href=""#table-1-current-local-business-environment"">see Table 1</a>.</p>
<p>Vietnam has been undertaking a restructure of SOEs and Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has said he plans to push the country’s SOEs into closer competition with the private sector. He hopes this will make them more competitive and the overall goal is to retain only a smaller number of key SOEs in certain industries.</p>
<p>Corruption also is being tackled and in November 2013 a former general director of the state-owned Agribank Financial Leasing Company was sentenced to death for his part in a $25m embezzlement of state property. Another man, a former chairman of a construction company, was also sentenced to death in the case.</p>
<p>Another factor in tackling corruption may come in the form of the TPP. Steven Winkelman, Chairman of the Vietnam Business Forum, told an audience in Vietnam in December 2013 that the TPP could help the government in its drive towards a market economy and reform of the SOE sector. The TPP is being negotiated between Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the US. Combined, these countries encompass 800 million people, around one-third of world trade, and nearly 40% of the global economy. Studies have shown that Vietnam has the most to gain of any country currently negotiating the agreement, with export and GDP growth potentially greater than for other partner countries. It is believed the partnership will enable the private sector greater access into key markets, will stimulate competition, will attract additional foreign investment and will help build key supply chain infrastructure, thus creating significant opportunities for Vietnamese businesses, and jobs and higher incomes for Vietnamese workers. TPP will help Vietnam’s strategic drive to industrialise, modernise and globalise.</p>

<p>“Only 20% of the population has bank accounts, so there are quite significant problems for companies around payroll and accounts payable and receivable.”</p>
<p><cite>Andrew Dyer, Head of Transaction Banking Sales, ANZ Group</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winkelman says foreign companies interested in investing in Vietnam “need to see more evidence of the Government’s willingness to reform the inefficient state-owned system, considered by many analysts as a root cause of Vietnam’s current economic challenges”. Corruption and conflict of interest issues are embedded in the fabric of the SOE sector, according to Winkelman. “Without addressing fundamental governance issues, progress will remain challenging. Investors wonder which over-extended state-owned conglomerate will be the next to fail, or which will be forced into taking bad assets onto their balance sheets. This misallocation of resources continues at a time when Vietnam needs to be making wiser decisions about capital outlays and business strategy.”</p>
<p>Vietnam’s economy also faces challenges because of an undercapitalised banking sector. Non-performing loans weigh heavily on banks and businesses. In September 2012, the official bad debt ratio climbed to 8.8%, although some independent analysts believe it could be higher than 15%.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese Government launched the Vietnamese Asset Management Company (VAMC) in July 2013 in a bid to address the troubled banking sector. US-based Fitch Ratings, however, has cast doubt on the ability of VAMC to perform its task. Fitch is concerned about the lack of capital at its disposal; at present it stands at $24m. The plan is to swap the banks’ debts for government bonds. Says Fitch: “We believe Vietnamese banks may still face capital-impairment risks even after offloading bad debt to the VAMC, based on preliminary data. This is because government-guaranteed bonds received in consideration for bad debt must be written off by a reported 20% each year, which effectively means that the bad bank only buys time for the banks to write off losses.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the Fitch report, the Financial Times said foreign investors were keen for decisive action from the government, not least because the banking sector’s problems have left the economy starved of new credit. “It is always possible that well-capitalised foreigners could come to the direct aid of the banks themselves but, as Fitch points out, there is limited appeal to the sector given a cap on foreign ownership of 30%,” said a report. “And any expansion of bank lending without an injection of fresh capital would only store up more trouble ahead.”</p>
<p>As elsewhere, Vietnam’s authorities have been reducing interest rates in a bid to stimulate economic growth. The cost and availability of financing, particularly for smaller companies and the relative impact of that on exports tends to put greater emphasis on efficient trade finance products. Access to US dollars, both onshore and offshore, is key and many different trade finance instruments are used to achieve this. Cash flow can be improved via pre- or post-shipment finance by utilising trade finance to fund the purchase or manufacture of goods, while awaiting payment from buyers. Many companies choose to finance the period between payments for the imported goods and the final sale of the goods. As more companies outsource elements of their production process to Vietnam there has been a growth in payables financing.</p>
<p>Another issue for multinationals to address when doing business in Vietnam is the largely cash-based economy, which, says ANZ’s Dyer presents challenges in terms of cash management. “Only 20% of the population has bank accounts, so there are quite significant problems for companies around payroll and accounts payable and receivable. There are also technology challenges regarding this because Vietnamese names are very long and the currency is also in high denominations (22,000 dong to $1). ERP systems have to be substantially modified to cope and there is significant manual input around the AP/AR processes,” he says.</p>
<p>The government is encouraging financial inclusion via a number of initiatives. For example, payments of more than 20 million dong ($1,000) have to be made through the banking system or a VAT receipt will not be issued. Modern payments systems are also being developed and a new cross-border system for inter-bank payments in dong is being rolled out. At the moment credit cards are not widely used outside of tourist hotels. However, there is a generational shift occurring, particularly as young people who have studied overseas return to the country and want to use internet and mobile banking services.</p>
<p>The main attraction for multinationals setting up in Vietnam is its potential, including low cost of labour, growing consumer market and its membership of ASEAN, which is a market with a combined GDP of $2.2 trillion. Despite the challenges, Vietnam represents an important opportunity for multinationals and the business environment is improving all the time.</p>

<h5 id=""marco-pearman-parish-ceo-corporation-china"">Marco Pearman-Parish, CEO, Corporation China:</h5>
<p>The Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) has been introduced by the Chinese government to allow companies to establish and operate their businesses in the same manner as they would in other regions such as Hong Kong or Singapore. Over the years, China has functioned as a production factory that enjoyed the ability to produce goods for a lower price than in many other regions of the world. However, in recent years an increase in the value of the renminbi against the dollar has seen Chinese goods reach near parity in price to those produced elsewhere. The Chinese population’s wealth is also increasing and thus creating a greater demand for imported goods. When these factors are coupled with the import and export restrictions placed on companies, the production factory that is China becomes a less appealing proposition than it once was. The SFTZ has therefore been established to offset these recent changes and is the testing ground for reform that will eventually spread across the whole of China. The goal of the zone is, ultimately, to make Shanghai the most important place in Asia and take the focus away from other regional economic hubs.</p>
<p>Opening a business in China has historically been a long and arduous process, with a number of different licences needing to be obtained before approval from the regulators is granted. The Chinese authorities have streamlined this process in the SFTZ allowing a business to be established in five working days rather than three months. This streamlined process offers corporates a greater incentive to begin operating in China due to the shorter time frame required when establishing a business and the cost-saving this will bring. In addition, a real address is not needed to register a company in the SFTZ. Instead a virtual address can be applied, removing the overheads associated with establishing a physical office based in China.</p>
<p>The SFTZ will also be open to companies that may traditionally have been unable to tap into the Chinese market, thanks to a relaxation of the registered capital laws employed throughout the rest of the country. In China, one will typically have to pay up to $150,000 into the company in registered capital before it can be established and penalties are distributed if this is not complied with. The new regulations introduced in the SFTZ have relaxed this rule and give a company 20 years before they have to invest their registered capital in the business. Furthermore, restrictions on what type of business can be opened in China and what actions can be performed have also been relaxed, thereby opening doors for new companies who previously would have been prevented from operating in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>A key benefit for corporates moving into the zone comes from the opportunity to freely convert the renminbi on the capital account. Historically, releasing money from the country is one of the primary challenges faced by corporates operating in China. The regulations employed in the SFTZ have relaxed the foreign exchange laws allowing a company to transfer up to $50,000 from China to accounts around the world without approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). There is no limit on how many transfers can be made, so in theory a few million US dollars could potentially be transferred on a daily basis. This is just the first step by the Chinese authorities and as the zone matures the limits will increase.</p>
<p>Tax incentives are also offered to corporates acting within the zone. A reduced tax rate of 16% will be applied to companies operating in the zone – reduced from the 20% rate that is issued across the rest of China. Furthermore, while import and export tax is currently the same rate as the rest of China, the Chinese authorities have pledged to eliminate this within the zone in the near future.</p>
<p>The regulations that are currently implemented in the SFTZ have already offered huge improvements for businesses wishing to operate in China. Although not all of the zone’s functions have been made clear yet, what the Chinese authorities have proposed will happen. They are determined to make it easier for businesses to operate in China and will not change the policy direction. The full implementation of the reforms promised for the zone may take some time because the authorities will want to make sure of each step before progression to the next. Despite this, companies have not been put off. Those businesses who have expressed an interest in establishing themselves in China are now beginning to see the benefits of Shanghai – it is where they want to be.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Liu Li-Gang"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/01/2014-01and02-tta-02-qa-liu-li-gang-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""liu-li-gang-greater-china-chief-economist-anz"">Liu Li-Gang, Greater China Chief Economist, ANZ:</h5>
<p>The Chinese government launched the SFTZ with a desire to effect change through experiments in the services sector. The SFTZ includes a liberalisation plan covering six service sectors or 18 sub-segments. Following the launch, the Shanghai government also issued a number of specific regulations concerning foreign investments allowed within the zone from 1<sup>st</sup> October 2013. The regulations include a ‘negative list’ that specifies 190 restricted business lines. It appears that more regulations or guidelines will continue to evolve in order to allow full operation of the zone.</p>
<p>Policy details covering financial, shipping, cultural and professional services have indicated that the SFTZ initiative aims to develop an open geographical zone that allows not only a freer flow of goods but also capital and human resources. In addition, Chinese policymakers have attached great importance to investors’ concerns and are looking forward to creating a business-friendly environment for international investment and trade. Aside from financial liberalisation, the FTZ will help China broaden and deepen reforms of the service industry ranging from shipping to healthcare sectors.</p>
<p>The zone is planned to honour the spirit of the free market, highlighting China’s key financial reform agenda from the recent Communist Party Council (CPC) 18<sup>th</sup> Third Plenary Session that has set the tone for China’s economic development for several years to come. In three years, the zone’s development has a target to reach a stage that is compatible to other market economies in the world. Additionally, the Chinese currency, the renminbi, will be convertible; interest rates will be market-determined; and other factor prices will be driven by market forces.</p>
<p>The opening of the service sector to foreign capital will also be hugely beneficial for corporates. With the ‘negative list’ approach, foreign investments in industries will face less administrative red tape, thus facilitating the services sector’s convergence with international standards. It will also allow China’s eventual participation in the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement.</p>
<p>The plan is a bold step to lift China’s economic reform to the next level. After the FTZ trial, successful experiences will be applied to the rest part of China. We believe the Shanghai FTZ will help boost China’s reform process, and return the economy to a more sustainable path.</p>

<h5 id=""jane-wang-china-tax-and-business-advisory-partner-pwc-and-bill-yuan-china-tax-and-business-advisory-director-pwc"">Jane Wang, China Tax and Business Advisory Partner, PwC and Bill Yuan, China Tax and Business Advisory Director, PwC:</h5>
<p>The establishment of the SFTZ has been recognised as a crucial economic reform initiated by China’s new leadership. The ‘pilot experiment’ in Shanghai will include reforms focused on four areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Financial reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrading of customs supervision framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplification of administrative systems supporting the further opening up of the services sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of a competitive regulatory and tax environment for businesses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The focus of the SFTZ financial reform is to promote renminbi (RMB) internationalisation. Foreign banks will be allowed to directly establish a branch, wholly-owned subsidiary or majority-controlled subsidiary with Chinese business partners in the region within a shorter time period. This new policy will reduce lengthy approval processes, significantly easing foreign entry. It is noteworthy that domestic private investors are also allowed to participate in the SFTZ in the form of financing services including setting up private banks, financial leasing and consumer financing (sole investment or joint investment with foreign capital).</p>
<p>For multinational companies operating in China that are not in the financial services industry, and who have their regional headquarters in the country, the relaxation of financial and foreign exchange policies could improve their regional treasury management capabilities. As a pilot initiative, RMB convertibility under capital accounts will also have an impact on domestic companies investing abroad. The SFTZ could encourage local enterprises to issue overseas bonds by creating conditions comparable to those present in overseas platforms commonly used by Chinese investors.</p>
<p>The SFTZ will implement a system in which overseas shipments entering the free trade area will not need customs clearance until a later stage. For logistics companies operating in the SFTZ, operational efficiency can be improved with simplified customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) procedures and port management.</p>
<p>In the SFTZ, foreign investors will enjoy similar treatment as their domestic counterparts. Foreign enterprises, except for the sectors specified in the ‘negative list’, are subject to a record filing system instead of the usual approval requirements. The simplified rules are expected to alleviate foreign investors’ administrative burden at the entry stage.</p>
<p>Key features of the tax policies and incentives are meant to support innovative business models in the SFTZ, rather than just provide generally reduced tax rates or universal incentives to all sectors which may not be adopted by other regions in China anytime soon.</p>
<p>Foreign investors should start assessing the impact of the SFTZ on their existing or potential business plans and operations in China. If the reform is implemented smoothly, foreign investors will be able to operate more efficiently throughout the SFTZ with the creation of treasury centres, shared service centres, regional headquarters and distribution hubs, as well as trading and investment platforms.</p>
<p>With more SFTZ-related policies to be released in coming months, we expect international investors in the SFTZ to make relevant changes to their future business models. Investors are also encouraged to start open dialogues with relevant stakeholders and Chinese government authorities to better understand the new policies and regulations. Both local enterprises and multinational corporations need to start developing a systematic strategy and step-by-step plan to take advantage of the policies implemented in the SFTZ.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the SFTZ should be seen as a testing model with policies that could be replicated in other regions in China. This pilot free trade area provides investors with an idea of the changes that could come about in terms of the investment administrative system, financial and foreign exchange control system, international trade model as well as the further opening up of service sectors across China and beyond Shanghai.</p>

<p>The announcement of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) is an attempt by the Chinese authorities to make Shanghai the economic centre of Asia, or even the world. Regulations surrounding the SFTZ are complicated but, going forward, they will open up most – if not all – of the activities currently restricted to companies operating in China.</p>
<p>While the SFTZ will be useful for companies serving the domestic market, the main benefits will arise for companies who deal mainly in exports. The loosening of regulations in areas such as foreign exchange will allow companies to move their regional headquarters or treasury centres to the FTZ and hedge risk as they would in Western markets. Trapped cash will be less of a problem in the SFTZ compared to mainland China as the relaxation of China’s foreign exchange controls within the zone will see corporates trade and deposit the renminbi in the same manner they would on the offshore renminbi market. Eventually it may be possible for companies in the zone to use the renminbi for all their trade and transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the relaxation of controls will permit companies greater cost-saving as operating and payment processes are simplified and streamlined in the zone. Overall, companies in the SFTZ will have more freedom and be able to behave in a more multinational way than ever before in China.</p>
<p>The zone will also make it easier for foreign companies looking to enter the Chinese market. The opening up of some restricted activities will allow companies to move away from the cumbersome joint venture situations that they have had to manage in the past.</p>
<p>Most CFOs in the West are convinced that the role of Regional Treasury Centres (RTCs) located in Hong Kong and Singapore will dwindle due to the reforms being led by the SFTZ. Although the initial edict remains fairly general and the full-range of benefits are yet to be announced, businesses clearly see a lot of promise in the zone.</p>

Escaping the cash trap,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>China is regarded as both the most important and most restrictive market in terms of liquidity management, but this is changing. A few years ago, the options for multinational companies (MNCs) in China wishing to repatriate excess liquidity were limited. Due to various restrictions on renminbi (RMB) conversion imposed by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), companies could either release their trapped cash through dividend, royalty or service payments – which all have withholding tax implications – or through entrustment loans.</p>
<p>But there has been much change since then. Regulatory reforms are easing the cross-border flow of funds and helping companies to strengthen their liquidity management across the whole business.</p>
<p>In line with its long-term objective of improving the convertibility of RMB, the PBoC has relaxed controls on cross-border RMB flows through the introduction of schemes for inter-company lending, in both RMB and foreign currencies, and cross-border netting. Companies are now taking full advantage of the new rules. In early September, Kunshan President Enterprises Food Company Limited successfully completed a two-way cross-border RMB lending transaction. A few days before, Coca-Cola Beverages in Shanghai announced it had made an RMB 250m ($40.85m) inter-company loan to a London-based subsidiary.</p>
<p>Incremental reforms are also taking place in other historically restrictive Asian markets. In Malaysia, for example, the capital account restrictions introduced in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis are now being lifted.</p>
<p>India, meanwhile, is now permitting companies to perform lending transactions to their overseas subsidiaries – providing, that is, the transactions do not exceed 400% of the company’s net worth.</p>
<p>The trend towards deregulation is an important development for corporates that are holding onto historically high levels of cash. Apple, for example, has built up over $100 billion in excess cash, albeit not all of it is sitting in Asia. Liquidity security is of primary concern for corporates following the financial crisis, which means that cash accumulation and deployment has become their biggest burden.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management-in-a-changing-region"">Cash management in a changing region</h3>
<p>Companies are increasingly taking a global approach to liquidity management and want not just visibility and control but, most importantly, access to their cash. They need to be able to consolidate their cash and get their hands on it quickly. The problem is keeping up with the rules in all the countries that a company operates in.</p>
<p>Understanding just how to navigate these rapidly changing regulatory environments is crucial for companies wishing to take advantage of the new opportunities springing up in China and elsewhere, according to Andrew Ong, Asia Head of Liquidity Management at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). Banks can help their clients navigate this complexity.</p>
<p>“For companies in Asia, a solid banking relationship characterised by local expertise, product innovation and global platforms is absolutely essential for unlocking trapped cash,” he says. “Corporations need to be confident that the organisations they bank with maintain strong relationships with local regulators, and are able to help them understand how and why policy is changing.”</p>
<p>Thomas Schickler, Global Head of Liquidity and Investment Products for HSBC’s Global Payments and Cash Management Business, agrees that a close banking relationship will be important to companies as the region continues to develop new rules. “We work very closely with our clients to help them to understand the direction of the regulations, plan for how this can impact the way they manage their liquidity and, where relevant, guide them through the process to seek the necessary regulatory approvals. At HSBC, we maintain relationships with regulators at all levels and participate in discussions with them about how the pilots should proceed, including the implications thereof for all of the concerned parties: regulators, banks and corporates.”</p>
<p>Due to the potential impact of Basel III on the availability of bank funding and the prospective higher cost thereof, corporates have heightened their focus on identifying diverse sources of liquidity. In a shift from legacy practices, in which liquidity was managed on a regional or single currency basis, treasurers are now focused on globalising their approach to liquidity management, says Schickler.</p>
<p>To that end, they are increasingly willing to trade off operational efficiency in order to be able to maximise the centralisation of their liquidity. “When treasurers look at the situation – particularly at the excess cash which is available to them in markets such as China, and even Indonesia and the Philippines – they will accept a more operational approach to tap the material excess liquidity that otherwise would have remained isolated.”</p>
<p>But there is a caveat to cross-border lending which treasurers need to be aware of, says Ong. Companies participating in the schemes are still subject to existing foreign debt quotas. This can be executed by establishing a new foreign currency international header account in a cross-border foreign currency sweep structure, thereby limiting all foreign currency movements between the international header account and the domestic foreign currency account to the specified State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) or PBoC quotas.</p>

<h3 id=""key-steps-to-unlocking-your-trapped-cash"">Key steps to unlocking your trapped cash</h3>
<p>Drawing on his 17 years of experience working in treasury and cash management in the Asia Pacific region, ANZ’s Global Head of Liquidity Management at ANZ Transaction Banking, Philippe Jaccard, shares with Treasury Today his top tips for managing trapped cash in the region’s tightly regulated markets.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not underestimate the importance of cash flow forecasting. “First, I think it is important to put in a process to determine the true excess,” says Jaccard. A treasurer must know the right amount of cash to keep in a country in a normal business environment and, something which is of increasing relevance in the current climate, the right amount to keep in a stress environment. “There has been a lot of talk lately in the industry that cash flow forecasting is inadequate, which I think is a true assessment,” he adds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the options for inter-company lending. Once the true excess has been determined, an investigation can begin into where that excess has come from. If there is a month-on-month accumulation because the company is unable to spend it locally, then inter-company lending might be considered, either through physical or notional pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use ‘leading and lagging’. If an MNC has a distributor in China which is consistently long in cash, then the transfer pricing in accordance with country tax regulations could be adjusted so the value China buys at is more appropriate – a process referred to as ‘leading’. ‘Lagging’ is the reverse. “A firm with a manufacturing entity that is chronically long could, instead of collecting payments immediately, give their group buyer longer payment terms so that, in effect, they use their excess to finance operations offshore,” he says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with your tax planner. If you’ve tried both cross-border inter-group lending, as well as leading and lagging, but you still have an excess of cash then you should begin looking at how you repatriate. “Once you get to this point, the problem is rarely an inability to do it – but rather the cost of doing it,” he says. In the US, for example, repatriation payments are subject to a tax rate of 35%. But this can be made more cost efficient by careful planning. One example would be to pool the equity investments of subsidiaries into a location where the profit and loss positions net each other off, thereby delivering the company a lower effective rate of tax.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id=""a-new-dawn-for-asia"">A new dawn for Asia?</h3>
<p>Despite the advent of limited cross-border lending in China, treasurers are not anticipating cash management within the region to be completely transformed overnight.</p>
<p>For example, in the 2012 Treasury Today Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study, almost a third of respondents stated that they do not see CNH/CNY actively being used for inter-company and third-party trade settlements. It will be interesting to see how much this changes in this year’s survey.</p>

<p>The ‘nirvana’ from a treasury perspective is to be able to pool cash in the same way as one can in Europe. “But that is almost impossible at the moment in Asia,” says Greenwich Associates’ Markus Ohlig. Although no one outside of the PBoC is entirely sure as to the exact timetable for the full internationalisation of the RMB, “the overall direction is now becoming clear. And looking back over the past year, the regulators have moved much quicker than a lot of people initially expected.”</p>
<p>Ong thinks that the pace of reform in China over the past year has been encouraging. “What was impossible just a few months ago is now a reality for some companies,” he says. Recent moves in Asia’s largest and most important economy might also signal the beginning of a wider shift towards currency liberalisation within the region.</p>
<p>The cross-border lending schemes that have been introduced by SAFE and the PBoC over the past year was an important step and one which Ohlig thinks will be followed by similar initiatives in the regions other emerging markets. “Over the past decade there has been a steady blurring of the boundaries between highly and lightly regulated markets. Although the changes in China in recent months have been more dramatic than those in other countries in Asia Pacific, they only serve to highlight the direction regulation is taking in the region.”</p>
<h3 id=""good-management-of-trapped-cash-requires-effort"">Good management of trapped cash requires effort</h3>
<p>The experts all agree that companies should also focus on what can be done with the cash if it can be centralised and controlled more effectively. With relatively low interest rates persisting globally, cash held can be a drag on the overall return on capital. Therefore, getting hold of cash only resolves part of the problem.</p>
<p>Some companies are looking to invest longer term in an attempt to get yield, whereas others may accept more risk. Is there value in consolidating cash back home or in-region? Reducing or freeing up sovereign exposure may be a driver for others.</p>
<p>The shrewdest companies plan ahead and think about all these issues at the outset before expanding into a new jurisdiction. The way an investment is structured and funded can help lessen the amounts of cash that gets trapped. The objectives and capabilities of the company, as well as the involvement of local partners together with advice from your bankers and tax consultants, will all be needed to make prudent decisions – 20/20 hindsight is not enough. However, any structure will only be partly effective and you will need to be able to manage any amount of cash that is trapped.</p>
<p>Coping with nuanced regulatory regimes takes effort and may involve delving deep into a treasury’s workflow. For example, in certain markets such as Indonesia and Thailand, the local currency is not transferrable on a cross-border basis. Thus if a company wants to lend on a cross-border basis, they need to convert the currency, usually into US dollars.</p>
<p>Due to foreign exchange (FX) cost considerations, companies will accumulate a ‘normal amount’ of at least $1m or more that is truly excess cash before making the conversion, in order to receive more favourable pricing. However, to do this efficiently, a company needs to establish the accuracy of its cash flow forecast in order to truly understand what cash is surplus.</p>
<h3 id=""looking-to-the-future"">Looking to the future</h3>
<p>Most observers agree there is a continuing trend to liberalisation. Countries are trying to protect but not inhibit growth and progress. Some bankers see the introduction of Basel III as providing an opportunity to harmonise approaches – Malaysia, for example, is one of the first adopters. Others are less certain and point out that investor flows out of the region are slowing government and central banks’ desire to continue along the path of deregulation.</p>
<p>Given the market stress recently affecting some Asian currencies – the Indian rupee in particular – might there not now be some hesitancy about following China’s path? “China has become a role model for other nations in the region. I think others will follow its lead, but each country has its own considerations and therefore its own agenda and schedule,” says ANZ’s Jaccard.</p>
<p>Companies are well advised to keep watching new developments closely, concentrate on their biggest amounts of surplus cash and stay abreast of what can be done now and in the future.</p>

Wrestling with Asian regulations,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The disparity across the various countries that make up the Asian continent can make keeping pace with the barrage of new regulatory measures a challenge. Whether an Asian firm or a western multinational company (MNC) operating in the region, the conflicting stages of regulatory adoption and various practices can cause great difficulty for treasurers when it comes to managing their cash effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>The Asia Pacific region is a large area with many countries, cultures and business practices and is difficult to assess as just one region, which is often underestimated by foreign finance professionals. According to Mikko Sopanen, Director of Global Finance and Treasury at Liteonmobile, “It cannot be seen as one and therefore it can be called fragmented. Due to the early economic development stage of most of the countries, the banking and those related activities can also be very different and heavily regulated.” Therefore, Sopanen explains, this confusion can extend to the banks, as many financial institutions must follow their home country practices and regulations, even when they operate in different countries.</p>
<p>“A Taiwanese bank’s trading desk in Singapore, for example, must follow Taiwanese regulations and practices in addition to the Singaporean regulations. So there can be double regulations to follow and those are also impacting the customer with regards to trading limits, transaction alternatives and forms,” he says.</p>
<p>There is then a domino effect in terms of regulatory adherence, leaving the corporate more tangled and constrained than ever. As the space is constantly evolving, this makes it even more difficult for those thinking of establishing or maintaining a hub in this region with its shifting goal posts and crisscross web of rules.</p>
<h3 id=""the-same-but-different"">The same, but different</h3>
<p>Alain Bridoux, International Business Consultant and former CFO at Asian-based firm, Sandvik, believes that the countries of Australia and New Zealand “belong pretty much to the global treasury systems and thinking modes of western MNCs. Yet China and India are two huge and different markets with specific issues. Then there are Singapore and Hong Kong, which play somewhat similar roles for treasury matters with regional treasury centres,” he says.</p>
<p>In one respect, operations in Asia are similar to those applied by firms elsewhere in the globe; cash management projects for corporates based there, like their Western counterparts, are primarily focused on seeking incremental efficiencies through streamlining and optimising their existing processes. However, while adhering to the onslaught of constant regulation, there is also another irritation for the corporate, regardless of the location, Asia is unique in the fact that its ‘ghettoisation’ adds yet another layer of complexity to this regulatory compliance.</p>
<h3 id=""the-right-solution"">The right solution</h3>
<p>Due to currency restrictions and the lack of a single currency for business flows, liquidity management options in Asia remain limited to domestic, in-country structures. Some exceptions to this include US dollar cash concentration structures across some of the more liberal jurisdictions, and, relatively recently, the participation of some Asian currencies in global cross-currency notional pool (CCNP) structures.</p>
<p>Globally, there is growing interest in CCNP solutions amongst companies with substantial liquidity in some parts of the world and the need to borrow in some others. The value of such solutions is impaired in Asia because some of the most relevant currencies, including the Indian rupee (INR) and the Chinese renminbi (RMB), are ineligible to participate in such structures due to regulatory restrictions. Bridoux highlights that the regulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives foreign exchange (FX) controls have been an essential difficulty for China and India thus far. This could present too great an obstacle for some.</p>
<p>“For risk management reasons, decentralisation of derivatives use is not advisable for China or India, but centralisation proves difficult. In my experience, this explains why many MNCs are still leaving China and India aside and do not seek full optimisation,” he opines.</p>
<p>Sopanen, on the other hand, disagrees, stating that an MNC’s treasury and dealing team can locate anywhere and conduct operations across the Asia Pacific region with some minimal local administrative support, allowing them the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>“The OTC trading without the direct cash flow connection is centralised so it is easy to manage with good counterparties and efficient tax optimising. Therefore, it is pretty easy to change the trading location for an MNC to the most efficient place to avoid, for example, the increasing regulation.”</p>
<p>Yet he concedes that “the Asian economy and business landscape are developing and changing rapidly, the governments and regulators have a huge challenge to cope with and to follow this development”.</p>
<p>“For this reason, it can to some extent be a juggling act to manage and control the economic development along with the increasingly regulated areas of banking, FX transactions and financing.”</p>
<h3 id=""relaxing-the-rules"">Relaxing the rules</h3>
<p>Paradoxically, as the landscape is changing at such an incredible rate, some of these developments can actually have a positive impact for western MNCs operating in the region, and for the global economy at large.</p>

<h3 id=""the-culture-gap"">The culture gap</h3>
<p>Interestingly, Bridoux believes that there is a cultural aspect to the regulatory phenomenon across the Asia Pacific region, and that this adds to the challenge of carrying out efficient operations there.</p>
<p>“In my opinion, few Scandinavian companies have been very successful in China. The regulatory aspect is in itself also a culture issue. In both China and Singapore there are now new regulations that make it more difficult for Westerners to operate in the country. Singapore has imposed new restrictions on the qualifications and degrees that are necessary in order to be eligible to be appointed CFO of companies. Residence permits have also become subject to new restrictions regarding salary and the impossibility of sourcing a local recruit with the same experience.”</p>
<p>In China, the application for the Z permanent visa has become more restrictive. There are also indications that the previous policy of rarely indicting Western executives for corruption or breaches of regulations is over. Several Western executives have recently been personally sued with the verdict awaited with some anguish from the expat community. Some state agencies (SAIC) can also decide unilaterally to ban some individuals from exercising certain corporate functions. Practically speaking, this can mean that the person has no other option than to resign and return to their home country if permitted to leave China.</p>

<p>The establishment of free trade zones have been very successful for China, for example, although the long-term benefits remain to be seen. Other countries are now experimenting in the same way, according to Bridoux. “The Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ), inaugurated in September seems to eliminate the concept of restricted or forbidden activities which led MNCs to joint ventures which frequently proved to be highly disappointing. The Shanghai FTZ could potentially wipe out the benefits of having regional treasury centres (RTCs) located in Singapore and Hong Kong. Obviously, the relocation to Shanghai of regional staff might prove lengthy or inconvenient but the profits derived by banks from trading offshore yuan (CNH) might come to an end if the zone proves successful,” he continues.</p>
<p>The optimism for a more relaxed business landscape is growing. In August, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce released a policy that aims to take measures to improve cross-border, e-commerce retail and export. The new policy took effect on 1<sup>st</sup> October and strives to promote growth in cross-border e-commerce, which is a long overdue development, as e-commerce in the nation has far outgrown existing domestic regulations. Cities including Shanghai, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Zhengzhou were amongst the first to implement the new policy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the same month, the Chinese central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government signed a new supplement to an economic accord to boost trade and economic co-operation and exchanges (CEPA). A US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) survey earlier this year demonstrated that the combined fund management business in Hong Kong rebounded significantly to a record high of HKD12,587 billion (about $1,622 billion) as of the end of 2012, representing year-on-year growth of 39.3%.</p>
<p>Sopanen also welcomes the apparent relaxation of ‘red tape’ rules in the region, as India is reportedly set to discard its global image of being inflexible in cross-border tax negotiations. This is a result of the announcement that New Delhi is to sign bilateral deals with the tax authorities in the US, the UK and Japan. The Indian government intends to accept corporate disclosures of profitability and tax liability of 29 MNCs without dispute for five years, so long as these are computed on the basis of mutually agreed principles.</p>
<p>“In some cases there are reduced documentation requirements related to cash management and payments, especially in India. There are also less tax related issues and regulations, when certain operations in the FTZs are also free of tax,” says Sopanen.</p>
<p>The upgrades in the free trade agreement are, perhaps most importantly, being given the stamp of approval from authorities in the region. Singapore’s Foreign Minister K. Shanmugam declared at the end of August that all ten members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) were supportive of enhancing the free trade agreement between China and the ten-nation bloc. With China one of ASEAN’s strongest strategic partners, Shanmugam said at the time: “I think as we prosper, as we increase our trading relationship, as we increase our connectivity, we can go much higher ... for the benefit of China and ASEAN, and an enhanced free-trade agreement will help us to achieve that.”</p>
<h3 id=""technology-aids"">Technology aids</h3>
<p>Asia is renowned for being quick to adopt innovative banking technology. For example, Asia is leading the world market in the adoption of mobile payment authorisation, internet-based banking and cashless delivery in the retailing industry. The way in which the region embraces technology with such vigour can be quite helpful when it comes to handling the strict regulatory environment, says Bridoux. “Cloud computing and new treasury global systems have definitely been useful to circumvent some regulatory obstacles.”</p>
<p>Sopanen agrees that streamlined infrastructure can assist in conquering some of the challenges in operating a treasury system in Asia. “When it comes to fulfilling all of the regulatory reporting requirements, automatic reporting systems are an enormous help in keeping to reporting schedules and decreasing the workload. Furthermore, the reports are now more accurate and less auditing and checking is required.</p>
<p>“Many banks also have e-platforms for documents and confirmation signing, which helps a lot, particularly when the signatory persons are all around Asia and travelling around the world. They can now sign and confirm online, independent of the location,” he continues.</p>
<p>Despite the technological advancements, however, Sopanen is surprised to see that many large MNCs are still relying upon Excel spreadsheets for treasury management. He also highlights some concerns about the availability of notional cash pooling for some of the banks’ ‘best clients’. “This does not benefit their local units and there is a lot of internal resistance,” he says.</p>
<p>“It is also true that, from a local standpoint, these offers break some FX rules and that bank executives can become personally liable if the breach is proven.”</p>
<h3 id=""has-interest-waned"">Has interest waned?</h3>
<p>Despite such restrictions around liquidity and inter-company transactions, many corporate treasurers have been able to extract efficiency from Asia through regional strategies, by focusing on operational and process benefits as opposed to liquidity benefits alone. For example, implementing a regional solution for payments and collections, aligned with their shared service center (SSC) and RTC strategies, usually results in significant reductions in operational costs, improved efficiencies, standardisation of practices and better controls.</p>
<p>As a result, according to Bridoux, the number of Western hubs across the Asia Pacific region continues to increase. However, some reticence remains as, “their localisation is subject to a lot of internal politics and self-interest attitudes. Very few Western executives feel like relocating to China and try to prove that the Asia Pacific region should be managed from Singapore or Hong Kong.”</p>
<p>Regional hubs far away from the main business units are very often not creating any value and just act as a conduit to the ultimate parent company so a new trend is emerging, with global SSCs opening in China, says Bridoux.</p>
<p>“This would obviously be a major change in the way MNCs operate. Political reasons probably exclude that critical data and services can be totally dependent upon a country where the intervention of the state could paralyse all operations.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is certainly an interesting concept. Sopanen feels that the regulatory battlefield across Asia doesn’t appear as complex in recent times as the environment on the western side of the world has almost become as complex, in fact in some ways worse.</p>
<p>“Europe and the US are starting to heavily increase their regulation and reporting requirements as Asia has done already in the past. There are also discussions around the transaction taxation in Europe. These trends are actually making it easier for companies to decide to locate in Asia and to deal with the Asian requirements, especially when most business growth for many industries is also on the Asian market,” he points out.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be straightforward for those doing business in the region to meet all these new requirements, particularly considering that many of the economies and financial markets in the region are still developing. As regulations consume corporates at a global level, many feel the APAC challenges are nowhere near as challenging and off-putting as they can first appear.</p>

India: looking on the bright side,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>On 28<sup>th</sup> August, the Indian rupee experienced its biggest single-day fall in more than two decades, plunging by almost 4% to reach a record low of 68.8 against the US dollar. Since US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke first hinted at tapering off quantitative easing (QE) back in May, the rupee fell 16% against the US dollar. Paul Mackel, Head of Asian Currency Research at HSBC, stated that caution towards emerging market assets and India’s long-running structural problems meant the rupee was one of the first in emerging Asia to face aggressive selling pressure.</p>
<p>During the summer when the rupee was at its lowest levels, markets began to question whether India could fund its high current account deficit. “Pressure on the rupee was brought about by the current account deficit, which is structurally driven largely by oil and gold imports, and the fact that India’s export sector remains relatively limited and uncompetitive,” explains Anjalika Bardalai, Senior Analyst, Asia, Eurasia Group.</p>
<p>India has witnessed the most rapid increase in its external liabilities relative to assets in Asia, Mackel wrote in a September report on the rupee. Current account and fiscal balances have been in negative territory since 2008, the report states, and in this respect, India stands out even among its peers.</p>
<p>In its October 2013 ‘Fiscal Monitor’ the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that fiscal consolidation in India had become more challenging in light of the rupee’s devaluation and higher global oil prices. It predicts the fiscal deficit will increase to 8.5% of GDP in the 2013 to 2014 financial year. At October’s IMF meetings in Washington, Indian Finance Minister Shri Chidambaram stated that the government was committed to the path of fiscal consolidation and aimed to bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% by 2016 to 2017.</p>
<h3 id=""structural-reforms"">Structural reforms</h3>
<p>When it comes to India’s current account deficit, Siddharta Sanyal, Chief Indian Economist, Barclays, says the government has applied pressure to contain imports and has placed restrictions on importing gold. “A depreciated rupee will also help the margins,” he says. In a mid-October research note, Leif Eskesen, Chief Economist for India and ASEAN, HSBC, stated that recent trade numbers suggest the Indian government will reach its 2014 current account deficit target of $70 billion, with a chance that the deficit could narrow even further. But he added that the government and India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), needed to stick to tight macroeconomic policies and step up implementation of structural reforms to bring about a sustained improvement in the current account position.</p>
<p>Since late August the rupee has appreciated and remained steady in the low 60s. The RBI is expected to further rollback currency stabilisation measures introduced in the summer. But in order to manage expectations, Eskesen stated that the central bank needed to signal its willingness to reintroduce measures should currency risks return. After all, tapering off of QE has merely been postponed. The bank also needs to demonstrate its seriousness in anchoring inflation expectations, says Eskesen. In this respect, HSBC expects an increase (of at least 25bps) in the repo rate this year.</p>
<p>Within days of assuming his new role as governor of the RBI in September, Raghuram Rajan, a former Chief Economist at the IMF, surprised investors by raising the central bank’s key policy rate to 7.5%. His actions left no doubt that Rajan is focused on reining in inflation, which remains stubbornly high. Data published by the Indian Central Statistics Office (ICSO) indicated that the provisional annual inflation rate based on all India general CPI for August 2013 was 9.5% compared to 9.6% for the previous month. “High inflation is a long standing problem in India,” says Bardalai of Eurasia Group.</p>
<h3 id=""turning-a-corner"">Turning a corner</h3>
<p>For now interventions by the RBI appear to have stemmed the rupee’s decline. Has India’s economy turned a corner? “In terms of the last six months when there was a perception of crisis, I feel a little bit more comfortable,” says Sanyal of Barclays. “I wouldn’t say that everything is absolutely fine, but from the extreme pessimism that we saw on the currency front, that risk perception has stabilised.”</p>
<p>In October, a better current account trend and news of potential portfolio inflows supporting the rupee saw HSBC lower its US dollar/rupee forecast from 65 to 62 for year end, and from 70 to 66 for the end of 2014. But Bardalai of Eurasia Group says the rupee is likely to remain volatile. “The currency is still down 10% to 15% relative to April,” she says, “when it was trading around 54 or possibly stronger.”</p>
<p>Economic growth also remains sluggish. In September Barclays revised its GDP growth for the 2013/2014 fiscal year down to 4.7%. Citing reasons for its decision, Sanyal says interest rates are still high and the government is constrained on the deficit side in terms of its ability to boost growth in the near term. Industrial growth is also low, which according to S. Gopalakrishnan (Kris), Co-founder and Executive Vice Chairman of Indian IT services company Infosys, and President of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), contributed to the slowdown in GDP growth in the past two years.</p>
<p>“Industrial activity is very low,” says Kris, “and some months it has been negative, which is a cause for concern as one of the factors for creating jobs is industrial growth.” According to data published by the RBI, the sales growth (year-on-year) of more than 2,900 non-government non-financial (NGNF) companies decelerated sharply to 9.1% during 2012-2013 from 18.5% in 2011-2012. “This is the lowest annual growth in the past ten years,” the RBI stated.</p>
<p>Kris says India needs to create ten million new jobs each year in order to keep pace with the number of people joining the workforce. But when compared with markets like China, India’s manufacturing sector is still relatively weak. “The services sector contributes more to the economy than industry,” explains Bardalai of Eurasia Group. Manufacturing generates just 16% of India’s GDP compared to the services sector, which is 55%. “What holds it back is restrictive labour laws,” says Bardalai. “Land acquisition is also very costly.”</p>
<h3 id=""financial-inclusion"">Financial inclusion</h3>
<p>The Indian government’s National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) proposes to increase manufacturing’s share of GDP to 25% over the next decade by creating the policy framework and financial instruments to encourage public/private partnerships (PPP) for infrastructure development. Kris of Infosys says India has a fairly robust banking sector and that most companies are able to access financing, but at the moment, he says bank capital is expensive. “That is one of the reasons why the investment ratio to GDP has come down”.</p>
<p>Accessing capital is a real problem for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), according to Bardalai. “Given the fiscal deficit, government borrowing is domestically funded, and all of that government borrowing crowds out the private sector.” In a speech given to a factoring conference in New Delhi recently, RBI Deputy Governor, Dr. K. Chakrabarty urged more banks to launch factoring services particularly for India’s micro-enterprises.</p>
<p>“Delays in settlement of dues adversely affect the recycling of funds and business operations of SME units. It is therefore, critical to ensure that the small entities are able to raise liquidity against their receivables,” he stated.</p>
<p>Anjali Mohanty, Managing Director and Head of Global Transaction Banking (GTB), India, Deutsche Bank, says she is seeing huge demand right now in India for payables financing – otherwise known as reverse factoring. “Borrowing costs have gone up by 200 bps to 300 bps, which is impacting SMEs,” she says. “Given the local liquidity and risk environment, it can be challenging for SMEs to meet their working capital needs from their existing bank relationships.” Although Deutsche Bank does not bank SMEs in India, it does bank large multinationals that do business with them and can leverage the credit rating of these buyers to provide cheaper financing to SMEs in the supply chain.</p>
<h3 id=""growing-in-sophistication"">Growing in sophistication</h3>
<p>Nirmal Khaderia, Asia Pacific Head of Corporate Treasury Sales and Head of Global Transaction Services (GTS) India, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), says the majority of companies they work with in India are increasingly focused on working capital management. He talks about “a new breed of Indian companies” that are more global in their outlook backed by large overseas acquisitions and international expansion via the organic route.</p>
<p>“Going global means managing liquidity and working capital at a global level, working with multiple clearing systems, multiple currencies, multiple platforms and ever changing regulations. This is a big challenge for them and is when they start looking at consolidation and centralisation, risk management practices, and learning from the experience of other corporates. They talk to global banks like us who have the experience of working with multinationals and learn from our vast experience in treasury management, bringing efficiencies in working capital management and leveraging the concept of shared service centres (SSCs).”</p>
<p>Indian companies’ hedging practices have also grown in sophistication, says Khaderia. “In the past, importers did not do much beyond hedging US dollar payment exposures due in the next 90-120 days.</p>
<p>However, a large number of exporters with long-term contracts actively hedged for periods of 12-24 months to take advantage of the premium. But as the currency market has become more volatile, companies are putting together more robust currency hedging policies.” In India companies are only allowed to hedge genuine exposures and interest rate options are not permitted.</p>
<p>Regulations and currency restrictions also makes liquidity management challenging for multinationals with Indian subsidiaries. As the rupee is not fully convertible, Navin Gupta, Head of Cash Management India, HSBC, says cash concentration and notional pooling is not permitted on a cross-border basis. Domestically, cash concentration is possible. Gupta says some companies in India are interested in cash concentration for multi-entity structures. In this respect HSBC is able to provide bespoke solutions, he explains, that are integrated with a company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and are more likely to win the support of the company’s respective stakeholders. “Only a few banks have the capability to provide this element,” says Gupta.</p>
<p>As Indian corporates become more global, Khaderia says they are increasingly getting into strategic treasury management relationships with global banks not only for their global business but also for their treasury needs in India (a space traditionally dominated by the local banks). “Some of the local banks have developed sophisticated processes around collections and payments backed by strong core banking systems implemented in the last two decades. However, global banks still carry the edge when it comes to customisation and the ability to integrate with the client’s ERP systems, backed by our global technology platforms and information reporting systems.”</p>
<p>Barclays’ experience of the Indian market is perhaps somewhat different to that of most foreign banks. Up until two years ago it maintained a retail banking presence in India; but in 2011 it closed its retail business so it could focus on corporate and investment banking. Barclays says it can now offer financial institutions and corporates much wider product coverage across capital markets, debt, risk management and FX, as well as trade finance, working capital and cash management.</p>
<p>“In India each bank has a particular strategy and particular client segment that it wants to pursue,” explains Ashwini Kapila, Managing Director and Head of Financial Institutions Group, Barclays India. “We defined our client segment in terms of where we believe we can add more value. It is about servicing global relationships coming into India, and large Indian companies looking to expand into other geographies such as Africa, the UK or Europe.”</p>
<p>The move from cash and cheques to electronic payments in India (see table overleaf) is also levelling the playing field between domestic and foreign banks. In an increasingly electronic world, moving money around India no longer requires banks to maintain an extensive branch network. “Most foreign banks in India have a limited branch network,” says Gupta of HSBC. “But in an electronic world you can address every corner of India.”</p>
<p>Mohanty of Deutsche Bank says between 65% to 67% of transactions in India are still physical payments, but 70% of the value of transactions is moved electronically. One of the major challenges India faces is ensuring that financial services are accessible even in the remotest parts of the country where large swathes of the population are unbanked.</p>
<p>India’s central bank hopes to raise the level of banking penetration by issuing new banking licenses. According to RBI’s Chakrabarty, rural India only had seven bank branches per one million adults in 2011, compared with the developed world and other BRIC economies, which had more than 40 branches.</p>
<p>In order to support annual economic growth of 8%, as envisaged by India’s 12<sup>th</sup> Five Year Plan, Chakrabarty says the banking business needs to expand significantly to an estimated INR288 trillion ($4.7 trillion) by 2020 from approximately INR115 trillion in 2012.</p>
<p>“We expect significant growth of the financial services industry in India over the next few years in terms of diversity of products,” says Kris of Infosys. “Mobile transactions and e-commerce is a huge opportunity; 150 million people have access to the internet, 800 million people have mobile access.”</p>
<p>Despite India’s economic and structural challenges, Kris is encouraged by the country’s significant opportunities for growth particularly when it comes to trade between India and other emerging markets. In its ‘Global Trade Forecast’ published in October, HSBC predicts by 2030 India will be the UAE’s top export destination accounting for 14% of exports. And as developing economies boost spending on large infrastructure projects, India is tipped to be one of the fastest-growing infrastructure import markets over the medium term.</p>
<p>Kris says India has demographics in its favour. “We have a young working population and are one of the few economies primarily driven by domestic consumption. If we can stimulate domestic activity, we will see growth in GDP.” Private consumption is approximately 60% of India’s nominal GDP, says Bardalai of Eurasia Group. “That is what has attracted a lot of foreign investors who are enticed not only by the size of the domestic market, but also by increasing private consumption driven by rising incomes and the mythical ‘rise of the middle class’.”</p>
<p>The Indian government set up a Cabinet Committee on Investment which, according to Bardalai, is supposed to fast-track big-ticket infrastructure investments. “But getting approvals through and starting the investment cycle are two different things,” she says. And with elections scheduled for next year, Bardalai does not anticipate any major economic reforms kick-starting the investment cycle until at least after the election. One major risk to India’s growth story could be further political fragmentation as a result of the forthcoming elections.</p>

<p>“People are waiting to see how the election pans out,” says Sanyal of Barclays. “In the past 20 years, India has had a fragmented political mandate but it has learned to live with no party having an outright majority. If some of the major political parties can form a government that should be okay in terms of the outlook for the economy.” But if the election returns another coalition government that is as fragmented as the current one or even more fragmented, that could lead to continued policy paralysis, says Bardalai.</p>
<h3 id=""evolution-of-payment-systems-in-india-the-journey-from-paper-to-electronic"">Evolution of payment systems in India: the journey from paper to electronic</h3>
<p>In the last eight to ten years, India’s payments infrastructure has undergone somewhat of a revolution or evolution – call it what you will. From a system that was completely paper-driven comprising mostly cash and cheques, India now boasts an electronic payments (e-payments) infrastructure, which is on a par with more developed markets. Although paper still dominates in terms of overall volumes, in terms of value, more payments in India are now made electronically.</p>
<p>India’s journey from paper to electronic started with the introduction of a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) payment system by the RBI in 2004. “Since then we have had several waves of mini-revolutions on the clearing side,” says Rakesh Garg, Managing Director and Head of Global Finance, Barclays India. “From a payments infrastructure perspective, India wants to be world class and is fast moving toward that goal.”</p>
<p>After RTGS came the low value National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system, which facilitates electronic funds transfers for individuals and companies between NEFT-enabled bank branches across India. More than 100 banks participate in NEFT and transfers can be made to more than 63,000 bank branches across the country.</p>
<p>The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which is charged with developing the country’s retail clearing systems, launched an Immediate Payments Service (IMPS) in 2010, which provides instant fund transfers between bank accounts using mobile phones. IMPS operates 24/7. Mobile banking is seen as a way of extending financial inclusion, particularly to remote parts of India; however, Garg says it is up to banks to develop mobile applications off the back of IMPS.</p>
<p>As e-commerce grows in India, the RBI hopes to increase the velocity of money via e-payments. “The focus for the next phase of development in Indian payment infrastructure is providing a thrust to modern e-payments that are safe, simple and low-cost for use by all,” writes HSBC and Boston Consulting Group in a report entitled ‘Emerging Payments Infrastructure Enabling Efficient Growth in India’. “The changes planned will thus bring to corporate India the benefits of increased efficiency, wider reach and standardisation.” The HSBC and BCG report highlighted current happenings in India’s payment infrastructure including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The RBI’s effort to drive usage of electronic channels – measures under consideration include taking electronic mandates in lieu of post-dated cheques, reducing time validity of cheques and levying charges on cheque issuance and use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rollout of image-based clearing using the Cheque Truncation System (CTS) across India in 2013, which will reduce clearing time and risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new electronic system for repetitive, bulk payments – National Automated Clearing House (NACH) – covering all computerised branches in India and offering faster settlement, will be rolled out across banks in 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial inclusion and access to unbanked population to be supported through measures such as interoperability via banking business correspondents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction of the Aadhaar number (ID card) to enable banking of people who are so far outside the realm of formal banking and facilitation of government initiatives, such as direct cash transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced controls on existing and new systems to reduce fraud, as well as a shift from proprietary formats to standard and internationally acceptable formats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The RBI recently announced the launch of a new RTGS system that supports the ISO 20022 XML messaging standard. India’s work is far from done though; BofAML’s Khaderia says at present, the clearing infrastructure supports push-based settlements and clients need to rely upon distributors/remitters pushing money to them. “A game-changing initiative on the electronic payment is NACH debit facility which enables clients to use pull mechanism for receivables. It is envisaged that the NACH debit facility will gradually eliminate a large number of cheques in the years to come.”</p>

India’s summer of discontent,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Indian corporates had to adjust to a new reality over the course of the summer. For the best part of a decade, the Indian rupee remained remarkably stable, hovering for the most part at 45 to the US dollar. But that changed dramatically in April this year when the Federal Reserve announced plans to begin tapering its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The announcement from Chairman Ben Bernanke triggered a slide in which the currency fell 17% against the US dollar (<a href=""#chart-1"">see Chart 1</a>).</p>
<figure class=""center"">

</figure>
<p>For India’s corporates, the timing of the rupee’s slide couldn’t have been worse. In the past three years, there has been a significant increase in the dollarisation of debt on the balance sheets of Indian companies, as many looked to take advantage of low interest rates in global bond markets.</p>
<p>At the last measure, the country’s corporate sector now has a total of $48 billion in outstanding US dollar debt. As a consequence, Indian corporates are more vulnerable to currency shocks than at any time in recent history, says Deep Mukherjee, Director, Corporate Ratings at India Ratings and Research, a subsidiary of Fitch. In August, the group’s research revealed that the credit ratings of 65 of its 290 investment-grade issuers may come under pressure should the currency remain weaker than INR60/USD – although these specific corporates, contributing to 16% of the investment-grade debt, are unlikely to default in a stressful scenario such as this. If the rupee was to move beyond 65 for a sustained period, an additional 17 corporates would come under ratings pressure.</p>
<p>In this environment, full hedging of exposures becomes imperative. However, the task is complicated by volatility. Three-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose 649 basis points in August to 19.1%, making it the highest among the 48 global currencies tracked by Bloomberg. “In this environment, hedging becomes a nightmare,” says Mukherjee. “Our corporate clients want a stable rupee at any rate and this historical high in volatility is making it very difficult for them.”</p>
<h3 id=""making-the-right-call"">Making the right call</h3>
<p>Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T), a technology, engineering, construction and manufacturing company based in Mumbai, was taken by surprise when the rupee began to slide earlier in the year. In the company’s risk management policy, treasury is mandated to leave a certain amount of foreign exchange (FX) exposures open, leaving the team with the flexibility to hedge them depending upon how they see market conditions.</p>
<p>In April, prior to Bernanke’s indication that the Fed would soon begin to taper bond purchases, the company was relatively bullish on the currency. However, its balance sheet suffered a hit on the unhedged part when nervous investors began to pull their money out of emerging markets. Since then, the company has become much more bearish, making a conscious call to hedge 100% of its exposures, and has made all the correct judgements as the currency continued to slide further against the US dollar.</p>
<p>“Between 50 and 60 we didn’t quite catch it right,” concedes Harish Barai, Deputy General Manager of Treasury at L&amp;T. “We thought the rupee was stretching a little bit and that it should bounce back. But we were caught out because the assessment on the current account and inflation was wrong.”</p>
<p>The volatility has complicated matters. In India, corporates can’t fully cancel or de-book on derivatives contracts; therefore, with the rupee moving up and down within a large range on a daily basis, making the right call becomes quite a challenge. “Things change so fast and there is so much commentary and data coming in all the time that it becomes very difficult,” says Vijay Kuppa, Treasury Manager, L&amp;T.</p>
<h3 id=""hedging-instruments"">Hedging instruments</h3>
<p>Options might represent a useful means for corporates to hedge their FX risks in this volatile environment. The decision to use such instruments, however, depends on a number of factors including the size and sophistication of the treasury, the hedging budget, and how confident the risk management team feel about the direction of the market. According to Citibank, which has a market share of 25% of corporate FX transactions in India, the hedging of FX exposures has become a very active topic of discussion for its Indian corporate clients in recent months – a debate which is not just around liabilities on the balance sheet, but export earnings too.</p>
<p>While forwards are relatively simple and inexpensive, Citi India says that more corporates are now looking at other instruments, including options and range forwards. “I think most corporates are pretty savvy and are looking at all the different solutions,” says Rahul Shukla, Head of Corporate Bank at Citibank India. “Of course, you have to pay a premium with options, but you can also sell at a level in which you can collect a premium. If two months ago you were selling your exports forward, during the period the rupee was sliding downwards, you may well have thought it would be selling at 75 now – so you would be losing out. Therefore, you have to evaluate each alternative at a given point in time.”</p>
<h3 id=""calm-after-the-storm"">Calm after the storm?</h3>
<p>L&amp;T’s treasury team say they have decided to stick mainly with conventional forwards for the time being. Although using such instruments can be more challenging in a volatile market, Barai and Kuppa believe their team have much more clarity now over the direction in which the market is heading, and therefore see no need to enter into pricey options contracts.</p>
<p>Kuppa is convinced that, thanks to recent interventions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the worst of the volatility is over for the rupee. “In recent weeks we have seen the currencies of most emerging markets appreciating, but the rupee is staying where it is because of intervention. As long as the central bank is intervening in the market and is serious about controlling the currency, we shouldn’t see another flare up.”</p>
<p>Beyond the actions of the RBI, there are also a number of other reasons to believe that the country is turning the corner. Of the main economic challenges influencing the rupee at present – current account deficit, inflation, growth and the fiscal deficit – the prospects are already beginning to look more positive for at least two out of the four challenges. The rupee’s movements over this past year largely reflect the economy’s ailing fundamentals and, in particular, a current account deficit which widened considerably in the early part of 2013.</p>
<p>In March, many research brokers were forecasting a current account deficit in India around the 5% mark. But thanks to a hike in duties on the import of gold, those same brokers have now revised their projections downwards, towards 3% (see Chart 2). The narrowing of the current account deficit has clearly eased some of the nervousness in forex markets, helping the rupee to recover to around 62 to the US dollar.</p>

<p class=""source"">DBS Group Research, October 2013</p>
</figure>
<p>The fiscal deficit is also improving, thanks largely to lower current expenditures and higher non-tax revenue. According to recent figures published by the World Bank in October, revised data shows that the central government’s fiscal deficit in FY2013 reached 4.9% of GDP, well below last October’s target of 5.3% and considerably better than the 5.2% estimate made in March. On the other two fundamentals, the prospects are less certain. In the same report, the World Bank slashed its growth forecast for India, predicting GDP to decelerate to 4.4% in 1Q14, down from the 6.1% it forecast in April. However, there is optimism that next year may see some improvement, with the RBI estimating growth to recover to 6.2% in FY2015.</p>
<p>The report also states that core inflation has fallen to 2.4%, well within the RBI’s comfort threshold – this has helped bring Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation down to 5.3%. Nevertheless, L&amp;T’s Barai says this is the one macroeconomic indicator that he is uncertain about. However, his gut feeling is there may be a small degree of respite in the coming months. And if, as a consequence, the central bank decides to lower the interest rates, it will surely provide further relief to the economy. “In India much concern remains regarding currency depreciation on the back of deteriorating macro parameters,” says Barai. “Now, finally, we see that some of them are being sorted out.”</p>

The Korean wave,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>With a population of just under 49 million, South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea) has a gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.155 trillion. Known as the ‘Miracle on the Han’, the country’s record-breaking industrialisation, technological achievement, education boom and rapid urbanisation turned it from one of the world’s poorest states to a global economic power – it was ranked the 15<sup>th</sup> largest economy in 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<h4 id=""exports"">Exports</h4>
<p>The performance of South Korea’s economy is closely related to the performance of its exports, which contribute to almost 50% of its GDP. Major exports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High tech manufactured products such as semiconductors (9%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machinery (9%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automobiles (9%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ships (7%).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall South Korean exports dropped by 1.3% to $548 billion in 2012.</p>
<p>To promote inward foreign direct investment (FDI), the Korean government offers various incentives including cash grants and tax breaks. In addition, there are two types of foreign investment zones (FIZs) designated for foreign-invested small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large foreign-invested companies, respectively. The World Bank ranks South Korea eighth in the world for ease of doing business.</p>
<h3 id=""history"">History</h3>
<p>Following Japan’s surrender in 1945, which ended its occupation of the Korean peninsula, the Republic of Korea was established in the southern half of the Korean peninsula, with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) under communist rule in the north. The two states established an armistice in 1953 following the Korean War. The country’s economic development was further halted by the ensuing US occupation (1945 to 1948) and the three-year Korean War, which destroyed around 60% of the country’s productive capabilities.</p>
<p>In 1953 the total industrial production of South Korea was estimated to be at a third of that in 1940, yet following significant political changes, South Korea experienced a strong economic recovery. The country experienced growth for 27 continuous years, beginning with its first five-year plan implemented in 1962.</p>
<p>The rapid economic progress during the Park Chung-hee regime resulted in a rise of per capita income to 17 times that of North Korea. South Korea ended its military rule in 1993 and Kim Young-sam became the country’s first civilian president. Today the country is a modern democracy. Previous president Lee Myung-bak, in office from 2008 to 2012, promoted his country’s role in global affairs, which was highlighted by South Korea’s hosting of the G20 Summit in 2010.</p>
<h4 id=""first-female-president"">First female president</h4>

<p>“For emerging economies with highly liberalised capital accounts, it is of utmost importance from a macro-prudential perspective to guard against adverse shocks of external origin and associated capital flows. In this regard, Korea has recently implemented macro-prudential tools such as adjustable caps on banks’ foreign currency derivative positions and a macro-prudential levy on their foreign currency liabilities. I hope that Korea’s policy experience could be a good reference for other emerging countries.”</p>
<h4 id=""recent-developments"">Recent developments</h4>
<p>Recent economic policy developments include the government’s announcement in April of a KRW17.3 trillion ($15.3 billion) stimulus plan, which was an attempt to boost domestic consumption to offset the slowing demand for the country’s exports. This effort was considered to be the third-largest supplementary budget ever in South Korea, exceeded only by the efforts approved after the 1997/8 Asia financial crisis and the 2008 global financial turmoil.</p>
<p>In August, the BOK held its policy rate at 2.50% for the third consecutive month. The central bank was cautiously optimistic on growth, citing benefits from domestic stimulus measures. However, many analysts believe that the immediate economic outlook remains challenging, as demand at home and abroad remains weak. The BOK itself expects a negative output gap to be sustained for a considerable time, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow.</p>
<h4 id=""integrated-into-the-global-economy"">Integrated into the global economy</h4>
<p>South Korea is truly integrated into the global economy, and as such must be aware of external threats and opportunities. In a recent statement, the BOK outlined the potential influences:</p>
<p>“In terms of the future growth path, however, there are both upside risks, due for instance to the possibility of an acceleration in US and Japanese economic growth, and downside risks related for example to the possibility of an economic slowdown in China and to a heightening of uncertainties surrounding the exit strategy of the US Federal Reserve.”</p>
<p>In a separate statement on current economic developments, the central bank stated that consumption and investment was also increasing “helped by the base rate cut and the stimulus measures taken by the government”, and is expecting GDP to grow by 2.8% this year. Last year, South Korea’s economy expanded by 2%, the slowest rate in three years, because of weak global recovery and trade.</p>
<h4 id=""regulation-changes"">Regulation changes</h4>
<p>Global banks operating in the country are being adversely affected by recent regulatory changes that let customers restructure their debts and forces banks to write off 30% to 40% of what they are owed, as well as the slowing domestic economic situation. Standard Chartered, for example, took a $1 billion write-down on its business in South Korea and is considering selling two consumer finance units, while HSBC announced in July that it will close its retail branch network, highlighting some of the difficulties such banks are experiencing.</p>
<h3 id=""regional-free-trade"">Regional free trade</h3>
<p>One effect of the 2008 global financial crisis was to pull East Asian countries together, for the region as a whole wasn’t as badly affected by the turmoil as the US or Europe. In particular, China, Japan and South Korea have been working together to liberalise trade and encourage economic co-operation across the region.</p>
<h4 id=""free-trade-agreement"">Free Trade Agreement</h4>
<p>Over the past decade China and South Korea have worked towards a bilateral trade relationship. In 2003, China became South Korea’s largest trade partner, replacing the US. The trade volume between China and South Korea then reached $160 billion in 2007, some 32 times what it had been in 1992 when diplomatic ties were formally established between the two countries.</p>
<p>China has pressed to establish a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with South Korea since 2006. However, South Korea hesitated, mainly due to fears that the low price of agricultural products in China would potentially hurt its domestic market. However, South Korea has looked more favourably at the idea following the global crisis. In October 2009, the Chinese Minister of Commerce, Chen Deming, and the South Korean Minister for Trade, Kim Jong-noon, signed an agreement to increase economic co-operation between the two countries.</p>
<h4 id=""china-south-korea-relationship"">China/South Korea relationship</h4>
<p>Currently, South Korea holds a relative advantage over China in that it has more skilled labourers, however this may be at risk due to the recent downward trend in the South Korean population (similar to, but not as severe as, the problems faced by Japan’s shrinking population). Additionally, as China catches up in technology and research development this will further lessen South Korea’s advantage. China is firmly focused on creating an educated and highly skilled workforce, with many Chinese students encouraged to spend time at the best international institutions before returning to strengthen their country’s economy.</p>
<p>In addition to the China-South Korea relationship, there are strong ties developing across all East Asian countries post-economic crisis. In 2009, the six major trading partners of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) –</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Japan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South Korea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>India.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Australia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>– affirmed their commitment to establishing an East Asian Free Trade Agreement (EAFTA) and Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia (CEPEA) within the next 15 years. If this is to occur, the EAFTA would create the world’s largest economic region, ahead of the US and EU, with its countries’ total population of three billion people (49% of the world’s population).</p>
<h4 id=""tripartite"">Tripartite</h4>
<p>More recently, China and South Korea have invited Japan to join a tripartite FTA discussion. Negotiations on the agreement were set in motion in May 2012, with the first official talks on the matter held in Seoul from 26<sup>th</sup>–28<sup>th</sup> March 2013. The second round of talks kicked off in Shanghai on 30<sup>th</sup> July and focused on proposals to remove substantive tariffs, and address areas relating to services and competition. It also touched on issues regarding intellectual property and e-business. However, this meeting followed the 24<sup>th</sup> June reduction in the currency swap agreement between Japan and South Korea to its lowest level since 2006, amid a deterioration in diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>It will likely take some time for these countries to come to any conclusive agreement framework. However, it is a sign of a core strengthening in the region which will encourage growth and investment further in South Korea with its impressive agreements with Europe, the US and at some stage in the future China and Japan.</p>
<h3 id=""payments-infrastructure"">Payments infrastructure</h3>
<p>The payment and settlement system of Korea consists mainly of a large-value payment system, various retail payment systems, securities settlement systems and foreign exchange (FX) settlement systems. The main large-value payment system is the BOK Financial Wire Network (BOK-Wire+), which is a hybrid settlement system that began operating in April 2009. The new functionality helps to save participants’ settlement liquidity through such features as a continuous bilateral and multilateral offsetting mechanism.</p>
<h4 id=""securities-settlement-system"">Securities settlement system</h4>
<p>Korea’s securities settlement system (SSS) has grown exponentially since its inception in 1975, with the average daily settlement volume reaching approximately KRW28 trillion last year. The Korea Securities Depository (KSD), together with the BOK and Korea Exchange (KRX), began revamping the SSS in 2009 and the new system was successfully implemented for equity (16<sup>th</sup> January) and bonds (20<sup>th</sup> February) in 2012. The new enhancements largely consist of: for equity, reorganisation of the stock exchange settlement and institutional settlement; and for bonds, reorganisation of the inter-dealer market and introduction of intraday repo.</p>

<p>Additionally, in March this year, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) passed a revised bill on the Capital Markets Act that will allow the establishment of central counterparties (CCPs) for the clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) financial derivatives. Derivatives, such as interest rate swaps (IRS), are now forced to settle contracts through the registered CCPs, which is expected to reduce counterparty and systemic risk. The size of South Korea’s OTC derivatives market reached KRW6,904 trillion ($6.32 trillion) as of the end of 2011, around 100 times the size of listed derivatives market. The IRS market accounted for almost two-thirds of the total OTC products.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-challenges"">Treasury challenges</h3>
<p>When operating in South Korea, corporate treasury problems will be slightly different depending on the corporate specifics. Large South Korean multinational companies (MNCs) who are expanding overseas, and particularly those entering emerging markets, will face different challenges compared with large global clients coming into the country.</p>
<p>Sunil Veetil, Head of Global Payments and Cash Management Korea at HSBC, explains:</p>
<p>“Corporates who are trying to move beyond South Korea and expand globally are facing multiple issues. One issue may be due to the fact that they are expanding very quickly and setting up manufacturing units in many emerging markets. These corporates are finding it difficult to manage such a large group from a treasury perspective. They need their banks to help them improve their visibility over cash to allow them to see what is happening in each one of these countries.”</p>
<p>As Veetil indicates, many South Korean MNCs are looking to establish manufacturing units abroad. China, Indonesia, Vietnam and India are the favoured destinations, chosen for their strong domestic potential, low labour costs and also as key locations to export products to the West. Some MNCs are also establishing production facilities in Egypt and Brazil: Egypt is used as a base from which to focus on Africa and the Middle East; whereas Brazil is a strong location for tapping into the Latin America markets. The US and Europe are also important locations, but for sales offices as opposed to production bases.</p>
<p>As they expand globally South Korean corporates are realising just how important efficient cash management is. As their success in other countries grows, so does the amount of cash being generated in different currencies. “In some countries, cash flows in and out are restricted by foreign exchange (FX) rules,” says Veetil. “This means a corporate can’t move the money out very easily; instead they have to wait for the end of the year to issue a dividend or instigate an intracompany loan. Some corporates have huge amounts of cash lying idle in some countries, which are not part of a global or regional cash pool so they are not able to use it efficiently. Trapped cash is a big issue.”</p>
<p>Currency volatility has been a main issue for corporate treasurers operating in a country so heavily dependent on exports. According to data compiled by the Samsung Economic Research Institute (SERI), the South Korean won has been the most volatile among Asian currencies over the past three years. The won’s volatility index came in at 10.4% from January 2010 to December 2012, well above the 5% average tallied for the ten major Asian currencies. The currency volatility spiked further in July, as concerns emerged over an early exit of US quantitative easing (QE).</p>
<p>Recently, the won has depreciated against both the US dollar and Japanese yen. This is a conscious government objective, as a weaker won boosts the price competitiveness of Korean-made goods in overseas markets. A stronger won makes Korean goods expensive on overseas markets and erodes exporters’ earnings.</p>
<p>FX risk is just one of many risks that companies face when moving into new countries. “As they expand into other countries, risk management becomes an issue in terms of operational and counterparty risk,” explains Veetil.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-structures"">Treasury structures</h3>
<p>Similar to the situation in Japan, South Korean corporates often want to retain a centralised and highly controlled structure, with headquarters having direct oversight over their country operations or regional operations. In addition, they are understandably hesitant to compromise on quality control. This makes it difficult for them to manage the various treasuries due to the costs and practicalities.</p>
<p>Establishing a regional treasury centre (RTC) or shared service centre (SSC) is not a widespread practice as yet, despite interest and engagement with the concept. According to Veetil: “Some of our clients have already set up RTCs in Asia, Europe and the US, for example, so they are moving in the right direction and are decentralising at least on a regional basis. A few have done it and others are asking about how they can do it. They understand the importance of control but also realise that they cannot have control over operations in more than 100 countries direct from Seoul.”</p>
<p>Of the primary countries that South Korean MNCs are investing in, the most important by far is China. Many corporates have set up RTCs that are entirely devoted to covering China, with Beijing being the location of choice.</p>
<p>MNCs who are trying to enter the South Korean market, on the other hand, have a different set of obstacles to overcome. There is a unique market practice in South Korea, Veetil explains. “Many MNCs entering South Korea already have high quality treasury frameworks in place and don’t want to increase the number of bank accounts they currently have. Yet within the country, standard market practice is to have an account with every bank where your customers have accounts. Therefore, MNCs may have to open six to eight bank accounts, which can become expensive. Visibility over cash also becomes an issue, as cash is lying about in all these different banks which can be a struggle to consolidate.”</p>
<h3 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>Many South Korean companies are taking advantage of the crisis to expand outside the country, particularly in terms of manufacturing. “The amount of manufacturing moving outside of South Korea has increased substantially and that trend will continue,” says Veetil. “They have cash and are willing to invest. Importantly, they are also willing to take risks and move into new markets in Africa, for example, which is proving to be a great opportunity for these companies. As they expand, both control and risk become important issues. Many are trying to reduce the number of counterparties that they deal with, which leads to another trend we are seeing: the move to more bank-agnostic connectivity, such as SWIFTNet.”</p>
<p>But South Korean companies will not adopt SWIFT overnight. The process of information gathering and decision-making is a slow one in many Asian countries, yet some are seriously considering SWIFT. Veetil says: “We are seeing more clients using SWIFTNet and implementing it very aggressively. Once the corporate community makes the decision to adopt SWIFT, the move will tend to be very uniform amongst South Korean companies.”</p>
<p>Geopolitical spats, as well as issues around currency volatility, will remain top of mind for many treasurers operating in South Korea in 2014. Aside from these two issues, Veetil’s bet is on technology as a hot topic for 2014. “We see increasing penetration on the mobile front. The smartphone penetration in South Korea is 80%-85%, which is amongst the highest in the world, but banking through a smartphone is only just picking up (currently up 10.2% in 2Q13 – valued at KRW1.35 trillion per day). From a technology perspective, this is a big area of opportunity for banks to take advantage of.”</p>

<h5>Could you describe the SWIFT take-up in South Korea recently?</h5>
<p>Since 2007, we have been introducing SWIFT to most of the large corporate groups in the country. Today, one of the largest corporates in South Korea has moved its many subsidiaries to SWIFT. This has demonstrated the value proposition of SWIFT to the group as a whole and encouraged greater adoption by other large South Korean corporates as well.</p>
<p>Every year, the number of corporates joining SWIFT has been increasing and our market awareness has also been rising. The main driver for joining SWIFT is to increase cash visibility for better transparency and lower total cost of ownership (TCO) among corporates doing business with their overseas entities. Most corporates see SWIFT as the best financial messaging services provider for cross-border transactions with one secure, standardised gateway to all banks.</p>
<h5>Do you notice an acceleration in the rates of companies moving to SWIFTNet, and what do you anticipate for 2014?</h5>
<p>Market awareness of SWIFT has increased among corporate treasurers and relevant players such as treasury and enterprise resource planning (ERP) consultants in South Korea. We expect more corporates will move to SWIFT in 2014 and beyond. However, we do not anticipate a dramatic uptake due to the lead time before decision-making. We believe that market awareness is the key to our success – so we will try to organise more customer events for sharing knowledge and providing up-to-date information, such as global industry trends and corporate case studies.</p>
<h5>What do you think are South Korean corporates’ biggest issues/worries?</h5>
<p>The South Korean economy is mainly export-driven, so many corporates have been expanding their businesses overseas, and for most the turnover from overseas is larger than from their domestic operations. This drives corporate CFOs and treasurers to look for similar payment and cash management processes, based on a single channel, as they have domestically. Such solutions offer better cash visibility and enable close monitoring.</p>
<p>One of the biggest concerns/worries for CFOs is how to achieve a day-to-day level of transparency over their overseas cash. Some corporates have tried different solutions offered by other vendors, but these solutions did not meet their business needs, mainly because they could only provide a limited level of cash visibility.</p>

It’s not about the money,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The benefits of keeping a happy ship when it comes to the working environment are clear: if people are happy they will work more efficiently, are more positive in their outlook towards their role and their colleagues, and will strive to achieve the best they can, all of which ultimately benefits the company. But things can go wrong and companies are misguided if they think they can buy their way out of trouble.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, the government-run Employment Tribunals Service (ETS) publishes statistics on the number and nature of employment tribunal claims. During the 12-month period between April 2011 and March 2012 ETS received 186,300 claims covering areas such as unfair dismissal and age and sex discrimination, all of which impact on employee engagement and morale.</p>
<p>Low morale amongst staff can be a major problem and should never be dismissed lightly. According to a recent Gallup poll, 70% of workers in the US say they are either not engaged or are actively disengaged from their companies. The cost of disengagement to businesses in terms of lost productivity is estimated by the research firm to be up to $550 billion a year.</p>
<p>It need not be like this. In his book, ‘Conscious Capitalism’, Professor Raj Sisodia claims “conscious companies” outperformed S&amp;P’s 500-stock index from 1996 to 2011 by 10.5 to one. In their bid to be more aware of their relationship with the world, these companies have actively adopted ‘conscious leadership’ which means mentoring, motivating, developing, and inspiring people, rather than deploying models of command-and-control or carrot-and-stick.</p>
<h3 id=""what-problem"">What problem?</h3>
<p>In order to improve and maintain employee morale, it is first essential to identify the roots of the problem. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, a theory of human motivation, says we all must meet the basic physiological demands before moving to the next level which is security. This is followed by belonging, self-esteem and finally self-actualisation. The hierarchy is dynamic but humans typically must satisfy the lower order needs before moving to the next level.</p>
<p>As one of life’s necessities, money, is seemingly an obvious starting point for work-place satisfaction (or otherwise), but Mike Richards, Managing Director of treasury recruitment specialists, MR Recruitment, which publishes an annual salary survey, says it may not be so. “We have found that lack of pay isn’t a major cause of low morale; it is a contributing factor, but certainly never the only factor,” he states.</p>
<p>However, one of the most common causes of low employee morale is lack of career development, says Adam Scurr, Business Manager at Hays Financial Markets. “This can leave people feeling they are in a rut, with nowhere to go,” he notes. This observation is refined by Richards who notes that aside from poor job content and leadership, lack of control over day-to-day work, often as a direct result of an authoritarian management style, will cause tension. “For instance, as a treasury analyst you are often following the directions of those above you for the majority of the day and frustration can build. Even as a global or group treasurer you have to agree the strategic direction that treasury should follow with your FD or CFO before being given the powers to carry it out.”</p>
<p>The list of potential threats to employee morale also includes poorly managed change, job uncertainty caused by restructures, mergers, downsizing and relocations, lack of employer appreciation, personal or domestic issues, bullying and even gossip and rumours within the workplace. But perhaps one of the most destructive causes of low employee morale is stress. It may be caused by overwork, boredom or the breakdown of a working relationship with a line manager; each of these may have roots in other factors such as lack of training, poor management technique or just simply selecting the wrong person for the job.</p>
<p>The causes may be many but the effect is dramatic. A survey from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that work-related stress was cited in over 40% of work-related illnesses. On average, people suffering from depression, anxiety or stress take about 24 days off work a year, a figure that translated to 10.4 million working days lost in 2011/2012 in the UK alone.</p>
<p>Stress at work can be costly for businesses financially, but it also has a negative influence on staff relationships, poor performance, staff turnover and leads to more management time being spent on resolving the issues arising from stress.</p>
<h3 id=""asset-or-cost"">Asset or cost?</h3>
<p>According to Vijay Kapur, a Malaysia-based Senior Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Consultant, the damage that low morale (whether caused by stress or not) can do within a business is self-evident but the key question an employer must ask itself is “are employees an asset or a cost?” Costs, he writes in his blog for the Indian CSR consultancy, Kohana, “need to be minimised and controlled; assets are expected to produce a return over the long term and are worth investing in.” If a business sees employees only as a cost it will have a high turnover of staff, almost certainly will not be getting the best out of them and will be spending far more on recruitment, training and lost productivity than a business that values and retains its staff.</p>
<p>If employees are genuinely seen as an asset, Kapur’s view is that the key challenge for the company is how to “recruit, retain and motivate high performance staff by creating a sense of pride and spirit in the organisation”. The most effective means of achieving this, he argues, is through attention to the fundamental needs of every employee which include a safe workplace, proper rewards, employee personal growth, and good work/life balance: in other words, the hierarchy of needs. “The more satisfied workers are with their jobs, the better the company is likely to perform in terms of profitability and particularly productivity,” he writes.</p>
<h3 id=""staff-survey"">Staff survey</h3>
<p>Richard Lambert, Director of employee engagement consultancy, Morale Solutions, notes that many organisations carry out ‘exit interviews’ in an attempt to uncover the true thoughts of departing employees. Clearly not all reasons for leaving are negative (someone may just seek a change of lifestyle or location). But where organisational negatives are apparent – particularly amongst professional staff – Lambert confirms that lack of career progression, a poor relationship with a line manager and wage stagnation often surface.</p>
<p>As part of Morale Solutions’ remit it carries out employee surveys. An organisation will often conduct a survey if it perceives there is a problem with staff morale. The first time a survey is used it is natural for staff to suspect motives, Lambert notes. Genuine anonymity is therefore a key issue as without it survey results may be worthless. Good communication is essential to ensure employees are at ease with the process but it is also essential for the company to use the research results to make positive changes. If this is done, Lambert says there will be “a massive upturn in levels of morale and employee engagement”. Of course, if no action is taken it will serve quite the opposite purpose and any future promises will sound hollow.</p>
<p>Conducting a survey of this kind will incur costs and building a business case may be necessary. But finding business metrics that correlate well with the concept of employee morale is not easy, warns Lambert. However, it may be enough to know intuitively that spotting signs of dissatisfaction early on enables an employer to tackle the issue before it becomes a major problem.</p>
<h3 id=""reading-the-signs"">Reading the signs</h3>
<p>There are many signs of deterioration in employee engagement. Some common signs of dissatisfaction are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased absence from work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of motivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low and/or poor quality productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constant complaints and a focus on the negatives of the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A general distancing from colleagues and withdrawal of cooperation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clock-watching.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should always be borne in mind that such behaviours may not be job-related and instead may arise out of personal or domestic issues; if so it becomes a more sensitive issue to handle and may require professional guidance from HR. It should also be noted that changing behaviour in the workplace is never clear-cut and must be taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>For most employees, the feeling of being valued, and being of value, is important in working life and thus many employees need to understand how their work fits into the general scheme of things. It is therefore also necessary to regularly give constructive feedback (positive and negative) but, says Lambert, the rule is “praise in public and chastise in private”. However, failure to confront poor performance is potentially disastrous, not just for the individual who will not know they are performing badly or feel they can get away with it, but also for colleagues who may see the lack of action as tacit management approval of poor performance and hence begin to question the validity of their own efforts.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-action"">Taking action</h3>
<p>Regardless of how low morale manifests itself, Richards advocates a “360 degree view” to help managers understand how employees may be feeling. “The best managers are those who listen and react to those above, below and on the same level and who can balance the needs of all,” he says. A little empathy goes a long way: “If you are the senior treasury professional in the department and you are frustrated by the current environment or company ethos, you can be sure those below you are feeling the same at least to some degree.”</p>
<p>The responsibility for creating a positive working environment rests with all parties but much rests on the ability of line managers in this capacity. “If there are any major changes going on in a business, employees need to be kept informed as much as possible, preferably in person,” states Scurr. “When people are kept in the dark, people start guessing and that’s when rumours circulate.”</p>
<p>A manager’s responsibility for staff welfare goes “as far as they feel comfortable going”, notes Richards. “Some staff members will be comfortable with an equal exchange – they will bring their personal problems or issues to the work place – whilst others will feel uncomfortable doing this.” Regardless of the depth of discussion, communication is clearly one of the most important aspects of a managerial role and getting it wrong can destabilise an otherwise good working environment.</p>
<p>Managing people is a skill but many managers are promoted because they have the skills, understanding and experience of the actual job, not necessarily the equally important communicative skills. In a commercial environment managing should be about building relationships with employees based on mutual trust and respect. The authoritarian model may benefit some environments (military for example) but quite often serves only to create an ‘us and them’ divide. This can impact severely on productivity, staff retention and, as we have seen above, the bottom line.</p>
<p>Managers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be open to communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take grievances seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept responsibility for mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be truthful with the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set realistic targets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never treat employees like a commodity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be explicit with instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid micro-management where possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer praise and thanks where due.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage employee initiative and development for all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""the-right-person-for-the-job"">The right person for the job</h3>
<p>The concept of a ‘job for life’ is a thing of the past not just because the way we work has changed but also the range of opportunities and the desire to progress has increased: people can move from job to job so they do (albeit less so during an economic downturn). As a driver for moving on, there is a clear link between level of job satisfaction and length of employment.</p>
<p>According to Lambert, there is always a “honeymoon period” when people start a new job. “Our research identifies morale as tending to peak when people have been in a role between three to five years; they know how everything works, they feel that their career is progressing and that they are valued.”</p>
<p>The common ‘danger zone’ is around the one to two year period. From exit interview data gathered by Morale Solutions, those leaving at this stage tend to be highly negative about specific issues. If a company can identify and tackle those issues beforehand it might be able to retain staff longer, reducing losses caused by under-performance as well as the significant cost of recruitment and bringing new staff up to speed.</p>
<p>There is a common plateau after the three- to five-year period where for many employees the challenge may have gone. If the employer cannot find a way of reinvigorating these individuals it is likely they will part ways. Five years’ or so service may be considered a good run by both parties, says Lambert, “but what is difficult to swallow is when a company spends lots on recruiting someone and they leave after one or two years”.</p>
<p>When it comes to recruitment, the interview should be a two-way conversation devoted to getting the right match of skills, Richards advises. Questions should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Draw out the actual skills and achievements of the candidate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out how capable the candidate is at managing and working in teams or alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess the candidate for fit with the culture and values of the organisation.</p>
</li>

<p>It is essential to ensure balance between these elements and to consider the value of building a team with a diverse set of backgrounds, experiences, ideas and working styles, rather than being swayed by one outstanding feature.</p>
<h3 id=""keep-it-going"">Keep it going</h3>
<p>Building and maintaining internal relationships can be approached in a number of ways and Scurr believes that the so-called ‘away-day’ or off-site team-building exercise can be useful. “It is very easy to become focused on your own role within your own team and not really venture out to find out how each team plays its part,” he explains. “With an away-day you get to meet people in other departments and this is vital to understanding the business better.”</p>
<p>Maintenance of morale can also come from stepping aside from day-to-day responsibilities and being invited to participate in project work, notes Richards. A break from regular duties adds a challenge to working life and can similarly expand the participants’ circle of colleagues and understanding of other functions.</p>
<p>The importance attached to pay varies, but a reward beyond basic remuneration, such as a bonus, can go some way to creating satisfaction, Richards notes. Be warned though that if employees start to see a bonus as a right, subsequent failure to meet that expectation can create the opposite of the desired effect – which shows how difficult it is to create the right balance.</p>

Indonesia: making the grade,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In April, Indonesia’s President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, urged multinational corporations (MNCs) in the country’s natural resources sector to engage in “genuine partnership and cooperation”. Speaking at a Reuters event in Singapore, he said many MNCs around the world “take too much and do not leave behind enough for the people of those countries”.</p>
<p>Indonesia is a major exporter of copper, nickel, gold and other commodities such as palm oil, oil and gas. The government has implemented a range of policies to encourage companies to invest more in downstream businesses and to add value to products before they are exported. At the same time, it is looking to expand the country’s manufacturing base.</p>
<p>In June, the Indonesian government announced a new tax of 20% on mineral exports of unprocessed metals. The Financial Times reported that companies without plans to build processing facilities onshore would be banned from exporting.</p>
<p>“Indonesia realises it has a large population that makes it an attractive domestic market for MNCs,” says Andy Dyer, Head of Transaction Banking Sales in Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas at ANZ Banking Group. “It doesn’t just want to be an export market based on cheap labour. Recent regulations are geared towards adding value to exports, particularly in the resources sector.</p>
<p>“Regulations have been designed to make it more difficult for the extractive industries to export without adding value. You could argue this might put some companies off entering the market, but the country has very strong fundamentals in terms of demographics and resources.”</p>
<p>In January, ratings agency Moody upgraded Indonesia’s rating from a ‘speculative’ grade to investment grade. Moody’s move followed that of Fitch, which upgraded the country in December 2012.</p>
<p>With an enviable GDP growth rate of around 6%, Indonesia is attracting interest from MNCs and increasing levels of foreign direct investment (FDI). At the start of the year Indonesia’s Investment Co-ordinating Board (BKPM) reported record levels of FDI for the country. In 2012 IDR206 trillion ($20 billion) in foreign funds flowed into the country and the BKPM predicts a total of IDR270 trillion ($27 billion) will be invested in 2013.</p>
<p>FDI accounts for around 70% of the total direct investments in the country of IDR376 trillion ($38 billion). The BKPM oversees investments, granting business permits to overseas and domestic companies. During the past month the BKPM has received 400 requests for permits per day, compared to the usual 150.</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-attraction"">Corporate attraction</h3>
<p>The chairman of the BKPM, M. Chatib Basri, told a press conference that prevailing global economic uncertainties were benefitting Indonesia, as the situation causes investors to turn to emerging economies. “Brazil is growing by only 0.6%, India has problems with inflation and China is slowing down. If you were an investor looking to invest in emerging economies, where else to invest but here?” he told the Jakarta Post.</p>
<p>The mining sector accounts for the largest share of FDI at 17.3%. Observers believe this will increase as the government’s commitment not to export raw minerals, but to add value via mineral processing, bears fruit.</p>
<p>There have been some high profile investments in Indonesia during the past six months. French cosmetics giant L’Oréal has opened its largest factory globally at the Jababeka Industrial Estate in West Java. A phased investment of €100m will establish the factory as a production hub for South-East Asia. The company said the factory is a response to increased market demand in Indonesia and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries; 30% of production will be for the domestic market, with the remainder destined for South-East Asia.</p>
<p>Toyota also has invested in a new production facility in West Java via Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia, a majority owned venture with local distributor PT Astra International. The plant has an initial output capacity of 70,000 units per year produced by 1100 workers.</p>
<p>These moves indicate that the interest in Indonesia is not based solely on natural resources; the country has another important resource – people. It is the fourth most populous country in the world with more than 250 million people, many of whom are young. In fact, 42.2% of the population is aged between 25 and 54 years. One quarter of the population is under 14 years old. More Indonesians are moving into the middle classes and consumerism is on the increase.</p>
<h3 id=""domestic-purchasing-power"">Domestic purchasing power</h3>
<p>In a quarterly report published in April, global consultancy McKinsey says 90 million Indonesians will join the ‘consumer class’ by 2030 – more than in any emerging country apart from China and India. McKinsey estimates that this migration into the middle class will be worth an additional $1 trillion in annual spending. “Already, Indonesia’s consumer spending, at 61% of GDP (2010), is closer to levels in developed economies than to the corresponding figures for neighbouring, largely export-driven nations such as Malaysia and Thailand,” states the report.</p>
<p>“As the percentage of the country’s population living in urban areas grows from roughly 53% of Indonesia’s residents today to 71% in 2030, spending should grow in categories such as financial services, leisure, travel, and apparel.” This spending already has begun to grow among the country’s city dwellers.</p>
<p>“Indonesia always has been seen as a market with a lot of potential, although it only started fulfilling its potential in the past five years,” says ANZ’s Dyer. This change came, he adds, when Indonesia became a major country of interest for investors and MNCs as a production base, as well as a consumer base. This has been fuelled by the commodities boom and also regular GDP growth rates of 6-7%.</p>
<p>“You could term what we are seeing as a second renaissance of investment in Indonesia,” says Manfred Schmoelz, Head of Transaction Services, Asia Pacific at The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). “When China and India were closed to international investment during the 1980s and early 1990s, multinationals made substantial investments in Indonesia. Once India and China opened up, some of that investment flow was diverted. But with a more politically stable environment, Indonesia’s economy is growing and currency and interest rate regimes have improved. Therefore, investment is picking up again.”</p>
<p>Riko Tasmaya, Treasury and Trade Services Head in Indonesia for Citi, says the country is well positioned to attract FDI as 60% of the economy is driven by domestic demand. “Growing consumer purchasing power is the engine of the 6.2% GDP growth in the country. Among the emerging and growth economies, Indonesia accounts for 39% of combined GDP growth; this is predicted to rise to 58% by 2025. By then, we believe Indonesia will be one of the top ten world economies.”</p>
<p>Indonesia is the strongest of the ASEAN countries and plays a critical role in supporting the overall economic growth of that group, says Tasmaya. “Much of the growth in Indonesia is due to the high proportion of young people in the country and their high levels of productivity.”</p>
<p>All of these points, he says, make Indonesia a very attractive country for FDI; the majority of investment is coming from Singapore, South Korea, Japan and the US. “These investors will find tremendous opportunities related to natural resources, consumer purchasing powers and a growing manufacturing base as the government tries to encourage the growth of more value-added exports,” says Tasmaya.</p>
<h3 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h3>
<p>McKinsey’s quarterly points out that Indonesia’s consumer market is very complex, scattered over more than 17,000 islands where tastes and preferences vary. Indonesia’s distribution infrastructure is fragmented geographically and small retail stores predominate in many consumer categories.</p>
<p>This presents challenges for corporates, particularly when it comes to collections.</p>
<p>Tasmaya explains: “While Indonesia spans a vast area and is comprised of thousands of islands, less than 50% of the population is bankable. For this reason, cash use is very high and collections are a key challenge for corporates. Solutions need to offer timely and secure collections with automatic reconciliation capabilities. Global banks such as Citi are investing heavily in the technology to support such capabilities.” Many corporates are partnering with global banks that can provide an end-to-end proposition that covers integrated collections, advanced liquidity management and payments support on one technology platform, he says.</p>
<p>Schmoelz also cites Indonesia’s geography as a challenge for corporates looking to expand operations in the country. “One of the key issues in Indonesia is its geography; the country is made up of 17,000 islands that are spread across a distance the size of Europe. A great deal of infrastructure investment – in roads, rail and ports – is required to help move resources around.”</p>
<p>The Indonesian government is encouraging infrastructure development. In May 2011, the government announced its ‘Master Plan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development’, a long-term, nationwide development plan running up to 2025, which could be worth up to IDR4000 trillion ($402 billion). Of this total, 70% is expected to be financed by the private sector including state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the government eased regulations to make the infrastructure sector more investor-friendly, such as amending the law on PPPs and passing a new Land Acquisition Law, which allows the government to obtain civilian land for public works projects. The World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) reports that the Indonesian government’s infrastructure plans include constructing power plants that will supply 20,000 megawatts of electricity during the next decade and 1095 kilometres of new toll roads to move goods faster across the vast archipelago. The IFC estimates the cost of these investments as $150 billion during the next five years. However, the government can finance only 30% of the cost; the rest will come from the private sector.</p>
<p>Among recent infrastructure deals is a $4.8 billion investment by China Railway Group, won in March 2010, to build and operate a coal railway. The Financial Times reports that Indonesia is the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, 15% of which goes to China. More recent projects include the construction of a $5.2 billion integrated railway network in Sulawesi; the construction of a monorail system for Jakarta; and the expansion of a terminal at Soekamo-Hatta International Airport. The government has introduced a nationwide freight transport programme to improve the movement of goods through the country’s vast waterways. As part of this programme, PT Pelabuhan Indonesia, the state-owned sea terminal operator, will construct Lamong Bay Terminal in Surabaya, East Java, with a planned inauguration in 2014.</p>
<p>In addition to a lack of physical infrastructure, Tasmaya says other challenges in Indonesia arise due to bureaucracy and corruption. “Good progress has been made on all of these fronts, although some concerns remain for investors, one of them with regard to labour reforms,” he says. “The government is on track to ensure that it doesn’t miss out on what it sees as a golden age in terms of its young population. Alongside investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, the government is investing in human capital, ensuring education is of a high enough quality to support economic growth. Attention also has been paid to innovation, with increases in the government R&amp;D budget.”</p>
<p>At the same Reuters event earlier this year, President Yudhoyono conceded that corruption was more difficult to eradicate than he had thought, but he denied suggestions that it had risen in his eight and a half years in office. “It’s not getting any worse, it’s actually improving – but I am still not satisfied. I am frustrated, I am angry and I am annoyed,” he said.</p>
<p>Widespread perceptions of corruption and broad regional disparities in health point to ongoing challenges for policymakers seeking sustainable, broad-based prosperity, according to a Gallup study of Indonesia. Published in May, the report, ‘Indonesia’s Economic Emergence’, found that 88% of Indonesians thought corruption was widespread in public sector, with 82% believing it is also widespread in business.</p>
<p>Gallup points out that systemic corruption is considered by economists as a hindrance to economic development. One of the most common forms, bribery of government officials, raises average transaction costs and tends to hurt the poor, who are typically less able to pay and less likely to have political connections on which to draw. “The result is that deeply entrenched patterns of income inequality become even more difficult to overcome,” says the report. “This is another of Indonesia’s major challenges to broad-based economic development.” At present the household income of the country’s richest 20% of people is four times that of the average income of the remaining 80%.</p>
<p>Gallup’s report concludes that recent trends in Indonesia, including the improving economic outlook and rising satisfaction with healthcare and education among its people, suggest the country is improving its competitive position by empowering more of its citizens to drive economic development. However, it warns that ongoing corruption and extreme income inequality continue to undermine Indonesia’s economic potential by increasing the risks for investors, foreign and domestic.</p>
<h3 id=""banking-developments"">Banking developments</h3>
<p>For the time being at least, Indonesia is proving attractive to a large number of MNCs. The needs for these multinationals entering Indonesia, says Vinod Madhavan, Global Head, Local Corporate Products and Receivables and Supply Chain Finance (SCF) at Standard Chartered Bank, are the same as for those entering any emerging economy. “Companies are looking for cash management and working capital solutions. They require support from financial institutions that can understand their needs, have a strong local presence and therefore understanding of the market,” he says.</p>
<p>Indonesia is one of the more mature markets in the region when it comes to accounts receivable (AR)/accounts payable (AP) management, he says. “There is a wide network of ATMs under the banner of ATM Bersama, which are interlinked between most banks. Corporates can manage their consumer-to-business (C2B) receivables (such as utility payments) through the ATM network, as there is a capacity for consumers to pay bills via ATMs. This has eased some of the problems with collections in such a widespread country.” Collections efficiency and AR reconciliation are real “pain points” for corporates, he adds.</p>
<p>There are four main pillars to RBS’s work in Indonesia, says Rob Carmichael, Head of MNC Coverage, Indonesia, RBS. “These pillars are trade, cash, debt and hedging. One of the landmark transactions we did this year was to help arrange Indonesia and South-East Asia’s largest bond transaction for PT Pertamina, one of the world’s largest producers and exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG).”</p>
<p>The PT Pertamina deal raised $3.25 billion in a US dollar-denominated bond sale. Conducted in May this year, it was the most valuable bond issuance from Indonesia to date, highlighting a growing trend of local Indonesian corporations tapping into the bond market. Pertamina received overwhelming interest for international investors, with offerings over-subscribing the initial target by 4.4 times. A total of $14.4 billion in orders from 667 international investors was booked. The offering was divided into two tranches with ten-year and 30-year tenors. Pertamina appointed Barclays Capital, RBS and Citigroup as the lead arrangers, with Bahana Securities, Danareksa Sekuritas and Mandiri Sekuritas acting as co-managers.</p>
<p>Carmichael says RBS also works with MNCs on currency hedging, and gives advice on how to repatriate dividend payments. SCF is a growing area; but whereas in Europe it can be focused on helping suppliers in financial difficulties, in Indonesia it is more to do with driving working capital efficiency, he says.</p>
<p>ANZ’s Dyer says the significant commodities exports from Indonesia generate interesting opportunities for structured trade finance and short-term trade products. “Our clients are looking to mitigate buyer risk and also be able to provide funding against stock and production assets, particularly in the case of palm oil.”</p>
<p>Standard Chartered is “very bullish”, says Madhavan, on trade innovations such as the Bank Payment Obligation (BPO). An alternative means of settlement in international trade, the BPO provides the benefits of a letter of credit (LC) in an automated environment. Importantly for banks, it offers the possibility of intermediation earlier in the supply chain by offering risk mitigation and financing services.</p>
<p>A BPO is an irrevocable undertaking given by one bank to another bank that payment will be made on a specified date after a specified event (such as delivery of goods) has taken place. The specified event is evidenced by a match report that is generated by SWIFT’s Trade Services Utility (TSU) or any equivalent transaction matching application.</p>
<p>The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) cites a number of BPO benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mitigating risks in international trade for buyers and sellers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed, reliability and convenience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced costs and improved accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assurance of payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to flexible financing options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securing the supply chain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“The BPO delivers operational efficiency to corporates while also mitigating payments risk,” says Madhavan. “We are seeing a good interest in this instrument in Asia. There is a regulatory mandate in Indonesia that requires the use of LCs with commodity transactions and we think the industry will take up the BPO to meet these requirements and to improve operational efficiency at the same time.”</p>
<h3 id=""regional-influence"">Regional influence</h3>
<p>While multinationals are entering the Indonesian market, there is a growing trend for Indonesian companies to “step out into the wider region”, says Madhavan. “Indonesia plays an important role in ASEAN, given the size of its market and also its proximity to Singapore and to Australia.”</p>
<p>The ASEAN was formed in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand to promote political and economic co-operation and regional stability. Brunei joined in 1984, Vietnam in 1995, Laos and Myanmar in 1997 and Cambodia was the most recent addition in 1999. Indonesia’s GDP is almost double that of its closest competitor in ASEAN, Thailand.</p>
<p>Says Madhavan: “Domestic Indonesian companies are moving out into the region via Singapore; like the multinationals, they are looking for financial institutions that have a strong presence in the markets in which they are expanding. For example, there is strong export growth between Indonesia and Africa. Standard Chartered has a strong presence in Asia, Middle East and Africa, and can see many of these flows and help both sides of transactions.”</p>
<p>Dyer says Indonesia is a relatively open market for cash. Multinationals can sweep dollars offshore, although they cannot put local currency funds into cash pooling systems. “Given Indonesia’s relatively high interest rates, there is a lot of interest in domestic cash concentration. Many MNCs are happy to use their profits to invest locally because Indonesia is still very much in growth mode.”</p>
<p>There are some challenges, he adds, as the rupiah is a volatile currency and foreign currency reserves are relatively low versus some other Asian markets. “The taxation system is also perceived by many multinationals to be a high burden,” he says.</p>
<p>Many MNCs entering the Indonesian market have set up shared service centres (SSCs) in Singapore, for example, says Citi’s Tasmaya. According to the ‘Asia Pacific Treasury Management Barometer 2013’, a study carried out by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill) and SunGard, 72% of corporates in the region have set up a regional treasury or SSC, the majority of them in Singapore. Of the treasurers surveyed in Indonesia, 52% said cash concentration will be a key focus during the next 12 months and 70% will be focusing on cash visibility as well.</p>
<p>“The depth and diversity of the Asia Pacific market has long served as both an opportunity and challenge for treasury professionals with regional responsibilities,” Paul Simpson, Global Head of Global Transaction Services (GTS) at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, stated in the report.</p>
<p>“On one hand, Hong Kong and Singapore have developed as hubs that are highly supportive of centralised operations and complex treasury structures. On the other, the region’s emerging markets, characterised by regulatory change, currency restrictions and systemic risks, provide a constant change to adapt to and leverage. Nowhere else in the world does a treasurer need to manage this level of contrast than in Asia Pacific.”</p>

Shifting global dynamics,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Significant changes in the relative size of the world’s economies will take place during the next 50 years, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In its November 2012 economic policy paper, ‘Looking to 2060: Long-term global growth prospects’, the OECD predicted that fast growth in China and India will soon make their combined gross domestic product (GDP) surpass that of the G7 economies and exceed that of the entire current OECD membership by 2060.</p>
<p>Growth in non-OECD countries will continue to outpace the OECD average during the period, although the difference will narrow over coming decades. From more than 7% per year over the past decade, non-OECD growth will decline to around 5% in the 2020s and to about half that by the 2050s, according to the report. Until 2020, China will have the highest growth rate among the countries included in the study, but will then be surpassed by both India and Indonesia. This partly reflects a more rapid decline in the working-age population, and consequently in labour force participation, in China rather than in India and Indonesia.</p>
<p>In the more immediate future, the OECD’s ‘Interim Assessment’ of the global economic outlook, published in March, confirms that growth of emerging economies remains much faster than that of advanced countries on average (albeit with significant differences across countries). The report predicts a return to “moderate growth” in the US during the first quarter of 2013, while a “meaningful recovery” is likely to take longer in Europe.</p>
<p>“Given the substantial share of the world economy now accounted for by emerging economies, they will again drive growth at the global level this year,” says the report. “Annualised growth in China is expected to continue to be well above 8% in the first half of 2013.”</p>
<p>The United Nation’s (UN) assessment of the global economy for the coming year is rather more downbeat than that of the OECD. Its ‘World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013’, published in December last year, highlights that economies in developing Asia “weakened considerably during 2012” as the region’s growth engines – China and India – shifted into lower gear. “While a significant deceleration in exports has been a key factor behind the slowdown, both economies also face a number of structural challenges that hamper growth,” states the report. “Given persistent inflationary pressures and large fiscal deficits, the scope for policy stimulus in India and other South Asian countries is limited.”</p>
<p>China and many East Asian economies, in contrast, possess much greater space for counter-cyclical policy. In the UN’s outlook, average growth in East Asia is forecast to pick up slightly to 6.2% in 2013, from the estimated 5.8% in 2012. GDP growth in South Asia is expected to average 5% in 2013, up from 4.4% in 2012, led by a moderate recovery of India’s economy.</p>
<p>While there may be differences in the details, it would be difficult to argue with the idea that developing – or emerging – economies are where the growth is. The moribund economic climates of many of the Eurozone countries, along with those of the UK and the US, do not present attractive platforms on which corporations can grow.</p>
<p>Data collected from purchasing managers across the Eurozone during March 2013 indicate a deepening of the downturn in the currency union, according to Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) published in April. Output and new orders fell at stronger rates, driving further job losses. PMIs fell in almost all countries, with a modest decline in Germany, accompanied by steep downturns in France, Spain and Italy.</p>
<h3 id=""east-asia-evolves"">East Asia evolves</h3>
<p>The austerity-hit developed economies stand in stark contrast to the vibrant and dynamic countries of the world’s Eastern hemisphere, which is characterised by younger populations and growth-friendly economic policies. In the past few years, the idea that the East was a region from which to source cheap labour, has given way to a realisation that it is also a region of other opportunities, with burgeoning consumer markets and in some cases very significant infrastructure projects under way.</p>
<p>“Asia is becoming the global engine of economic growth, a position further highlighted since the global financial crisis,” says Sameer Sawhney, Global Head of Transaction Banking, ANZ. “This growth is sustainable and an increasing number of Western corporations are looking to Asia as a key growth market for their businesses.”</p>
<p>For example, San Francisco-based GAP, one of the largest clothes retailers in the US, began an aggressive expansion into China in 2011 as part of a global strategy. The company plans to have around 45 outlets in China by the end of this year as it seeks to reduce its dependence on North America, where consumer confidence is volatile.</p>
<p>Diane S. Reyes, Global Head of Payments and Cash Management at HSBC, says the bank is “bullish” about China’s outlook; the country has been a key contributor to world economic growth and that looks set to continue with more than 7% GDP growth for 2013. “Firms that want to grow in the global economy should be involved in China and using the renminbi (RMB),” she says. “Currently, more than 10% of China’s international trade is settled in RMB, and by 2015 we expect that over one third of all international trade transactions with China will be denominated in RMB.”</p>
<p>As a very big consumer-oriented market, there are “tremendous” opportunities in China for retail companies to expand, but they need to understand the market and its settlement conditions, and potential complexities that vary city by city.</p>
<p>Reyes says the pace and scale of urbanisation in China is extraordinary. “This trend therefore provides significant opportunities for companies involved in infrastructure development as China continues to invest heavily in housing, transportation, telecommunications and other infrastructure projects to enable people to move into cities.”</p>
<p>In September 2012 China’s economic planning authority, the National Development and Reform Commission, announced approvals for 60 infrastructure projects worth a total of $150 billion. The projects include highways, ports and airport runways. Financial news service Bloomberg reported a surge in the share price of infrastructure companies around the world following the announcement, with Japanese and US companies recording significant jumps.</p>
<p>China is not the only country that is going for infrastructure growth as governments throughout the region instigate large-scale projects. The Indonesian government, for example, has announced plans to float tenders for several medium-to-large infrastructure projects worth $7.6 billion in 2013. The move, aimed at boosting economic growth, will cover projects such as toll roads and dams, construction of which is expected to begin by 3Q13. In Vietnam, the government has announced a large project to build a high capacity electrical transmission line for 437kms across a number of provinces and through to Ho Chi Minh City in the south. It aims to ensure electricity supply to the southern areas of the country by 2014-2015, as well as power grid connectivity across Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia by 2015.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-china"">Beyond China</h3>
<p>It is not just China and India that represent opportunities in the East. In a 2011 report, ‘The Time for Regional Expansion is Now’, Accenture identified South-East Asia as an emerging prime business destination in Asia. Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam offer multinationals new markets in which to pursue growth, the report says. After India and China, South-East Asia is regarded as the third pillar of Asia as a whole.</p>
<p>Accenture says the region is perceived to be a long-term destination that will remain on the periphery of an Asian strategic agenda for a majority of businesses outside the region, but at the centre of expansion plans for native businesses seeking growth closer to home.</p>
<p>“We believe businesses that position themselves now for growth in South-East Asia will be rewarded by finding themselves in the middle of a new ‘centre of gravity’ within future high-growth markets,” says the report. “South-East Asia has the clear potential to become an alternate hub to China within the Asian region. It offers new opportunities for international companies and can act as a launch pad for local businesses seeking to become regional or global leaders.”</p>
<p>Businesses that are gravitating towards expansion into South-East Asia should focus on four key imperatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adopt a regional mindset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop strong partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt from the core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move with agility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of its sheer scale China dwarfs every other country in the region, says Sawhney. But from a strategy point of view, other markets of interest include Indonesia, the Philippines, India and Vietnam. “These markets are growing exponentially and have stable political and regulatory environments and are hungry for foreign investment.”</p>
<p>Domestic markets in the East are becoming more vibrant; India has a population of 1.3 billion and Indonesia has 230 million people. “We are moving away from the term ‘emerging market’ to one of ‘growth market’,” says Sawhney. “While these markets may not yet be a big part of a company’s P&amp;L, they will be in the future. In Vietnam, for example, 65% of the population are under the age of 20.”</p>
<h3 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h3>
<p>Expanding into Eastern markets is not without its challenges, of course. “Asia today is very much like Europe of the 1980s and 1990s – it has many different markets, economies, currencies and taxation regimes,” says Richard Jaggard, Managing Director and Head of Transaction Banking Europe, Standard Chartered. “Corporate treasurers’ first challenge is how to manage such complexity – many have gone down the regional treasury route, others are managing Asia from their European or US headquarters. As their scale of business grows in Asia, treasurers realise they have to put more high quality resources into the region in order to manage the increased complexities and risks that come with commercial growth.”</p>
<p>Corporates want to use the structures they have developed in the West and blend them into Asia, says Jaggard. For example, they are looking to ‘bolt on’ Asian operations to the liquidity structures they have developed in Europe. This will enable them to centralise cash from the region – some are doing this via a regional treasury centre (RTC), others are looking to integrate into a global structure. For non-mobile liquidity, corporates are focused on in-country efficiency via approaches such as yield enhancement based on aggregated positions within the region.</p>
<p>ANZ’s Sawhney says there are changes afoot in Eastern markets that make them very interesting for corporate treasurers. “In the past Asia was a factory for the world with uni-directional flow to the West, as companies sourced from Asia. There was no significant currency risk as the majority of transactions were in US dollar or euro. Now, however, there is increasingly a two-way flow as companies look to supply to Asian markets. Funding flow and allocating capital are becoming key differentiators.”</p>

<p>Corporations looking to do business in the East will at some stage have to develop a strategy for China’s currency. “The internationalisation of the RMB is posing issues for corporate treasurers to work through in terms of managing investments and cash,” says Sawhney. “To date there are still only three fully convertible Asian currencies – the Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar and Japanese yen. The biggest growing markets in the East – China and India – do not have open currencies.”</p>
<p>HSBC’s Reyes says the Chinese regulators are looking to ease currency inflows so corporates can raise RMB funding in Hong Kong or another market, and use that to fund projects in China. This will help corporates to limit their foreign exchange (FX) exposures. “A challenge when dealing with the RMB is whether to go onshore, with accounts in China, or offshore in Hong Kong, for example,” she says.</p>
<p>Jaggard says a significant challenge for corporations doing business in China is what to do with the cash they generate there. “During the past few months the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBoC) has taken a few more steps in its RMB liberalisation programme, such as the ability to make short-term foreign currency loans. This will help.”</p>
<p>In April, Australia became the third country, after the US and Japan, to seal a currency deal with China. It means the Australian dollar can be converted directly into RMB. China is Australia’s main trading partner, with exports and imports totalling A$120 billion in the last financial year.</p>
<p>A survey of 500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Australia, conducted by HSBC, found that 40% of companies importing from or exporting to China intend to settle transactions in RMB during the coming year. The currency deal between Australia and China will reduce costs, as firms will no longer have to convert via the US dollar. According to the survey, 31% of SMEs plan to use both US dollar and RMB, and 13% intend to exclusively use the Chinese currency. “Given China represents over 20% of our current trade and is expected to grow by 8.5% per annum to 2020, the RMB’s role within Australian trade will inevitably rise,” said HSBC Bank Australia Head of Business Banking, Paul Edgar, in a statement. “It is clear from the survey that Australian SMEs are getting ahead of the curve.”</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-strategies"">Treasury strategies</h3>
<p>Growth rates in the faster growing economies are very attractive, but treasurers realise they need to develop efficient infrastructure that will support growth, says Jaggard. “Centralisation through the development of skills centres, such as RTCs, provides the opportunity to identify and manage financial risk, while shared service centres (SSCs) focused on accounting and payments provide processing efficiency gains as well as quality in information management. Both are important parts of building scalable platforms for growth regionally, and increasingly globally,” he says.</p>
<p>Most of the multinational companies (MNCs) now operating in the East realise that it is not possible to run a global treasury to cover everything centrally out of one market, says Sawhney. “There is a huge amount of activity with companies opening RTCs to take advantage of the depth of the markets in terms of liquidity, currency and interest rates. There is also significant advantage in being in the same time zone.</p>
<p>“Asia is awash with liquidity and represents a big opportunity to run medium to long-term money at attractive prices”, he adds. Companies realise they can fund business from the liquidity pools in the regions where they are growing.</p>
<p>Sawhney cautions companies entering Eastern markets to ensure they understand the relevant regulatory and cultural environments. “The pace of change is so rapid in the region that what might have been best two years ago is no longer the case. I believe that this is why regional banks are gaining in importance – partnering with a local bank in each country is too unwieldy, so working with regional banks that have a strong footprint across countries is key.”</p>

Finding funding,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Khalid Quadir is a Bangladesh entrepreneur who was educated in the West and worked on Wall Street. He helped set up Grameenphone, Bangladesh’s largest mobile phone operator, which partnered with the well-known microfinance organisation, Grameen Bank. His latest venture is about providing Bangladesh companies with an alternative means of financing to help grow their businesses.</p>
<p>Quadir estimates that there are approximately 50 private commercial banks in Bangladesh. Large global banks like Citi and HSBC also have a presence, but he says the cost of bank financing is quite high – anywhere from 16% to 18%. “If you are a strong performing company growing between 15% and 20% a year, it is possible to operate at such a high financing cost, but in some ways you are working for the bank,” he says.</p>
<p>While most companies in Bangladesh rely on funds provided by friends and family, Quadir says there is only so far they can get using this form of financing. In a bid to provide Bangladesh companies with an alternative, Quadir in partnership with Patrik Brummer, the founder and chairman of Brummer &amp; Partners (the largest hedge fund group in the Nordic region), set up Bangladesh’s first private equity fund – the $88m Frontier Fund. It will make long-term investments in privately-owned family firms in Bangladesh that are looking to expand. Its equity investments range between $5m and $15m and target company’s in the country’s export, retail, manufacturing, agriculture, health, education, IT and services sectors.</p>
<p>Family-owned companies in Bangladesh were initially reluctant to relinquish equity to an outsider, but Quadir says a new generation of Asian entrepreneurs are becoming more open to alternative forms of financing.</p>
<h3 id=""awash-with-capital"">Awash with capital</h3>
<p>The picture that Quadir paints of companies in Bangladesh suggests somewhat of a dichotomy when it comes to funding growth in Asia. The commonly-held perception is that Asia is awash with capital from outside investors, banks and other financing vehicles – and there is certainly some truth in that. According to EuroFinance’s Treasury Verdict Asia 2013, more than 70% of Asian treasurers reported that longer-term funding was not a major issue and they did not foresee any problems accessing it in future.</p>
<p>“Asian companies have access to myriad sources of capital,” says an Account Officer with The CID Group, which is Taiwan’s largest venture capital (VC) firm. In addition to traditional bank loans, he says it is important to not overlook the ‘gray market’ and ‘black market’ loans. Although the cost of ‘gray’ loans can be as high as 10% a month, according to some reports, the Account Officer says these loans are trending up and serve a critical role for many local entrepreneurs. “Also, many entrepreneurs are funded by their family and friends,” he continues. “For factories and corporate suppliers, these tend to be the most utilised avenues of capital.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are two faces of Asia. There is all the exuberance of high growth rates but who in Asia is benefiting from that?”</p>
<p><cite>Steven Beck, Asian Development Bank (ADB)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>VC and angel investment is also growing in Asia. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with intellectual property (IP), the Account Officer says there is ample opportunity to raise venture investment. Tom Russell, co-founder of SeedAsia, one of the first Asian-based crowd-funding platforms to offer international investment opportunities in Chinese and South-East Asian technology start-ups, says is not too difficult for Chinese start-ups to obtain financing as there are a lot of VCs and private equity (PE) firms. Crowd-funding platforms like SeedAsia are relatively new to Asia though, and Russell says there are some cultural barriers to overcome. He says if they tried to introduce the platform five years ago, it probably wouldn’t have taken off. “But thanks to the global financial crisis, people now want to have more say in what they do with their money and don’t want to rely solely on banks,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""the-asian-dichotomy"">The Asian dichotomy</h3>
<p>But the funding picture starts to look a little less rosy for smaller companies that are not creditworthy, have no IP or other kinds of assets. Obtaining bank financing is hard for many entrepreneurs, says the Account Officer at The CID Group, as banks are used to lending against real estate assets. “For software or technology companies, it can be hard to get a loan. And if you are an Asian entrepreneur without connections, IP or real estate assets to securitise debt, they are often forced to grow organically.”</p>
<p>Outside of Singapore, Hong Kong and possibly Japan, unsecured lending is relatively scarce (most loans tend to be secured) and smaller companies tend to be rather constrained in their ability to borrow from banks, says John Chen, Treasury Director Asia Pacific at Honeywell. “These companies typically do not have access to the debt markets either.” The most common form of funding, says Chen, is through compression of collection and extension of payment terms. But as Asian businessmen are not necessarily open to disclosing their sources of funding, gaining an accurate assessment of their sources can be difficult.</p>
<h3 id=""plugging-the-trade-finance-gap"">Plugging the trade finance gap</h3>
<p>“There are two faces of Asia,” says Steven Beck, Head of Trade Finance, Private Sector Operations Department, Asian Development Bank (ADB). “There is all the exuberance of high growth rates, but who in Asia is benefiting from that? Then there is the other face of Asia that has yet to reap the benefits – countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia, which are very different from coastal cities in China and parts of India.” Beck says there is a clear link between the provision of trade finance, economic growth and jobs. But ADB’s trade finance survey of 147 banks and more than 500 companies in 4Q12 found that banks rejected a substantial percentage of requests to finance imports and exports. This meant that $1.6 trillion of demand for global trade finance was unmet, according to the ADB, with $425 billion not realised in developing Asia.</p>
<p>The ADB’s Trade Finance Programme (TFP) supports trade by assuming risk in 18 developing markets in Asia. Last year alone, Beck says it provided $4 billion in financing and more than 75% of its portfolio supported transactions involving SMEs. “If we didn’t support a lot of these transactions they probably wouldn’t end up getting done,” says Beck, “and as a result, there would be a lost opportunity to create more economic growth and jobs. This is the bread and butter of the global economy but it is often overlooked.” Beck says the banks have finite amounts of capital, which means they tend to focus more on core markets and clients, and typically that is not developing countries outside of the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China).</p>
<p>Another factor aggravating trade finance support is more stringent capital requirements under Basel III. Banks surveyed by the ADB indicated that they would reduce support to trade finance by approximately 13% if Basel III was fully implemented. Since the survey was concluded, the Basel Committee announced more lenient liquidity requirements, but it is still expected to have a negative impact.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered Global Research estimates that Basel III and European bank deleveraging will have a profound impact on the Asia ex-Japan (AXJ) corporate financing landscape. It predicts a $66 billion equity shortfall for the AJX banking system over the next five years, with India’s banking sector being the most capital-constrained. Over the next five years, it says there will be a cumulative financing gap for Asian corporates of around $340 billion.</p>
<h3 id=""the-rise-of-asias-bond-markets"">The rise of Asia’s bond markets</h3>
<p>As bank lending decreases, the hope is that local bond markets will help plug the corporate financing gap. In light of Basel III and European bank deleveraging, Standard Chartered estimates that there will be a tripling in size of the AXJ corporate bond market to more than $10 trillion by 2017 from just $ 3.3 trillion today – a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%. “Basel III has meant generally that lending has come down from the banks, so a lot of borrowers have turned to the bond market,” says Henrik Raber, Global Head of Debt Capital Markets at Standard Chartered. “Companies want to diversify their funding base, and the opportunities are quite attractive in terms of locking in longer-dated fixed funding.”</p>
<p>According to the ADB’s Asian Bond Monitor for 1Q13, emerging East Asian bond issuance expanded 12.1% year-on-year to $6.7 trillion at the end of March 2013, driven by double-digit growth in corporate bonds (19.5% year-on-year). Indonesia had the fastest growing corporate bond market in the region during the first quarter, expanding 27% year-on-year to $20 billion, followed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which had the region’s largest corporate bond market at $1.1 trillion, up 25% year-on-year. “Asian economies are growing fast and investors are interested in having exposure to currencies in the region – it is not seen as risky anymore,” says Thiam Hee Ng, Senior Economist with the ADB’s Office of Regional Economic Integration.</p>
<p>As a result of quantitative easing, the rise in US dollar liquidity is also spurring higher levels of US-dollar bond issuance by Asian companies. “Chinese companies are issuing US dollar bonds, even though their revenues are not in dollars, and then swapping the proceeds back into renminbi (RMB),” says Ng. By 2030, Standard Chartered forecasts the Asian bond markets could be larger than the US.</p>
<p>Asian bond markets are far from homogenous however, and different regulatory environments in each market means issuance is far from straightforward. “While Singapore, Hong Kong and the dim sum bond markets are akin to eurobond markets, if you move into Thai baht, foreign issuers need to get permission to apply,” Raber explains. Issuing bonds that can be marketed to investors regionally is also difficult, says Ng, as there is no unified regional bond market.</p>
<h3 id=""financing-the-supply-chain"">Financing the supply chain</h3>
<p>For SMEs that need a steady stream of financing in order to grow, issuing bonds may be too costly and time-consuming. Another option that is gaining ground in Asia is financing linked to trade flows between buyers and suppliers.</p>
<p>Since 2010, Sheung Li Fung Ltd., a Chinese garment manufacturer, has supplied Perry Ellis, a US international clothing company, using GT Nexus’s electronic trading platform. The platform automates the exchange of trade documents and information between suppliers in Asia and large buyers in the West. It also supports a range of financing options for suppliers. One option, which Sheung Li Fung uses, is the Coface Early Payment Programme, which provides payment protection services that reduce the risk of non-payment.</p>
<p>With the recent introduction of the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Global Trade Supplier Finance (GTSF) programme, which is integrated with the GT Nexus platform, Sheung Li Fung used the online financing service for two recent transactions with Perry Ellis. “The online financing service is much faster and easier when compared to factoring services with local banks,” says Kelly Lee, Accounting Manager, Sheung Li Fung. She is now able to get capital within one week after approval from the buyer and no paperwork is needed for the application. “Our ambition at GT Nexus is to democratise access to capital by connecting everyone in a cloud-based network,” explains Kurt Cavano, Chief Strategy Officer. “By bringing the buyer and supplier together, we can leverage the buyer’s good credit so the supplier can get immediate access to capital.”</p>
<p>Cavano says the financing GT Nexus provides is much cheaper than what companies could obtain normally. “More than 10,000 SMEs worldwide use our platform, 70% of which are in Asia,” he says, “and a third of them are taking financial services.” RTS Financial, a commercial financing company in Kansas City Indianapolis, uses the GT Nexus platform to provide financing for companies in countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and China. “We have many clients in Asia that have traditional banking relationships because, even if they have bank financing, there is a limit to how much they can obtain,” says Justin Goheen, Director of Business Development at RTS Financial. “In some cases, we replace traditional forms of bank financing. As long as the invoice and the receivables are good, we can provide financing.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In those countries where there is more competition and options for non-bank financing, Eugene Buckley, Vice President and General Manager Asia Pacific at PrimeRevenue, a web-based supply chain financing (SCF) platform, says companies are having to look at the best possible financing structures to keep pace with the competition. “There needs to be a greater understanding of the importance of supply chains,” he says. “Often companies in these markets are scraping together expensive sources of capital, but by participating in SCF programmes companies can obtain financing at rates they could only dream of if they were to go to their bank.”</p>
<p>SCF, however, is still a relatively new concept in Asia. “Most SCF programmed in the past were initiated by companies in the US or Europe that buy from companies in Asia,” explains Chetan Talwar, Head of Corporate Trade Advisory and Solution Delivery, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services.</p>
<p>Atlas Copco, an industrial group, recently rolled out a SCF programmes to strategic suppliers in three Asian markets: China, India and Japan. “We have many production companies in China (more than 15), as well as India and some in Japan,” says Audrey Deng, Head of Group Treasury, Asia Pacific at Atlas Copco. “They are very important to us and some of our suppliers can benefit from our scale and credit strength. Even if there are some existing funding channels from banks, SCF gives them more immediate access to funds.”</p>
<p>Atlas Copco uses its credit strength to help long-standing suppliers gain access to more affordable financing. “We don’t want money stuck in working capital,” says Deng. “More and more treasurers are becoming interested in this.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s Talwar says a SCF programme is linked to sales and is a much cheaper source of liquidity, but it can take time to get off the ground. He says a typical programme can be up and running in 12 months, and in certain jurisdictions suppliers may not sign up immediately. “It is not something that is applicable to all industries,” he says. “You need to have strong buyer/supplier relationships.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Significant changes in the relative size of the world’s economies will take place during the next 50 years, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In its November 2012 economic policy paper, ‘Looking to 2060: Long-term global growth prospects’, the OECD predicted that fast growth in China and India will soon make their combined gross domestic product (GDP) surpass that of the G7 economies and exceed that of the entire current OECD membership by 2060.</p>
<p>Growth in non-OECD countries will continue to outpace the OECD average during the period, although the difference will narrow over coming decades. From more than 7% per year over the past decade, non-OECD growth will decline to around 5% in the 2020s and to about half that by the 2050s, according to the report. Until 2020, China will have the highest growth rate among the countries included in the study, but will then be surpassed by both India and Indonesia. This partly reflects a more rapid decline in the working-age population, and consequently in labour force participation, in China rather than in India and Indonesia.</p>
<p>In the more immediate future, the OECD’s ‘Interim Assessment’ of the global economic outlook, published in March, confirms that growth of emerging economies remains much faster than that of advanced countries on average (albeit with significant differences across countries). The report predicts a return to “moderate growth” in the US during the first quarter of 2013, while a “meaningful recovery” is likely to take longer in Europe.</p>
<p>“Given the substantial share of the world economy now accounted for by emerging economies, they will again drive growth at the global level this year,” says the report. “Annualised growth in China is expected to continue to be well above 8% in the first half of 2013.”</p>
<p>The United Nation’s (UN) assessment of the global economy for the coming year is rather more downbeat than that of the OECD. Its ‘World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013’, published in December last year, highlights that economies in developing Asia “weakened considerably during 2012” as the region’s growth engines – China and India – shifted into lower gear. “While a significant deceleration in exports has been a key factor behind the slowdown, both economies also face a number of structural challenges that hamper growth,” states the report. “Given persistent inflationary pressures and large fiscal deficits, the scope for policy stimulus in India and other South Asian countries is limited.”</p>
<p>China and many East Asian economies, in contrast, possess much greater space for counter-cyclical policy. In the UN’s outlook, average growth in East Asia is forecast to pick up slightly to 6.2% in 2013, from the estimated 5.8% in 2012. GDP growth in South Asia is expected to average 5% in 2013, up from 4.4% in 2012, led by a moderate recovery of India’s economy.</p>
<p>While there may be differences in the details, it would be difficult to argue with the idea that developing – or emerging – economies are where the growth is. The moribund economic climates of many of the Eurozone countries, along with those of the UK and the US, do not present attractive platforms on which corporations can grow.</p>
<p>Data collected from purchasing managers across the Eurozone during March 2013 indicate a deepening of the downturn in the currency union, according to Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) published in April. Output and new orders fell at stronger rates, driving further job losses. PMIs fell in almost all countries, with a modest decline in Germany, accompanied by steep downturns in France, Spain and Italy.</p>
<h3 id=""east-asia-evolves"">East Asia evolves</h3>
<p>The austerity-hit developed economies stand in stark contrast to the vibrant and dynamic countries of the world’s Eastern hemisphere, which is characterised by younger populations and growth-friendly economic policies. In the past few years, the idea that the East was a region from which to source cheap labour, has given way to a realisation that it is also a region of other opportunities, with burgeoning consumer markets and in some cases very significant infrastructure projects under way.</p>
<p>“Asia is becoming the global engine of economic growth, a position further highlighted since the global financial crisis,” says Sameer Sawhney, Global Head of Transaction Banking, ANZ. “This growth is sustainable and an increasing number of Western corporations are looking to Asia as a key growth market for their businesses.”</p>
<p>For example, San Francisco-based GAP, one of the largest clothes retailers in the US, began an aggressive expansion into China in 2011 as part of a global strategy. The company plans to have around 45 outlets in China by the end of this year as it seeks to reduce its dependence on North America, where consumer confidence is volatile.</p>
<p>Diane S. Reyes, Global Head of Payments and Cash Management at HSBC, says the bank is “bullish” about China’s outlook; the country has been a key contributor to world economic growth and that looks set to continue with more than 7% GDP growth for 2013. “Firms that want to grow in the global economy should be involved in China and using the renminbi (RMB),” she says. “Currently, more than 10% of China’s international trade is settled in RMB, and by 2015 we expect that over one third of all international trade transactions with China will be denominated in RMB.”</p>
<p>As a very big consumer-oriented market, there are “tremendous” opportunities in China for retail companies to expand, but they need to understand the market and its settlement conditions, and potential complexities that vary city by city.</p>
<p>Reyes says the pace and scale of urbanisation in China is extraordinary. “This trend therefore provides significant opportunities for companies involved in infrastructure development as China continues to invest heavily in housing, transportation, telecommunications and other infrastructure projects to enable people to move into cities.”</p>
<p>In September 2012 China’s economic planning authority, the National Development and Reform Commission, announced approvals for 60 infrastructure projects worth a total of $150 billion. The projects include highways, ports and airport runways. Financial news service Bloomberg reported a surge in the share price of infrastructure companies around the world following the announcement, with Japanese and US companies recording significant jumps.</p>
<p>China is not the only country that is going for infrastructure growth as governments throughout the region instigate large-scale projects. The Indonesian government, for example, has announced plans to float tenders for several medium-to-large infrastructure projects worth $7.6 billion in 2013. The move, aimed at boosting economic growth, will cover projects such as toll roads and dams, construction of which is expected to begin by 3Q13. In Vietnam, the government has announced a large project to build a high capacity electrical transmission line for 437kms across a number of provinces and through to Ho Chi Minh City in the south. It aims to ensure electricity supply to the southern areas of the country by 2014-2015, as well as power grid connectivity across Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia by 2015.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-china"">Beyond China</h3>
<p>It is not just China and India that represent opportunities in the East. In a 2011 report, ‘The Time for Regional Expansion is Now’, Accenture identified South-East Asia as an emerging prime business destination in Asia. Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam offer multinationals new markets in which to pursue growth, the report says. After India and China, South-East Asia is regarded as the third pillar of Asia as a whole.</p>
<p>Accenture says the region is perceived to be a long-term destination that will remain on the periphery of an Asian strategic agenda for a majority of businesses outside the region, but at the centre of expansion plans for native businesses seeking growth closer to home.</p>
<p>“We believe businesses that position themselves now for growth in South-East Asia will be rewarded by finding themselves in the middle of a new ‘centre of gravity’ within future high-growth markets,” says the report. “South-East Asia has the clear potential to become an alternate hub to China within the Asian region. It offers new opportunities for international companies and can act as a launch pad for local businesses seeking to become regional or global leaders.”</p>
<p>Businesses that are gravitating towards expansion into South-East Asia should focus on four key imperatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adopt a regional mindset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop strong partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt from the core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move with agility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of its sheer scale China dwarfs every other country in the region, says Sawhney. But from a strategy point of view, other markets of interest include Indonesia, the Philippines, India and Vietnam. “These markets are growing exponentially and have stable political and regulatory environments and are hungry for foreign investment.”</p>
<p>Domestic markets in the East are becoming more vibrant; India has a population of 1.3 billion and Indonesia has 230 million people. “We are moving away from the term ‘emerging market’ to one of ‘growth market’,” says Sawhney. “While these markets may not yet be a big part of a company’s P&amp;L, they will be in the future. In Vietnam, for example, 65% of the population are under the age of 20.”</p>
<h3 id=""challenges"">Challenges</h3>
<p>Expanding into Eastern markets is not without its challenges, of course. “Asia today is very much like Europe of the 1980s and 1990s – it has many different markets, economies, currencies and taxation regimes,” says Richard Jaggard, Managing Director and Head of Transaction Banking Europe, Standard Chartered. “Corporate treasurers’ first challenge is how to manage such complexity – many have gone down the regional treasury route, others are managing Asia from their European or US headquarters. As their scale of business grows in Asia, treasurers realise they have to put more high quality resources into the region in order to manage the increased complexities and risks that come with commercial growth.”</p>
<p>Corporates want to use the structures they have developed in the West and blend them into Asia, says Jaggard. For example, they are looking to ‘bolt on’ Asian operations to the liquidity structures they have developed in Europe. This will enable them to centralise cash from the region – some are doing this via a regional treasury centre (RTC), others are looking to integrate into a global structure. For non-mobile liquidity, corporates are focused on in-country efficiency via approaches such as yield enhancement based on aggregated positions within the region.</p>
<p>ANZ’s Sawhney says there are changes afoot in Eastern markets that make them very interesting for corporate treasurers. “In the past Asia was a factory for the world with uni-directional flow to the West, as companies sourced from Asia. There was no significant currency risk as the majority of transactions were in US dollar or euro. Now, however, there is increasingly a two-way flow as companies look to supply to Asian markets. Funding flow and allocating capital are becoming key differentiators.”</p>
<h3 id=""rmb-strategies"">RMB strategies</h3>
<p>Corporations looking to do business in the East will at some stage have to develop a strategy for China’s currency. “The internationalisation of the RMB is posing issues for corporate treasurers to work through in terms of managing investments and cash,” says Sawhney. “To date there are still only three fully convertible Asian currencies – the Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar and Japanese yen. The biggest growing markets in the East – China and India – do not have open currencies.”</p>
<p>HSBC’s Reyes says the Chinese regulators are looking to ease currency inflows so corporates can raise RMB funding in Hong Kong or another market, and use that to fund projects in China. This will help corporates to limit their foreign exchange (FX) exposures. “A challenge when dealing with the RMB is whether to go onshore, with accounts in China, or offshore in Hong Kong, for example,” she says.</p>
<p>Jaggard says a significant challenge for corporations doing business in China is what to do with the cash they generate there. “During the past few months the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBoC) has taken a few more steps in its RMB liberalisation programme, such as the ability to make short-term foreign currency loans. This will help.”</p>
<p>In April, Australia became the third country, after the US and Japan, to seal a currency deal with China. It means the Australian dollar can be converted directly into RMB. China is Australia’s main trading partner, with exports and imports totalling A$120 billion in the last financial year.</p>
<p>A survey of 500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Australia, conducted by HSBC, found that 40% of companies importing from or exporting to China intend to settle transactions in RMB during the coming year. The currency deal between Australia and China will reduce costs, as firms will no longer have to convert via the US dollar. According to the survey, 31% of SMEs plan to use both US dollar and RMB, and 13% intend to exclusively use the Chinese currency. “Given China represents over 20% of our current trade and is expected to grow by 8.5% per annum to 2020, the RMB’s role within Australian trade will inevitably rise,” said HSBC Bank Australia Head of Business Banking, Paul Edgar, in a statement. “It is clear from the survey that Australian SMEs are getting ahead of the curve.”</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-strategies"">Treasury strategies</h3>
<p>Growth rates in the faster growing economies are very attractive, but treasurers realise they need to develop efficient infrastructure that will support growth, says Jaggard. “Centralisation through the development of skills centres, such as RTCs, provides the opportunity to identify and manage financial risk, while shared service centres (SSCs) focused on accounting and payments provide processing efficiency gains as well as quality in information management. Both are important parts of building scalable platforms for growth regionally, and increasingly globally,” he says.</p>
<p>Most of the multinational companies (MNCs) now operating in the East realise that it is not possible to run a global treasury to cover everything centrally out of one market, says Sawhney. “There is a huge amount of activity with companies opening RTCs to take advantage of the depth of the markets in terms of liquidity, currency and interest rates. There is also significant advantage in being in the same time zone.</p>
<p>“Asia is awash with liquidity and represents a big opportunity to run medium to long-term money at attractive prices”, he adds. Companies realise they can fund business from the liquidity pools in the regions where they are growing.</p>
<p>Sawhney cautions companies entering Eastern markets to ensure they understand the relevant regulatory and cultural environments. “The pace of change is so rapid in the region that what might have been best two years ago is no longer the case. I believe that this is why regional banks are gaining in importance – partnering with a local bank in each country is too unwieldy, so working with regional banks that have a strong footprint across countries is key.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Western multinational companies (MNCs) have become somewhat accustomed to the establishment of regional treasury centres (RTCs) in and outside of their home markets. Their Asian contemporaries have, so far, been somewhat more reticent. That distinction may be abating. With Asian giants Sony, Huawei and Lenovo, to name just three, already having made this leap, what are the options, difficulties and regional trends surrounding this development?</p>
<p>Singapore leads the field in terms of a location for a RTC and this does not seem likely to change anytime soon. Some of the world’s largest companies, including DuPont and DHL, have already located their RTC in Singapore. Unilever has taken its treasury operations a step further by consolidating its former RTCs into a global infrastructure for operational treasury activities, called global treasury operations (GTO). The cornerstone of this infrastructure is the World Treasury Centre (WTC) in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. In the WTC, all daily funding, investment, liquidity and foreign exchange (FX) management activities are executed with internal group companies and external counterparts.</p>
<p>In Treasury Today’s 2012 Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study (<a href=""#chart-2-which-locations-do-you-see-emerging-as-the-preferred-locations-for-sub-regional-treasury-centres-for-the-greater-china-region"">see Chart 2</a>), 51% of Asian corporates surveyed cited Singapore as the preferred location for sub/regional treasury centres for the Greater China region, with Shanghai coming in second at 46%, Hong Kong third at 43% and Beijing last with just 7%.</p>
<p>The same study also asked respondents about their anticipated timeline for the CNH/CNY actively being used for inter-company and third-party trade settlements (see Chart 1), which is an important consideration for any company establishing a RTC in the region with interests in China. Over 60% of respondents think this will happen within the next three years.</p>

<p>Traditionally Asian MNCs with a strong global presence were to be found based in Japan and Korea. Taking a closer look at the first example, Japanese MNCs were historically inclined to practice a far lower level of treasury centralisation than Western MNCs. In 2005, Japanese car manufacturer Nissan established a RTC in Singapore, yet Nissan’s Japanese contemporaries did not exactly rush to follow them. However, Gourang Shah, Citi’s Head of Treasury Advisory for Asia Pacific, says that “this reticence is being put under pressure by the strong competition that Japan is now facing from China, Taiwan and Korea. As a result of this, Japanese corporates are increasingly looking to centralise their treasury operations and today corporates from China and India and to a lesser degree other Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, are expanding their global footprint.”</p>

<p>With the expansion of these countries comes an increasing interest in RTCs. The lure of a more cost effective and operationally efficient treasury department drives this interest, yet there is a level at which a company must be before they are ready for this step. Margaret Yao, Regional Sales Executive, Asia Pacific, Treasury Services, J.P. Morgan, notes, “in order to be able to go down the RTC road, these companies require senior sponsorship to drive the evolution and ensure a seamless re-engineering of their internal workflows, as well as have an ongoing commitment to investing in common ERP (enterprise resource planning) and TMS (treasury management systems).”</p>
<p>What should be done by these companies before they can be truly ready? Although there isn’t a one-rule-fits-all guide there are some generic indicators. “Lots of Asian companies still need to work on their treasury function, such as cash concentration, improving visibility and access to cash,” says Francois-Dominique Doll, Product Specialist, SunGard AvantGard. “Although it varies on a case-by-case basis, I would agree there are many areas for improvement, but they are catching up very quickly. European and US companies took five to ten years to transform their treasuries, whereas Asian companies are looking to achieve this within two years.”</p>
<p>Asian treasurers are well aware of best practice techniques. Even companies that haven’t centralised or transformed their treasury are aware of what is out there. However, this does require buy-in from top-level management as well as from the operating subsidiaries. “If they really want to remove any inefficiencies and improve working capital management, they will need to release resources in order to achieve that goal,” says Doll.</p>
<p>In Asia there are many restrictions in moving cash from one country to another and each country follows different policies in terms of cash management. Lenovo’s Treasurer, Damian Glendinning, explains that having cross-border loans is a major issue for corporates as many countries have FX rules. “When it comes to Asia, countries with no exchange controls are the exception rather than the rule,” he says. Only the Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar and Hong Kong dollar are easily convertible outside of their respective home markets.</p>

<h5 id=""a-typical-regional-treasury-centre-will-perform-some-or-all-of-the-following-functions"">A typical regional treasury centre will perform some or all of the following functions:</h5>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""where-to-go"">Where to go</h3>
<p>The reality is that there are few countries in Asia that offer the depth and open markets needed by RTCs. Historically choices have been – and still are – Singapore and Hong Kong. Shanghai is emerging as a third alternative, yet with FX controls remaining in place it is not necessarily an ideal location unless a corporate’s operations are solely in China. Australia used to be one of the first choices for corporates, given the language and the Western culture. However, its physical distance from the rest of Asia has resulted in many relocating their RTCs to either Singapore or Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Singapore will continue to be an attractive centre for MNCs due to its proximity to India and South-East Asian markets and its successful track record in market development, such as the derivative market and fund management industry. The nation’s English language proficiency remains its competitive advantage and its AAA sovereign rating is an important selling point in its establishment as a wealth management centre. The government is strongly committed to high-end management education and actively encourages employment of expatriates to mitigate possible talent gaps and support future growth.</p>
<p>Singapore has a deep and liquid FX market, an excellent pool of well-educated labour, and world class transport and telecommunications infrastructure. Over the past ten years the number of RTCs located in Singapore has grown steadily, with a surge in numbers since 2008.</p>
<p>The city state’s attractive tax benefits are a strong pull, particularly the many double taxation agreements (DTAs) they have negotiated with their trading partners. And, of course, Singapore is the region’s pre-eminent banking centre with a wide mix of readily spoken languages.</p>
<p>Up-and-coming, Shanghai has set a timetable to achieve international financial centre status by 2020. It is already the centre for the domestic renminbi (RMB) financial market in terms of the size of both the equity and bond markets. The volume of international cross-border flows is subject to the timetable of the liberalisation of the capital account. Currently the intermediation of capital outflow is through the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDII) scheme. Significant developments in the Shanghai financial markets are anticipated in the years to come.</p>
<p>Hong Kong can claim many of the same advantages as Singapore. Its currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is pegged to its US counterpart. It operates a ‘benign’ tax regime and a concentration of the world’s leading banks. It is home to over 1,300 bank branches and over 200 authorised institutions. These include a number of investment banks, which serve the debt capital markets. In 2009, Hong Kong’s banking infrastructure was updated and the SWIFTNet system replaced the previous high value clearing system, the Clearing House Automated Transfer System (CHATS).</p>
<p>For cash concentration activities, both Singapore, with its finance and treasury centre (FTC) incentives, and Hong Kong, have withholding tax on interest waivers but, for lending money, the applicable withholding tax rule is from the country that pays interest. Hence, DTAs help with withholding taxes.</p>
<p>An additional issue is the maturity of the infrastructure offered and the presence of a financial hub, which comes with service providers such as banks, tax and legal experts.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Acarate and former Vice President Treasury at Huawei, David Blair says he is seeing many Asian MNCs from South-East Asia, China and India setting up international treasury centres and RTCs in Singapore. “Motives vary but essentially they are looking for a real international financial centre not far from home,” he explains. Companies will often opt to set up RTCs in China or India if there is a large enough domestic presence to justify doing so.</p>
<p>Similarly, Hong Kong comes up as the preferred location for a RTC for North Asian companies, but observers note that more often than not, after the initial move to Hong Kong, even these companies prefer to relocate to Singapore for tax reasons.</p>
<p>Lenovo’s Glendinning adds an interesting note to the decision-making process stating that the criteria is often not based on hard logic. There is always a human element when deciding whether to set up a RTC and where. The human element is highlighted in the table which shows an interesting comparison between Europe and Asia in terms of the number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) employed in the treasury department. This perhaps illustrates the benefits of establishing a RTC. Almost 75% of respondents to the European Study were regional treasuries in Europe and just over half employ just one to four FTEs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, whilst the establishment of a RTC, whether it is South-East Asia, China, India or Eastern Europe for that matter, requires sound technology, systems, people and robust banking partners. Treasurers should not underestimate the legal implications. The scope and jurisdiction of any RTC structure will impact its legal constitution so time spent thinking about the framework of an RTC is time well spent and vital to its ongoing success.</p>
<p>Another consideration for the location of RTCs is the legal system and its workings. Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia are common law systems, with precedence and transparency, and the courts, lawyers and judges are all independent of the government. China meanwhile is rapidly developing its legal framework but still has a way to go before the same levels of legal protection exist as with other international financial centres. A common legal framework is very important to protect financial transactions and structures that cross borders.</p>
<p>The objective pros and cons are not the only consideration; there is usually a fair amount of politics involved, personal preferences and agendas that can influence the final decision. If the hurdles can be overcome however, with the right structure and location the benefits can be worth the pain.</p>
<p>Finally, the environment also needs some attention and banks need to respond if they are to attract the cash management mandates of companies operating in the region. Here is just a small selection of the responses from RTCs in the region when asked: “What improvements should your service provider(s) be delivering?”</p>

<p>Following its independence from Malaysia in August 1965, Singapore, which was then a third-world nation with poor infrastructure, limited capital and most importantly no natural resources, had to develop a plan to steer its economy.</p>
<p>In a bid to create jobs in the early 1960s, the government set up the Jurong Industrial Estate – the first of many – and the Economic Development Board (EDB) with a $100m budget to woo foreign investors. These two events marked the start of Singapore’s path to industrialisation.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, the EDB shifted its focus from manufacturing to new key industries – chemicals, electronics and engineering, as well as funding growth in biomedical sciences.</p>
<p>The Singaporean government is once again in the process of restructuring its economy, this time to ensure growth is anchored in productivity and innovation in the mid to long term.</p>
<p>The 2013 budget builds on the restructuring measures put in place since 2010, with additional initiatives for businesses to upgrade, create better jobs and raise wages.</p>
<p>For the fourth consecutive year, Singapore has unveiled restrictions on foreign labour, with total workforce growth targeted to ease to 1%-2% annually through 2020, compared with an average 3.3% per annum over the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Foreign labour policies were tightened further through higher foreign worker levies, dependency ratio ceilings and more stringent eligibility requirements for certain passes, with the least productive sectors that rely most heavily on low-skilled foreign workers being hit the hardest.</p>
<p>“The foreign workforce can’t keep growing faster than the local workforce, not indefinitely,” Singapore’s Finance Minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, told Bloomberg in March. “That’s why our most important economic and social strategy is that of raising productivity to a new level.”</p>
<p>Wrapping up the March 2013 budget debate in parliament, Shanmugaratnam warned that economic restructuring will be painful but it cannot be put off any longer, arguing that Singapore was at a critical point in transition and that the push for a restructure was not just an economic issue but also a key social pillar.</p>
<p>“If we do not achieve momentum in the next three years, there’s a real risk that we will be in exactly the same position as today. Both workers and businesses will be worse off,” he told parliament.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the budget’s two priorities – economic restructuring and society inclusivity – he said that productivity growth has been weak and that 2011’s 2.6% decline was “miserable”.</p>
<p>Manu Bhaskaran, Founding Director and CEO of Centennial Asia Advisors, says, “Singapore is moving towards a productivity-driven growth model, settling for lower growth but higher quality. This in the sense of the impact on income distribution and opportunities for Singaporeans, as opposed to foreign workers, etc.”</p>
<p>He says this entails stricter controls on immigration, especially low-skilled workers and semi-professionals, coupled with several government incentives for businesses to upgrade and move up the value chain.</p>
<p>Citi’s Head of Treasury Advisory for Asia Pacific, Gourang Shah, agrees. “Singapore used to be an electronic manufacturing centre but it was forced to move up the value chain. It has to constantly innovate to keep its developed world status and stay one step ahead of the others.”</p>
<p>David Blair, Managing Director of Acarate in Singapore and the former Vice President, Treasury of Huawei, notes that the government remains committed to the finance sector, including treasury and is consciously trying to make Singapore more attractive for locating regional treasury centres (RTCs).</p>
<p>“A potential issue that has been covered recently in the press has been that by limiting the number of work permits the country runs the risk of making it harder to get expatriates into the country. However, these constraints are mainly placed on low-end service jobs and Singapore remains committed to high value-add finance jobs.”</p>
<p>However, Blair concedes that work permit applications are now taking on average a couple of months to process instead of a few weeks, as in the past.</p>
<h3 id=""economy"">Economy</h3>
<p>According to a report published in March 2013 by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore’s real GDP grew by 1.3% in 2012. On a quarterly basis, it grew 1.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, after registering zero growth in the third quarter. According to latest estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, GDP in the first quarter of 2013 was a year-on-year contraction of 0.6%. MAS has forecasted a growth of 1%-3% for 2013, supported by domestic-oriented activities and some recovery in the sectors reliant on external demand. Activity is expected to remain modest in the first half, especially in the externally-exposed industries, before picking up in the latter half of the year, in tandem with the strengthening of the global economy.</p>

<p>However, domestic-oriented activities are likely to remain firm, with the construction sector expected to see significant expansion in 2013, in view of a strong pipeline of projects awarded over the past years. This could create positive spillover effects for activities such as bank lending and real estate services.</p>

<p>Inflation is forecast at 3.5%-4.5%, underpinned by firm accommodation and private road transport costs. However, if these two items are excluded, MAS expects that core inflation will be around 2%-3%.</p>
<p>The government estimates casinos contribute 1.5%-2% of GDP and employ 22,400 people. It has subsequently generated new revenue through taxes on gaming, accounting for 2.2% of total operating revenue, according to the Financial Times.</p>
<h3 id=""sovereign-ratings"">Sovereign ratings</h3>
<p>Singapore is the only Asian country to have AAA credit ratings from all three major credit rating agencies – Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P), Moody’s and Fitch.</p>
<p>In affirming the AAA rating with a stable outlook in March this year, Fitch says the ratings are underpinned by Singapore’s strong sovereign balance sheet that serves to insulate the small and open economy from external shocks. Sustained fiscal surpluses have $259.3 billion – equivalent to 5.4 months of current external payments and 65.2% of broad money supply at the end of 2012.</p>
<p>The sovereign’s large current account surplus has been a main driver for sustained accumulation of foreign exchange (FX) reserves. The country is one of the largest net external creditors (in sovereign, bank and non-bank sectors) among AAA peers. Furthermore, its net international investment position reached 276% of GDP in 2011, the highest among AAA sovereigns.</p>
<p>Fitch however notes that although Singapore’s ratings are supported by strong economic performance, underpinned by an attractive investment environment, a low tax regime and high quality public institutions, as a small open economy, Singapore’s economic growth is more volatile than the AAA range median and is more exposed to global economic cycles.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, Singapore has demonstrated its capacity to weather economic volatility, helped by its fiscal flexibility,” said Fitch.</p>
<p>In its credit rating report last year, Moody’s warns that challenges facing the country include containing consumer price and property inflation over the near term, and fostering a growth model that is driven by productivity and innovation over the longer term.</p>
<h3 id=""double-taxation-agreements-and-free-trade-agreements"">Double taxation agreements and free trade agreements</h3>
<p>Singapore has 69 comprehensive double taxation agreements (DTAs) and seven limited DTAs in force. Limited DTAs are restricted to tax exemption on income derived from international shipping and/or air services.</p>
<p>Singapore’s network of free trade agreements (FTAs) covers 18 regional and bilateral FTAs with 24 trading partners. These include the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), with the US, India, China and Japan, among others.</p>
<p>Blair says what matters for RTCs are tax treaties and reduced withholding taxes, and these often go with FTAs. “Singapore is very strong in this respect. It is better than Hong Kong, which is viewed by many states as a tax pariah and therefore has less tax treaties,” he says.</p>
<p>The MAS also has cross-border collateral arrangements (CBCAs) with Bank Negara Malaysia, Bank of Thailand, Bank of England, Banque de France, Bundesbank, De Nederlandsche Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Prior to these arrangements, MAS accepted only securities issued by AAA rated entities. By broadening the collateral pool to include foreign currency-denominated collateral, MAS now accepts certain kinds of collateral issued by entities with lower credit ratings but it applies larger haircuts.</p>
<p>Bhaskaran says Singapore’s multiple trade and economic partnership agreements have improved its competitiveness as a hub for global companies to base themselves to serve Asian growth.</p>
<p>“The gradual progress in ASEAN economic integration through AFTA in the past and soon through the ASEAN Economic Community will help, as will our economic links with Malaysia through the Iskandar region in southern Malaysia, which is being increasingly linked to the Singaporean economy with benefits for both countries.”</p>
<h3 id=""financial-sector"">Financial sector</h3>
<p>Singapore remains ranked fourth best financial centre, together with London, New York and Hong Kong, according to the Global Financial Centres Index 2013 (GFCI) released in March this year. Hong Kong and Singapore are now only two points apart, whereas there is a 48-point difference between London in the top spot and Singapore in the fourth spot.</p>
<p>In the GFCI’s list of questions, Singapore drew the most number of mentions as a centre that is likely to become more significant, followed by Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul.</p>
<p>In 2012, the finance and insurance sector in Singapore grew by a modest 0.5%, much lower than the 8.9% recorded in 2011, due to weak performance in sentiment sensitive segments such as FX trading and stockbroking, according to Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry.</p>
<p>Singapore’s FX market saw an average daily turnover of $337 billion in 2012, largely unchanged from 2011. Trading in major currencies such as the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen continued to dominate the market with the euro/US dollar pair registering the highest trading volume.</p>
<p>In 2012, the derivatives market activity in the Singapore Exchange rose by 11% to 80 million contracts. Total options trading volume rose by 126% and total futures trading volume grew by 7.9% to five million option contracts and 75 million futures contracts respectively from 2011.</p>
<p>In its 2012 Financial Stability Review, published in November last year, MAS says Singapore’s economy and financial system have been resilient through the global financial crisis, with growth having slowed significantly. However, it says growth is still expected to be positive in 2013.</p>
<p>“Financial markets have remained stable despite financial fragilities and persistent macroeconomic uncertainties globally. Concerns over liquidity and counterparty credit risks have been muted in the domestic inter-bank market, while confidence in Singapore Government Securities remains high,” said the report.</p>
<p>The MAS expects interest rates to continue to remain low, but warns that there is a risk that expectations of low interest rates for the foreseeable future will become entrenched. It cautions that while Singapore dollar funding for domestic lending remains adequate, non-Singapore dollar funding risk should be closely monitored especially since non-Singapore dollar loan growth has outpaced non-Singapore dollar deposit over the past year. “A sudden spike in global risk aversion could trigger stresses in global US dollar liquidity, with adverse knock-on effects on the Singapore banking system.”</p>
<p>The central bank says corporates are more leveraged now than they were a year ago, and although they seem well-positioned to cover their interest expense, this could change if interest rates rise significantly.</p>
<p>Fund raising in other corporate finance markets rose, with large firms issuing twice the amount of debt in the first three quarters of 2012 compared to the previous year.</p>
<h3 id=""currency-interchangeability-and-rmb-clearing"">Currency interchangeability and RMB clearing</h3>
<p>Three countries – Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei – adopted a system of free interchangeability of their respective currencies on 12<sup>th</sup> June 1967. Malaysia bowed out in 1973, but Brunei and Singapore decided to continue with the arrangement which is still in force today.</p>
<p>Under the arrangement, both countries undertake to accept the currency issued by the other and to exchange them at par, without charge, into their own currency.</p>
<p>The MAS says this arrangement can be viewed as a “currency union between two countries characterised by a one-for-one exchange rate of their currencies and a joint (but managed) float against all other currencies.”</p>
<p>The central bank says the two currencies serve as a medium of exchange, as direct payment in trade and investment between the two countries, thereby reducing conversion costs. It also eliminates exchange-rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>In April this year, the MAS and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on renminbi (RMB) business co-operation.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, MAS and PBoC will co-operate closely in reviewing the conduct of RMB businesses and clearing arrangements in Singapore. The two central banks also agree to establish a regular dialogue to review RMB liquidity conditions and discuss issues concerning the stability of the RMB market.</p>
<p>In addition, the PBoC signed an RMB Clearing Agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Singapore branch in February, allowing the branch to provide RMB clearing services to participating banks and their customers for the next five years.</p>
<h3 id=""payment-and-settlement-systems"">Payment and settlement systems</h3>
<h4 id=""meps"">MEPS+</h4>
<p>In order for Singapore to be a key financial hub, according to Ying Siew Ang, Head of Transaction Services in ASEAN, J.P. Morgan, it needed to leverage on operational efficiency and productivity, making sure that all payments are executed seamlessly, and allowing corporates to see payments or receipts almost instantly. Hence it developed MAS Electronic Payment System (MEPS+), which began operating in December 2006 and provides several improved features over its predecessor, MEPS.</p>
<p>MEPS+ offerings includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use of SWIFT message formats and networks. This allows for greater straight through processing and cost savings by banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced queue management capabilities which help participants to better manage settlement risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated collateralised intraday liquidity facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated gridlock detection and resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""cls"">CLS</h4>
<p>Continuous Linked Settlement System (CLS), a global multicurrency settlement system, went live in September 2002 and initially settled FX transactions in seven major currencies – the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, yen, pound sterling, Swiss franc and the US dollar. The Singapore dollar was added in 2003, together with the Danish krone, Norwegian krone and Swedish krona. FX trades involving the Singapore dollar and other CLS currencies can now be settled in CLS without exposure to FX settlement risks.</p>
<p>For efficiency, three local banks – DBS Bank, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) and United Overseas (UOB), who are CLS shareholders – established the Clearing and Payment Services Pte (CAPS), a common clearing utility to process their CLS transactions.</p>
<h4 id=""singapore-ach"">Singapore ACH</h4>
<p>The Singapore Clearing House Association (SCHA) was formed in December 1980, as an association to establish, manage and administer clearing services and facilities for cheques as well as debit and credit items of its members. In addition to MAS, at the end of 2010, it had 46 ordinary members and 51 associate members. The SCHA provides Singapore dollar cheque clearing, US dollar cheque clearing and inter-bank Giro clearing services through the automated clearing house (ACH). J.P. Morgan’s Ang says inter-bank Giro payments comprise 56% of the local ACH, with the remaining 44% in cheques.</p>
<h4 id=""cheques"">Cheques</h4>
<p>Both Singapore dollar denominated cheques and US dollar cheques presented to and drawn on banks in Singapore, are cleared through the Cheque Truncation System (CTS). For US dollar cheques to be cleared in ACH, both the presenting and paying banks must be participants of ACH.</p>
<h4 id=""inter-bank-giro"">Inter-bank Giro</h4>
<p>Inter-bank Giro (IBG) was enhanced in July 2001 to a browser-based eGiro system, which allows participants to send and receive Giro items, including returned and rejected items, electronically via a secured communication network. With eGiro, clearing cycles for the direct credit and debit transactions are shortened significantly.</p>
<h3 id=""financial-institutions"">Financial institutions</h3>
<p>Commercial banks operate as full banks, wholesale banks or offshore banks. As of April 2013, there were a total of 123 commercial banks operating in Singapore. Commercial banks, licensed and governed under the Banking Act, may undertake universal banking. In addition to commercial banking, they may carry other businesses regulated or authorised by MAS, including financial advisory services, insurance broking and capital market services. They are however barred from engaging in non-financial activities.</p>
<p>There are three local banks in Singapore, with the biggest being DBS, followed by OCBC and UOB. Prior to the consolidation of the local banking industry in Singapore, some banks had already established a footprint in Asia, according to J.P. Morgan’s Ang; however, the expansion increased significantly after the consolidation. DBS, which bought Kwong On Bank and later Dao Heng Bank in Hong Kong, is now focusing more on the North Asia market, while OCBC is looking into the South Asia market and UOB is looking at both.</p>
<p>Full banks with Qualifying Full Bank privileges may operate in a total of 25 locations. Wholesale banks can offer the same range of banking businesses as full banks but cannot carry out Singapore dollar retail banking activities.</p>
<p>Offshore banks can engage in the same activities as full and wholesale banks for businesses transacted through their Asian Currency Units, which banks use to book all their foreign currency transactions conducted in the Asian Dollar Market. The banks’ Singapore dollar transactions are separately booked in the Domestic Banking Unit.</p>
<p>Fitch, in a statement in March, notes that domestic banks maintain solid asset quality and are well-capitalised, with a non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 1.2% and core Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 12%-13% as of end 2012.</p>
<p>The credit rating agency says risks related to a potential build-up of a property bubble, spurred by prolonged negative real interest rates and optimistic prospects for Asia, led the authorities to introduce a seventh round of property cooling measures in January this year. These measures, together with the banks’ strong standalone strength and healthy household balance sheets, mitigate downside risks for the domestic banking sector.</p>
<p>“The system may face more risks from growing exposure to high growth markets such as China, India and Indonesia, but this is not a material risk in the near term,” Fitch says.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h3>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s Ang says, given that Singapore has no FX controls, various kinds of cash management techniques are used, whether physical cash concentration or notional pooling. “It all comes down to how well known the technique is in the market and how comfortable the corporate is in applying these techniques as each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. It also depends on the corporate’s appetite and what they require.”</p>
<p>She says both physical cash concentration and notional pooling have been in the market for a very long time, but notional pooling is not as well known or researched. “There are also tax implications that need to be considered by the corporates and, as such, some companies tend to favour one technique over the other. But having said that, all the techniques are available in Singapore and there is no regulatory limitation as to which technique is being applied.”</p>
<p>Blair agrees that the country is open from a tax, legal and regulatory perspective. Because of that, Singapore is the most popular hub in Asia for cash concentration arrangements like zero balance account, sweeping and pooling.</p>
<p>“Singapore is Asia’s largest derivative centre and especially strong in FX, so it is excellent for financial risk management,” says Blair.</p>

Conquering talent challenges in Asia,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Scarce treasury talent with the right specific treasury skills and knowledge in addition to multi-country experience is an issue for organisations operating in the East, says Marie-Astrid Dubois, Assistant Treasurer, EMEA and Asia at Honeywell. “While highly qualified professionals can be found in financial centres such as Singapore and Hong Kong and some relief is provided by returning students or migrations from Western countries to Asian countries, the talent pool is proving too small for the large corporations and domestic firms to fish from.”</p>
<h3 id=""an-unique-landscape"">An unique landscape</h3>
<p>The disparity across the various countries that make up the Asian continent exacerbates this challenge. This fragmentation of culture and conflicting stages of development across the Asian landscape can have a negative impact on employee engagement – for existing staff and talent that a company is trying to attract. The skills and requirements of individuals from different countries is difficult to discern, says Joseph Lee, Treasury Director, Asia Pacific Japan and Africa at Hewlett-Packard (HP), so it’s important not to rely on a one-size-fits-all retention programme in Asia. “In Singapore, for example, it would be easier to retain staff with a programme that allows them to work at home, as a work/life balance is a priority in this country. Emerging economies like Indonesia, on the other hand, are likely to have staff attracted by high pay scales than any other incentive.”</p>
<p>A generic approach to talent management in the region could therefore prove rather futile. What is effective for a company based or headquartered in Asia would likely be considerably different to a Western-based multinational. So attracting and retaining talent may need a different approach, according to Sharon Miles, Director at Spencer Stuart, and treasury talent is no different. “The risks, challenges and opportunities in global markets and Asia in particular, over recent years mean that corporates and their boards are revising and analysing their treasury agenda and their hiring strategies. They are determining what the most appropriate solution for their own circumstances is – particularly one that is effective across all jurisdictions in the region.”</p>
<p>Another obvious trend and challenge when it comes to hiring and retaining talent is the fierce competition between multinational companies (MNCs) and domestic firms. Fishing from the same pool of resources, MNCs and local organisations are striving to make their available roles and company more attractive and high potential candidates are in the advantageous position of choosing a suitable role after weighing up the pros and cons of each offer. The MNCs will likely win out in this battle, according to Lee, as they are capable of offering roles based on individual skills, plus the ability to cross various breadths of functions is much higher for career-minded staff within a multinational firm. “If we look at the graduate recruitment exercises that typically occur in many countries across Asia, MNCs have a higher success rate at recruiting the top 10% of graduating cohort from prestigious schools than domestic firms.”</p>
<p>“That is testament to the lure of an MNC over a domestic company. Domestic companies usually compete for the next level in the resource pool and this is proving quite a challenge for these firms looking to attract the best talent.”</p>
<p>Adding to the concern of these local corporates is the increasing inclination for MNCs to hire from the region itself, rather than bring expat talent into Asia (Dubois’ entire Asian team is recruited locally for example). Furthermore, from the perspective of ambitious talent facing this choice, experience gained in a global corporation can prove invaluable when interested in climbing the career ladder, says Miles. “While talent is always a high priority, extremely high value is placed on experience and especially experience gained in blue chip environments.”</p>
<p>Yet local Asian businesses have not given up the fight, and those with a regional focus are increasingly identifying both internal and external talent, as well as becoming more sophisticated in how they assess and develop their talent. This drive and activity may go some way to explaining such a high staff turnover within Asia: loyalty is lost as talent look for the best way to further themselves professionally.</p>
<h3 id=""management-strategies"">Management strategies</h3>
<p>Whatever the decision, employees need to see that the organisation they migrate to, and stay with, has a transparent plan in place that allows them to develop as individuals with the potential to fill important roles within the organisation. Many organisations have programmes that are part of their recruitment and retention agenda; however, how effective each initiative is depends, not only on the sophistication of the company, but also on the corporate’s ability to understand how to draw talent out. During times of crisis – such as the current economic uncertainty – these schemes can come under pressure, says Miles. “Nevertheless, the challenge remains to provide high potential and talented executives with both the breadth and depth of experience in their development, balancing the need for progress and advancement with gaining sufficient depth and traction to consolidate their experiences along the way.</p>
<p>“Companies who do this well do so during all stages of the cycle, consistently through the boom and the down times – monitoring, assessing, tracking, rotating, developing talent and understanding what local talent values and needs and promoting from within.”</p>
<p>However, with candidates typically subjected to a very rigid initial hiring process in order for the company to identify talent, it may be sometimes difficult to determine the success of the talent programme itself. Nevertheless, it is the consistent and continuing efforts from management level that will allow the candidate the best chance of fulfilling their potential, according to Lee, who speaks of his experience with British American Tobacco. Lee held the position of Regional Treasury Manager, Asia Pacific from 2001-08 and Shell Treasury Manager Downstream East from 2008-12. “Senior management, along with HR, would identify high potential individuals and plan next roles for shortlisted persons as part of their development. This short to medium-term plan allows the individuals to understand how they will be progressed within the organisation and what they need to do to get to the next level. This stage is actually very critical – the ability to assess each individual’s contribution and ensure management follow-through of the development plan,” says Lee.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Honeywell employs recruitment and talent programmes in all of its subsidiaries globally, and Dubois acknowledges that the retention issue is more visible in emerging countries than in the Western world. “We are very involved in talent discussions and evaluations, high potential training and retention programmes. I would also stress the notion of regional or sub-regional teams to create critical talent mass. Sharing best practises, discussing issues to create a knowledge pool and feeling part of a team makes a huge difference.”</p>
<p>A global perspective, the necessary depth of experience and sufficient exposure across the full breadth of the treasury portfolio are all essential in moulding a fully rounded treasurer with the necessary leadership credentials that are crucial when considered as part of a succession programme. But, according to Miles, “the trend to consolidate and control the treasury function from the corporate centre, driven from both a risk management and an efficiency point of view, challenges the ability to develop treasury talent and capability within the broader organisation and across the region. Opportunities to gain the necessary experience can often only be available within the corporate centre or by moving to another organisation.”</p>
<h3 id=""strengthening-the-pipeline"">Strengthening the pipeline</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, forward thinking companies that employ a management strategy well have a reasonable concept of what talent looks like and will be anxious to establish clear and visible leadership responsibility across the business to facilitate succession planning. Organisations are becoming more sophisticated in how they assess and develop the talent, and are introducing more disciplined structures, processes and systems to manage their talent.</p>
<p>With localisation targets ever popular, rotational programmes are very much de rigueur as high potential employees are groomed for future executive positions – minimising the requirement to hire expatriates. An advocate of local recruitment herself, Dubois puts a lot of effort into cross-regional training for her staff, encourages talent discussions at the regional level and provides maximum exposure for the high potentials (so called ‘high touch’), enabling regular contact between the employee concerned and C-level executives. “Also of huge importance is a close working relationship with HR, which helps me focus and adjust talent strategies accordingly. We then organise performance assessments twice a year that allow us to properly track progress and adapt training. Competitive compensation also helps with retention, of course.”</p>
<p>Yet it can be difficult to retain talent if, after years of investment and development, the senior roles are not opening up or decisions are taken to recruit externally. Sometimes the only way for frustrated talent to make the transition into a core treasury position is to leave the organisation altogether.</p>
<p>There is no simple solution to ensuring smooth succession, says Miles. “It takes time, attention and commitment to a culture that continuously fosters and delivers talent development, mobility and promotion. Understanding what the talent in Asia needs and values is important.”</p>
<p>But there are occasions when these roles do open up, and when they do, it’s imperative that a qualified candidate is willing and able to fill that position. In this succession planning, management involvement and commitment to the process is one key success factor, according to HP’s Lee. “The identification of high potential candidates, coaching, mentoring activities all involve management time and effort. It cannot be delegated downwards or left to the HR function to manage.”</p>
<p>“When we identify candidates who will be taking over the role of the current employees in a certain number of years, it is sometimes questionable as to whether the chosen candidates will be trained sufficiently for the role when the time comes. This would take a huge amount of commitment that not all companies are always ready for,” he adds.</p>
<p>Ultimately, gaining appropriate exposure and experience across the strategic, operational and leadership dimensions is key to ensuring there is a pipeline of well-rounded, experienced talent in the business, says Miles. “For treasury executives this includes understanding the business well and gaining sufficient exposure across the treasury portfolio and the various instruments, networks, relationships and transactions is important.</p>
<p>“Successfully leveraging experience from within the global business where this is available, to develop local talent, needs to be tempered with an appreciation of what is important for the local talent pool.”</p>
<h3 id=""team-spirit"">Team spirit</h3>
<p>But not every high potential case is a success. Some may not live up to the standards initially set for them and others may possibly decide to opt out of the talent programme altogether. Meanwhile, there are staff members who are quietly working away delivering value for shareholders: these employees also have development requirements, according to Lee. “Although high potential candidates will have more opportunities than their peers for career programmes offered by their company on account of the limited resources available, the development and aspirational needs of employees who are not identified as high potential within the company should not be neglected. They contribute to shareholder value as well.”</p>
<p>Lee cites a very effective scheme that was employed in one of the companies he worked for. This company segregated the staff into three buckets: the lowest bucket (10% of all employees) that the top line wanted to manage out; the top bucket (10%) which was considered to be high potential; and the bulk core bucket that would hold 80% of employees. “The bulk core bucket contains people that contribute value at their individual levels. We call them the achievers – these people achieve the results for the company but are not identified in the high potential silo,” says Lee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The trend to consolidate and control the treasury function from the corporate centre, driven from both a risk management and an efficiency point of view, challenges the ability to develop treasury talent and capability within the broader organisation and across the region.”</p>
<p><cite>Sharon Miles, Director at Spencer Stuart</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although HR and senior management do not look at these ‘achievers’ as closely as they would the top 10%, it is up to management nonetheless to provide training and motivation such that these core business contributors feel that they are involved in development strategies and are important in achieving the company goals. In fact, some of these mid-level employees actually turn out to be high potential talent when encouraged appropriately. Says Lee: “It is therefore very important that management continue to develop these people so that they can realise their potential. Likewise, the employees that are not in the top talent bracket must ensure that they continuously review their career plans and aspirations. They should then make themselves and their requirements visible to the managers.”</p>
<p>Every team has a mix of talents and it is important to ensure that every employee feels that they have an essential role to play in order to distinguish their company as a winning team, agrees Honeywell’s Dubois. “I try to develop each and every member of staff to their full potential so that everyone feels that they contribute towards the value of the team. I want everyone to be proud of what they have achieved. I do not believe in concentrating on one special ‘talent’ – everyone has his or her part to play.</p>
<p>“Yet competition for talent is there and we need to be mindful of that – especially with the current economic climate as a backdrop. But the important thing is to understand the people you have on your team, have a genuine interest in their development and what they want and encourage them to bring the most they can.”</p>
<p>While investment in talent for the future is vital, success is invariably dependent on the entire team. Focusing solely on a few high potentials and neglecting your asset base of capable, loyal, committed and reliable people may prove a costly strategy in the longer term, advises Spencer Stuart’s Miles.</p>
<p>“As the Asian economies continue to grow and the associated demand for experience and skill increases, companies that do not pay attention to developing and supporting their people will find this will come at a cost,” she concludes.</p>

China: in the fast lane,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>According to a Chinese proverb, in every crisis there is an opportunity. As economies worldwide continue to struggle following the global financial crisis, China itself has become the opportunity.</p>
<p>Reuters has estimated that in January this year exports from China grew 25% from a year earlier – higher than Reuters’ forecast of 17%. A trade surplus of $29.2 billion was higher than market expectations of $22 billion. New lending by banks in the country totalled $172 billion, more than double the amount recorded in December 2012.</p>
<p>HSBC’s services purchasing managers index (PMI) for China hit 54 points in January, up from 51.7 in December. Nearly a third of the firms the bank surveyed said they expected business to expand in the coming year. HSBC calculates that the services sector contributes 46% to China’s GDP and is now equal to that of the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Official PMI figures from China’s National Bureau of Statistics recorded a modest increase in non-manufacturing PMI of 0.1% in January, compared with the previous month. Broken down into specific industries, the figures found the construction industry PMI was 61.6% (a decline of 0.3% on December) and that the services PMI was 54.9%, up by 0.2%. Within that figure, retail trade, air and water transport remained above 60%, while declines were recorded in the hotel services, ecological protection, environmental management and public facilities administration, real estate and residential services industries. The manufacturing PMI for January was 50.4%, down by 0.2% on the previous month but above the 50% threshold that indicates growth.</p>
<p>Commentators have warned that statistics for January have been skewed by the reduction in working days for January last year because of the Lunar New Year holidays. But compared to developed nations, China still presents a strong economic picture.</p>
<p>In its Global Economic Prospects report, published in January, the World Bank noted that developing countries had recorded among their slowest economic growth rates of the past decade during 2012, partly because of the euro zone uncertainty. However, as the institution’s President, Jim Yong Kim pointed out, developing countries have remained “remarkably resilient” during a global economic recovery that remains fragile and uncertain.</p>
<p>China’s economy slowed to an estimated 7.9% in 2012 from 9.3% in 2011, its weakest rate since 1999, says the World Bank. Exports from the region contracted by 8% in the three months to September and caused industrial production growth to slow to 3-4% in 2Q12. Global growth during the same period, says the World Bank grew 2.3% and is expected to remain broadly unchanged at 2.4% in 2013. China’s growth will accelerate to 8.4% in 2013 before stabilising at about 8% in 2014 and 2015 as the economy re-orients toward domestic demand and services, the report says.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, in 2011 China’s GDP was $7.318 trillion, generated by a population of 1.344 billion. The future of the country is promising, particularly with regard to development indicators. For example, the country outpaces its East Asia and Pacific (developing) neighbours in terms of life expectancy (73) and primary school enrolment (111% – which takes into account over or under-aged students). Between 1996 and 2004, the percentage of the population living on the national poverty line was reduced from 6% to 2.8%. (India, another engine of economic growth in the developing world, has 29.8% poverty levels and lower life expectancy, but matches China in terms of school enrolment.)</p>
<p>While China is closely watched, it is often misunderstood. In January, Qu Hongbin and Julia Wang, Economists at HSBC in Hong Kong, published a paper tackling what they termed as ‘two myths’ of the Chinese economy. “Myth one: China is export-reliant. Wrong. Conventional trade statistics overstate the economy’s exports dependence. Myth two: China is losing export competitiveness. Wrong again. China is still gaining global market share,” says the report.</p>
<p>The HSBC economists argue that China often acts only as the final assembler of parts and components made elsewhere. Citing the OECD’s Trade in Value database, they write that exports contribute 18% to China’s GDP, once exports with no domestic value added are stripped out of the figures. China’s economy is far less reliant on exports than it appears at first glance, says HSBC.</p>
<p>The resilience of China’s export market is attributed to two factors: low cost producers continue to benefit from economies of scale and quality differentiation; and China is becoming more competitive in higher value-added goods.</p>
<p>“Global demand will likely remain weak for a few more years and dampen export growth in the short term,” says the report. “But beyond the current downturn, China has the potential to continue expanding its share of global exports given that it has 20% of the global labour force but still accounts for just 10% of global exports. This potential should be unlocked, as industrialisation and urbanisation in China’s inland provinces picks up. As more inland cities become linked to the world market, they should further China’s market share gains in global trade.”</p>
<p>While international trade has slowed since 2008, the report’s authors state that Chinese producers are gaining a bigger share of global exports than in the past and are positioning to gain even more market share when global trade eventually recovers. The same goes for China’s economy: “China’s current share of global exports at 10% is only half the level of its share of global labour force. The recent urbanisation push will help the economy unlock this potential. With transport and logistics in place, inland cities will replace coastal areas as China’s new export engines. The positive spill-over from production to consumption will boost imports too,” says the report.</p>
<p>China’s rapid urbanisation is another factor often misinterpreted. So-called ‘ghost cities’ are cited as evidence that China’s economy is over-heating and will collapse. However, commentators such as Stephen Roach, a Professor at Yale and a former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, points out that in urbanising, China cannot afford to wait to build its new cities and instead aligns investment and construction with future needs.</p>
<p>A McKinsey study into China’s urbanisation, published in February 2009, predicted that the country’s urban population could hit one billion by 2030. “In 20 years, China’s cities will have added 350m people more than the entire population of the US today. By 2025, China will have 221 cities with one million-plus inhabitants, compared with 35 cities of this size in Europe today and 23 cities with more than five million. For companies in China and around the world, the scale of China’s urbanisation promises substantial new markets and investment opportunities,” says McKinsey.</p>
<p>While China’s economy slowed in 2012, it did not collapse, points out Stuart Parks, Head of Asian Equities at UK-based independent investment manager Invesco Perpetual. China’s economy, he says, is rebalancing and the composition of growth is arguably becoming much more sustainable.</p>
<p>“Exports are contributing less to overall growth in the Chinese economy, although there are signs that these, along with infrastructure spending, picked up towards the end of the year. The new administration is unlikely to see the need to make wholesale changes,” he says.</p>
<p>There are a number of measures that need to be moved forward, in China, says Parks, including capital account reforms and the introduction of a market-driven banking system to support privately owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). “If reform measures are not pushed through, the long-term growth of the economy will be impeded in our view. There may also be an increase in inflationary pressures, such as we have seen in India, if supply-side bottlenecks are not addressed.”</p>
<h3 id=""regulation"">Regulation</h3>
<p>Although economic reform seems a recent phenomenon in China, it dates back to December 1978 when the first steps to opening up the country to foreign investment were made. Underpinning reform are myriad regulations governing the financial markets and business environment. For multinational companies (MNCs) that are attracted to the opportunities that China represents, knowledge of the regulatory environment is crucial.</p>
<p>“The regulatory environment can be complicated for treasurers of multinationals operating in China to navigate,” says Percy Batliwalla, Head of Asia Pacific Sales, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill). “The central bank and government reporting requirements have a significant impact on treasury management activity, which is often different from frameworks in home markets. On-the-ground expertise and local market, regulatory and policy knowledge is vital for treasurers at MNCs in China.”</p>
<p>The speed of change in China, particularly in relation to regulations, can take many corporates by surprise, says Sonia Rossetti, Head of Product Management, West at Standard Chartered Transaction Banking. “What is today a fact, can change overnight.” Batliwalla identifies “three pillars” of the regulatory framework in China:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC)</h5>
<p>Which is authorised by the PRC State Council to regulate the banking sector in China (excluding the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau). It is also responsible for administration of the supervisory boards of the major state-owned banking institutions and other functions delegated by the State Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The People’s Bank of China (PBOC)</h5>
<p>China’s central bank, with responsibilities for formulating and implementing monetary policy, issuing renminbi (RMB) and administering its circulation and managing the state treasury. It also maintains normal operation of the payment and settlement system, guides and organises anti-money laundering (AML) work of the financial sector, and monitors relevant fund flows, conducts financial statistics, surveys, analysis and forecasts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)</h5>
<p>Which is responsible for drafting relevant laws, regulations and departmental rules on foreign exchange (FX) administration. SAFE oversees the statistics and monitoring of the balance of payments and the external credit and debt, releasing relevant information according to regulations and undertaking related work concerning the monitoring of cross-border capital flows. It also supervises and manages the FX market of the state and undertakes operations and management of FX reserves, gold reserves and other FX assets of the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Entering the Chinese market can look more complex than it is in reality, says Rossetti. “The Chinese authorities allow things to happen in a very controlled environment because they want to ensure their financial model is sustained. Many of the measures that are taken in the country are first piloted with a small number of multinational companies and banks and once they are proven, they are very quickly rolled out.”</p>
<p>Recent reforms are enabling multinational companies operating in China to move their surplus cash outside of the country, approval of which is done on a case-by-case basis, says Yigen Pei, China Head for Citi Transaction Services. “This is a very important move and a positive step for MNCs as they look to move surplus cash outside of China.”</p>
<h3 id=""rmb-internationalisation"">RMB internationalisation</h3>
<p>The internationalisation of China’s currency, the RMB, is the big story for MNCs. In global trade terms, the RMB has risen from 30<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> in just 18 months, according to figures from financial messaging co-operative SWIFT. The moves to support internationalisation, such as relaxation of cross-border lending laws, are enabling corporate treasurers to free up cash that was previously trapped in the country.</p>
<p>Pei highlights that the RMB is not yet an international currency – only about 1% of the currency is held outside China. “However, cross-border lending in RMB is currently in pilot with a few companies. Once the Chinese regulators are confident that such a structure works, they will roll it out and we will see more RMB going offshore,” he says.</p>
<p>Despite it being early days, the internationalisation of the RMB has been a key focus for multinational companies, says Rossetti. “As China’s regulators continue to develop the regulations around the currency, multinational companies are looking to build structures that will enable them to move cash in and out of the country. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is piloting with a number of banks on plain vanilla processes such as pooling and netting for in-country and cross-border transactions.”</p>
<p>The pilot programme to allow RMB cross-border settlement began in July 2009 and has since been extended to regions and cities across China. Before the pilot scheme was launched the RMB was not permitted for cross-border transfer. No RMB conversion was allowed in the offshore market and no cross-border financing took place in the currency. The pilot scheme made it feasible for companies to invoice in RMB for cross-border trade of goods and services. RMB can be used for cross-border settlement and for a wide range of activities including generic payments and receivables, letters of credit, import and export collection and letters of guarantee.</p>
<p>RMB conversion in the offshore market is now allowed but is subject to an FX limit provided by the appointed clearing agent. Short-term cross-border financing of up to 30 days is also now permitted.</p>
<p>In January this year, Citi announced the completion of its first cross-border lending transaction in RMB on behalf of a European food company. The transaction was structured to optimise the company’s treasury activities by leveraging its China operation’s surplus cash. The lending to its group treasury centre in Singapore is a critical step to expand and include RMB into the company’s treasury management currency basket, says Citi.</p>
<p>Pei says the step creates a new treasury solution that enables corporates to connect China with their regional and global treasury centres, and achieve greater efficiency in their global fund usage and allocation. “This will also signify important progress of RMB internationalisation by establishing a bigger role for the currency in multinationals’ treasury management globally.”</p>
<p>Standard Chartered has also been active in this area. In November last year it became the first foreign bank to gain approval for a RMB 3.3 billion loan quota on behalf of a US global manufacturing and technology company. In addition to ensuring that the submitted application met the various key requirements (satisfactory cross-border lending rate, tax requirements and ability to monitor the utilisation of the quota) set out by PBoC, Standard Chartered is responsible for proposing the most efficient cross-border lending structure to support its client’s business goals. The quota is expected to support the MNC’s Chinese office’s ability to lend RMB to its overseas parent or other related companies which can in turn settle RMB denominated invoices.</p>
<p>George Nast, Global Product Head of Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered, says the programme brings greater efficiencies and control to Shanghai-based treasury centres where corporations can negotiate for better lending frequency and rates that match their actual needs.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h3>
<p>The internationalisation of the RMB, along with simplification of payments processing and account structures, are significant factors for corporates treasuries in China, says Pei. “It will take time for these changes to come into effect, but they will ultimately help multinationals to speed up structures such as shared service centres (SSCs) to optimise their payments activities. Cross-border pooling and netting in foreign currency, which also has recently been allowed, will help corporates to optimise treasury and cash management.”</p>
<p>He believes the priorities of multinationals operating in China have changed; a decade ago when companies were first moving into the country they wanted to ensure they had multi-bank capabilities and efficient processes. Operations were largely decentralised. Today, says Pei, corporates are looking to centralise processing and treasury management, which has been driven by the financial crisis. “Companies need to know what their future cash flows are and are looking to better use their internal working capital.”</p>
<p>When macroeconomics, demographics and demand dynamics are considered, the business ambitions of MNCs operating in China must be supported by efficient cash and liquidity management structures, says Batliwalla. MNCs in China have become more proactive in their approach to cash and liquidity management. “Increasingly, they are identifying the establishment of a streamlined banking structure, with a consequent reduction of costs, through improved use of effective payment and receipt methods, as a treasury priority. Accurate and timely reporting of communication of cash flows, which enable enhanced returns on cash balances, are also in the front of mind for MNC treasurers in China. Unsurprisingly, MNCs we talk with have also earmarked liquidity, improved controls, cash visibility, lowered financing costs and moving idle cash for regional and global deployments as major treasury management priorities.”</p>
<p>Technology is also an evolving focus. An increasing number of corporates are launching interfaces with ERP systems for payments, reconciliation and accounting efficiency. Similarly, electronic banking systems that provide high levels of security and technical support and streamlined account structures with simplified bank account management are becoming more common in China treasury spaces.</p>
<p>Batliwalla says MNCs in China are embracing a centralised treasury management model. “This is likely to continue and in greater numbers, MNCs are establishing payment factories, SSCs, centres of excellence and even global business service centres to centralise daily flows and achieve operational efficiency.” Furthermore, many MNCs are looking to improve returns from normal cash investment and FX deals under the proper risk controls, he adds. “More sophisticated treasuries in China are leveraging consultancy services from global partner banks to offer detailed information of local regulation, on the China macro picture and the larger domestic market.”</p>

<img alt=""Lenovo"" class=""logo"" height=""15"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lenovo-logo-2013-90x15.png"" width=""90""/>
<p class=""management-summary"">Lenovo Group Ltd is a Chinese multinational computer hardware and electronics company with operations in more than 60 countries worldwide. In 2005, the company acquired IBM’s personal computer business. Group Treasurer, Damian Glendinning talks to Treasury Today about his treasury operations.</p>
<h5 id=""what-were-the-challenges-following-the-transformation-from-being-a-chinese-company-into-a-multinational"">What were the challenges following the transformation from being a Chinese company into a multinational?</h5>
<p>The challenges mostly related to the business outside China, where everything had to be built from zero, as Lenovo did not have any operations outside the country before the acquisition of IBM’s PC business. The treasury operations inside China were operating smoothly and as efficiently as was possible within the regulatory environment – so there was no reason to change anything or interfere with them.</p>
<h5 id=""how-does-lenovo-integrate-its-chinese-treasury-operations-with-its-global-operations"">How does Lenovo integrate its Chinese treasury operations with its global operations?</h5>
<p>For the time being, the two are still relatively separate. This is due in large part to the regulatory environment in China, which makes it difficult to use the cash we generate there to fund the business outside China, where our profit and cash generation record has not been as strong over the years. Having said that, all treasury is part of the same team, and we are able to vary payment terms on inter-company transactions to balance cash availability and needs, within limits.</p>
<h5 id=""is-the-regulatory-environment-becoming-easier-eg-freeing-up-surplus-cash-in-china"">Is the regulatory environment becoming easier (eg freeing up surplus cash in China)?</h5>
<p>The regulatory environment is definitely becoming easier. The internationalisation of the RMB is going faster than any of us expected, and a lot of things are now becoming possible which could have only been dreamed of a few years ago, such as cross-border RMB pooling. However, this is still an evolutionary process: a lot of the changes are still in the experimental phase, and there is still tension between the desire (and need) for a more open system, and the – very good – reasons for which the controls and regulations were established in the first place. So not all the pieces are in place for a fully open system, and there will still be some time and some experimentation before the regulations are totally user friendly.</p>
<h5 id=""what-advice-would-you-give-to-treasurers-of-mncs-seeking-to-do-more-business-in-china"">What advice would you give to treasurers of MNCs seeking to do more business in China?</h5>
<p>The main advice to treasurers of MNCs doing business in China is not to expect business to be done the way it is in their home country. The regulations have shaped just about every aspect of how cash and treasury is managed in China, and the fact has to be accepted and acknowledged. It is important to hire good Chinese staff – and to listen to them. They have experience of the system and how it works. At the same time, it is important to be open to the changes, and to move to take advantage of them. However, many new regulations and processes are initially introduced as an experiment, so do not expect full certainty on day one – it is important to be able to live with a degree of uncertainty.</p>
<h5 id=""what-are-the-current-challenges-for-your-treasury-operations-and-how-do-you-plan-to-overcome-those-challenges"">What are the current challenges for your treasury operations and how do you plan to overcome those challenges?</h5>
<p>There are always many challenges in all operations. Frankly, China is not the area of our operations that causes me the most concern. To an extent there is a problem, it is keeping track of all the changes, and knowing what is the best time to implement them. But it is a good problem to have.</p>

<p>Citi’s Pei says multinationals now view China as a very important market and want to ensure their treasury operations in the country are efficient and are connected with regional or global pools to the greatest extent possible. “This will depend in part on the market and further deregulation. China is still undergoing structural changes and companies will have to adapt to the specifics and changing dynamics such as a rebalance between export and domestic consumption, digitalisation and increasingly sophisticated consumers.”</p>
<p>As the market evolves, says Batliwalla, corporates are addressing working capital efficiency challenges. For example, some have taken steps to shorten AR terms while at the same time, prolonging AP terms, incurring minimal or zero costs. Additionally, MNCs are mitigating their AR risk more actively or looking to remove some of the ARs off balance sheet, for which banks are developing more complex AR financing products. He says there has been a clear improvement across the industry in document flows and funding flow management, driven by a willingness by MNCs to leverage solutions and systems by banks to greater effect.</p>
<p>To maximise trade activities and operations, MNCs in China have gravitated towards supply chain programmes offered by local and international banks. “Although not a novel concept in China, supply chain finance (SCF) programmes have become more entrenched as MNCs take a more involved role in the working capital cycle of suppliers and vendors, and look to further enhance their relationships domestically. More recently, as MNCs look to take advantage of liberalisation policies regarding cross-border trade flows, many are turning to banks to provide solutions to manage cross-border settlement and other funds flows.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The past decade has seen Asia become a much more significant economic player. Against a backdrop of low interest rates and sluggish growth in Europe and the US, Western corporates have increasingly been focusing on expanding their businesses in the faster-growing emerging markets. Yet one consequence of these developments is that many multinational corporates (MNCs) have been obliged to bring the management of their Asian subsidiaries’ treasuries closer to the region. Conducting operations from a Western headquarters has become impossible for many firms, with the result that an increasing number of regional treasury centres are being established in Asia in order to manage the corporate funds and risk exposures.</p>
<p>At the same time, the structure of domestic corporate treasuries in Asia is also changing: Asian companies are trying to control their global treasury operations centrally. Treasury is becoming a higher priority than before and companies are increasingly building dedicated treasury operations.</p>
<h3 id=""The treasurers rising profile"">The treasurer’s rising profile</h3>
<p>The past decade has seen the evolution of the role of the treasurer from an almost administrative position towards the more coordinator role that is expected today. “In the past few years, treasurers have played the role of coordinator, particularly with areas like finance, tax and IT. They have been the centre of expertise and they connect back to the lifeblood of the company, which is cash flow and managing liquidity,” says Steve Dwyre, Managing Director, Industrials and TMT at Lloyds Banking Group.</p>
<p>Yet now treasurers are making another transition. From this coordinator position, the treasurer is being drawn on to play a much more strategic part in the firm, in the heart of the business so to speak, deferred to by the CFO and participating at Board meetings more than they have ever done before. As the role of the treasurer achieves this higher profile, the number of talented professionals from a banking background who are choosing corporate treasury as a career choice is also rising, according to Stuart Ridley, Manager – Treasury at Robert Walters Recruitment. “I’ve seen an improvement in the quality of people who are choosing treasury over the normal financial/accounting route. As the treasurer becomes a more respected position, more people are attracted to it,” he says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treasurers are being asked to present the Board with innovative solutions for counterparty risk analysis that goes beyond credit default swap (CDS) spreads and public ratings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a senior figure, and an expert across many fields, the objectives of the treasurer are therefore shaping many of the trends that we can see developing in 2013. As they juggle their many balls of responsibility, the treasurer must respond to economic developments and regulatory changes, while also grabbing growth opportunities with both hands. The decisions they make are driving the industry forward.</p>
<!-- nextpage -->
<h3 id=""global-priorities"">Global priorities</h3>
<p>Risk management is one area where the treasurer has recently proved to be a strong coordinator. Often sitting on the risk committee, the treasurer may assist the banking partners with stress scenarios and management planning, taking the treasury function to the next strategic level. In this new, more involved approach, treasurers are being asked to present the Board with innovative solutions for counterparty risk analysis that goes beyond credit default swap (CDS) spreads and public ratings.</p>
<p>As they’re the ones liaising with the banks, the treasurers understand the ratings and counterparty analysis processes, affirms Rajesh Mehta, EMEA Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi Transaction Services. “They are increasingly being seen as ‘the risk manager’ which in many corporate organisations is not a designated function per se. Whether it is with bank counterparty risk, credit ratings or potential sovereign default, treasurers get involved in all key stages of the risk management process. And the investment committees are looking to treasurers to satisfy the threshold of risk management.”</p>
<p>From a risk perspective, the way the treasury operates and how it is managed will only continue to rise in importance. This is currently reflected in the upgrade of the risk management capabilities of treasury departments – in both financial institutions and larger corporates, according to Rohan Douglas, CEO at Quantifi. “Given the turmoil in the financial marketplace, institutions are subject to a lot more volatility, which is driving an increased focus on more accurate valuations and more comprehensive risk management.”</p>
<p>In these uncertain times, corporates can face difficulties with regard to credit lines and liquidity that they rely upon for business operations. Treasurers, therefore, are aware of the importance of working capital and maximising the internal working capital resources. They are also looking to improve working capital through improved credit risk analysis and collections automation strategies, resulting in reduced borrowing margins. Treasurers are now much more the arbiters of working capital across the firm, says Mehta. “Most treasurers tend to act as the bank relationship arm of finance within the firm and are now preaching the value and importance of working capital and optimising internal capital.”</p>
<p>As for where the specific impact of working capital can be seen, the corporate treasurer is getting involved with their supply chain on a much more strategic level. “Treasurers know that the companies, especially those who are focusing on emerging markets growth, have to optimise their supply chain in order to successfully grow otherwise any weak link or potential disruption could become a constraining factor,” he says.</p>
<p>Furthermore, intraday liquidity will continue to be high on the agenda next year, according to Ruth Wandhöfer, Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy at Citi Transaction Services. “Solutions to improve the corporates’ use of liquidity will help in this respect but banks themselves will need to find ways to better monitor and allocate liquidity usage. Pricing of intraday liquidity will become a more prominent area of discussion given the fact that liquidity constitutes an increasing cost to banks. This is further accentuated by the fact that Basel aims to discourage access to intraday wholesale liquidity and instead more liquidity is expected to be held by banks at all times.”</p>
<h3 id=""tech-trends"">Tech trends</h3>
<p>Treasurers’ objectives – efficient working capital and risk management – are also driving the technology agenda. The challenge for banks in the current environment therefore, according to Citi’s Mehta, is satisfying this demand for innovation while also adhering to the mandatory regulatory demands.</p>
<p>Mobile is one area that seems to be going from strength to strength in the corporate arena. Since Citi launched CitiDirect® BE mobile, the mobile extension of its electronic banking system, last year, it has implemented the solution in 87 countries and accumulatively completed $10 billion in transaction value through mobile. The advantage of mobile as an efficiency enabler for treasurers frequently needing to conduct business while on the road is also widely known, but there is now a more basic demographic trend that the banks must cater for. Says Mehta: “We are seeing a convergence between the personal technology that is used by the average consumer and the expectation that corporate interaction shouldn’t be any less convenient. Treasurers are expecting the same digital interface in their working environment.”</p>
<p>Corporates are looking for more flexible software that provides high performance and the development of technologies, including multicore architectures, are helping provide this. According to Douglas, leveraging Intel’s multicores CPUs allows software to run much faster on what is now industry standard hardware. “To further simplify their IT infrastructure, more companies are also looking to introduce a hosting model and cloud computing. The ability to leverage computational power on demand and rent hardware on an as-needed basis, in addition to run calculations out on a cloud, has a lot of interesting applications in the financial arena where often computational requirements peak at certain times in the day.”</p>
<p>But the world of technology is ever changing. According to Dwyre, we have moved on from simply having a web and a cloud and have now entered a new world of ‘sensors’, which are becoming smaller and more ubiquitous in everyday life. “Linked to the cloud, sensory data that exists in the real world suddenly becomes available to the consumer and the business world. How sensors react to all the data that is being collected and how that data is used is the important part.”</p>
<!-- nextpage -->
<p>A concrete example of this is Lloyds Bank’s creation of the Arena platform, from which a treasurer can see every balance in every bank account and can even transact in foreign exchange (FX) across this one system that connects it all – no longer do they need to rely on a system that only a bank can access.</p>
<p>Many companies have spent vast quantities of money putting in place a treasury management system (TMS) or an enterprise resource planning system (ERP). But this buoyant market naturally tailed off when budgets were cut; although the corporate might need a TMS or ERP, they had to hold out on its implementation until they could spare the funds. But new providers are coming to the market that can actually offer the required system on a bit-by-bit basis, according to Ridley. “Two or three segments from the entire system might be absolutely essential to you and you can pick and choose these to your specification. This is much more attractive to cash-strapped corporates than paying for an all singing, all dancing system that you are only using a fraction of.”</p>

<h3 id=""outsourcing-trade"">Outsourcing trade</h3>
<p>While trade with the rest of the world has continued to show impressive growth, intra-Asian trade has also developed in its importance to the region, affording it a greater level of protection against economic shocks originating in the EU and the US. Indeed, the move away from the bulk of trade being conducted on a US dollar basis has demanded that treasurers expand their risk management arrangements to take account of this changing landscape.</p>
<p>“The fragmentation in the FX space that has been apparent in Europe for some time is now increasingly becoming an issue in Asia,” says Tanuja Randery, CEO at MarketPrizm. This can make trading quite costly and complex in terms of trying to gain access to the multiple markets. “Access is a big word for a lot of things: in order to trade, clients need to be immersed in the market or they may just want to receive data from and send their orders back to the market. This involves the maintenance of development and network staff.</p>
<p>“But we are seeing increasing demand for these services in Australia and also continuing demand in Tokyo. Other emerging countries are also becoming more attractive such as Taiwan and Indonesia. In addition, China looks very interesting but it is early days yet.”</p>
<p>An integrated offer from a provider that actually has its own network, data and software is therefore becoming an attractive option – a trend growing more in Asia because the penetration in the region in terms of electronic and algorithmic trading is much lower than its Western counterparts, according to Randery. And Asia is expensive for low latency networks and collocation. While FX electronic trading has existed for quite a few years, the growth of high frequency trading (HFT) and algorithmic trading is emerging as a relatively recent trend, she says. “The reason this has happened is because clients are no longer able to make money in the placid markets, such as equities, so they have entered the FX space as a means of diversifying asset classes. This trade landscape is also becoming more global in nature and as a result we have seen the number of interested buy side and HFT players increasing significantly.”</p>
<p>Although the data volumes are much fewer in the FX arena than those seen in equities (most of the work happening with five or six currency pairs), in terms of fragmentation and the complexity deriving from that, in addition to the customisation required for the FX venue itself, trade is almost more complicated as a result. Says Randery: “You may not need as much bandwidth from a network perspective to reach the venue and trade but you do need it for many functions, particularly when it comes to managing each of the FX venues in an extremely bespoke manner for provisioning/onboarding set-up.”</p>
<p>In turn, these enormous complexities encourage traders to look towards a managed services model; they are looking for players to simplify and extract the infrastructure for them, and provide the infrastructure and data as a service model. The region is therefore seeing a shift towards the high speed, low latency service – a trend that looks set to continue. “A lot of our clients are saying that they want to avoid the spaghetti mess of multiple pipes, vendors, cross-connects, etc, which is time-consuming and costly. They are looking for very simplified infrastructure – and we act like the master switch that the clients plug into. We feed the venue, becoming a flow aggregator distributing each of those clients to where they need to go through the pricing engines. We manage the process so that it almost looks like the one stream – leveraging our infrastructure to mutualise cost and channel customers.”</p>
<h3 id=""onwards-and-upwards"">Onwards and upwards</h3>
<p>As the Asian landscape is composed of many diverse markets at different stages of development, companies operating in Asia – both MNCs and domestic – must be prepared to combat a number of different challenges. When it comes to the management of treasury, a one-size-fits-all strategy is therefore unlikely to be appropriate, so corporates should be equipped to deal with the policies and procedures that are bespoke to the region.</p>
<p>A key challenge for regulators across the Asian landscape in the coming years will be ensuring that monetary policies continue to favour sustained growth. Given that many of the economies are still in nascent stages, maintaining a favourable regulatory environment is crucial. Nonetheless, Asia – with its economic titans such as China and India – remains set to be one of the key drivers of global growth in the coming year.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Once the dream economy of the East and heralded in the 1970s and 1980s much as China is now, Japan remains the world’s third largest economy. It has a nominal GDP of $5.87 trillion, despite having one of the biggest national debts in the world and enduring the Lost Decade of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Japan has suffered from falling prices for two decades and this autumn experienced its fourth recession since 2000. Yet this protracted deep deflation in Japan paradoxically provided a model for the rest of the world. When the financial crisis hit, the G7 nations quickly implemented a near-zero interest rate policy, effectively imitating Japan’s policy.</p>
<p>However, there is a real danger inherent in this policy. Analysts are now warning of the ‘Japanification’ of the world economy – ie the threat of an extended period of stagnation or negative GDP growth.</p>
<p>The flagging Japanese economy proved to be the deciding factor in the recent elections on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2012. After a three-year absence, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) was re-elected based on a pledge to revive the Japanese economy. Almost immediately afterwards, the central bank – Bank of Japan (BOJ) – extended its asset purchase programme, aimed at keeping borrowing costs down, by Japanese yen (JPY) ¥10 trillion ($119 billion).</p>
<p>The Japanese government is expected to raise its economic growth forecast for the next fiscal year to above 2% on hopes that its planned fiscal stimulus package will boost growth. It is also keeping up pressure on the BOJ to step up its monetary stimulus, even after it loosened policy in December for the third time in four months.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would consider changing the law governing the central bank unless it boosts its inflation target. The BOJ has already signalled it may set a higher target at its 21<sup>st</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup> January meeting, despite market participants expressing disbelief that it has the means to achieve it.</p>
<h3 id=""rebooting-the-economy"">Rebooting the economy</h3>
<p>According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, net government debt is estimated to be 135% of GDP in 2012 and on current projections government debt will reach 164% of GDP in 2016. The overwhelming majority (95%) of the debt on issue is held domestically.</p>
<p>Many market analysts have predicted the imminent demise of Japanese economic power, fuelled by its unorthodox government bond scheme. In a recent paper, UCSD Professor Takeo Hoshi and University of Tokyo Professor Takatoshi Ito ask an interesting question: how long can Japanese bond prices defy gravity? They argue that the key feature that has kept this process going has been that 95% of the Japanese government debt is domestically owned. “Japanese residents put their savings into banks and insurance companies, who along with pension funds lend to the government at very low rates. But as more Japanese retire from the workforce, that is likely to change dramatically,” according to Hoshi and Ito.</p>
<p>As the number of people investing from within the country grows smaller, domestic banks are called upon to subsidise the deficit. Hoshi and Ito report that Japanese banks collectively hold about ¥142 trillion of central and local government bonds as of the end of March 2010. This is about 32% of total bank loans.</p>

<p>While the top banks are losing their places at the top of the global rankings to their Chinese rivals, overall, Japan’s banks are holding their own, according to The Banker’s 2012 survey of global banks.</p>

<p>According to Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) ASEAN+3 Bond Market Guide, Japan offers a wide range of financial tools to meet a range of issuer and investor requirements. Aside from traditional instruments such as loans, corporate bonds, and commercial papers, securitised products are also available in Japan’s credit market. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) supervises the capital market of Japan.</p>
<p>After the global financial crisis in 2008, despite showing downward trend in the second half of 2008, the corporate bond market has shown relatively steady recovery towards 2009 and 2010. The 11<sup>th</sup> March 2011 earthquake and tsunami hit the market, and the performance of the first half of 2011 showed a slowdown.</p>
<p>The country’s stagnant economic growth is characterised by a lack of natural resources, an export market that remains well below its import market and, at times, a tempestuous trade relationship with other Asian countries. Over the past 20 months, the economy has maintained a stable footing, allowing economists to turn to the more long-term worries for Japan’s continuing success.</p>
<p>With interest on government debt rising and exports to Europe and China down, the latter dramatically due to the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, questions for future prosperity will revolve around the newly-elected government’s ability to increase foreign confidence in Japan and to begin to devise solutions for the ongoing debt situation.</p>
<h3 id=""trade"">Trade</h3>
<p>Japan is a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and an ASEAN partner. The country has free trade agreements (FTAs) in operation with:</p>

<p>FTAs with India and Australia, which are under discussion, would further strengthen the country’s trade capabilities.</p>
<p>The diplomatic ruptures with China have dealt a blow for those who wish to see Japan’s trading potential strengthened. Total exports fell 6.5% in October from a year earlier, sharper than a 4.9% fall forecasted by economists, leading to a fourth straight monthly trade deficit.</p>
<p>In addition, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry reported that industrial production fell 1.7% in November 2012 from the previous month. Compared with the same month a year earlier, it was down 5.8%.</p>
<p>Following on from the natural disaster of 2011 there were hopes in Japan that focus might shift positively to more inspired ways of preserving the country’s future prosperity and endurance. One such way that potential benefits to a change in outlook are being observed is in the approach to energy. Nuclear power accounted for almost one-third of Japan’s energy supply before the reactors were shut. The radiation worries and resulting backlash against nuclear energy has meant that Japanese companies are hungrily buying from Malaysia, Australia, and the US, as well as across Africa. Japan is already the world’s largest importer of natural gas.</p>
<p>The large changes to global trade following from 2008’s crisis have by no means stabilised. As the Eurozone crisis continues, the region’s banks, under rising political pressure to shore up capital at home in markets that are barely growing, are cutting lending to emerging markets.</p>
<p>Many French banks, including BNP Paribas, Société Générale (SocGen) and Crédit Agricole, have retrenched due to a lack of US dollar reserves, which is the currency for the majority of global trade financing. They are choosing not to play in a region now dominated by US banks, such as J.P. Morgan, Citi and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, large international banks including Standard Chartered and HSBC, and domestic Japanese banks. The latter are being bolstered by domestic corporates expanding into other areas of Asia, eager to gain traction in the quick-evolving and growing economies of previously minor Asian economic powers.</p>
<p>Although initially a shift of the locality of those financing trade may have provoked fears that there would be a reduced pool for Asian companies to borrow from when exporting, it seems it is a straightforward locality change in where the money is coming from. In this shift it has thus far been the Japanese banks that appear, up to now, to be coming up on top. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have a 16.6% and 9.6% market share respectively, massive increases on their representations in 2011 additionally meaning that Mitsubishi UFJ is now the top market shareholder.</p>
<p>As intraregional trade flow increases and Japanese companies expand their reach into new markets, complex structured hybrid trade finance models are becoming increasingly important.</p>
<h3 id=""payments"">Payments</h3>
<p>Domestic retail banking operates in a country in which the majority of payments are still made in cash. Although viewed by much of the world as a technological superpower, the reality is that in terms of day-to-day functionality plastic cards, although gaining in popularity, are still not used at the same level as other developed countries. Large retail companies, therefore, will be balancing books that are dominated by cash payments.</p>
<p>Direct debit is the most common payment method for all regular consumer to business payments, ie utility and rental payments, etc. Cheques, on the other hand, are uncommon and mostly used by corporates. Companies pay employees mainly through direct credit into their bank accounts. Electronic payments (e-payments), made real-time via Zengin System, are steadily gaining in popularity due to the widespread use of electronic devices and smart phones.</p>

<p>Systems managing inter-bank payments in Japan are divided into private sector clearing networks, domestic funds transfer system and the foreign exchange (FX) JPY clearing system. Alongside these run ATMs, which have a high importance as e-payment mechanisms in Japan, according to the Japanese Bankers Association.</p>
<p>There are four major payment systems for clearing and settling inter-bank payments in Japan – three clearing systems in the private sector and a funds transfer system operated by the central bank. In 2009, the securities settlement systems were reformed and wide-ranging progress has been made.</p>
<p>Postal accounts and postal giro services, provided by the government-run Post Office, are also popular. Similar to the rest of Asia, the pick up of electronic transfer systems has been widespread in the Japanese banking system.</p>

<h3 id=""foreign-exchange-controls"">Foreign exchange controls</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law (April 1998) gave companies in Japan greater flexibility in managing foreign currency, trade settlement, and subsidiary funding. There are five key law revisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cross-border capital flow liberalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free market for foreign currency exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overseas accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-lateral netting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow domestic trade in foreign currency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Japan resident entities are responsible for all regulatory reporting.</p>
<p>Export and import controls are imposed following the UN sanction.</p>
<p>Export and Import of certain products are prohibited or require specific licences.</p>

<h3 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h3>
<p>Companies operating in Japan have the choice of a variety of short-term funding alternatives, with a range of short-term investment instruments. Most Japanese companies tend to rely on cash concentration as a means of managing individual company and group liquidity.</p>
<p>Zero balancing is the most widely used liquidity management technique. Notional pooling, which is available in Japan, is infrequently used by companies because the tax implications surrounding the technique in Japan are unclear and can make the whole process overly complicated.</p>
<p>Discussion of FX in any part of Asia is dominated by talk of the rise of the renminbi (RMB) as an international currency. Japan is no different, and exposure to the RMB and developments around its use as a trade currency will only grow increasingly pertinent.</p>
<p>As SunGard highlights in a November 2012 survey report, FX risk exposure, credit and interest rate risk remain top priorities for Japanese corporates. ‘As a company’s global exposure increases, FX volatility can have a greater impact on profits, product pricing, and performance,’ according to the SunGard report.</p>
<h3 id=""attracting-top-talent"">Attracting top talent</h3>
<p>Japan has attracted a number of international companies over the decades; it is a wealthy country with a strong and loyal consumer population.</p>
<p>It is often said, however, that it is one of the hardest of the developed countries for global brands to break into and to do so requires a deep commitment to the Japanese operations. Multinationals are confronted by challenges including opaque regulation, comprehension challenges and market impenetrability. This is not a country that companies can do a ‘smash and grab raid’, but requires a long-term approach which, when done correctly, can reap vast rewards.</p>
<p>One problem that multinationals must solve is how to attract, retain and get the most out of the local labour pool. The successful integration of domestic management into international teams adds layers of complexity. As Japanese companies looking abroad for growth must learn to rely further on in-country management, so must multinational companies do so in Japan.</p>
<p>An Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) survey from November 2011 polled the opinions of multinationals operating in Japan and the problems that they face. Just over half (54%) of the non-Japanese corporate respondents were satisfied with recent hires in specialised and managerial positions in Japan, while 20% reported being unsatisfied or highly unsatisfied with their recent intake in Japan. This reflects the complexity of recruiting local talent in a country where the established Japanese company will have greater authority in securing talent.</p>
<p>Most elite Japanese graduates will be drawn to the big Japanese names, with joining a foreign company still being thought of as a risk. Just as Japanese consumers are wary of foreign brands which appear and disappear within a short timeframe, so too are their workers when looking for a job. Aside from this prudence on the part of Japanese talent, Japanese workers are also concerned about the day-to-day practicalities involved with working for a foreign company.</p>
<p>The shrinking working age population is also an issue to bear in mind – Japan’s elderly population, aged 65 or older, is forecast to increase to 38% of the population by 2055.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Japan has attracted a number of international companies over the decades; it is a wealthy country with a strong and loyal consumer population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest, yet most persistent problem for multinationals operating in Japan remains that of language skills and capabilities. The majority of the Japanese workforce have a low level of English capabilities and are not aggressive in honing and quickly acquiring these skills.</p>
<p>Other persistent problems with Japanese employees are symptomatic of the cultural differences – there is not much encouragement in Japan for individuality either in general society, at school or work. Loyalty and a communality of approach are stressed as positive attributes, but also could have the effect of inhibiting creativity and leadership in business.</p>
<p>Alongside this cultural clash, however, runs the excellence in technical skills, attention to detail – and loyalty. If foreign multinationals can employ creative leaders to work alongside the Japanese workforce and encourage a change in approach that is aligned with the company’s global aims, as well as support foreign language education, then they will reap the rewards. Japan is a country rich in potential and possibilities for multinationals that can tailor their approach for a unique, yet richly rewarding, opportunity.</p>
