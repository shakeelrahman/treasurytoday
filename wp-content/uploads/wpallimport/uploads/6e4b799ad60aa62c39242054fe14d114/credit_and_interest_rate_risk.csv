<h5 id=""citi"">Michael N. Berkowitz, Managing Director, Head of Global &amp; North America Liquidity Product Management, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi:</h5>
<p>In a rising rate environment, treasurers should review investment horizons to ensure that capital is preserved and liquidity is maintained. As all non-overnight investments bear an inherent level of interest rate risk, rising rates will have an impact on the current and future values of existing cash holdings, as well as influence the relative attractiveness of different investments for meeting specific investment needs.</p>
<p>With that in mind, corporate treasurers may want to adjust their interest rate exposures and consider investments with shorter duration.</p>
<h5>Mitigating risk with short duration investments.</h5>
<p>Having a solid understanding of how various cash investments are impacted by interest rates allows treasurers to take action to mitigate the impact of a rising interest rate cycle. Concentrating cash globally or regionally can also improve treasury efficiency, increasing interest income and reducing interest expense. The following is a summary of short-term investments and their characteristics:</p>
<h5>Overnight bank deposits:</h5>
<p>Rates tend to track rises in interest rates fairly closely, although treasurers should review counterparty credit risk associated with the depository bank. Certain bank deposits provide companies with the option of earning credits to offset fees, interest or both.</p>
<h5>Time deposits:</h5>
<p>Time deposits can offer higher yields but tend to catch rate increases with a lag as they need to wait out the term of the deposit before being reset to a higher rate. Time deposits carry the same counterparty risk as overnight deposits but increase liquidity risk. Certain evergreen or minimum maturity time deposits offer attractive yields and increased liquidity versus longer-term-time deposits with a 31-day call feature.</p>
<h5>Money market funds (MMFs):</h5>
<p>Compared to overnight bank deposits and term deposits, counterparty credit risk is significantly more diversified and yields are in line with market rates (with some lag). On the other hand, US Prime funds can impose gates and fees for investors and have floating net asset values (NAVs).</p>
<p>To better prepare for and navigate in a rate rising environment, it’s critical for treasurers to design and deploy a robust investment strategy that recognises trade-offs in yield, safety and liquidity.</p>

<h5 id=""pwc"">Yvonne Welsh, Treasury Advisory Expert, PwC:</h5>
<p>With positive growth projections, the macroeconomic landscape is being set for potential gradual interest rate increases in major global economies after being at historically low levels for many years. While no two organisations are the same in their exposure to such rises, we believe this new environment is an opportunity for the treasurer to add significant value, whether from a cash, funding or FX perspective.</p>
<p>Firstly, in relation to cash, rising rates present the opportunity to earn improved returns on idle or investment cash balances. When they do happen, the differential between the more favoured short-term investments – eg bank deposits or MMFs)– and other investment options such as separately managed portfolio, will likely widen.</p>
<p>Additionally, different categories of investments will have varying “lag effects”. When these factors are considered against the context of changing MMF regulation and the reduced willingness of banks to take on corporate deposits, upticks in rates could be the impetus for such treasurers adopting a more dynamic investment approach. However, before suggesting this, treasurers should be clear on their board appetite for risk in the changing rate environment and have in mind the additional monitoring and research required to be successful.</p>
<p>The levers to consider in the context of borrowing are twofold. One is managing the risk on the overall portfolio. It could be useful to explore the possibility of accelerating the refinancing of existing debt and lengthening duration when doing so. Specifically, in relation to existing floating debt, while it is likely that any related hedging activity will already have incorporated anticipated rate increases, pre-emptive action may provide longer-term certainty on interest costs.</p>
<p>The second aspect is optimising operational processes to reduce borrowing requirements and related interest cost. A reliable cash flow forecast is not only required to facilitate optimal investment activity but is essential for monitoring debt covenants. It sounds simple but forecasts need to reflect the possible increased interest costs, commercial impacts and have appropriate sensitivity analysis in order to build the most realistic and accurate cash requirements. Additionally, working to release any trapped/idle balances across geographies will release cash to pay down debt – in particular floating rate debt. In the current low-interest rate environment some companies may have managed idle cash in a benign fashion, however, solutions to access working capital improvements such as supply chain financing may become more compelling in a rate-rising backdrop.</p>
<p>Finally, FX. Typically, as interest rates increase a currency strengthens and adjustments in monetary policy will follow at varying points in time. Companies with international operations will, therefore, need to assess the implications of this potential additional volatility in FX rates from both a commercial and financing perspective. For those with existing hedging programmes in place, action should be considered to ensure this strategy remains relevant and effective as rates increase. For those without a hedging programme now may be the time to consider how to gain better visibility of exposures, examine sensitivities and explore the use of hedging instruments to smooth potential volatility and erosion of earnings.</p>

<h5 id=""zanders"">Sander Van Tol, Partner, Zanders:</h5>
<p>Corporate treasuries are used to operating in a low-interest rate environment. The main question then for corporate treasurers is how to prepare for a potential hike in interest rates?</p>
<p>Before answering this question, it is good to first look at the concept of interest rate risk. To determine the basic exposure of your company, the first step is to look at the net position; are you a net borrower or investor?</p>
<p>In this answer we are looking at interest rate risk management from a net borrower’s perspective, meaning that an increase in interest rates will lead to an increase of the interest expense line in the P&amp;L of the company. An increase in interest expenses also has an indirect effect via the interest coverage ratio; meaning that a potential increase in interest rate can lead to a potential breach of the ICR covenant.</p>
<p>Interest rates may also impact the pension obligations of corporations. Normally we see that future liabilities under a defined benefit (DB) pension plan will decrease as a result of an interest increase (future liabilities are discounted using a higher discount rate).</p>
<p>The interest expense of the company is normally a combination of interest paid on a diversified funding portfolio, which can consist of drawings under your revolving credit facility, overnight debit positions and loan term funding like terms loans, private placements and bonds. Furthermore, interest paid on financial and operational leases are part of the interest rate risk exposure.</p>
<p>When we decompose the interest rate exposure further, one notes that interest paid is a combination of a reference/benchmark rate and a specific credit margin. This can be seen quite clearly in revolving credit facilities which use a Libor/Euribor reference rate depending on the period of the drawing (normally three or six months) plus a credit margin depending on a leverage ratio or credit rating.</p>
<p>For long-term instruments like bonds and private placements, the reference rate is less clearly defined but normally is dependent on long-term interest benchmark rates, like swap rates or government yields. Furthermore, the credit margin is fixed until final repayment. The decomposition of the interest rate on financial and operational leases is harder to make. Normally leases are using one all-in interest rate. For overdraft facilities, the interest rate exposure is sometimes even more opaque because banks charge interest based on their own, bank-specific, reference rate.</p>
<p>So why is the decomposition of interest rate risk exposure of importance? This has to do with the ability of corporate treasuries to hedge their interest rate exposure. With interest rate derivatives like swaps, caps and swaptions, one can hedge a potential increase of a reference rate or benchmark rate, but not the credit margin. So, it is good to understand that interest rate risk hedging can provide companies with relative protection against an interest rate increase but not a total protection of the interest expense. In case companies are looking to hedge their total interest rate exposure, including the credit margin component, it is most beneficial to look at either amending or extending the current credit facilities and/or a liability management exercise in the debt capital market to profit from current market conditions on the long term.</p>
<p>Corporates looking to brace themselves for a rise in interest rates can also use derivatives. Most suitable derivatives to hedge the risk of a future interest rate hike in the long term are forward starting swaps and swaptions. With forwards starting swaps, companies can fix the swap rate they will use in the future. This instrument can be used even if the underlying funding is not secured yet. Generally speaking, corporate treasuries will use forward starting swaps in case there is a high degree of certainty about the future funding requirement and the company has a view that the interest rate is likely to increase.</p>
<p>If the underlying exposure is less certain, or the view of a potential hike in interest rates is more unclear, treasury can potentially enter into swaption in which the corporation is buying the option to enter into an interest rate swap at the exercise date in which it is paying the fixed leg of the swap. The preference for one instrument over the other is dependent on the price of derivative and the view on interest rate changes.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Market and currency volatility inevitably leads to interest rate risk. Where this threatens to impact profitability it has to be effectively managed. What does it entail for treasurers operating in Asia?</em></p>
<p>Just as there may be a whole new generation of bankers who have yet to work in a rising interest rate environment, so there must be a number of new treasurers who are yet to experience the vagaries of interest rate movement. But it will happen sooner or later and whichever direction interest rates take (China possibly downwards, the US possibly up), companies failing to take informed action (even if that means doing nothing) are taking a huge financial risk.</p>
<p>According to CPA Australia, the country’s professional accounting body, interest rate risk should be managed where fluctuations in interest rates impact on the organisation’s profitability. In its publication, ‘Understanding and Managing Interest Rate Risk Finance &amp; Treasury’, it states that action should be taken “so that the focus of the organisation is on providing the core goods or services without exposing the business to financial risks”.</p>
<p>In essence, interest rate risk arises from the exposure of a company’s financial activities to negative movements in interest rates. The proper management of that risk by a business is not about trying to stop rate movements (because in general this is not possible) but is instead about maintaining that risk exposure somewhere within the pre-agreed boundaries of what is acceptable. However, as with most variable factors in modern commerce, what is tolerable for one company may not be so for another. Because the influencing features of risk management (such as risk appetite, nature of business and capital structure) are different for each participant, there can be no one-size-fits-all solution. For a treasurer, this means having to understand exposures, grappling with the sources of risk and their possible effects, and then finding, implementing and maintaining the most appropriate means of its measurement and its ongoing management. For those without the experience it could be a bumpy ride.</p>
<h3 id=""the-connection-between-interest-rates-and-fx"">The connection between interest rates and FX</h3>
<p>The Asian markets exhibit a number of different micro-climates largely driven by political economies. But it is easy to forget that interest rates and FX rates are interconnected to the extent that one affects the other. Aside from Japan, China is the major influence on its neighbouring economies. Where that tight interconnectedness of interest rates and currency measures steers the direction of economic movement, it is easy to see why China’s recent profound meddling with yuan (CNY) is of extreme interest to many in the region (and indeed beyond).</p>
<p>Until the middle of last year, CNY was pegged to the USD (within a limited float-range) affording its currency relative stability. Its interest rates were correspondingly unwavering. However, with the devaluation of CNY last year (on 11<sup>th</sup> August) in response to continuing efforts by the central bank, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBoC), to shift to a more market-driven system of setting the currency’s rate (as it tries to meet the requirements for the currency to join the International Monetary Fund’s basket of reserves), there has been considerable speculation that China’s currency may start to float with even more freedom against the USD in 2016.</p>
<p>Indeed, China’s economic growth goal of 6.5% for the next five years will not be met unless CNY falls at least 8% against the USD by the end of 2016, according to Royal Bank of Canada and Rabobank Groep. China (like all other developed economies) will most likely use monetary policy (eg the manipulation of interest rates) to try to reverse the effects of its current economic slowdown, resulting in downward currency movement (against the likes of USD, GBP and Euro) and strengthening of its exports. If there is a shift in terms of CNY versus other currencies at the hands of monetary policy enacted by China, it will quite likely have an impact on other economies in the region. There are many overseas corporates with major business interests in the region and if interest and FX rates do move as expected, decisions will need to be made about the response: falling interest rates in China lowers prices, local revenues will drop accordingly and costs will have to be taken out somewhere.</p>
<h3 id=""some-sources-of-risk"">Some sources of risk</h3>
<p>It is obvious that companies with floating rate debt are negatively exposed to increases in interest rates, whereas companies with borrowings which are totally or partly fixed are exposed to falls in interest rates. However, bond prices always move in the opposite direction to interest rates, so any rise will decrease their value. This may seem counter-intuitive, but newly issued bonds will reflect the new higher rate so that pre-existing bonds will have to re-price downwards to offer investors the same yield. Although a non-financial firm will usually report its bonds on issue in financial statements at levels often different to their face value, early redemptions must be done at market value which may be significantly different because interest rates change the value of fixed-rate debt. It is the case too that a pension scheme also faces interest rate risk in that its liabilities act in a similar way to bond value, falling in value as interest rates rise (and vice versa).</p>
<p>Derivatives (such as interest rate swaps, futures or options) are impacted by interest rate changes, representing either an opportunity gain or loss (if the transaction is finalised on maturity). An FX forward, where rates are affected by the differential between domestic interest rates and foreign rates, may for example see an increase in the domestic rate relative to offshore rates in which case the cost of hedging imports will rise as the cost of hedging exports falls.</p>
<h3 id=""made-to-measure"">Made to measure</h3>
<p>In seeking to mitigate interest rate risk, first of all, it should be understood that regardless of the system of measurement, the results achieved – and thus the efficacy of that system – hangs entirely on the validity of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the basic methodologies used to model interest rate risk exposure. This observation from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, from its publication, ‘The Principles for the Management and supervision of Interest Rate Risk’, is aimed principally at banks subject to Basel II, but is nonetheless wholly relevant for treasurers.</p>
<p>The document (currently under discussion for Basel III enhancement) stresses further that when designing an interest rate risk measurement system, those responsible “should ensure that the degree of detail about the nature of their interest-sensitive positions is commensurate with the complexity and risk inherent in those positions”. As an example, when using gap analysis to explore exposures, “the precision of interest rate risk measurement depends in part on the number of time bands into which positions are aggregated”. The aggregation of positions/cash flows into broad time bands implies some loss of precision and, in practice, the organisation using this system “must assess the significance of the potential loss of precision in determining the extent of aggregation and simplification to be built into the measurement approach”. The integrity and timeliness of data on current positions is, it adds, a key component of the risk measurement process.</p>
<h3 id=""risk-management-and-more"">Risk management and more</h3>
<p>In the context of interest rate risk management, the role of the treasurer is to focus on possibilities – asking what can possibly happen and how can the company protect itself and secure an acceptable degree of certainty in the circumstances. Treasury therefore needs to be prepared for any possibility so that the business is not seen to be gambling with the turn of events. In the first instance, such preparedness requires the ability to know and understand exposures in all entities, including subsidiaries. The use of simple spreadsheet tools may provide a broad measurement of the impact of small changes of interest rates on a firm’s accounting income, but might not be the optimal approach when attempting to understand more fully what the impact is of rate changes on those exposures.</p>
<p>For this reason, it may be prudent for an organisation to deploy a more technologically advanced assist, integrating their ERP systems with their TMS perhaps to gain more automation of processes and thus more certainty around the accuracy of analysis of interest rates (and of course the interlinked FX movements). The actual tools used will depend on the level of exposure but it can be an arduous and inefficient exercise if treasury is spending a lot of time trying to recreate formulae and testing spreadsheets to assess the potential impact on a variety of factors and variables of movement in interest and accompanying FX rates; this may be a driver for the acquisition of new technologies.</p>
<p>If the appropriate sensitivity analysis models are in place, the right data is readily available and the business knows its exposures, then the process can be relatively straightforward for most operations. It may be desirable to implement more advanced means of measurement of the impact of multiple hypothetical interest and FX rates changes on cashflow, capital and future earnings. But as long as the organisation understands what is going to happen to it if interest rates shift then its vulnerability potentially decreases. It must therefore measure that vulnerability under stressed market conditions. A part of this process is to analyse the effect of the breakdown of core assumptions around the market, creating a number of stressed ‘what-if’ scenarios. Whether the rate shift is immediate and sustained, gradual, parallel (all maturities on the yield curve change by the same amount) or whether it shifts more at the back end of the yield curve where there may be less exposure, the key always is to understand at different points in time what the effect of change is. Large organisations with exposures going out months and probably years must undertake proper analysis covering all points in that period.</p>
<h3 id=""instruments-of-protection"">Instruments of protection</h3>
<p>There are many ways that interest rate risk can be managed. The simplest method is when the borrower requests its lender to fix the interest rate of its loan for the period of the loan, although this has its own inherent risk if rates fall. Natural hedges may be used where interest rate exposures are created that are offset by elements of the company’s natural business cycle (a construction firm, for example, will see a rise in business activity when interest rates fall, as investors build more when the cost of projects is lower). Also many companies that wish to hedge macro-level interest rate risk will use instruments such as interest rate swaps. These are simple to understand and tend to be favourably treated from an accounting perspective making them relatively easy for treasury and accounting to comply with from a regulations standpoint.</p>


<blockquote>The kind of action to be taken will come about following the determination of the appropriate risk appetite for the organisation and its stakeholders. Every business should have drafted and implemented a guiding policy.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Slightly more complex is optionality within instruments such as swaptions (the right but not the obligation to swap), bond forwards (where the short position agrees to deliver pre-specified bonds to the long position at a set price and within a defined time window), interest rate futures (allowing the buyer and seller to lock in the price of the interest-bearing asset for a future date). Caps, floors and collars are commonly used ‘over-the-counter’ (OTC) products. Caps fix the interest rate payable by a borrower over its life and below the cap level, the interest rate payable is floating. The main use is by borrowers who need to avoid covenant breaches that would otherwise be caused by sharp rises in rates. A floor is an option that fixes the minimum interest rate receivable over its life; treasurers with cash invested might buy a floor that is lower than current interest rates to set a minimum return. Collars set a corridor of possible interest rates between a maximum and a minimum. As with FX options, it is also possible to start combining different derivative positions into larger strategies.</p>
<p>Arguably interest rate management does not need to be complex and that the plain vanilla instruments work when protecting against macro-level interest rate exposure. And whereas FX management tends to require a more reactive response because it constantly changes, interest rate changes are fewer and further between and are more predictable, giving time for a considered response. But whilst treasurers will not be constantly putting swaps on and taking them off in response to events, rate movements can be more impactful when they do occur and cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3 id=""a-matter-of-policy"">A matter of policy</h3>
<p>Managing interest rate risk suggests that certain actions must be taken, but of course it may be that doing nothing is the best approach. This can only be confirmed if the business has the right analysis, drawn from the most appropriate and timely information. Treasury does not necessarily need to hedge to protect against interest rate movements, it just needs to know what to expect and to set those expectations with the company’s senior executives, board and shareholders. It is also the case that every set of financial statements (for IAS, IFRS et al) ask for the kind of analyses that can show the impact of certain percentage changes in interest and FX rates as a demonstration of risk management visibility and transparency to the investment community.</p>
<p>The kind of action to be taken will come about following the determination of the appropriate risk appetite for the organisation and its stakeholders. Every business should have drafted and implemented a guiding policy – certainly where the use of financial instruments is required to manage interest rate risk – and this will hopefully be an informed decision based on close study of the variables that the business is affected by. Of course, the decision points will be different for each organisation based on circumstances and stakeholder expectations but a heavy borrower will be more sensitised to changes in interest rates than one which tends to invest more.</p>
<p>According to the Basel Committee, policy should define those responsible for managing interest rate risk and should ensure that there is adequate separation of duties in key elements of the risk management process “to avoid potential conflicts of interest”. Additionally, it advises that interest rate risk should be monitored on a “consolidated, comprehensive basis, to include interest rate exposures in subsidiaries”.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the policy document should be reviewed on a regular basis. If analysis highlights company exposures at a macro and micro level for each component of the business, then it will enable the treasurer to make the best possible decisions. This level of understanding should also be seen as an opportunity for treasury to proactively engage in continued discussion with the rest of the business and its key stakeholders, helping to steer future policy direction.</p>
<p>A stale policy – one that has not been appropriately updated – around any form of risk management puts the company in a position where it may not be aligned with the reality of the market place: this is a dangerous scenario. But in the context of interest rate risk it is not just the actual rate movements which could negatively impact a business: any expansion into new territories or markets that have different interest rate profiles from existing market activities could upset the validity of existing underlying assumptions and the modelling accuracy of interest rate risk exposure. It is important to understand that the realities of the business and where it operates will determine what its overall exposure is and thus what its risk management policy should be.</p>
<p>The response to rate movements is therefore not just about the making of assumptions but also about validating those assumptions, being prepared with an accurate view of what the outcomes will be across the business and, ultimately, taking the appropriate decision to ensure the business is protected.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>After a period of little or no inflation in many of the world’s leading economies, it appears we could now be approaching the point where prices finally begin to tick higher. What type of inflation environment can we expect going forward, and how should corporates analyse and quantify their explicit and implicit inflation risk? In this article, experts from banks and leading risk consultancies discuss these and other important questions.</em></p>
<p>“We think inflation right now is at a nadir,” says Adam Chester, Head of Macroeconomics, Commercial Banking at Lloyds Bank. That’s right. After many long months of subdued inflation across the most G7 economies, signs that change is now afoot are now being picked up.</p>
<p>Concerns over disinflation – or even deflation – are beginning to ease in America. By late April, the US ten-year “break-even” rate, which measures average market expectations over the same time period had recovered from a 1.53% low in January to 1.92%, its highest point since November 2014, and a reflection of the higher core inflation now being recorded in the US.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the UK, price indexes may, despite the recent slip into negative inflation, also be about to move higher. In the past year plunging energy prices, combined with aggressive high-street discounting and a period of sustained strength in sterling weighing on imports have together produced months of flat headline inflation figures. But the significance of these factors is now waning. Brent crude is back up at around $65 a barrel. There is too some evidence that high-street discounting is starting to slow compared with the frenetic pace we saw in 2014. Exchange rate movements have been more mixed – sterling bounced back slightly post-election – but dollar/sterling is still well below where it was in the early part of last year.</p>
<p>“The falling out of the base effects of those three things will I think cause inflation to move higher as we move into the second half of this year,” says Chester. “We have headline inflation at the end of this year back at 1%. In the medium term, the key driver will be the underlying dynamics of the UK economy, and in particular how wage growth materialises. There are some tentative signs that wage pressures are starting to emerge as the labour market tightens, and we think that will continue.”</p>
<p>Then there is the Eurozone. Just a few months ago, we were hearing talk (unfounded though it seemed) that the single market may be entering a deflationary ‘lost decade’ akin to what Japan is only now gradually emerging from. But even here the picture is changing. At the end of April four months of declining prices in the euro area was officially declared over. Inflation in the Eurozone now stands at an annual rate of zero, a sub-target level that highlights the fact that there is still some way to go. However, with the European Central Bank’s programme of quantitative easing set stimulate prices further up until its conclusion in the autumn of 2016, it would be tempting to conclude that a corner has now been turned.</p>
<p>One does not need to be an investor or central banker to understand that this turnaround represents good news for the global economy. Inflation is not intrinsically good or bad. But like GDP growth and industrial production increases, a moderately higher rate of inflation can be taken as a sign that a recovery is under way. For businesses the contrary scenario, as recently played out in Japan, would have been very harmful. Deflation drives up the real cost of debt, depresses asset values and, ultimately, defers consumer consumption. Whatever business you are in, everyone west of the Urals should be relieved that scenario no longer looks likely to play out.</p>
<p>However, the return of inflation also raises risk management questions for corporates. In this still uncertain environment, corporate treasurers – even those at companies without any direct linkages to inflation on the balance sheet – should consider defining an appropriate strategy to understand the risks they are facing and reduce the impact on their business of uncertainty related to market movements and central banks actions. Perhaps it’s time to recap on the basics.</p>
<h3 id=""different-impacts"">Different impacts</h3>
<p>The answer to the question of what higher inflation will mean for corporate risk managers ultimately hinges upon the company and the nature of the business they are in. While inflation impacts all companies to one degree or another, the impact tends to manifest itself differently across sectors. How it does, precisely, will often determine both the feasibility and usefulness of risk mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are those with direct linkages to inflation. This category includes companies, like utilities firms, who have tangible linkages to inflation in both revenues and the asset base. It could also include any commercial real-estate owners, companies with commercial offices or indeed retail outlets on long-dated leases that are also linked to inflation.</p>
<p>These two broad groups of corporate clients, because they have an explicit link to inflation in their business, tend by virtue of that to be the main users of inflation-linked hedging products. Like any hedging exercise the objective here is to foster greater stability in cash flows and the balance sheet. “An investment into a utility company is akin to investing into an index-linked bond in that the return is 100% inflation linked, to the extent that the corporate doesn’t hedge any,” says Aled Patchett, Director, Financial Risk Advisory at Lloyds. “As a result of that linkage they tend to hedge a large proportion of their inflation risk.”</p>
<h3 id=""understanding-the-implicit"">Understanding the implicit</h3>
<p>Then you have the other – much bigger – set of companies, those that have exposures that are more implicitly linked to inflation; that is revenues or costs that broadly, but not exactly, track inflation over time. Hedging inflation risk is difficult for these types of companies and because of that many opt to simply ignore the risk. There are a number of reasons why it is difficult, beyond the obvious point that it is harder for companies to work out precisely which costs are linked to inflation, which revenues are linked to inflation and where there might be a natural offset or hedge within the business.</p>
<p>The first relates to the accounting treatment of any potential hedges. “It is not straightforward for them to hedge their implicit exposures because won’t get good hedge accounting unless they can point to an explicit underlying inflation contract,” explains Patchett.</p>
<p>Hedging inflation exposures with certain types of derivatives might prove dangerous if ones projections are not spot on. Hedging is simpler when a company has something that is contractually linked to inflation, all one has to do is purchase an inflation swap linked to the performance an index like the Consumer Price Index (CPI). But try to use an index to hedge an exposure that is only implicitly linked to inflation would expose themselves to basis risk, that is the risk that the inflation hedging strategy will not experience price changes entirely matched (eg opposite directions from each other) to the underlying inflation exposure.</p>
<p>“If I have a cost base that roughly tracks inflation, but not perfectly, I will have basis risk between how the cost actually moves and how the inflation index moves,” says Ivan Harkins, Director of Debt and Hedging at risk management consultants JC Rathbone Associates. “That would be quite important in the building trade, for example. In recent years, particularly in London there has been huge inflation in building costs that has completely outpaced the consumer price index.” Harkins points out that companies with risks of this nature would be advised to consider their hedges very carefully before proceeding. “Hedging exposures, where there is a significant basis risk, with an instrument like a swap can be dangerous because you can incur a liability under the hedge that does not match the underlying you are trying to hedge.”</p>
<p>For these reasons, those that hedge implicit linkages to inflation are few in number relative to the utilities and energy companies who tend to dominate the inflation linked derivatives market. Even those treasurers who decide not to actively hedge inflation risk still need to be mindful of their company’s exposures, however, especially given the fact that a changing inflationary environment often reflects changes in other financial exposures.</p>
<p>“What is really important to understand is that the three main factors which will drive higher inflation – energy prices, aggressive discounting, and the strength of sterling – means that for a much broader set of companies who historically think that inflation is not their biggest risk, the drivers of higher inflation can be very meaningful to them in terms of their exposures to financial markets,” says Yuri Polyakov, Head of Financial Risk Advisory, Lloyds Bank. “For a treasurer looking at the dynamics of inflation, they really need to be thinking about what the direction of oil prices or the weak sterling means for their business, for example.”</p>
<h3 id=""cost-or-revenue-sensitive"">Cost or revenue sensitive?</h3>
<p>Determining what types of exposures one has, explicit and implicit, is the first step. The next is determining where the exposures reside and quantifying them. One method that Commerzbank’s corporate solutions team uses to assist clients with this employs an inflation sensitivity matrix; on one side sits a cost sensitivity metric and on the other side is a revenue inflation sensitivity metric. Companies that exhibit a high correlation of sales to inflation may benefit from monetising their exposures through for example, issuing inflation linked debt, while firms that demonstrate sensitivity to cost inflation would typically benefit from executing hedges against higher inflation.</p>
<p>“Hedging inflation is the final part of a process,” says Satu Jaatinen, Head of Corporate Solutions at Commerzbank. “To figure out a company’s exposure to cost inflation is not always completely straightforward.” How Commerzbank approaches it is by using a mix of measures that they believe denote cost inflation sensitivity for a corporate. One of these is comparing EBITDA growth to inflation growth, with a negative correlation between the two indicating cost sensitivity. Others include the inverse of EBITDA margin and percentage of fixed costs of total costs. As Jaatinen explains the EBITDA margin can be helpful in determining where the more significant exposures reside. “If you have a very low EBITDA margin, you are more exposed to for example, wage inflation moving higher than if you have a high EBITDA margin. We use this mix of measures (“cost inflation indicator”) also in our pension exposure analysis to see how much inflation cost exposure companies have already before the additional inflation exposure stemming from pensions.”</p>
<p>Again it is important to note that there is a sector angle to this. Precisely where a company appears on Commerzbank’s inflation risk matrix will to some extent be determined by the business they are in. One can imagine how utilities companies’ revenues are naturally linked to inflation (sometimes through an explicit inflation to price linkage) and they typically benefit from a higher inflation environment. Service sector companies however, will have a higher concentration of wages on their accounts and will be more likely to suffer from higher inflation. As such, revenue sensitive industries, as measured by the correlation between their revenues and inflation, appear to mainly reside in the oil and gas, utilities, basic resources, travel and leisure and to a lesser extent, food and beverages sectors. Meanwhile, companies that seem to be more cost than revenue sensitive in the matrix (applied to Eurostoxx companies) are more likely to be operating in the telecoms, technology and automobile industries. The matrix sometimes reveals individual companies’ dislocations compared to industry average too as exposures do vary from company to company.</p>
<p>As an interesting side note on Germany, when the cost sensitivity is measured by fixed costs as percentage of total costs, only one industry in the DAX – technology and telecommunications – was deemed to be more sensitive to cost than revenue inflation. Within MDAX however, a whole lot more industries (eg healthcare, industrial goods and services, chemicals, oil and gas, retail and technology) showed up as being more cost- than revenue-sensitive to inflation. This could be explained by a higher percentage of domestic labour force as well as higher operational leverage in the MDAX vs DAX industries, Jaatinen explains.</p>
<h3 id=""finding-the-right-hedge"">Finding the right hedge</h3>
<p>Identifying whether your business is cost or revenue sensitive is of crucial importance when it comes to evaluating the suitability of different hedging strategies. For example, companies in sectors that are more revenue than cost sensitive could see benefits from hedging their inflation exposures through inflation linked debt issuance. Inflation linked bonds offer companies a means of offsetting the volatility in their sales revenues with the cash flows incurred through debt payments. There is but one problem with this strategy. “The challenge in the inflation linked investment market is that it is finite,” says Lloyd’s Patchett. “There are a small number of investors who will buy inflation linked paper. That means a corporate cannot go to the market and issue an indeterminate amount of bonds any given year.”</p>
<p>Consequently, alternative strategies are sometimes pursued. One of these, Patchett explains, would be to issue a normal fixed-rate bond before embedding an inflation swap which transforms the fixed bond coupons to inflation. “The other option is to create [the inflation link] through the derivatives market,” he says. By doing that companies can obtain “cash flows that exactly match what an inflation linked bond would look like.” The other relates to the accounting treatment of any potential hedges. “As hedge accounting is really only achievable if a corporate can point to an explicit underlying inflation contract,” explains Patchett.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for companies with inflation exposures in their cost base, utilising the purchase of inflation linked derivative contracts is more often the better strategy. A company with exposure to inflation through rental contracts, for example, might choose to create a pay-out in with an inflation swap that exactly matches the inflation increases set by their landlords. Liquidity in this market can also be lacking at times, but it is said to have improved a lot since the market’s infancy in the early 2000s. Today, it is proving particularly useful means of hedging for companies with inflation cost sensitivities. “If you’ve got a 20 year inflation linked lease so that every year the rental payment increases by inflation obviously there is a huge amount of uncertainty around what your rental costs may be over a 20 year period,” says Patchett. “But you can forgo that uncertainty by entering into a hedge, the bank pays the uncertain component and they swap that for a known payments schedule over the twenty year contract.”</p>
<h3 id=""everyones-concern"">Everyone’s concern</h3>
<p>Whether one decides to hedge inflation with a derivative, monetise it with a bond or simply just decide to tolerate it, it is evident that no risk-conscious corporate treasurer can afford to ignore inflation entirely. Forecasts suggesting that inflation is ripe for a rise should unquestionably be noted by treasurers as any rise in prices will have implications for almost every aspect of their work.</p>
<p>Take, for example, cash management and the growing levels of liquidity on corporate balance sheets. Last year a research report, professional services firm Deloitte found that the 1,200 listed companies in the region have built up their cash reserves by €47bn over the past year, bringing total cash reserves to €963bn. This represents an increase of around €250bn on the reserves recorded in 2007.</p>
<p>The reserves now swelling corporate balance sheets underline just why treasurers need to be cognisant of inflation, even if it is not deemed to be a risk worth hedging. “A lot of people forget that when they hold large cash balances, for whatever valid reasons that may be, in an environment where there is high inflation those cash balances lose purchasing power to inflation every year,” says Lloyds’ Polyakov. “It is not just negative yields on corporate cash balances, it is actually how much money you are losing to inflation. So that is something corporate cash and portfolio managers clearly need to consider.”</p>

<h2>China’s Markets: Interpreting Interest Rate Volatility</h2>
<!-- <h3>China Money Market Series Part 1</h3> -->
<p>China’s domestic bond market is in a new phase of its rapid evolution, as the investor base is broadening and strengthening with increased interest from institutional buyers focused on the front end of the market. The attraction for these typically more-conservative investors is a large and liquid market, which caters to a wide range of very secure borrowers, and offers more attractive yields than those available on bank deposits. However, a key idiosyncrasy of China’s market at this stage of its development is heightened volatility at the front end of the yield curve, with considerable implications for risk and returns. Understanding the nature and drivers of volatility is important for navigating China’s markets, in our view, and active management can help turn this challenge to investors’ advantage.</p>
<p>China’s ascendance in the ranks of global markets has been swift. In the past couple of decades, China’s bond market has grown in both size and depth to become the third largest in the world at more than $4 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements, with trading volumes topping $43 trillion in 2013. This liquidity has become a key attraction for institutional investors globally. Most corporate treasuries have already gained exposure to Chinese fixed income via money market fund (MMF) investments, and pension funds and sovereign investors are showing increased interest.</p>

<p>The benefits of market access via MMFs include exposure to the highest quality issuers in the government-, quasi government- and banking sectors, potentially higher yields than are available on bank deposits and, depending on the fund, management consistent with global standards for triple-A rated stable net asset value (NAV) funds such as tight limitations on interest rate risk. Moreover, we believe active management is necessary to help address anomalies in China’s short-term markets that have significant implications for investor portfolios.</p>

<h3 id=""not-your-average-market-nature-and-drivers-of-volatility"">Not Your Average Market – Nature and Drivers of Volatility</h3>
<p>For institutional investors, the most significant anomaly in China’s rates markets is their volatility. The typical relationship between tenor and range is inverted, so that instead of increasing with the length of maturity, volatility is most pronounced at the front end of the yield curve. <a href=""#figure-2"">Figure 2</a> shows that the annual ranges of yields on shorter-dated securities are considerably wider than those for longer-dated securities. This phenomenon has been consistent over a number of years, though year-to-date the range is substantially smaller than it was in 2013, when a midyear credit crunch drew international attention. In this instance, short-term benchmark rates rose several percentage points on the convergence of several catalysts for volatility: seasonal effects, foreign exchange flows, reduced bank lending and a pullback in support from the central bank.</p>

<p>Given the degree of potential volatility in China’s markets, it pays to understand the drivers. The most predictable one is seasonal, as liquidity constraints are common around major holidays such as Chinese New Year and key quarter-end balance dates. Around holidays, the fluctuations are attributable to consumption patterns and resulting bank behavior. For example, consumers draw down savings for vacation spending, and immigrant workers returning to their home provinces bring cash for their families. To cater to this demand, banks accumulate cash by borrowing in the repurchase (repo) markets and offering higher yields on interbank deposits. The quarter- and year-end spikes are also common but less pronounced, and they occur when banks store up cash to meet required loan-to-deposit ratios at the end of each reporting period.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>These seasonal effects are closely followed by the central bank, which has the capacity to intervene via its open market operations to alleviate liquidity pressures. That said, market observers note that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has been known to tolerate significant levels of volatility before intervening materially, as was the case in May/June 2013. Moreover, the triggers for intervention are not fully transparent, and no clear pattern of intervention has emerged.</p>
<p>Volatility in China’s short term markets is also partly attributable to fluctuations in foreign capital flows. Over much of the past decade China has seen strong inflows as international investors have looked to capitalize on the Renminbi’s appreciation versus the US dollar. These flows, all else equal, inject liquidity into China’s financial system, exerting downward pressure on money market rates. In order to stabilize money market rates, the PBoC has historically relied on the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), which determines the share of deposits banks must set aside in case of financial trouble. By raising this ratio periodically, the PBoC created extra demand for liquidity from banks, which helped absorb foreign currency inflows. As <a href=""#figure-3"">Figure 3</a> shows, between 2005 and 2011 when inflows were generally substantially positive, the RRR was consistently raised (with the exception of reductions during the global financial crisis). However the RRR is a blunt tool: rates would head lower as foreign currency inflows accumulated, then spike after each RRR hike.</p>

<p>Since 2011, foreign currency flows have become more volatile and two-way in nature, in part due to slowing growth outcomes and most recently due to the PBoC doubling the currency’s daily trading earlier this year. At the same time, the PBoC has implemented new tools, relying increasingly on Open Market Operations of varying tenors to help fine-tune market liquidity. However, as noted above, the triggers and patterns of its interventions are unpredictable.</p>

<p>In China particularly, such insights are not just helpful to understand market behavior – they are instrumental in helping manage interest rate risk. Active management of an asset portfolio’s duration can aid in reducing adverse market movements when rates are rising, and allow increased yield generation when yields are falling. Volatility of this kind raises important risk and return considerations for investors in short-duration or money market funds as interest rate fluctuations increase the potential for higher earnings, but also the risk of underperformance on adverse market moves.</p>
<p>The volatile front end provides substantial scope for individual specialists to differentiate their performance, as managers better able to anticipate and position flexibly for large movements in short rates are likely to be able to deliver better returns for clients. <a href=""#figure-4"">Figure 4</a> highlights this point by showing a significant distribution of performance across a range of Fitch AAA money market strategies. Though all are limited to a 75-day weighted average maturity (WAM), the return differential between the highest and lowest yielding funds can often exceed 50bps.</p>

<p>In sum, we see a trend of continued expansion in the investor base for Chinese debt, and particularly with the increased attention from more conservative institutional buyers. For these investors, the attractions of risk diversification in a liquid market of increasingly high quality are clear. However, alongside these benefits are factors idiosyncratic to this stage of China’s market development, which contribute to volatility. As a result, an informed approach is key to navigating China’s markets, in our view, and investors need to take an active role in managing the risks to reap the rewards.</p>

Managing liquidity through periods of rising interest rates,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Investors have grown accustomed to an environment of record low interest rates. However, comments from the world’s major central banks, coupled with improving economic growth expectations, suggest that investors may soon have to adapt to a changing rate environment. For those investing for the short term to meet cash management needs, ensuring preservation of capital and maintaining liquidity as interest rates rise is a key priority. An understanding of how different cash-like investments are affected by rising rates can help treasurers position their portfolios to achieve this.</p>
<h3 id=""the-current-yield-constrained-environment"">The current, yield-constrained environment</h3>
<p>Since the financial crisis of 2008, the world’s major central banks have, to varying degrees, pursued ultra-loose monetary policies to stimulate economic activity. The US Federal Reserve (the Fed) was the earliest advocate of this approach, taking its benchmark federal funds rate to a record low of 0-0.25% in December of 2008, where it has remained since. The Bank of England followed suit soon thereafter, in March 2009 reducing its key rate to 0.50%, while the European Central Bank has gradually cut Eurozone interest rates from 2.00% in 2009 to their current record low level of 0.50%.</p>
<p>While interest rates have languished at historic lows, the unprecedented asset-purchase programmes of the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have served to inflate the prices of bonds, supressing yields further still. With the debt crisis in the Eurozone periphery raising concerns over a possible break-up of the currency bloc, and with developed markets in a prolonged slump, the yield on the US ten-year Treasury bond hit an all-time low just below 1.4% in July 2012. This was down from a high of nearly 15.9% in September 1981, as shown in the chart below. UK Gilt and German Bund yields have also fallen to their lowest ever levels.</p>

<p>The yield-constrained environment of the last few years has been a challenging one for liquidity investors looking to meet their short-term cash needs, particularly as inflationary pressures have served to erode returns. Conditions, however, now look to be changing and yields are picking up from their lows – since April, the interest rate on the ten-year US Treasury has risen by more than 100 basis points. Although this is likely to be a gradual process and central bank policy rates may remain on hold for some time yet, liquidity investors need to be prepared for an eventual normalisation of interest rates.</p>
<h3 id=""lower-for-how-much-longer"">Lower for how much longer?</h3>
<p>As the outlook for economic growth in the developed world has improved, investors are increasingly focusing on how much longer central banks will keep interest rates at record lows and when they will change the trajectory of their asset-purchase programmes. This focus by investors has already led to a significant rise in benchmark bond yields from their record lows. For the first time in many years, the broader fixed-income asset class has experienced negative returns.</p>
<p>The current era of extraordinarily low interest rates is best explained by the unprecedented actions by the Fed and other central banks in response to the financial crisis. We have already seen above how the Fed initially employed traditional monetary policy tools, lowering the federal funds target rate from 5.25% in September 2007 to a 0%-to-0.25% range in December 2008 (where it has remained since). Then, in November 2008, amid near-frozen credit markets, overnight rates close to zero and the US economy mired in the worst recession since the 1930s, the Fed embarked on a programme of quantitative easing (QE). The central bank extended the size and average maturity of their balance sheet assets through the purchase of Agency debentures, Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and Treasuries. These actions sought to contain the financial crisis, limit its impact on the broader economy, and aid the prolonged recovery by lowering longer-term interest rates to encourage investment and consumption.</p>
<p>Roll forward to May 2013, and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke was indicating that the Fed could begin reducing its monthly asset purchases later this year if improvements in economic growth seemed sustainable. This indication was followed in June by a statement that asset purchases may end altogether in 2014. As a result, investors aggressively sold both risk assets and Treasuries, causing the yield on the ten-year Treasury to rise to over 2.60% in June, from just 1.63% at the beginning of May. Credit spreads also widened approximately 30 bps over that period (as measured by the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade index). While yields have retraced somewhat since that initial reaction, they remain higher for UST maturities longer than two years as of mid-2013. The rise in yields across the curve, from two years out, is shown in Chart 2.</p>

</figure>
<p>As the central bank has signalled, reductions in asset purchases will be the first step toward the normalisation of monetary policy (the Fed has repeatedly emphasised that this decision will be “data dependent”). Ending the QE programme would be its second step. If economic conditions warrant, the Fed’s next moves would include modification of forward guidance regarding, and the eventual raising of, the federal funds target rate.</p>
<p>Fed communications suggest that the current level of the target rate will likely remain appropriate for a considerable period of time. But as investors anticipate diminished monetary accommodation and eventual tightening by the Fed, demand for fixed income securities will fall, causing prices to drop and market interest rates to rise.</p>
<p>In Europe, monetary authorities have begun to issue forward guidance about the future direction of rates to try to stem rising bond yields in reaction to US tapering. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have sought to reassure markets that rates will remain at record lows for a prolonged time so that borrowing rates remain attractive and continue to stimulate economic growth. Nevertheless, with interest rate policy having been effectively made conditional on improvements in the real economy, there remains considerable uncertainty about the actual timing of rate rises.</p>
<h3 id=""allocating-cash-most-effectively-ahead-of-rising-rates"">Allocating cash most effectively ahead of rising rates</h3>
<p>Given rates are at record lows and unlikely to fall much further, and with economic activity picking up in North America and in Europe too, it is safe to say that interest rates will begin to trend upwards at some point. We have seen that bond markets are already adjusting to a period of interest rate normalisation. As interest rates and yields rise, short-term cash investors will also have to adjust to ensure that capital is preserved and liquidity is maintained.</p>
<p>This is because all fixed income and short-term portfolios carry an inherent level of interest rate risk, so rising rates will have an impact on the current and future values of existing cash holdings, as well as influence the relative attractiveness of different investments for meeting specific investment needs. Investors with short-term investment horizons should therefore consider the potential effects of rising interest rates on the instruments at their disposal and adjust their exposures accordingly.</p>
<h3 id=""strategies-to-insulate-a-portfolio-from-rising-rates"">Strategies to insulate a portfolio from rising rates</h3>
<p>How can an investor protect a portfolio of bonds in a period of rising rates? Though some investors may choose to simply exit the asset class, there are strong arguments for maintaining a core allocation to fixed income. In most rate environments, fixed income provides diversification, a steady stream of income and a lower volatility investment over time. Additionally, fixed income portfolios with greater duration have historically provided higher returns, albeit with greater volatility, over longer time horizons. However, for investors with shorter investment horizons (especially those with potential near term cash needs), or those looking to protect profits from longer duration strategies, a key priority is to mitigate potential volatility during the anticipated rising rate period. To that end, investors should consider how they can best deploy two effective strategies for managing a rising rate environment: shortening duration and increasing income.</p>
<h3 id=""shortening-portfolio-weighted-average-duration"">Shortening portfolio weighted average duration</h3>
<p>The most effective way to protect a portfolio from the impact of rising rates is to reduce its weighted average duration. In traditional fixed income portfolios, this is typically achieved using one or more of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sales of longer dated fixed coupon securities, and/or reinvestment of interest income, into those with shorter tenors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investments in higher income or higher yielding securities, which will have shorter interest rate durations relative to bonds with the same maturity. By investing in credits with spreads over the risk free rate, more cash is received on the coupon payment dates thereby shortening the duration and increasing the cash available to be reinvested at higher rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchases of floating rate notes, whose interest rates reset on a regular basis. As a floater’s interest rate resets to adjust for market changes, its price should typically experience less volatility and thus it will have a lower duration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the latter it is worth pointing out that most floating rate notes reset interest rates on a monthly or quarterly basis thus durations on these securities are typically shorter than three months. However, it is important to note that while the owners of such bonds have limited exposure to changes in interest rates, they are exposed to the creditworthiness of the borrower until the final maturity of the bond. This means that floating rate bonds, not issued by the US Treasury, can have longer spread durations than interest rate durations. This can result in greater volatility should credit conditions change.</p>
<h3 id=""increasing-the-interest-income-component-of-total-return"">Increasing the interest income component of total return</h3>
<p>Increased income or yield not only lowers duration but also provides greater income return helping offset declines in price in periods of rising rates. However, higher yields due to increased credit exposure do not come without added risk. Should credit spreads widen in conjunction with rising rates, these securities will under perform. Similar to interest rate duration fixed income investors must be cognizant of spread duration as well. Longer spread durations will typically be more negatively impacted by widening credit spreads.</p>
<p>Due to the risk of widening credit spreads it is important that an investor examine where credit spreads are relative to historical patterns at the beginning of a rising rate period. In recent years, extremely low levels on risk-free rates have forced investors to seek yield in riskier securities, resulting in tighter credit spreads. It is possible that as investors sell fixed income securities in anticipation of higher rates, sales will not be limited to risk-free Treasuries alone and credit product may see spreads widen.</p>
<h3 id=""examples-of-short-duration-product-styles"">Examples of short duration product styles</h3>
<p>As they consider the key elements of investing in a rising rate environment–shorter duration, income cushion, lower credit spread duration – investors can choose among a variety of traditional short-term fixed income products. Rising interest rates will affect different cash-like investments in different ways. Understanding how various cash investments are effected by interest rates allows investors to take action to mitigate the impact of a rising interest rate cycle. The following is a summary of the impact that investors can expect to see from rising rates on the main types of short-term investments:</p>
<h5>Overnight bank deposits:</h5>
<p>Rates tend to track rises in interest rates quite closely, although investors should be aware that, due to being exposed to a single counterparty, credit risk may be higher. Counterparty risk can be reduced through diversification, while potential returns may also be higher from a more diversified investment.</p>
<h5>Term deposits:</h5>
<p>Tend to lag shorter-dated deposits due to the need to wait out the term of the deposit before re-setting to a higher interest rate. These carry the same counterparty risk as overnight deposits, but as they are not marked-to-market, investors are not exposed to unrealised losses.</p>
<h5>Money market funds:</h5>
<p>Will see their yields rise in line with prevailing interest rates, although with a small time lag. Due to their diversified portfolios, they carry a significantly lower level of counterparty risk than overnight or term deposits. Also these are not marked-to-market, so there are no unrealised losses.</p>
<h5>Managed reserves funds:</h5>
<p>Usually have durations between 0.25 and one year, and invest primarily in higher income-generating short-term corporate securities. Due to higher durations, unrealised losses can occur when rates rise. Managed reserves funds have historically outperformed money market funds over longer time periods, as well as offering a higher yield.</p>
<h5>Short-term bond funds:</h5>
<p>Potential to earn higher yields than cash instruments, but longer duration and marked-to-market pricing means that they are more sensitive to interest rate movements. Investors may therefore experience unrealised losses, and therefore need to be certain about the accuracy of their cash flow forecasting before investing in longer duration in a rising rate environment.</p>
<h5>Separate accounts:</h5>
<p>Offer investors the flexibility to tailor portfolios so that they have the specific duration and other risk characteristics that they are comfortable with. However, separate accounts are marked-to-market, and may suffer unrealised losses as interest rates rise.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With the right investment strategy in place, cash investors can ensure that they are best positioned to benefit when interest rates eventually begin to rise. Given that timing the market is fraught with difficulties, treasurers may benefit from a flexible approach that allows them to move cash reserves between different options to suit the prevailing interest rate environment. The first step to designing a robust cash strategy is to recognise that different short-term investments carry different yield, security and liquidity considerations through the interest rate cycle.</p>

 Business Briefing: How do you manage inflation uncertainty?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The Bank of England (BoE) has missed its 2% inflation target for the past 41 consecutive months. How will it manage the inflation environment going forward, and how should corporates analyse and quantify their explicit and implicit inflation risk?</p>
<p>Aled Patchett and Andrea Loddo of Lloyds Bank propose an approach that treasurers may adopt in order to determine their net inflation exposure and the most effective response in different inflation scenarios.</p>
<p>“Given the challenging economic environment in the UK, there is a level of uncertainty as to the inflationary pressure in the coming years,” notes Aled Patchett of Lloyds Bank’s Risk Management Solutions team. The Bank of England (BoE) has missed its 2% inflation target for 41 consecutive months, and instead its monetary policy is clearly allowing inflation to hover around 3%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, as China puts restrictions on property investment in order to try to cap inflation, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has been taking the view that inflation should rise in an attempt to stimulate the economy, and has set about doing this by printing more money. In such an uncertain environment, corporate treasurers should consider defining an appropriate strategy to reduce the impact on their business of uncertainty related to market movements and central banks actions.</p>
<p>The real debate around managing inflation risk starts with how a business quantifies its level of exposure, says Andrea Loddo of Lloyds Bank Financial Risk Advisory group. Some companies may argue that they do not have exposure to inflation; however a more thorough analysis may highlight that in fact inflation does indeed have an impact on financial performance.</p>
<p>A company may begin to determine its exposure to inflation through either a qualitative scorecard analysis or a quantitative analysis. In order to quantify the correlation between revenues and inflation, the latter may require some detailed modelling and historic revenue streams analysis. These revenue streams should be adjusted in order to strip out any change in revenues arising through, for example, M&amp;A activity. However, if it is a well-established operation with predictable revenue streams, it will be relatively easy to establish the dependence of inflation to key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<p>Given the potential impact on KPIs, it is important that treasurers understand the precise nature of their exposure to inflation. Establishing whether companies are net receivers of inflation (with risk manifesting in prices, sales, contracts and subscriptions or property value for example) or net payers (eg labour costs, lease obligations, maintenance pensions or debt) is the first step that can help treasurers in quantifying the net exposure to inflation. After this exercise has been completed, the treasurers can decide if actions should be taken to mitigate the net inflation exposure; it may transpire that doing nothing is the optimal approach.</p>

<p>If we look at the inflation market, inflation break-even rates are historically more volatile on short maturities. Chart 2 shows the historical distribution of inflation breakeven rates over the past nine years. Break-even rates beyond the 10-year maturity are relatively less volatile. The relative ‘stickiness’ of inflation on long tenors has probably been one of the motivations behind the “no action policy”, but Loddo warns against complacency.</p>

<h3 id=""understanding-inflation-risk"">Understanding inflation risk</h3>
<p>The impact of inflation on a business manifests itself in both cash flows and the balance sheet. For businesses with 100% nominal debt and revenues linked to inflation, a high inflationary environment is beneficial because their nominal debt is essentially eroded while their revenues rise. However, a low inflation scenario will be detrimental for this type of company.</p>
<p>Treasures should consider protecting the shareholders from significant moves in profitability driven by inflation. In a high inflationary environment, the ‘do nothing’ approach is perhaps an acceptable one. However, in a low inflation environment a business may find itself in a position where its debt is not eroding as quickly as anticipated and its revenues are stagnating, or even reducing. The impact of inflation is larger for companies with higher leverage, notes Loddo. It is then important to take into consideration the nature of the exposure to inflation. If, for example, costs rather than revenues exhibit inflation-linkage then under a high inflation environment the net profit would be eroded. This effect, however, would be naturally offset by nominal debt being eroded.</p>
<p>Few companies have assets and revenues that are 100% linked to inflation (such as the UK-regulated utility sector). Most commonly the asset valuation is simply the present value (PV) of the expected future cash flows. If cash flows are projected to increase in line with inflation (at least directionally), as inflation rises the PV of those cash flows increases, so the valuation of the assets increases and therefore the company could increase its debt capacity. Hence, it follows that if inflation falls the converse is true and the company may not be able to increase its debt capacity without increasing leverage. The leverage profile of a company may therefore be impacted by inflation and the magnitude of this impact is what we are trying to assess.</p>
<p>Accepting that inflation impacts a large number of companies, it is a little surprising that the number of entities hedging their inflation risk is in fact a relatively small subset of the market. UK utilities are one example: they have managed their inflation risk by either issuing inflation-linked bonds (such as National Grid and Anglian Water) or using inflation swaps to transform their nominal debt into inflation linked debt. Some others that have also adopted inflation solutions are transport infrastructure owners (such as BAA and Network Rail), major retail supermarkets, some telecom players and companies in the real-estate sector (rental streams tend to be long term and linked to inflation).</p>
<p>In this context, it is important to highlight that hedging per se is not always the optimal decision. A thorough analysis of the business may show the net inflation position, as there will likely be natural offsets which mitigate the overall exposure to inflation. It is important that the treasurer understands what tools they have available to them to mitigate the inflation exposure when necessary. With continued inflation uncertainty, now is a good time for treasurers to think about this topic, says Loddo.</p>
<h3 id=""traditional-inflation-risk-mitigants"">Traditional inflation risk mitigants</h3>
<p>A number of Lloyds’ clients have adopted a hedging strategy that utilises revenue inflation swaps. They remove uncertainty by swapping variable inflation-linked changes with known uplifts to the revenue stream. This enables clients to finance their business knowing exactly how much debt they can support over the period, and also gives the bank more certainty in terms of the company’s cash flow streams.</p>
<p>Traditionally revenue inflation swaps have been long dated, as the market is more liquid at longer tenors, and Loddo notes that the reduction of uncertainty around inflation in this way may help the company generate more accurate forecasts, leading to a more solid and predictable business plan.</p>
<p>Businesses with long-dated infrastructure-type assets, such as private finance initiatives (PFIs), adopt risk management strategies based on removing uncertainty from cash flows. As a result they will commonly enter into long dated swaps at the outset of the project to allow them to focus on managing the business and the elements that they can control. They are therefore hedged against future market movements from a cash flow perspective.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study"">Case study</h2>
<h3 id=""mitigating-inflation-linked-risk"">Mitigating inflation-linked risk</h3>
<p>Although inflation can manifest itself in different aspects of the business, such as labour cost, revenues, asset values and maintenance, the factor that typically captures the attention of treasures is the linkage of inflation to revenue streams. In this particular case, possibly the most frequent solution is to reduce the exposure via income swaps.</p>
<p>As an alternative solution, a company can achieve the same risk mitigation effect by looking at a more holistic approach. This approach shows how inflation risk related to cash flows can be efficiently reduced by optimising the current debt mix via inflation linked debt. There are two ways of introducing inflation linked debt: either via issuing indexed linked debt or by swapping a portion of existing nominal debt to inflation via inflation swaps.</p>
<p>The case study is based on a company with £100m net debt and £40m EBITDA, which we assume to have a 20% linkage to inflation over the next three years. We also assume a cost of debt of three month GBP LIBOR + 200bps. We will quantify the cumulative cash flows (EBITDA – Interest Expense) over a three-year horizon under three different debt mix combinations: 100% Fixed, 100% Floating, and 90% Fixed 10% Inflation linked (IL). Additionally, we will evaluate the cumulative cash flows under three different scenarios: expected (as implied by current market forward rates); high rates-high inflation; and low rates-low inflation. The aim is to establish under which scenario one of the three debt mixes can have cost reduction benefits.</p>
<p>Charts 3 and 4 show the expected cumulative cash flows (Y axis) versus the cumulative cash flows under the high rate-high inflation scenario (X-axis, left chart), and low rate-low inflation scenario (X-axis, right chart). On an expected basis, the cumulative cash flow does not materially differ for the three debt mixes. This is because under the current market forward rates, the three debt combinations are, from a cost perspective, similar. However, on a stressed case basis, the three debt mixes exhibit different cost profiles.</p>

</figure>
<p>Under a high inflation-high rate scenario, the 100% Fixed is optimal. By adding IL debt (90% Fixed-10% IL) the increase in EBITDA is partially offset by higher interest expense on the IL debt.</p>
<p>Conversely, in a low inflation-low rate scenario, as expected, the opposite is true and the 100% Floating debt mix is now optimal. The 90% Fixed-10% IL debt mix outperforms the fixed debt mix. This is because the IL debt acts as natural hedge and offsets the decrease in EBITDA due to lower inflation.</p>
<p>Overall, the relative stable position of the grey dot compared to the alternative debt mixes under different market scenarios demonstrates how the inflation risk in EBITDA can be mitigated by adding a portion of IL debt.</p>

<h3 id=""an-alternative-inflation-linked-debt-and-swaps"">An alternative: inflation-linked debt and swaps</h3>
<p>IL debt has traditionally been used by UK utilities, for example, to hedge their IL assets. Unlike nominal bonds, IL bond’s coupons and principals change with inflation.</p>
<p>However, this solution is not necessarily applicable only to utilities. Indeed, it is of no real benefit where a company has little or no exposure to inflation in its business, and it may even exhibit a higher risk profile due to the uncertainty of the final principal payment. But in a low inflation scenario, where there is direct or indirect exposure to inflation that is reflected in the company’s earnings, a portion of interest-linked debt can act as natural hedge, mitigating the overall exposure of the business to inflation. IL debt does not require more attention or scrutiny than other debt – it is just an alternative with a different risk profile and, depending on the business, it may or may not make sense.</p>

</figure>
<p>Companies that consider IL debt may also look at IL swaps as a solution to achieve a similar profile. In considering IL swaps, it is necessary to understand why a business would move from a cash flow hedging angle (specific to businesses which have clear exposure to inflation on a revenue line) to the more holistic balance sheet hedging approach required by IL debt.</p>
<p>Patchett suggests that the IL swap is attractive, from a cash flow perspective, as a hedge against direct or indirect exposure to inflation. In the short term it exhibits positive carry benefits compared to nominal debt (fixed or floating). This is because in the current environment real rates (which can be approximated by nominal rates minus inflation) are negative. As a result, interest expense associated to inflation would be negative in the short term. The caveat here is that at maturity, the company pays the inflation uplift on the initial notional; this explicit inflation linkage may prove too much of a risk for some corporates.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It is crucial here to restate the importance of considering a holistic approach which does not focus exclusively on revenues but includes IL costs as well, such as labour or maintenance. The real aim is not to hedge the largest and most explicit exposure in isolation, but to achieve the right strategic solution which will take into account the natural hedging characteristics associated to each exposure.</p>
<p>It is then important to establish how this approach fits in the overall strategic plan of the company. “The choice of instrument should have a clear motivation behind it,” advises Loddo. Ultimately, IL debt/swap may help companies to achieve a desired risk profile. While these solutions can be efficient from a risk management perspective, the accounting implications should also be understood.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""what-is-a-tms"">What is a TMS?</h3>
<p>A TMS, sometimes referred to as a ‘treasury workstation’ in the US, is a software platform used by corporates to automate, record and control a host of core treasury functions. In addition to these functions, a TMS also acts as a database for core information, such as bank account data, that passes through the treasury department.</p>
<p>The TMS was first pioneered in the mid-1980s with the ultimate goal of bringing about full straight through processing (STP) – that is the complete automation of all standard or day-to-day treasury processes.</p>
<p>These processes, when performed manually, can expose treasuries to a substantial level of operational risk, says Pole Yu, Regional General Manager for IT2 Treasury Solutions, Asia Pacific. “Spreadsheets can be complex to manage,” he says. “They do not offer a controlled workflow and are dependent on the accuracy of human data inputs. As a result, they expose treasuries to the operational risk associated with highly manual processes.</p>
<p>“A critical eye and high levels of attention and expertise are required when using treasury spreadsheets,” he adds.</p>
<p>The ultimate objective of STP is to minimise manual requirements and allow treasurers to focus more energy on activities that really make a difference, says Mike Fullmer, SunGard’s Senior Vice President for the Asia Pacific region. “The things a treasurer can impact,” he says, “are the things that are coming in the future – tomorrow, next week or next month.”</p>
<p>“Treasurers should be focused on where the market is moving,” Fullmer adds. We put systems in place that removes the need for manual intervention, which can cause errors, and instead get the treasury team focused on where they can actually impact the forward planning for their company.”</p>
<h3 id=""an-overview-of-the-current-market"">An overview of the current market</h3>
<p>For corporations looking to make an investment in TMS software, there is a wide range of products available on the market, with substantial variations in terms of both complexity and price. However, most TMS products on the market will include the following basic functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Static data storage (database).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation of standard treasury transactions and accounting entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workflow and security controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to trading facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back office processing facilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since TMS technology was first introduced, the cost of purchase and implementation has fallen considerably – partially as a result of technological advancements. The market has also expanded substantially over this period. In the beginning there were relatively few vendors and nearly all the products were ‘high end’ – targeted for use by the largest corporate treasuries or banks. But now there is a lot more choice in the market, from expensive bespoke solutions tailored principally for the demands of large multinationals to much cheaper off-the-shelf packages that are designed for smaller organisations’ use.</p>
<p>There is no single TMS solution that is right for every corporate. The particular type of solution that a corporate adopts will largely depend on what they are trying to do. “We don’t try to put the same solution in for everyone,” Fullmer says. “We always look closely at the particular requirements of the company we are dealing with. Are they going into multiple markets? Do they have FX exposure? Do they have a lot of money in different countries and with different bank accounts? How are they forecasting their cash and how are they managing the receipts coming in?”</p>
<p>The particular type of TMS solution a corporate chooses to adopt, says IT2’s Yu, will largely depend on the degree of organisational complexity. This can be measured by a number of different factors, such as the dealing volume, international and multicurrency profile, subsidiary structure, funding and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>“Every business is different,” Yu says. “Quite often a treasury will find itself struggling with daily workflows, unable to provide sufficiently timely, up-to-date answers to the key treasury questions. Although the buck stops with the auditors, senior management may require better reporting or have specific concerns, perhaps over the impact of FX exposures on earnings volatility or efficient use of capital or bank facilities.</p>
<p>“In the Asia Pacific business environment, where growth may depend on engagement in a dynamic, multicurrency environment, it’s a situation we encounter more and more frequently,” he adds.</p>

<h3 id=""benefits-for-corporates-in-the-asia-pacific-region"">Benefits for corporates in the Asia Pacific region</h3>
<p>According to Yu, uptake of TMS solutions in the Asia Pacific region has yet to reach the level of Western counterparts, and many are continuing to rely on older, spreadsheet-based or legacy systems developed in-house. However, since the 2008 financial crisis there has been a noticeable spike in demand amongst Asian corporates for new TMS. One of the reasons for this, Yu says, could be the increased focus on liquidity management which resulted from the financial crisis. In an economic environment where credit has become increasingly scarce and expensive, corporations globally have had to focus, more than ever, on gaining up-to-the-minute visibility of their working capital, in order to reduce their dependence on external credit lines and to optimise investment returns.</p>
<p>“This information is of maximum value when it reflects the current and near-term position of the enterprise,” he says. “TMS offer mission-specific tools to display and report this information completely, accurately, on-demand and, if appropriate, in real time. The TMS can automatically assemble, organise and report the information from all relevant sources, including bank account balances, opening and maturing treasury transactions, treasury flows such as interest payments and dividends, and commercial payable and receivable flows.” And achieving greater global visibility of cash, he adds, is essential in order to gain timely visibility of financial risk.</p>
<p>The vast majority of corporates in Asia operate across multiple markets and, as a consequence, are regularly dealing with different currencies, different regulatory regimes, as well as needing to co-ordinate with different business units. In such a complex environment having the correct treasury technology in place becomes increasingly vital, SunGard’s Fullmer says. “To be able to manage that effectively you often need some assistance to pull that data together, otherwise you are going to be the ones running around manually trying to deal with that.”</p>
<p>This requirement is linked to the arguments concerning centralisation and decentralisation, he argues. An effective TMS solution can provide corporates with the means of centralising certain information without necessarily centralising power. He gives the example of a company operating within China: to operate in such a tightly controlled market will often require relationships and funds to be managed by a team within that country. With the right TMS solution, Fullmer says, a company is able to centralise these functions without excluding headquarters from the decision-making process. “What we have seen is that companies operating in some heavily regulated Asian markets are able to have local controls and make local decisions – but management is getting better visibility over what is going on.</p>
<p>“A TMS can enable a multinational to have one central source of truth when it comes to information so that, at the group level, the CFO can clearly understand where the company stands and they are not just chasing after reports,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""looking-ahead"">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>There is little doubt that the TMS technology has changed substantially over the past decade, with today’s platforms providing tools for the automation of a wide range of treasury responsibilities including dealing, reporting and risk management. But how can it provide even greater support to the corporate treasurer?</p>
<p>Although it remains a relatively new concept yet to be fully validated from a security perspective, mobile technology, Fullmer believes, may well be the next big thing in the TMS market.</p>
<p>“Mobile technology is definitely one of the areas that vendors are looking to expand into in the future; but speaking to companies it is clear that there are still security concerns,” he says, explaining that there remains a degree of resistance from IT departments within some multinationals to the idea of allowing a treasurer to access their network over a mobile device.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the concerns Fullmer alludes to, there is agreement that the optimisation of TMS for use on mobile devices is an important advancement – indeed, both IT2 and SunGard already provide mobile apps to their clients. “It is a major development and a natural evolution,” Yu says. “We expect to see more treasurers picking up where they left off across a variety of devices.”</p>

<p>When it comes to understanding risk, the growing frequency of so-called ‘rare’ market events today, together with elevated volatility, means that the traditional Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach is less than perfect. Yet, Lloyds Bank believes that with certain enhancements, a VaR based methodology can prove to be invaluable in helping treasurers and risk managers to prepare for what the future holds.</p>
