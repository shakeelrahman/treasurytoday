<p><em>Standard Chartered Bank’s Stuart Keelan and Desiree Pires discuss how navigating inflation risk, hedging and sustainability are key themes for treasury teams coming out of the pandemic.</em></p>
<p style="margin:2em 0 2em 0;"><a class="button--red-stroke" href="/podcasts/standard-chartered-digital-transformation">Listen to podcast</a></p>
<p>The pandemic has triggered a fundamental restrike in market pricing for interest rates, foreign exchange and commodities, said Stuart Keelan, Financial Markets Head of UK &amp; Europe at Standard Chartered, speaking during a recent Treasury Today podcast. Corporates have responded by restructuring their hedging programmes across their rates, FX and commodity exposures, and are taking advantage of the low cost of financing to either shore up their balance sheets or invest in their business via digitisation, ESG projects or M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>Similarly, Desiree Pires, Managing Director, Head of Corporate Sales Europe at Standard Chartered, noted how clients continue to review their hedging policies and programmes in response to the market shocks. The crisis has made them question how appropriate their existing policies were and led to a greater appreciation of the value of options, especially when forecasts can be uncertain, she said. “We are seeing an increased use of analytics and back testing tools to develop more dynamic and flexible hedging frameworks.”</p>
<p>M&amp;A activity and proactive strategies to manage inflation are also driving treasury strategy. Although Pires acknowledged the wide differentiation of economic recoveries for different sectors and regions, she predicted consolidation in some sectors and an increase in M&amp;A activity as companies take advantage of cheap, plentiful liquidity. As for inflation, she noticed a spike in corporate concerns. “Treasury’s view of rates has changed from a comfort that rates will continue to be lower for longer to a real concern about inflation,” she said, citing the ensuing treasury risk around input costs and higher interest rates spiking borrowing costs. One response to the latter has seen corporates actively pre-hedging future issuance and increasing fixed exposures through swaps, swaptions and interest rate caps, she said.</p>
<p>Another focus is supply chains. Here companies are structuring shorter, more localised supply chains and increasing digitisation. “Companies are changing supply chain models, reacting to increased red tape driven by COVID, Brexit, and trade wars impacting global trade,” said Keelan.</p>
<p>The focus on digital solutions is also extending to payments, especially cross board payments linked to either trade finance, supply chain solutions, opex or capex. Standard Chartered is working with clients on various digital solutions spanning regulatory documentation platforms and API connectivity. The bank is also partnering with third-party treasury software providers and fintechs to develop solutions that link directly to a corporate’s TMS systems, ensuring ease of connectivity and both reduced admin burdens and IT resource commitments.</p>
<h3 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h3>
<p>Sustainability is another key theme, reaching well beyond green bonds or financing. The bank is discussing new risk management products and helping clients achieve their net zero goals in a process that requires careful management because of the cost of the transition on margins in the medium term. “We’re partnering with clients to manage their financing structures in this regard,” said Pires. “As a bank, we have committed to our Stand on Accelerating to Net Zero to not only manage our own carbon footprint but more importantly that of the clients we’re financing. Given 80% of the world’s carbon emissions come from our footprint markets of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, we believe we can partner with clients to take a stand to achieve net zero carbon by 2050.” she added.</p>
<h3 id="carbon-market">Carbon market</h3>
<p>Pires and Keelan discussed how an efficient carbon market is crucial to achieving this goal and the bank is working with peers to try and scale carbon markets. For example, Group Chief Executive, Bill Winters is involved in chairing the Task Force on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets. Elsewhere, the bank has launched Climate Impact X (CIX), partnering with DBS, SGX and Temasek to create a global exchange for high quality carbon credits to support clients’ pathway to net zero.</p>
<p>Indeed, Pires and Keelan believe a voluntary carbon market could be one of the most exciting sustainability innovations going forward. At present, companies buy or sell carbon in a regulatory-driven environment for compliance purposes, explained Pires. “Going forward, we expect more demand to offset carbon even if not required to for regulatory reasons.” She said this will require a greater supply of carbon credits than currently exist and is one driver behind initiatives like CIX. “It’s also interesting to consider new industries that may emerge as suppliers of carbon credits,” she said.</p>
<p>Companies are spending an increasing amount of time exploring how to integrate ESG principles into their business via internal company goals and treasury policy, she added. New products from the bank include developing sustainable deposits for clients that allow simple deposit placements to be ESG friendly. Elsewhere, Standard Chartered has transacted ESG linked derivatives in FX, interest rates and commodities, linked to both “use of proceeds” as well as ESG performance.</p>
<p>Keelan concluded that one of the key challenges corporates will face is understanding both what net zero means – and how to measure it. He also noted a widening disparity between markets as Europe takes a lead on policy frameworks, but other markets, often dependent on heavy emitting industries, struggle with how to finance the transition bereft of policy guidance. “At Standard Chartered, we are working to define a methodology, a market standard and be transparent with our stakeholders and stimulate the debate,” he said. “Our Stand of Accelerating to Net Zero is about partnering with clients to address their challenges on the journey to sustainability.”</p></div>

<p>When considering this topic, the mind tends immediately to leap to questions directly related to funding: for example adequacy of backup lines, resilience of lenders. However, I intend to swerve these immediate issues in favour of looking at some areas that are maybe less considered, and which may in some cases have yet to impact the corporate.</p>
<p><strong>Cash forecasting</strong>. Whilst obviously important in itself, the point to be considered relates to the scenarios we use. We may have generated a “10% down” revenue scenario, but have we ever considered a downside case of 40%/50% or more reduction? I suspect if we had presented that to (pre-COVID) management we would have been laughed out of the boardroom or CFO’s office.</p>
<p><strong>Business continuity planning</strong>. We may be comfortable with our own response to closed offices and working from home, but how have our banks, suppliers and customers weathered the storm? In the case of banks particularly, have we tended to take their BCP (and associated testing) for granted? We may want to question them more closely about their planning scenarios and investment. Particular attention should be paid to those institutions which rely on the physical proximity of their staff to each other for efficient resolution of customer issues.</p>
<p><strong>Credit control</strong>. We all know that our cash collection is critically dependent on extraneous factors such as billing and credit control. So how has our credit control function performed, and perhaps more importantly, how does management propose to modify the approach post-COVID? Is that gold-standard customer, with an immaculate payment record over decades, still worthy of the “undoubted” status and large credit limit?</p>
<p><strong>Supply chain impacts</strong>. A supply chain financing programme can be a valuable tool in channelling much needed financing to suppliers. If you have such a programme, there are questions to be asked about whether it has risen to the COVID challenge under a stress for which it was not designed; and in particular whether the demand for supplier financing has peaked and strained the capacity of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Receivables financing</strong>. As a follow-on from the credit control points above, we need to consider corporates funding themselves with factoring, invoice discounting, or receivables securitisation programmes. The respective finance companies, rating agencies and investors will be reviewing the quality of current and projected asset pools. Some programmes may prove to be non-viable going forward, others may attract changes in terms and/or pricing. Are we prepared with the necessary data, arguments and in the worst case, alternatives?</p>
<p><strong>Pensions</strong>. Finally, a UK-specific point about defined benefit (DB) pension schemes. Those of you attempting to manage a DB scheme deficit will understand the emphasis that the pensions regulator places on the strength of the employer covenant which underlies the recovery plan. The trustees of such a scheme are mandated to monitor the covenant closely and to take action where it has significantly weakened. It is highly likely that over the course of the next year there will be a series of pension-related impacts. These may include: revisiting agreed recovery plans; requesting that contingency arrangements may be triggered; taking security formally over contingent assets; increasing deficit repair contributions. Any one of these, or a combination, may have significant impacts on a UK company’s short-, medium- and long-term cash projections.</p>

<p>It is now clear on each continent that the COVID-19 pandemic has created unparalleled disruption around the world. As a business owner, large or small, our immediate concerns are for our staff safety and to ensure that our cash flow is sound. What are the priority actions we might consider?</p>
<p>Managing and reviewing cash flow and cash flow forecasts is an ongoing exercise that must be monitored on a daily basis. For every treasurer, it is key to do so during challenging times, making sure they are profiling accurate figures. Forecasting and assessing in this period is indeed critical for any businesses survival, and this approach should be clearly documented in the company’s treasury and risk policies. For any business too, a robust treasury policy should be a basic management requirement. A correctly designed policy sets out details of the causes and potential risks around treasury department exposures and the appropriate risk responses for each of them.</p>
<p>In my position as an interim-manager and consultant in treasury, reviewing all aspects of my client businesses includes a close examination of existing policies and procedures, but also assessing whether major changes may be required during these turbulent times. For too many companies a treasury policy is a ‘frozen’ document instead of considering this as an evolutionary exercise.</p>
<p>In the life of a business, the opening of new subsidiaries, approaching new banks, M&amp;A deals, the opening or closing of bank accounts, additional procedures, and also new risk appetite standards agreed by the board of directors, might affect staff behaviour, integrating new risks in the company. The critique approach in reviewing policies must ensure this document is comprehensive and easy to understand. I very often make use of staff feedback in this dedicated process.</p>
<p>Often the encountered risks particularly affect those with a decentralised organisational structure. For these companies, the COVID-19 crisis can be seen as an opportunity to boost their appetite for structural review, and to reconsider centralisation needs. We see many treasuries having achieved a high level of centralisation but, having also considered standardisation and automation, have found it much easier to adapt quickly to new business practices – and be able to feel more secure during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Today it seems highly likely that all these efforts will continue, becoming firmly embedded into organisational working culture. Thanks also to the growing role of technology and innovation, which is equipping treasurers in many business decision-making, greater value is delivered into the organisation, decreasing risks in the meantime. I also often see that companies that have onboarded strong guidelines and policies have seen their treasurers become more responsive, giving them more time to focus on their strategic role and on the needs expressed by the business.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, since the treasury function has risen in prominence, a closer focus on policies will need to become more prevalent, with more frequent updating of these documents.</p>

<p>It’s an irony but also a ‘silver lining’ of the pandemic, that pivotal events can provide companies with the ideal opportunity for a thorough and intelligent review of their risk policies; or to create policies if they don’t already have them (and if you don’t, there are no more excuses!). Without going into a full policy checklist, I think any review should encompass three main areas:</p>
<h4 id="policy-construction">Policy construction</h4>
<p>Recent events have reminded us yet again that funding and liquidity are fundamental in the treasury hierarchy of needs. But we should also now ask tough questions about the breadth and depth of treasury policy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Emphasis – do key policies still fairly represent the risks which have proven to be the most crucial to your organisation?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Content – how is that view reflected in the actual detail? Did the content turn out to be sufficient, appropriate and accurate enough to protect you?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scope – what turned out to be missing? And does the treasurer need to have greater input in any other areas, eg credit/concentration risk, operational risk, or even HR planning?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Review – is the frequency and/or quality of your policy review process adequate?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="resilience-and-fit">Resilience and fit</h4>
<p>This is about the ongoing process of ‘proving’ policies so they support meaningful decisions, via data and/or practical experience; there should be a plentiful supply of both at the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metrics/KPIs – have these held up under pressure? Are data points still the right ones, set at the appropriate level for monitoring? How accessible and accurate is supporting data; could that guide future IT investment? Many treasuries use a KPI dashboard or similar; now is an ideal time to create and/or rethink those.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Forecasting – modelling and scenario planning will be taking on new significance – the past few weeks will provide hugely valuable backtesting, and insight into which elements of your forecast were not realistic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stress testing – unfortunate as these times are, the pandemic is the best example of a genuine stress test that many treasurers have experienced; and yet could still be worse. Use that information productively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contingency planning – incorporate all the above! Where should trigger thresholds be set, and what constitutes materiality for your company?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="use-test">Use test</h4>
<p>Finally, it’s important that policies are not simply viewed as a box-ticking exercise, or a piece of paper. ‘Use test’ is about a company’s ability to show genuine understanding, buy-in, and active use of its risk policies at all levels. UK financial regulators rightly place a great deal of value on this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decision-making – is the company really ‘living’ its policies during this crisis by using them to guide decisions? What evidence is there for and against this?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Action – do decisions translate readily into an action plan that everyone can follow, or are more specific crisis plans needed?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Communication – is the policy framework well understood, credible and well communicated?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>A business that is doing well will often have what is known as retained earnings – the portion of net income it keeps in a separate account. This can be used in a variety of ways, such as funding expansion or major capital projects. However, retained earnings can also be used to pay dividends or to repurchase its shares in the open market.</p>
<p>Share repurchases (or buybacks) and dividends are a means by which publicly traded companies can return cash to their shareholders. A company can fund its buyback by taking on debt, with cash on hand, or with its cash flow from operations. A set of corporate principles, known as a ‘pay-out policy’, will typically guide the value of any proposed cash dividends and share buybacks.</p>
<p>In practice, a buyback will see the company buy its own shares from the open marketplace, effectively cancelling these to reduce the number of freely trading shares (or ‘share float’) in the market (hence a buyback is sometimes referred to as a ‘float shrink’). The company can also make a tender offer, where existing company shareholders are asked if they wish to tender some or all of their shareholdings within a certain time frame; the offer includes the number of shares the company wishes to acquire and its offer price range.</p>
<p>Conversely, dividends are offered as a share in the company’s profits on a discretionary basis. These are paid out or ‘distributed’ at regular intervals to shareholders, mostly as cash but sometimes as shares of stock or other benefits. Dividends are declared (authorised) by the board of directors. Their value or distribution may be constrained by debt covenants.</p>
<p>Of the two, buybacks are usually seen as the more tax efficient, if less direct, way to return capital to shareholders. Whereas dividends are a definite taxable return and are subject to different tax treatments at both the corporate and personal levels, buybacks have uncertain value and tax is deferred until the investor sells.</p>
<p>Returns on share buybacks can never be guaranteed, but with corporate cash pools increasing, they appeared to be on the rise, especially in the US. In 2018, US companies saw a peak buyback of US$866bn, Apple alone undertaking US$100bn in buybacks during that year.</p>
<p>However, according to the FT in February 2020, citing preliminary figures from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, US corporates bought back US$736bn of their own stock in 2019. This was down 19% on 2018. On the other hand, a record-breaking US$485.5bn was paid out in dividends, with 2019 now the second year in a row that more than US$1trn was returned to shareholders.</p>
<h4 id="why-dividends">Why dividends?</h4>
<p>Dividends are a share of company profits, paid at regular intervals to its shareholders. Its directors are free to distribute dividends at whatever value they see fit, on the proviso that they are derived only from company net profits.</p>
<p>Not every company pays dividends. Rarely will a start-up or high-growth company offer a pay-out. These businesses often report losses in their first few years. If there are profits, these will often be ploughed back into the business.</p>
<p>Dividends are usually associated where a mature business has notable positive (and predictable) income streams and profits. These companies may not exhibit the huge growth curves of their formative years, but as established market players, dividends (usually paid at a higher rate than more dynamic/less predictable businesses) can boost overall returns for those that have invested in the company’s stock.</p>
<p>Cash is the most common pay-out but some companies issue shares of stock as an alternative. According to Standard &amp; Poor’s, since 1932, cash dividends have made up about one-third of the total returns on US stocks, with the remainder coming from price appreciation, or capital gains, on that stock.</p>
<p>Dividends have two main roles: to signal to investors that the company is healthy and has a future, and to attract investors by paying them a regular income, possibly increasing the market value of the company’s stock.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why a business may choose not to pay dividends. If rapid growth is part of its strategy, then earnings can be invested back into the company. That business may also wish to use its cash to fund M&amp;A activity. Conversely, a business that is perhaps not so strong may choose not to pay dividends simply to avoid the negative impression it gives to the market should it ever need to stop paying or lower its pay-out.</p>
<h4 id="types-of-dividend">Types of dividend</h4>
<p>Although cash tends to be the preferred form, dividends may take several forms. The list includes:</p>
<h5 id="cash-dividends">Cash dividends</h5>
<p>As the most common form, cash dividends issued per share are simply a cash payment whose value has been calculated by using the dividend per share (DPS) formula shown below.</p>
<p>Other forms may be known as distributions-in-kind. These may be used as a means of reducing corporate tax liabilities that may arise from, for example, an increase in an asset’s value.</p>
<h5 id="stock-dividends">Stock dividends</h5>
<p>As an alternative to cash, a number of shares may be awarded to each shareholder based on the amount of shares they hold. This may be done on a pro-rata rights basis. This is not obligatory in terms of offer or uptake but the idea is to ensure that extra share issuance does not dilute the existing ownership or voting rights of the shareholder, maintaining their percentage of equity stake at the same level.</p>
<h5 id="property-dividends">Property dividends</h5>
<p>Dividends may be offered as an asset such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E), which is generally highly illiquid, or inventory, which is more liquid.</p>
<h5 id="scrip-dividends">Scrip dividends</h5>
<p>Sometimes a company will offer its shareholders a choice of either receiving a cash dividend or the equivalent in additional shares of the company. Scrip issues are usually offered when there is insufficient liquidity for a cash dividend to be paid. By increasing the number of shares, these secondary issues will dilute share value but they are exempt from stamp duty as they are not an investment per se – even though investors can sell them on the open market (at which point they are subject to capital gains).</p>
<h5 id="liquidating-dividends">Liquidating dividends</h5>
<p>This is an end-of-the road dividend where all assets are liquidated and the remaining proceeds (if there are any) after satisfying creditors are paid out to shareholders as a dividend. Creditors are always senior to shareholders in such a case. A liquidating distribution usually only occurs where a solvent business is in voluntary liquidation.</p>
<h4 id="how-much">How much?</h4>
<p>The main calculation used to decide the value attributed to each individual share in a dividend pay-out is DPS. DPS determines total income for each investor, based on share ownership.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">DPS formula</h2>
<div class="copy__body"> <p><img alt="graphic 1" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/corporate-strategy/2020-05-06-tt-07__btb_give-and-takeshare-buybacks-vs-dividends__215x251.png?la=en&amp;hash=0D89958BB423FA48D2A0EB0D8E3A9E15" style="float:right;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="100"/></p>
<p>There are two version of DPS calculation:</p>
<p>DPS = <em>total dividends paid/number of shares outstanding</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>DPS = <em>earnings per share x dividend pay-out ratio</em> (This figure is the expected percentage of profits returned based on historical dividend pay-outs, which could be in the region of 50%, or as low as 20%.)</p>
<p>Basic EPS takes the net income applicable to common shares for the period and divides it by the average number of shares outstanding for that same period.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<h4 id="why-buybacks">Why buybacks?</h4>
<p>Both buybacks and dividends are of interest to market analysts because, as distributions to shareholders, they affect investment returns and financial ratios. One of the major benefits of a share buyback is that it reduces the number of shares outstanding for a company. Share repurchases made with excess cash (as opposed to debt) therefore can increase per-share measures of profitability, notably cash flow per share (CFPS) and earnings per share (EPS) which are key metrics for investors when assessing stock values.</p>
<p>Buybacks can enhance EPS, even when the company is reporting otherwise unexceptional top-line and bottom-line growth. This may see the business being given a higher valuation by investors, and as long as the price-earnings (P/E) multiple at which the stock trades remains unchanged (P/E = current stock price divided by EPS), the buyback should drive up the share price.</p>
<p>Indeed, the FT recently noted that share buybacks “have played a role in bolstering the stock market to record highs by reducing the share count and boosting company earnings per share”. It said that the S&amp;P 500 ended last year (2019) up nearly 30%, “even as underlying profits growth stagnated”.</p>
<p>Firms that often buyback their own shares can grow EPS at a faster rate than by its normal business activities alone, especially for well-established market leaders. It is a way of attracting investors, especially as it also demonstrates the power to generate sufficient cash to buy-back its own shares in the first instance. However, the buyback process has been seen as a way of manipulating key financial metrics such as EPS, and has even been criticised as signifying a lack of imagination within the business, in that if the business has nothing better to do with its cash than buy its own shares, then has it run out of ideas, and is thus a poor long-term investment.</p>
<h4 id="impact-on-financial-statements">Impact on financial statements</h4>
<p>Reducing outstanding shares has an effect on a company’s income statement and other financial statements. The balance sheet will see a reduction in cash holdings, and thus its total asset base, following a buyback (to the value of the buyback). Shareholder equity will also lower on the liabilities side by the same level.</p>
<p>As well as increasing EPS, buybacks reduce the assets on the company’s balance sheet – cash – and so will similarly improve the health of other financial performance metrics such as the aforementioned P/E ratio (simply because fewer outstanding shares, but with the same earnings, equates to a higher EPS and thus better P/E), return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE).</p>
<p>The cost of a buyback programme will normally be reported in the following quarterly earnings statement, although the total spend should also be visible in the company’s Statement of Cash Flows, under Financing Activities, and in its Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Retained Earnings.</p>
<h4 id="dilution-effect">Dilution effect</h4>
<p>To keep senior executives happy, public firms can give their employees the right to buy the company’s stock at a specified price for a finite period (good value for the employee if the stock rises and they exercise their option and then sell those shares – usually with vesting controls put in place by the company – on the open market). But employee stock option plans, if issued in significant numbers, can dilute EPS and P/E by adding shares to the market, weakening these key metrics.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote><p>Regular dividends can signify corporate stability, keeping shareholders keen and attracting new investors, but once on that pathway it is difficult to leave without damaging after-shocks.</p></blockquote>

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<p>A business that has pursued stock options (or indeed one that has seen M&amp;A result in new shares being issued, or perhaps has issued dilutive securities such as stock warrants or convertible preferred stock) may elect to minimise the effects of dilution, reducing the number of outstanding shares through a buyback programme.</p>
<p>Diluted EPS (and all potential dilution) has to be reported under GAAP as an adjustment of the basic EPS. In a profitable business, diluted EPS is always lower than basic EPS (as profit has been spread amongst a greater number of shares), just as in a loss-making business, diluted EPS always shows a lower loss than basic EPS because the loss is spread out over more shares.</p>
<h4 id="which-is-best">Which is best?</h4>
<p>There is no definitive answer as to which is best; both have advantages and disadvantages. Here’s a brief list of pros and cons:</p>
<h5 id="buyback-advantages">Buyback advantages</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gainfully deploys expensive-to-hold cash, and signals healthy liquidity of the business.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Boosts key valuation metrics such as EPS and CFPS, making the business look more attractive to investors.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Counters market undervaluation: companies buy low then re-issue upon market correction.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Pays off investors and reduces overall cost of capital.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Flexibility for company to engage with the market when it is ready to do so.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Little or no market negativity when buybacks are reduced or halted.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Tax efficient for investors; deferred until stock sold and then subject to a capital gains rate. If held for more than one year, a lower capital gains rate may apply.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="buyback-disadvantages">Buyback disadvantages</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shareholders may expect excess cash to be better used for investment activities such as a new manufacturing plant, increasing market presence, R&amp;D or M&amp;A activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wise investors can see through buybacks designed simply to increase key financial metrics (or pay large bonuses to senior executives).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buybacks can be a sign that the company has few profitable long-term opportunities, at least in its current form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can affect a company’s credit rating if it borrows money to buy-back ie taking on debt never outweighs an EPS boost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="dividend-advantages-for-a-stable-dividend-policy-as-opposed-to-irregular distributions).">Dividend advantages (for a stable dividend policy, as opposed to irregular distributions)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Signals ‘business as normal’, giving shareholders and potential investors confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stabilises market value of shares.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Meets the needs of institutional investors who can only invest in companies with stable dividends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can improve the company’s credit standing and make access to financing easier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="dividend-disadvantages-again-for-a-stable-dividend-policy">Dividend disadvantages (again, for a stable dividend policy)</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Difficult to suspend or cease pay-outs once started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspension or cessation can see knee-jerk stock disposal by investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspension or cessation can negatively affect the market price of shares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less tax efficient for investors (subject to ordinary income tax, with no deferrals).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paying dividends despite financial difficulties is potentially ruinous.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="shareholder-happiness-corporate-happiness">Shareholder happiness = corporate happiness</h4>
<p>Listed companies operate to keep their shareholders happy. Buybacks increase a stock’s value, but knowledgeable investors will ask if that is just a short-term boost for certain financial ratios or over-compensating of executives. Regular dividends can signify corporate stability, keeping shareholders keen and attracting new investors, but once on that pathway it is difficult to leave without damaging after-shocks.</p>
<p>If the financial benefit of both is considered on behalf of the investor, there are two US indices that might steer opinions one way or the other. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats includes only companies that have managed to raise dividends annually for at least 25 consecutive years. S&amp;P’s equivalent for signalling active buyback companies is the S&amp;P 500 Buyback Index, which lists stocks with the highest buyback ratios, defined by cash paid for share buybacks in the last four calendar quarters, divided by the company’s market capitalisation.</p>
<p>S&amp;P reports that between March 2009 and March 2019, the annual return on the S&amp;P 500 Buyback Index was 21.09%, whereas the Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual return of 19.35%. The standard S&amp;P 500 posted an annual return of 17.56% over the same period.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Treasurers are finding that their role in their organisation’s ESG strategy is increasing, and in turn, so is their focus on sustainability. A sustainable treasury doesn’t simply mean cutting out paper-based processes – though that can certainly be part of it. Instead, through the likes of sustainability-linked loans and thematic bonds (green bonds, gender bonds, water bonds, for example), treasurers are able to help steer their organisations towards a more sustainable future through one of their core functions: finance.</p>
<h4 id="its-not-just-green-bonds">It’s not just green bonds</h4>
<p>As of June 2019, according to Bloomberg, green finance is worth over US$31trn – and showing no signs of slowing down. Looking at that figure more holistically, it may seem small. Indeed, uptake of green finance options has been slower than some experts are happy with. According to data released in October 2019 by the World Resources Institute, just 25 of the world’s largest 50 banks have made public sustainable finance commitments.</p>
<p>The same report found that even among the banks with active commitments, “the average annual level of fossil fuel finance from 2016-2018 is nearly twice the annualised amount of sustainable finance commitments. Only seven banks have annualised sustainable finance targets greater than the amount of finance they provide for fossil fuel-related transactions each year.”</p>
<p>From this data alone, it’s clear that businesses must do more to initiate sustainable financing themselves, but many aren’t aware of all the available options. Treasurers often hear primarily about green bonds or linked loans, but as has been previously noted, the demand for green bonds unfortunately far exceeds the supply.</p>
<p>For Leonie Schreve, Global Head of Sustainable Finance at ING Bank, the answer may instead lie in green loans and sustainability-linked bonds. “Green loans are very closely related to green bonds, and a sustainability-linked bond is a copy of the sustainability-linked loan, where you actively support clients in their sustainable transition,” she says.</p>
<p>Heather Lang, Executive Director, Sustainable Finance at Sustainalytics agrees. “Green bonds and linked loans are the two major pillars, but we’ve seen a fair bit of diversity within those pillars,” she says. “We also expect to see transition financing (transition bonds) becoming a hot topic in 2020, expanding beyond projects that would already be considered green by definition to include assets and industries that are looking to transition to a low carbon economy. This will promote entry for a lot of different industry players that haven’t been part of the green bond market in the past.”</p>
<p>Schreve adds that a new product was launched by ING last year: the sustainability-linked derivative. She explains that this is the same concept as a sustainability-linked loan, but also enables treasurers to fully integrate their sustainability target into all their financing streams – not only in the loans but also in the derivative.</p>
<p>There is also more diversification in loans, explains Lang. “You have green use of proceeds loans, where the loan would finance projects or assets defined as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’.” There are also general-purpose loans, which could be syndicated loans or revolving credit facilities, that would link the interest rates of loans to sustainability performance targets.</p>

<p>Having a sustainable treasury doesn’t have to be limited to just finance though. Digitalisation, for example, can help a company go paperless and thus improve its sustainability agenda. The blockchain space is one that is rapidly expanding and has the potential to revolutionise trade documentation.</p>
<p>Blockchain providers don’t just hope to make trade easier, by digitalising unwieldy bills of lading and letters of credit, but in making everything paperless, the industry could save US$400-600bn per year, according to Bain &amp; Company. Shipping giant Maersk took part in a proof of concept in 2016, exploring the use of blockchain to digitalise traditional bills of lading. It found that a simple shipment of roses from Kenya to Rotterdam generated a paper pile that measured 25cm high. Meanwhile, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates that trade generates around four billion pages of paper documents per year.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Green bonds and linked loans are the two major pillars, but we’ve seen a fair bit of diversity within those pillars.</p>

<p>Running a quick search online for the benefits of going paperless returns millions of results on why a business should convert. In addition to cutting out stacks of paper, it’s estimated that one printer ink cartridge is thrown out every second. By going paperless, or at least reducing paper-based processes, a company would reduce its contribution to this figure, and by extension its contribution to the tonnes of oil and harmful chemicals used in production of ink cartridges.</p>
<h4 id="its-easier-than-youd-think">It’s easier than you’d think</h4>
<p>For Lang, key success factors when going green are working with sustainability teams and CSR teams internally. Historically, treasurers and CFOs haven’t worked as closely with those teams in many companies, and it’s a trend that she’s seen pick up in the last few years.</p>
<p>Along with collaborating internally, she adds, it is also beneficial to work with financial institutions that have their own sustainable-finance teams. “Working with underwriters that have expertise in green bonds and sustainable bonds, working with lenders who have experience with target setting around sustainability performance targets for loans is key to success,” she says.</p>
<p>Likewise, Schreve explains that prior to the introduction of transition finance, working towards a sustainable treasury was more challenging. “Products like green bonds and green loans are specifically tied to a defined use of proceeds. If you want to go to the green bond market, first of all you need to be an issuer, and secondly you need to have a sufficient volume of green assets in your company.”</p>
<p>Now though, having transition and sustainability-linked products which instead support you in identifying clear targets for the transition, the market is immediately opened up to a much broader spectrum of clients in a wider variety of sectors. “By opening up the markets from outside just the regular ‘green sectors’, there is a lot of opportunity for others to also build sustainable treasuries,” she says.</p>
</div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">What are transition bonds?</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>According to the Institute of Sustainable Finance, “transition bonds are a new class of bonds, the proceeds of which are used to fund a firm’s transition towards a reduced environmental impact or to reduce its carbon emissions. The proceeds can be used exclusively to finance new and/or existing eligible transition projects. These bonds require the issuer to commit to shifting to more sustainable business practices. Transition bonds do not require the project or the issuer to be classified as ‘green’, but the issuer is required to use the proceeds for climate transition-related activities.</p>
<p>“For example, a coal-mining firm may issue a transition bond to finance efforts to capture and store carbon. Advocates of transition bonds suggest that it is better for companies aspiring to become ‘greener’ to finance their assets using transition bonds rather than be excluded from the green bond market without an alternative source of funding to support transition projects.”</p>

<h4 id="it-pays-to-be-green">It pays to be green</h4>
<p>A primary benefit of following sustainable finance routes, according to Lang, is accessing the capital and diversifying the base of investors and lenders. Linked to that is being able to showcase this to different stakeholders and really improve the external profile for the sustainability commitments that are being made. Showcasing to direct stakeholders isn’t all that matters though, as the public reputation of a company can also be boosted by having a sustainable agenda.</p>
<p>Schreve believes that this doesn’t just come from consumers, but also from potential employees. “I see all young employees and part of their decision to join ING is that they see we play a leading role on the sustainability front, and that is very important to them. With a scarcity of resources, this is a differentiator which can really help attract talent,” she says.</p>
<p>Of course, the rate of return on sustainable investments should also be a key driver. A 2019 study by Morningstar found that more than 34% of sustainable European funds appeared in the top quartile of their category and 63% were in the top half. Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, nine of the biggest ESG mutual funds in the US outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index in 2019, and seven of them beat their market benchmarks over the past five years.</p>
<p>From these results – and many others that have been published – it’s clear that ESG and sustainable investments do indeed pay. This success is showing no signs of slowing down, either. Lang points out that the most recent figures from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance for the two-year period from 2016-2018 indicate that by the end of 2018 over US$30trn assets under management had been invested through some form of responsible or sustainable investing. “That was a 50% growth rate over just a two-year period,” she says.</p>
<p>There are also the long-term benefits to think about, says Schreve. With countries drafting their own climate bills, and the Paris Agreement still standing, certain sectors are likely to become riskier and demand for green financing will increase. “If I were a CEO in one of our clients’ companies, I would want to make my company resilient and push the sustainability agenda to make sure that I’m still there in ten years’ time as well.”</p>
<h4 id="getting-others-onboard">Getting others onboard</h4>
<p>Utilising these benefits is the best way to convince others to start thinking sustainably. These could include other internal business functions as well as external partners. “Make the business case and really showcase the work that treasury is doing in bridging together financial initiatives with sustainability initiatives,” suggests Lang.</p>
<p>Schreve agrees and thinks that putting an investor spin on it can also help. “Sustainability is seen as a better risk, so eventually valuation of a company should also be better. It’s therefore in the interests of the CEO, CFO, the investor relations officer, and of course the stakeholders around the company to move on the transition agenda of sustainability.”</p>
<p>The entire sustainable finance market is still young, adds Schreve, and so the market is increasingly opening up. “I think the beauty of this space is that it really is diversifying before our eyes,” adds Lang.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Treasury outsourcing was a hot topic some years ago, offering companies a way of increasing the efficiency of treasury activities or freeing up time for value-adding tasks. When banks pulled out of the outsourcing market, the topic fell off the radar for some treasurers. But others have continued to take advantage of specialist treasury outsourcing services, and there are a number of factors that may prompt companies with certain requirements to consider this approach.</p>
<p>As in other areas of business, treasury outsourcing can be an effective means of freeing up internal resources, buying in capabilities or making better use of existing staff. “Many treasurers realise that in order to enable their staff to make strategic decisions, they need to focus their staff on strategic activities. By outsourcing tactical treasury functions, a treasurer can better utilise their personnel by focusing them on more added-value activities and projects,” says Dan Carmody, Executive Director of treasury consulting, staffing and training firm <a href="http://www.treasolution.com/" target="_blank">TreaSolution</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than being a thing of the past, treasury outsourcing could once again be a topic of interest for treasurers looking to do more with less. Indeed, TMS provider BELLIN has recently decided to work with a partner for treasury outsourcing. Beate Haumesser, Presales EMEA, who previously oversaw BELLIN’s treasury outsourcing division, explains that treasury outsourcing can be particularly attractive in the current environment for several reasons.</p>
<p>One is the high workload faced by many treasury teams. “The use of technology is necessary to streamline processes and boost security, but for various reasons not every company wants to acquire a TMS,” she says. “Customers can also save time previously dedicated to repetitive work, and can focus on valuable treasury tasks and prepare decisions.”</p>
<p>In addition, Haumesser says companies may seek pragmatic support to bridge a period where internal staff is blocked for other projects. Other considerations are that companies can access a service – and benefit from a system provider’s expertise – without having to undergo a selection process for a TMS application.</p>
<h4 id="a-short-history-of-treasury-outsourcing">A short history of treasury outsourcing</h4>
<p>“Outsourcing of treasury activities was very popular around the turn of this century,” says Sander Van Tol, Partner at independent consulting firm Zanders. “Some of the leading international banks and specialised treasury consultancies offered outsourcing services from their Dublin offices.”</p>
<p>Van Tol explains that the business rationale for external outsourcing was that external parties were able to provide a more cost-effective and redundant solution, compared to executing treasury activities in-house. He adds, “The outsourcing services were especially popular with US multinationals outsourcing part of the EMEA treasury activities.”</p>
<p>However, Van Tol continues, “in practice these portrayed benefits were not realised due to extensive communication required between the client (corporate treasury function) and outsourcing company. So many multinationals stopped their outsourcing contracts.”</p>
<p>And as Pat Leavy, CEO at Dublin-based outsourcing solutions provider FTI Treasury explains, there came a point when banks offering treasury outsourcing services exited the market. “Going back to the late 80s, when the banks first offered treasury outsourcing services, the expectation was that this would be a huge business revenue generating proposition for them,” says Leavy. “The combination of these revenue expectations, and the demands of providing highly customised solutions, progressively led to a solution where banks began to exit the market over a period of time.”</p>
<h4 id="rise-of-the-ssc">Rise of the SSC</h4>
<p>Van Tol says that with outsourcing falling out of favour for some multinationals, these companies turned to a different form of outsourcing, using shared service centres (SSCs) – “this is the outsourcing of some of the more repetitive, low value-adding treasury activities to an SSC,” he notes. Van Tol explains that these SSCs could be either internal, ie company owned, or external SSCs run by some of the larger IT or accounting firms, and are typically located in countries with lower salary levels in order to realise the cost efficiencies associated with outsourcing.</p>
<p>While this approach has served many companies well, the situation continues to evolve. “Due to the more intensive use of technology for repetitive/standardised activities, the financial benefit of outsourcing to low cost countries is diminishing,” says Van Tol. More recently, it seems that market noise around outsourcing is growing again, “as corporates look to treasury outsourcing as a way of becoming more compliant, reducing operational risk while remaining lean and cost efficient.”</p>
<h4 id="flavours-of-outsourcing">Flavours of outsourcing</h4>
<p>Of course, while different trends have gained prominence at different times, treasury outsourcing never actually went away. While bank-run outsourcing services may have fallen by the wayside, specialist treasury outsourcing providers have continued to serve corporate customers – FTI Treasury, for example, has been operating since 1988. And as Leavy explains, outsourcing can take a number of different forms, depending on a company’s specific needs. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting up an overseas regional treasury centre or finance company.</strong> One common scenario is that of North American companies setting up a regional treasury centre or finance company in Europe for activities such as cash pool administration, managing foreign currency exposures and handling intercompany lending or intercompany netting. “Very often, companies don’t want to deploy a new set of resources in Europe, so they look for a third party to help them,” Leavy explains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retaining front office activities while outsourcing the back or middle office.</strong> Another situation that may lend itself to outsourcing is when a company decides to outsource back office activities (like confirmations, settlement and reconciliation) and treasury accounting processes in order to focus on front office treasury activities such as execution and intercompany loan administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harnessing technology for specific activities.</strong> Organisations may be looking for an outsourcing company to provide technology for a particular process, such as intercompany netting, intercompany loan administration or managing a complicated balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outsourcing the running of the treasury.</strong> Last but not least, Leavy says some companies may simply be looking for someone to run the treasury on their behalf, including day-to-day cash management, executing transactions and back office processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While outsourcing can take many different forms, Leavy says one common feature of all these models is that decision making is ultimately retained by the company itself. “Things are either managed under a mandate or a policy,” he says. “In most cases, it’s about process – if you think about it, a lot of daily cash management is a process, as is foreign exchange execution and intercompany lending.”</p>
<h4 id="reasons-for-outsourcing">Reasons for outsourcing</h4>
<p>As these examples illustrate, the motivations for considering treasury outsourcing can vary considerably. Some companies may lack the resources, staff or experience needed to carry out particular activities, while others may be looking to free up staff to focus on more value-adding tasks.</p>
<p>“With the regional treasury centre example, the company may not have resources in Europe and may be looking for a structure that’s easy to establish,” says Leavy. “But you could have a situation where a company just wants to concentrate on strategic activities without being concerned about the back office resource or accounting resource.” In practice, Leavy says, most treasuries spend a disproportionate amount of time managing operations, rather than looking at strategic aspects of treasury management.</p>
<p>In other cases, changes to the business model, such as spinning off part of the business, can result in the need for treasury outsourcing, as the business that has been carved out may need its own treasury very rapidly. “Someone who already has an infrastructure in place can get a treasury operation up and running very quickly,” says Leavy. “We’ve migrated a global corporate within six weeks, including technology and process.” More typically, this can take ten-12 weeks – which Leavy says is considerably faster than recruiting a team, building a technology infrastructure and establishing processes.</p>
<p>A newer catalyst is the emergence of high-growth companies becoming internationalised very rapidly, which gives rise to the need for internationally focused treasury management in a short space of time. “In that case, companies may ask whether they can get someone to look after all this for them while they concentrate on the business growth dimensions of the business itself,” says Leavy.</p>
<p>And a further catalyst for adopting treasury outsourcing is the need to replace legacy technology which is no longer fit for purpose. “If somebody is already invested in technology, they’re probably less likely to consider outsourcing,” Leavy says. “But if they suddenly find themselves in the situation where the technology isn’t working and they have to invest heavily in a new technology infrastructure, they might ask whether there’s an easier way of doing this. We can find somebody that can deploy a technology platform and integrate that via our customer – what we would call ‘client-side technology infrastructure’.”</p>
<h4 id="when-to-outsource">When to outsource</h4>
<p>Treasury outsourcing will be more applicable to some types of organisations than others. Zanders’ Van Tol says that treasury outsourcing is more common “when organisations aren’t quite big enough to have their own treasury department; when the internal treasury teams don’t have the time to perform all the treasury management activities, or if they are lacking that core treasury expertise. In such cases, treasury outsourcing could be the perfect option since an external party that specialises in treasury management can bring valuable corporate treasury expertise and knowledge, in addition to the latest treasury technology trends, best practice and procedures.”</p>
<p>FTI Treasury’s Leavy says that in practice, the companies that lend themselves more easily to outsourcing “are companies that actually make something.” He adds, “If you think about it, if you make something in an international context, you tend to have international subsidiaries around the world – and with that comes international cash, foreign currency and intercompany lending. That gives rise to intercompany transactions that might require a netting proposition. A lot of our clients are in that space where they’re selling a product, rather than a high-end IT service offering.”</p>
<p>That said, Leavy says he also has clients which are domestic companies with complicated balance sheets that may not have the technology or expertise to manage complicated loan structures or capital market structures.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-outsource">What to outsource</h4>
<p>While every company will have its own specific requirements and goals, there are a few rules of thumb that treasurers should bear in mind when considering treasury outsourcing. BELLIN’s Haumesser says the activities best suited to an outsourcing arrangement include time-consuming tasks that occur repeatedly, such as data collection and reporting, as well as tasks that need a structured process, such as payment processing and netting – “In general, all tasks which do not need an individual decision/human intervention.”</p>
<p>TreaSolution’s Carmody, likewise, notes that in general, “tactical treasury functions that are repetitive are best suited for outsourcing.” He adds, “In many instances, if the treasury function can be flow-charted, all or some of the function can be outsourced.” However, he also notes that organisations should not fully outsource functions which include critical control security measures, and/or that require strategic decision making.</p>
<p>According to Haumesser, other activities that should not be outsourced may include tasks that require specialist knowledge of the company or its processes, such as liquidity planning. She also notes that outsourcing may not be permitted for some tasks due to compliance, such as “decisions about the investment or refinancing of cash positions.”</p>
<h4 id="outsourcing-technology">Outsourcing technology</h4>
<p>Van Tol says that in addition to low value treasury activities, “we now see also outsourcing of functional and technical support surrounding treasury technology solutions, like TMSs, payment systems and other specialised treasury technology software.”</p>
<p>He notes that despite the importance of a functioning TMS or payment system for a treasury function, such systems do not always get the required support from internal IT departments, which may be looking to standardise and outsource their own activities. “We now see consultancies and IT companies offering Treasury Managed Services as a way to provide a cost-effective solution to alleviate the key man risk to which they are currently exposed with their IT department,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="ingredients-of-a-successful-arrangement">Ingredients of a successful arrangement</h4>
<p>When implementing an outsourcing arrangement, it’s important to get things right from the outset. As such, treasurers will need to give plenty of consideration to which specific tasks can be outsourced, and which stakeholders will need to be involved in the project. They will also need to ask the outsourcing provider some key questions. Carmody suggests the following as a starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How long has your company been in business?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the response time if there’s a problem with these services?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is the single point of contact in case there are questions/issues?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long are you able to provide treasury outsourcing services?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication is key in such arrangements, and BELLIN’s Haumesser emphasises the importance of initial communications in terms of ensuring all the relevant information has been passed on. As well as providing the necessary information to the service provider, she adds that companies should make sure they have a clear understanding of what the service provider will deliver.</p>
<p>It’s also important to understand that a strong relationship is key to any treasury outsourcing arrangement. “Treasury tends to include small numbers of personnel in large organisations,” says FTI Treasury’s Leavy. “It’s not like in the accounting, AP and AR environment where you can have hundreds of people working – you’re talking about a small number of people. So the expectation from a company that is considering outsourcing is that the treasury service provider is very integrated, and is part of their treasury organisation.”</p>
<p>As such, relationship is an important consideration – as is the ability to be flexible. Leavy also says a good service provider will look to add more value to the service that’s being provided by suggesting ways of reducing costs, speeding up processes and minimising risks.</p>
<p>But of course, there are also some pitfalls to avoid when implementing an outsourcing model. Carmody warns companies not to outsource too much too soon, for example. “It’s tempting to outsource all tactical functions upon contract signing,” he says. “I would suggest that treasurers consider outsourcing treasury functions in phases to ensure that all functions are being implemented and completed in an appropriate and secure manner.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Having the right capital structure in place is essential when it comes to supporting a company’s growth, achieving the flexibility needed to accommodate any unexpected bumps in the road, and harnessing opportunities for M&amp;A when they arise. It also represents a significant consideration within a company’s overall approach to risk management.</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers, managing capital structure is an important area of responsibility, from striking the right balance between debt and equity, to making decisions about dividends and understanding the tax implications of different financing instruments. What’s more, given that the company’s capital structure can evolve over time, it’s important for treasurers to keep a close eye on market conditions and any developments that may necessitate a shift in approach.</p>
<p>With this in mind, what considerations should treasurers bear in mind when approaching the task of capital structure management?</p>
<h4 id="striking-a-balance">Striking a balance</h4>
<p>Capital structure is a term used to describe the particular mix of debt and equity that a company uses to fund itself. A company’s business operations, acquisitions and capital expenditures can be funded using a variety of sources, including equity (ie selling shares to raise capital) and debt (ie borrowing funds via debt instruments such as loans or bond issuance).</p>
<p>Different companies will approach this differently depending on factors such as the company’s size and industry, as well as the current macroeconomic environment. There are, of course, some important differences between the different sources of capital, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost of funding.</strong> Broadly speaking, equity is a more expensive funding source than debt, as investors take on a higher risk than when lenders provide debt funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverage.</strong> Despite this, companies that take on high levels of debt experience a higher cost of debt due to the greater probability of default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accountability to shareholders.</strong> Shareholders own a portion of the company, meaning they will need to be consulted on certain decisions, whereas debt financing doesn’t give the lender control over the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact on cash flow.</strong> Regular debt repayments may adversely affect cash flow, whereas equity doesn’t include specific repayment obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tax deductibility.</strong> Interest paid on debt is usually tax deductible, unlike dividend payments on equity shares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk in the event of liquidation.</strong> If a company goes into liquidation, a hierarchy is in place to determine which creditors are paid back first. Shareholders are at the bottom of the list and are therefore the last group to be paid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to determining the optimal capital structure for a particular business, a number of factors will need to be taken into account. Venkat ES, head of Asia Treasury Products, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America (BofA) explains: “A company’s capital structure can be dynamic as it is dependent on shifts in its internal policies, local regulatory requirements (such as minimum or maximum shareholding), tax environment and liquidity situations (HQ and local), profitability, and commitment to local markets.”</p>
<p>In practice, many companies will opt for a capital structure that includes both debt and equity components. The relative proportions of debt and equity used by a company will determine its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), a calculation which states the weighted average of the company’s cost of equity and cost of debt. Traditionally the rule of thumb is that the best capital structure is the one which provides the lowest WACC. However, this is not set in stone, as David Blair, Managing Director, Acarate Consulting, explains in the box on below.</p>
<h4 id="the-treasurers-role">The treasurer’s role</h4>
<p>Overseeing the company’s capital structure is an important element of the CFO’s responsibilities. PwC’s 2019 Global Treasury Benchmarking Survey, Digital Treasury – It takes two to tango, said that capital structure is a priority for 100% of CFOs – joint first with cash flow forecasting, and ahead of funding (98%) and currency risk (69%).</p>
<p>That said, corporate treasurers also have a key role to play in making sure the company’s capital structure is the best fit for its needs. PwC’s survey noted that an increasing push for internal sources of growth “creates an opportunity for treasurers to think more strategically about capital structure and the balance sheet.” Respondents to the survey identified capital structure as the fourth most important priority for treasurers, ahead of bank relationships, working capital, and technology and digital innovation.</p>
<p>“Capital structure management is a key pillar of a company’s risk management approach and an important area of responsibility for treasurers,” says Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Director – Regional Treasury Services Centre Asia Pacific at Johnson &amp; Johnson. “It examines how we finance the overall operations and growth of the company by using different sources of funds, ie from its own balance sheet, capital raising or loans.”</p>
<p>For treasurers, the objectives of capital structure management may include maximising shareholder value, achieving the flexibility needed to realise opportunities for M&amp;A, and reducing the cost of capital. In addition, a company’s capital structure will need to be sufficiently flexible to suit the organisation’s goals and requirements as economic conditions evolve. As such, achieving the right balance is something that will look different to different companies.</p>
<p>“Managing capital structure is a very important activity for a corporate treasurer, although the level of involvement may vary from company to company,” says BofA’s Venkat. He explains that capital structure has a direct impact on a company’s funding strategy, cash flow management, dividend repatriation, and debt management. “It also has an indirect impact on its FX/IR risk management and bank relations if local currency other than its HQ reporting currency is involved, where local bank support is needed especially in some restricted markets,” Venkat adds.</p></div>

<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Calculating leverage</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading">David Blair, Managing Director, Acarate Consulting</h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How have companies traditionally calculated leverage?</h4>
<p>Traditionally leverage was determined with reference to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the WACC curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WACC combines the cost of debt and the cost of equity. Equity is generally more expensive than debt, especially after the tax shield on interest (interest on debt is tax deductible, whereas dividends on equity are not tax deductible). However, excessive leverage – ie too much debt – will drive up the cost of equity. This is because higher leverage increases risk, mainly due to the fact that higher interest payments may not be sustainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CAPM allows us to calculate the cost of equity with the (equity) market rate of return, plus the individual stock’s beta, which is the volatility of the individual stock compared to the market volatility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WACC can be found online and on Reuters and Bloomberg. It’s still a fairly standard metric, though there is much academic debate about how exactly to calculate it. WACC is also used for things like corporate investment decisions, such as building factories, developing products and entering new markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, companies with stable revenues can have higher leverage because they are very likely to be able to cover the interest payments. A typical example is power companies, as light and power are always needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="whats-changed">What’s changed?</h4>
<p>The current situation deviates from the traditional approach in a number of ways. For one thing, technology companies and other favourites ‘always’ run net cash balance sheets with no debt and tons of cash. Decades ago, this was because the technology sector was risky and needed a strong balance sheet to survive. Now, these are the biggest companies on the planet (and therefore hardly risky start-ups) and still have an abundance of cash. Academics cannot explain this (certainly not with formulae) and ascribe it to market sentiment and perception.</p>
<p>In addition, interest rates are at historic lows, and have been for a while. This makes it easier to cover interest payments so that companies can have much higher leverage than has been traditional. Creditors therefore have to look at interest cover in the P&amp;L, rather than leverage (ie the debt to equity ratio) on the balance sheet. Of course, when (or if) interest rates revert to historic norms, then many companies will struggle to cover interest payments.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-this-mean-for-treasurers">What does this mean for treasurers?</h4>
<p>Treasurers can balance all this by managing the balance sheet towards a target rating, which effectively subsumes all the relevant metrics. Obviously, they also have to comply with any covenants on debt outstanding.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="what-to-consider">What to consider</h4>
<p>Optimising the company’s capital structure is a task that includes a number of activities and considerations. “The types of activities that are likely to fall within the scope of capital structure management include defining appropriate borrowing levels to limit loan funding to that which the company can service without causing financial stress,” says Clifton-Bligh. “Additionally, decisions on dividend repatriation and capital injection also form part of the capital structure responsibilities of treasurers.”</p>
<p>In order to manage capital structure effectively, Clifton-Bligh says considerations include “the risk and cost of debt vs equity; matching cash flows to meet interest and capital repayment obligations, flexibility of those various instruments against the underlying need for financing, and the taxation implications of exceeding debt to equity ratios.”</p>
<p>Venkat, meanwhile, says that treasurers need to consider factors such as the following: the company’s internal liquidity situation; the level of commitment to local markets; debt and capital market conditions; whether the company is in an expansion or consolidation stage; the local legal/tax/currency control related regulatory requirements, including the ability to repatriate excess liquidity out of the country, tax treatments and key metrics including return on equity, debt-equity ratio, liquidity/current ratio, profitability, dividend paid rate.</p>
<h4 id="considerations-in-asia">Considerations in Asia</h4>
<p>For treasurers in Asia, there are also some specific points that they will need to bear in mind. Clifton-Bligh points out that the maturity of the legal and financial environment, as well as the regulations in Asian countries, “may create challenges for treasurers as they conduct their capital structure activities.” She adds that examples of such challenges include “the availability of suitable debt products and tenure to match the company’s requirements, cost, taxation consequences of equity – some countries impose additional taxes on companies that meet a threshold of capital.”</p>
<p>BofA’s Venkat, likewise, says that treasurers may face challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Legal requirements regarding the type of investments, percentage shareholding and local partner requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevant tax regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency control regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local management influence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capital support by local banks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Venkat points out that capital structure is mainly driven by tax and is restricted by relevant local legal requirements. “Often, changes in market conditions can have considerable impact on the availability and accessibility to capital,” he says. “Corporate treasurers need to stay ahead by anticipating the changes and ensuring that the treasury can carry out critical functions such as liquidity positions, settlements and risk management.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, capital structure management is an important element of the treasurer’s responsibilities. While this is not something treasurers will determine in isolation, pinpointing the right balance between debt and equity – and managing this effectively over time – is key to ensuring a company has the agility needed to respond to evolving market conditions and harness opportunities. The coming months are likely to bring some significant challenges, particularly in Asia, so treasurers should continue to ensure the capital structure in place continues to be the best fit for the company’s needs.</p></div>

<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Q&amp;A</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading">Harsha Basnayake, Asia-Pacific Transaction Advisory Services Managing Partner, Ernst &amp; Young</h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How significant an activity is managing capital structure in terms of the treasurer’s overall responsibilities?</h4>
<p>We have always held a view that managing the capital agenda of the business is core to the survival of any management team because it underpins the longer-term success of the business. The capital agenda of any business represents a set of activities relating to: raising or accessing capital for growth or to fund day to day operations; investing or deploying capital to new investment opportunities that may be both organic and inorganic; optimising the use of capital in the business portfolio and preserving or managing the risk and adopting to changes in the business environment.</p>
<p>An efficient capital structure is the output of a well-managed capital agenda. While this should really be on the CEO’s and CFO’s agenda, the treasurer plays a very critical role in monitoring the broader macro-economic activities and balancing the short, medium and longer-term capital needs of the business. The treasurer is best placed to advise on what type of a structure permits the company to be agile, responding to diverse market conditions in managing its overall capital agenda.</p>
<h4>To what extent can a company’s capital structure evolve over time?</h4>
<p>A company’s capital structure has to evolve over time depending on the growth trajectory it is on. In a disrupted low growth environment, companies have to maintain a high degree of flexibility in their capital structure.</p>
<h4>What factors do treasurers need to consider when managing the company’s capital structure?</h4>
<p>This is a difficult question as these factors may vary depending on the circumstances confronting the business.</p>
<p>I would expect them to be guided primarily by the capital agenda activities undertaken by the company based on the growth trajectory that the business is on. Business success at the end is measured by the overall shareholder value creation as well as business resilience depending on the circumstances faced by the business – and treasurers present a barometer to guide where they should invest and how such activities should be funded.</p>
<p>For this to happen effectively, treasurers need to have sharp focus about the medium-term market volatility and be creative to map the funding mix for businesses.</p>
<h4>How might market conditions affect how treasurers approach this topic in 2020?</h4>
<p>We see a couple of challenges. We are experiencing a very volatile market – markets in our part of the world are experiencing low growth, are vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, and on top of that we are now faced with the coronavirus impact – which has really been a black swan event. Risk of recession in some of the markets is quite real. It is a time where treasurers have to be quick to act and have access to multiple capital sources so that there is flexibility to change course as needed.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>It is essential that treasury operates within a strong environment of process, control and reporting; if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.</p>
<h4 id="capital-management">Capital management</h4>
<p><strong>Funding:</strong> treasurers raise capital from debt and equity arkets. Once this capital is drawn down, the treasurer can influence the cost of utilising this capital on a day-to-day basis. There will be fixed costs associated with raising capital but there are variable costs in utilising certain debt capital, especially revolving facilities. Take the case of a USD revolving credit facility: the spread between one-week and three-month USD LIBOR is currently 37bps or US$38,000 on US$10m per annuum. Managing this debt on a more frequent basis is time consuming but you can offset this by implementing an efficient process and utilising your TMS.</p>
<p><strong>Cash flow forecasting:</strong> consistent, complete and accurate short-term cash flow forecasting cannot be understated in terms of the savings that can be achieved by treasury managing available cash, utilisation of loan facilities and ability to place cash in fixed term deposits. This includes the ability of treasury to have accurate forecasts by currency so that a long position in one currency can be utilised to fund a short position via the treasury function.</p>
<p><strong>Working capital management:</strong> I also call out management of working capital as an area that can generate significant cost savings. The three elements of working capital – receivables, payables and inventory – all have an impact on the group’s cash/capital, and on the cost paid for that capital. It is quite a complex area because it requires interaction and buy-in across business operations, with multiple stakeholders with competing demands.</p>
<h4 id="transactions">Transactions</h4>
<p><strong>Cash management/bank accounts:</strong> treasury has direct control over its bank account and cash management structures, and can influence how other parts of the business manage their cash. This requires consistent and ongoing reporting, analysis and ownership. Ownership is key to ensure areas identified in reporting are actioned.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign exchange:</strong> foreign exchange (FX) trading platforms enable full visibility on ‘best price’ execution which can be linked to the TMS for straight through processing. This also enables reporting and analysis to ensure that treasury has visibility on share of wallet which can be leveraged for pricing on other services with banks.</p>
<h4 id="services">Services</h4>
<p>Treasury needs to ensure that it is only paying for services it requires and is achieving competitive pricing for these services. Treasury is a dynamic function, and requirements will change year-on-year. An annual review of services can identify opportunities for cost saving.</p>
<h4 id="reporting-communication-and-technology">Reporting, communication and technology</h4>
<p>The key to achieving cost savings and efficiencies is consistent reporting on activities, communication to those who can action change, and explaining the rationale. Technology should be utilised to support an efficient process and enable identification of costs by developing and continuously enhancing your reporting. The management methodology, ‘Plan-Do-Check-Adjust’, is a great continuous improvement tool that will facilitate cost saving within any treasury function.</p></div>

The next step is to evaluate each process, and redesign them, such that they are standardised and more efficient across the organisation. This analysis will uncover potential overlap or duplication of efforts in multiple areas within the organisation. By eliminating non value-added activities and avoiding duplication of efforts, treasury is helping to cut costs.</p>
<h4 id="obtain-cash-visibility-to-optimise-liquidity">Obtain cash visibility to optimise liquidity</h4>
<p>One guaranteed strategy to reduce costs is to have accurate visibility of available cash on a daily basis across all or most bank accounts. This transparency will uncover trapped cash within the organisation that will allow treasury to concentrate all excess cash in order to reduce debt (in leveraged organisations) or to optimise investments (in cash-rich organisations). In the former case, treasury is reducing interest costs, and in the latter, treasury is increasing interest profits.</p>
<h4 id="transform-the-treasury-organisation-to-a-more-centralised-model">Transform the treasury organisation to a more centralised model</h4>
<p>A natural consequence of standardisation across treasury processes is the ability to execute them with an optimised number of resources. Avoiding duplication of efforts will release resource time across the organisation, so they can focus on other value-added activities while at the same time reducing the labour cost of treasury resources to execute the essential treasury tasks.</p>
<h4 id="leverage-treasury-technology-to-make-it-all-work">Leverage treasury technology to make it all work</h4>
<p>Treasury technology is evolving constantly. We are seeing the integration of artificial intelligence, business intelligence, blockchain and API into treasury applications. Treasury teams must make it a mandate to evaluate and implement the appropriate technologies into the day-to-day operations. Treasury management systems allow for the automation of standard treasury processes, the connectivity to financial institutions to provide cash visibility and optimise liquidity, and straight through processing from internal systems (ERPs) to the financial institutions with security and speed. Technology enables small treasury teams to execute a broad range of treasury processes across multiple geographies.</p>
<p>By no means is this an exhaustive list of treasury initiatives to help reduce costs. There are other opportunities such as bank relationships, currency risk management, debt management, investment management, payments and fraud control that must be explored as part of the overall treasury assessment. Treasury must continue to be in an innovating mindset in order to continue cost-cutting efforts while remaining relevant to the organisation.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>If you are looking to find ways to optimise costs, why not look at the following categories and see if there are opportunities for you to explore further?</p>
<p><strong>Bank fees:</strong> do you understand the different items for which banks are charging you? Account analysis statements can be cryptic and can run into several pages. Ask your banks if they can provide an Excel version of the fees so that you can analyse the 20% of categories that typically contribute to 80% of costs. Also, ensure you have reporting in place to provide analysis of fee trends and to automatically flag any increase beyond a certain threshold.</p>
<p>Do you earn an earnings credit rate (ECR) from banks to help offset fees? When was the last time you analysed whether you have sufficient fees to offset ECR credits fully? Converting accounts to an interest-bearing account may be more beneficial.</p>
<p>In the US, some banks charge Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) fees on balances. It may seem like these are fees that go to the government but actually these are regulatory costs that the banks are trying to pass on to customers. This item can mask the true interest you earn from the bank.</p>
<p>Do you have bank accounts that have not seen transactions for several months and could be closed? Are there lockboxes open which see a minimal number of cheques? Could virtual accounts make sense for your organisation as a way of consolidating the number of bank accounts you have? Do you have a large proportion of payments via wire, when ACH or SEPA could be used?</p>
<p><strong>Interest costs:</strong> there are many ways to evaluate and optimise the interest cost expense and income for treasury:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How does the current provider of interest income or expense compare to others in the market? When was the last time you did a comparison?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where there have been changes in the interest rates in the market, does your pricing reflect this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you work with procurement to standardise payment terms or extend terms? For suppliers who struggle, you may be able to offer supplier financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a net investor and have excess cash, have you looked at dynamic discounting for your suppliers? It could earn more interest income than might be available through banks, ECR or mutual funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you looked at receivables financing through securitisation/asset backed securities (ABS) to get cheaper financing, especially in cases where your customers’ credit is better than your own?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transaction costs:</strong> do you have a high volume of transactions? Treasury management systems can help reduce manual work, streamlining compliance activities, and managing communication across multiple subsidiaries. Where automation is not possible because of complexity or limitations in your business model, it’s worth exploring shared services centres.</p>
<p><strong>Software subscriptions:</strong> are you still paying for software subscriptions for systems that you no longer use? Have you looked at competitor systems to compare the value being delivered by your current systems? Some companies with robust IT support dedicated to finance may be able to build simple in-house systems that are more customised to your business needs but without annual subscription and maintenance costs.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The Treasury organisation assists in managing costs in a number of key ways. While the Treasury organisation itself is not the ultimate decision maker for how and where to cut costs, it is responsible for rapidly and accurately executing these cost-cutting decisions. Thus, Treasury is a key player that enables a company to realise cost savings in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Treasury ensures that payment templates and payment approval workflows are in place. For instance, if there is a change to a lower cost supplier, Treasury ensures that the new supplier can receive and reconcile payments, and there is no disruption to the company’s supply levels and business operations. It oversees the reorganisation of operating accounts and sets up expedited processes for collecting and disbursing funds as one would see in the case of an exit from a business unit. Treasury ensures that funds are available to make accurate payroll and severance payments, and that the correct information accompanies these payments.</p>
<p>In addition, through its own operations, the Treasury department can help mitigate costs by ensuring that a company can effectively manage its cash flows while maintaining liquidity, optimising cash resources, and obtaining access to financing facilities that minimise borrowing costs. Technology also plays a major role in this effort. With the automation of key treasury functions such as reconciliation and payment initiation and approval, a company can reach settlement faster. This enhanced speed can dramatically mitigate the associated liquidity and payment risks in addition to the costs associated with delays in processing.</p>
<p>Also, with fewer risks and more control over payment and information float, treasurers can view and forecast their cash positions with much greater precision to gain a better view of cost-cutting opportunities in their working capital. For example, these enhanced cash positions can provide more power over payment ability, which can be leveraged with suppliers to lower the costs of their working capital financing by negotiating better terms for accounts payable. In addition, treasurers may be able to gain a more accurate view of their cash positions and lower unnecessarily high revolving lines of credit which can dramatically cut interest payments or bank fees. By utilising these insights, treasurers can spend less time understanding where they stand and more time making better cash management decisions.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The Year of the Rat is traditionally associated with new beginnings – but for treasurers, 2020 is also likely to see the continuation of existing challenges, from an uncertain trade environment to funding constraints for suppliers. But despite these issues, there’s also considerable potential for new technologies such as AI and blockchain to drive greater automation and efficiency.</em></p>
<p>Saturday January 25<sup>th</sup> marks the Chinese New Year, which in 2020 brings the Year of the Rat. The rat was last seen in 2008 – a year still imprinted on many treasurers’ memories as marking the height of the global financial crisis. But as the first of the 12-year cycle of animal signs, the rat is traditionally associated with new beginnings, as well as with diligence and positivity.</p>
<p>That said, for corporate treasurers, 2020 is likely to include the continuation of a number of challenges. Risks arising from geopolitical events continue to be a major consideration for treasurers, not least because of the continuing trade war between the US and China. At the same time, treasurers in APAC will be confronted with numerous other issues, including regulatory change and the impact of funding constraints on suppliers.</p>
<p>But the year ahead will also bring plenty of opportunities for treasurers willing to embrace them. Technology has the potential to bring real benefits in the form of automation, efficiency and the ability to make better-informed decisions. By harnessing these developments effectively – and by partnering more closely with the business – treasurers will be better placed not only to overcome the challenges that 2020 will bring, but also thrive in this evolving landscape.</p>
<h3 id="shifting-sands">Shifting sands</h3>
<p>Given the turbulence that has shaped global markets in recent months, in the year ahead treasurers will certainly be looking for opportunities to drive improvements wherever they can be found. But it’s unlikely that the recent challenges will subside anytime soon. Christopher Emslie, Asia Regional Treasurer at General Mills, says that 2019 was a “year of uncertainty” – and he expects this to continue into 2020.</p>
<p>“With that uncertainty comes a lot of risk,” he says. “For us, the first goal is to try our best to mitigate those risks and make sure we’re in control of everything that’s happening. That means making sure we have the controls in place that will help us navigate difficult times – whether that’s social unrest in Hong Kong, Brexit or the trade war in China.” Emslie adds that as well as impacting companies’ ability to do business, geopolitical challenges also have implications for foreign exchange and currency volatility.</p>
<p>“The geopolitical situation in 2019 will likely continue to impact in 2020 and be loosely monitored by treasurers – including the global effect of US elections in 2H20,” says Mark Evans, Managing Director, Transaction Banking at ANZ Institutional. “Treasurers will also keep a close eye on the impact of the changing interest rate environment.”</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, Evans says that “for borderless businesses, treasurers will be focused on ensuring their credit profiles are appropriate for the dynamic economic conditions.” He also notes that businesses will be keenly interested in being prepared for changing benchmark rates and a possible negative interest rate environment.</p>
<h3 id="regulation-and-beyond">Regulation and beyond</h3>
<p>In addition to the implications of political and economic uncertainty for trade, regulatory change is another area that has brought numerous challenges for treasurers in recent years – and in 2020, treasurers will be keeping a close eye on regulatory developments and government initiatives.</p>
<p>“Although automation is helping stay ahead of the changing local regulatory and compliance landscape, local knowledge will be critical in ensuring businesses stay compliant with key regulatory and legal changes,” says Evans. “This will be an important point of consideration in the decision-making process as businesses explore new markets and tackle the growing costs associated with regulation and compliance.”</p>
<p>Faisal Ameen, head of Asia Pacific Global Transaction Services at Bank of America, says that treasurers “should continue to monitor and assess the impact of regulatory changes such as the import/export rules, currency restrictions and data onshore rules on their day-to-day operations.”</p>
<p>He adds, “On a positive note, government-led initiatives on distributed ledger technology, trade digitisation and real-time processing are gaining momentum in Asia Pacific and treasurers should continue to work with their banking partners to reap the benefits and improve operating efficiencies.”</p>
<p>Other topics of interest will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Funding.</strong> Kjel Christiansen, Managing Director, Americas and APAC at technology company Taulia, notes that “other more subtle trends are coming out which will have a direct impact on treasury.” For example, he points out that the cost of funds is steadily rising, while “Australian banks are tightening on lending.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FX risk.</strong> Ameen says that as prevailing market conditions continue to stay volatile, “it is important for treasurers to reassess their FX risk management strategy continuously based on their existing risk appetite to manage their exposures.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The rise of ESG concerns.</strong> As ANZ’s Evans explains, another notable trend is that businesses are increasingly embedding environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles for sustainable finance models. “I see this as another key trend as we experience greater awareness within the industry,” he says.</p>
<p>Bank of America’s Ameen likewise highlights the growing focus on ESG, which he says is “gradually becoming a business imperative, with treasurers now tasked to embed sustainable practices in their treasury processes.” He adds: “We expect this trend to turn into a priority with the rise of the millennials.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keeping track of cash.</strong> Challenging conditions are likely to keep treasurers’ attention squarely focused on the importance of razor-sharp cash management. “Prolonged economic certainty will keep cash at top of mind for Asian treasurers,” says Christiansen. “How we see that manifesting will be a renewed focus on liquidity and access to cash.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Addressing supplier health.</strong> According to Christiansen, cash shortages will be most pronounced in the SME area, “where SMEs are still experiencing lending challenges from banks due to the lack of collateral to secure lending and a general lack of venture and growth capital. This then becomes a risk for larger businesses in the region and indeed the globe, as supplier risk increases.” He notes that treasurers can address this issue by implementing early payment solutions that will provide suppliers “with a confident source of liquidity.”</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">China-US trade war: the story so far</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Among the notable developments of President Trump’s presidency, for corporate treasurers the trade war with China is one of the most significant.</p>
<p>Aiming to protect US jobs and support domestic manufacturers – and raising accusations of intellectual property theft – the US has so far imposed tariffs on over US$360bn of Chinese products. In response, China has levied its own tariffs on US$110bn of US goods.</p>
<p>These developments have prompted companies in Asia to assess the impact on their supply chains and could lead some to shift their supply chains away from China. “This is prompting treasurers to work alongside their procurement counterparts to expand their supply chain from China into other markets such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia to safeguard supplies,” says Faisal Ameen, head of Asia Pacific Global Transaction Services at Bank of America.</p>
<p>The situation continues to evolve: in December 2019, a preliminary trade agreement was announced, putting a halt to further tariffs that had been planned on additional Chinese goods. The ‘phase one’ deal saw the US offer to reduce existing tariffs on Chinese goods. China, meanwhile, is reportedly set to purchase an additional US$200bn of American goods and services, including poultry, pork and soybeans, in the coming two years.</p>
<p>Of course, this issue is not the only concern for treasurers in APAC. As Ameen points out, “While the US-China trade war has larger global impact, within the region the Korea-Japan trade dispute and the protests in Hong Kong may have ripple effects on the region’s economic growth and stability.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="harnessing-technology">Harnessing technology</h3>
<p>Another major theme for 2020 is the evolution of technology and the rise of digitisation. “The efficiencies available due to the technological changes would be on top of mind for most treasurers,” says ANZ’s Evans. “Treasury departments will benefit greatly by better understanding the impact of emerging technologies across the industry; particularly on the creation of more efficient working capital and liquidity management tools for their businesses.”</p>
<p>When it comes to specific developments, Emslie says that treasurers in the region will increasingly be exploring the opportunities offered by using AI/robotics to improve efficiencies and processes, while also improving control and mitigating risk.</p>
<p>“A lot of us aren’t there yet – there’s still a long way to go on our journey,” he says. “At this point I think it’s about building more efficiencies into our ERP and getting information in to gain a better understanding of how business works for us – as well as improving the lives of our people on the ground by taking away some of the need for manual intervention.” Emslie notes that by doing so, people can be freed up to spend more time analysing information.</p>
<p>It’s clear that treasurers have a significant role to play in spearheading the adoption of cutting-edge technology within their organisations. A 2019 survey commissioned by DBS Bank found that 30% of respondents say that CFOs and corporate treasurers as responsible for “pushing the agenda of their technology colleagues” – compared to 11.3% who saw this as the responsibility of the CEO.</p>
<h3 id="gaining-momentum">Gaining momentum</h3>
<p>Gaurav Jain, Senior Manager, Treasury Advisory Services at Deloitte Southeast Asia, says that a recent Deloitte survey found that “while liquidity and financial risk have been identified as one of the top priorities for treasurers, new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML), Big Data and robotic process automation (RPA) are also generating interest with wider community and are up for increased adoption.”</p>
<p>He notes that the ongoing political uncertainty around Brexit, US-China trade tensions and global growth challenges “still demand caution on FX management” – and they also “push for an increased use of technology in the treasury function for effective monitoring and management of risk.”</p>
<p>“We also foresee a greater push for intelligent reporting,” says Jain, noting that the treasury function has typically used treasury management systems to generate such reports in the past. “Having more sophisticated BI reporting will allow decision makers to have a more holistic view of risks and opportunities,” he says, noting that the move from producing financial reports towards the adoption of sophisticated analytical reports providing strategic recommendations to the CFO “will allow treasurers to be seen as value-adding partners to the business.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Technology: developments to watch</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Bank of America’s Ameen notes that there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to treasury transformation, so treasurers should take the time to understand and evaluate the benefits each technology offers, considering its business objectives and resources available. He summarises the technologies that treasurers should keep an eye on in 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Robotic process automation (RPA) and AI:</strong> “Advancements in RPA and AI are enabling treasury efficiencies while redefining treasury operations,” says Ameen. He says areas in which RPA and AI have been applied “to new levels of success” include cash forecasting, receivables reconciliation and the adoption of virtual accounts for cash concentration purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributed ledger technology (DLT):</strong> Ameen notes that while DLT offers many possible applications and is touted to have the potential to transform treasury, the change is still yet to come. “However, 2020 could be the inflection point as industry bodies get down to developing market standards, as well as practical and executable solutions.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time processing:</strong> “The benefits are tangible – improved working capital and greater transparency on flows,” says Ameen. “Many treasurers are already leveraging automation to streamline business processes, and real-time treasury is a natural next step to optimise treasury.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He adds that the payments space is leading the way, and is also the catalyst for broader change. “For instance, the move to real-time electronic submission of documentation could be combined with faster payments for greater efficiency in trade finance.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="accuracy-and-automation">Accuracy and automation</h3>
<p>Taulia’s Christiansen is another to emphasise the role technology is playing in revolutionising treasury. “Cash forecasting tools which leverage AI will be able to predict cash flows with greater accuracy in a tenth of the time it currently takes,” he says. “Technology platforms are also filling a void around funding SMEs.”</p>
<p>In addition, Christiansen notes that many banks are being required to complete a greater level of diligence, which historically has been very manual. “Partnering with a tech platform simplifies and automates a very manual and archaic process,” he comments.</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming challenges</h3>
<p>But while there is clear interest in these technologies from corporate treasurers, companies may also need to overcome certain obstacles when seeking to adopt them. The DBS survey found that seven out of ten APAC companies “risk being left behind by a lack of digital strategy and execution plan.” The survey found that the three most significant risks to digital adoption were the speed of change and complexity of the enabling technologies, execution challenges and delivery of outcomes, and the availability of talent to help execute digital transformation efforts.</p>
<h3 id="business-partnering">Business partnering</h3>
<p>Last but not least, treasury may once have been regarded as a function that operates in relative isolation from the rest of the business. But since the financial crisis, treasurers have played an increasingly strategic role within their organisations – which requires strong communication between treasury and the business.</p>
<p>PwC’s 2019 Global Treasury Benchmarking Survey, Digital Treasury – It takes two to tango, reported that strategic thinking was seen as a crucial skill for treasurers of the future by 99% of respondents, while 84% cited the importance of business partnering capabilities. In addition, the survey highlighted the importance of a range of soft skills including communication skills, management skills and people skills, as well as experience outside treasury.</p>
<p>Becoming a better partner to the business is another of the 2020 goals mentioned by General Mills’ Emslie. “We’re trying to get as close to the business as we can,” he says. “We want to be able to give them a far better view of what’s happening so that they can make better business decisions – whether it’s cash, whether it’s helping with working capital and improving DSO, DPO and inventory.”</p>
<p>When it comes to achieving this, Emslie says the main focus is on communicating effectively with the business and explaining “what we’re trying to do on their behalf.” But as he explains, this is a two-way exercise: “We need to understand what business is doing, they need to understand what we’re doing – and then together we can come up with a plan to say, ‘This is what we can do for you’.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>As ambitious projects go, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) takes some beating. With all the grand plans to establish the infrastructure capable of connecting great swathes of Asia and Europe, it needs businesses to get involved. What does it take for a treasurer to ensure their organisation’s engagement with BRI is successful?</em></p>
<p>BRI is not just an infrastructure project in which land, sea and air ports become links in a vast chain connecting Asia and Europe; it is intended to be “a collaborative ecosystem”. When Deloitte released its report entitled ‘Embracing the BRI ecosystem in 2018’, it was at pains to point out that although the focus to date has been on energy, infrastructure and communications, the next five years or so will see BRI cast its gaze wider, covering sectors as diverse as trade, manufacturing, e-commerce, tourism and culture.</p>
<p>As a multi-decade strategy to boost the flows of trade, capital and services between China and the rest of the world, BRI is a “physical, financial and policy connect”, says Vina Cheung, Global Head of RMBI, HSBC. “It is not just about Chinese firms, but about local companies in countries along the route and multinationals that are capable of being part of the project.”</p>
<p>BRI represents a huge opportunity for Chinese and non-Chinese companies globally. With the current phase all about developing infrastructure, businesses engaged in the transportation construction, energy, water management and telecoms fields are likely to see most activity. But this list also includes opportunities for businesses that supply the main project firms, including the heavy plant manufacturers and materials suppliers, and professional service providers such as engineering firms, electrical specialists, and architectural practices. The need for legal specialists at this stage is also important for contract work. “Any business involved in these sectors globally should proactively seek out opportunities,” says Cheung.</p>
<p>The effect of these projects will ultimately be to ease the flow of trade. This stage will act as a catalyst for more commercial development along the routes, especially for goods and services. The reason is simple: improved efficiency should lower the cost of doing business – one of the underlying BRI objective, notes Cheung. With the growth of BRI trade estimated by HSBC to surpass US$2.5trn in the next decade, the opportunity here, she adds, is “significant”.</p>
<p>Despite the dominance of state-owned enterprise (SOE) over the major BRI infrastructure projects to date, Deloitte authors Sitao Xu and Lydia Chenargues also anticipate increasing opportunities for privately owned enterprise and the world’s MNCs. Similarly, they see country-level involvement shift from the current preponderance of emerging nations to a greater number of mature economies.</p>
<h3 id="risk-and-reward">Risk and reward</h3>
<p>However, for businesses of all types, the nature of BRI as both a long term and costly investment puts risk to the fore. Of the 70 countries Chinese state media says have joined the BRI (meaning about 125 have not), the sovereign debt of 27 is defined as ‘junk’ by the three main ratings agencies. Fourteen have been given no rating at all.</p>
<p>The majority of Chinese investment to date has focused on its geopolitical priorities such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. These are amongst countries that will need to demonstrate significant financial reform in order to see major capital inflow from MNCs.</p>
<p>The extent of China’s investment so far raises concerns about its own BRI debt levels. Indeed, global ratings agency Fitch said in January 2017 that the “lack of commercial imperatives” behind BRI projects means that it is “highly uncertain whether future project returns will be sufficient to fully cover repayments to Chinese creditors”.</p>
<p>MNCs understand that although there may be an opportunity for massively increased trade flows, BRI could equally generate vast almost unserviceable debts for a long time to come; success is not guaranteed. Whilst not downplaying the risk, Deloitte’s Xu and Chenargues argue that the risks are less severe than many assume. In fact, their belief is that “concern is overrated”, adding that “China has long insisted that BRI is a commercial venture, not an aid programme”.</p>
<p>With China’s strong bi-lateral connection with many of the higher risk countries, and its conviction of the need to ultimately develop along commercial lines, the Deloitte authors suggest that SOE-led BRI projects are effectively underwritten by China’s policy banks. This should help ease concerns of external investors, they feel, and bringing in quality. Interest is rising.</p>
<h3 id="beneficiaries">Beneficiaries</h3>
<p>With Beijing having committed a further US$124bn at its May 2017 BRI Forum, President Xi Jinping also announced the commencement of ‘BRI 2.0’. In this, the focus on infrastructure shifts to investments in international finance, mining, manufacturing, tourism and culture. The forum attracted delegates from around the world, including Vladimir Putin amongst state leaders and officials from almost 40 countries; parts of Africa, South America and western Europe all potentially benefiting.</p>
<p>Naturally, large companies are paying very close attention and banks are eyeing up the prospects too, with Citi winning a deal from Bank of China to manage a complex US$3bn bond issue in April 2017. The money is for funding the opening of Bank of China branches across Asia, Eastern Europe and East Africa.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. A recent Asian Development Bank report suggested that, between 45 Asian countries, there should be an investment of US$26trn to 2030, to fix the apparent infrastructure shortfall. Two-thirds of that sum is for further transport and power development.</p>
<p>At this stage, with most of the construction deals going to Chinese firms, the biggest western beneficiaries will be financial and professional services, says Jonathan Bewes, Vice Chair, Corporate and Institutional Banking, Standard Chartered. The demand is for technical expertise and specialist products, and funding to match. Standard Chartered announced in December last year that it will commit US$20bn by 2020 to support BRI.</p>
<p>No wonder then that major MNCs such as Siemens, Honeywell, GE and ABB have already climbed on board the BRI train, along with around 50 Chinese SOEs that have so far played a part in the 1700 or so infrastructure-related ‘BRI 1.0’ projects.</p>
<p>GE, for example, drew only US$400m in equipment orders from BRI projects in 2014. By 2016, that figure stood at US$2.3bn, with a pipeline of US$7bn for its gas turbines set over the following 18 months.</p>
<p>If Chinese business will be the biggest beneficiary, BRI may well raise fears that it is nothing more than a one-way conveyor belt for Chinese goods to reach the rest of the world. The US has already called for the bidding on related contracts to be transparent. Notwithstanding non-Chinese discomfort, the country’s media outlet Xinhuanet reported in May 2018 that the value of China’s imports from BRI countries increased faster than its exports in 2017 (a 20% year-on-year rise versus 8.5%). This is the first time it has happened since BRI was announced in 2013. It’s not proof of equitable trade flows, but it may be seen by some as a step in the right direction, the current US/China trade war excepted.</p>
<h3 id="international-involvement">International involvement</h3>
<p>“We should build an open platform of cooperation and uphold and grow an open world economy,” said President Xi at the May 2017 BRI Forum. In its insistence that BRI is open for all – not least because it cannot itself foot the expected estimated final capital cost that ranges between US$4trn and US$8trn – Beijing is seemingly handing an opportunity for foreign business to join the journey.</p>
<p>Where, for example, there is a meeting between market need on the one side, and the provision of professional services (and the trade of branded consumer products) on the other, there will be occasion for non-Chinese firms to flourish for many years to come. If domestic firms cannot offer the skills and experience (or brand desirability) to match those of their overseas counterparts, then the trade is seemingly there for the taking.</p>
<p>However, there is a danger of corporates erecting too much of a rigid framework around something that may be more conceptual in nature, says Bewes. “There are plenty of opportunities in one country or another for businesses to take advantage of, but much of this could be seen as ‘business as usual’,” he argues. Standard Chartered, he adds, has in effect been working on ‘BRI’ projects for the past few decades – in 2017 alone, the bank closed 50 BRI deals, half of which were in Africa. “Each business will have to evaluate what opportunities fit with its own strategy and manage the risks accordingly.”</p>
<p>Conceptual or not, BRI is an occasion for businesses to look beyond their own traditional operating models. Some forward-looking international traders are already incorporating a flexible approach in terms of the goods they source and sell, notes Cheung. A garment manufacturer, for example, might shift its thinking in terms of a finished product being shipped out from a single location, towards the idea of the availability and use of different materials at different points along the route, creating a highly flexible supply chain.</p>
<p>The ‘flexible’ approach may go some way to mitigating the risks inherent in emerging market operations. But the risk when operating in some BRI countries can be higher than others, and businesses should thus be supported by those with on-the-ground knowledge, says Cheung. “Asia has a very dynamic and varied regulatory regime; with many countries along the belt and road still developing, the local laws, regulations and tax arrangements can be complex.”</p>

<figure class="left"><img alt="Belt and Road initiative: directions of flow" height="307" src="/i/2018/07/2018-07and08-tta-02-ia__belt-and-road-example__625x307.jpg" width="625"/></figure>
<h3 id="treasury-approach">Treasury approach</h3>
<p>The real test in this environment is for companies to navigate through a full corporate lifecycle, from entering into a new market, to growing the business or maintaining the project, to enhancing capabilities through integration with a regional hub or headquarters. With treasurers playing an increasingly important role in company growth, thinking through these different stages is vital, says Cheung.</p>
<p>In general, the difficulty for businesses working in third-party countries (certainly beyond G20 nations) can be substantial, adds Bewes. “Partnering with banks that have on-the-ground presence in those territories, where they are part of the local infrastructure, will offer a huge advantage in terms of help and advice navigating the local cultural, regulatory and legal challenges.” The major western banks such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citi, boast long operational histories along the BRI routes.</p>
<p>For treasurers, at the start there is a need to define the optimal business form for entering any new market with a BRI project. For the project to function in a sustainable way, this would include a consideration of the best legal structure (many US firms, for example, are working in JVs with Chinese SOEs, according to the Centre for Strategic &amp; International Studies). Treasurers should also define the most appropriate hedging policies, working capital models and, of course, approach to financing.</p>
<h3 id="financial-concerns-for-treasurers">Financial concerns for treasurers</h3>
<p>One of the major themes of BRI is sustainability, notes Bewes. Indeed, Chinese policy-makers speaking at the International Green Finance Forum in Beijing in September 2017 put forward their belief that green finance is the key to making BRI a sustainable project. China has issued US$36bn of green bonds, a figure representing 39% of global issuance. “China will honour our commitment to reduce carbon emissions and make more efforts to promote green finance globally, including facilitating green investment in the Belt and Road region,” said Yin Yong, Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China, quoted by Global Capital. “We believe green finance should be a key pillar of its success.” It’s an area that treasurers should be looking at.</p>
<p>The broader question of BRI project finance will almost certainly begin to generate the need for creative forms of capital, Bewes believes. “There is a question about how infrastructure is developed further as an asset-class in itself. This will be an important angle, in order to attract and mobilise private sector capital.”</p>
<p>The FT has reported that many western banks are leaving the funding of big state-sponsored infrastructure projects to local banks and development finance institutions. They are instead focusing, for now, on ancillary business, such as providing FX, trade finance, interest rate swaps, or cash management. Strong treasury relationships in this environment are therefore essential.</p>
<p>Whether engaging in a BRI 1.0 infrastructure project or 2.0 trading arrangements, for the incumbent bank to support ongoing local business (and familiarity is a real comfort in any new venture), it is necessary for treasury to establish if its bank has a presence in each new market and whether its data flows can be integrated with group operations; standalone operations massively increase risk. It will also be necessary to discover how well-established the bank is in each location, both in terms of size of balance sheet and connectivity to the business infrastructure (including local regulators, local clearing systems and, for FX, whether it is a market maker or taker).</p>
<p>With capital controls likely to be a concern for inbound investors, this is something treasurers will also have to plan and manage. Indeed, with many different currencies and stringent controls likely to be encountered along BRI routes, at the very least, some complex FX scenarios will be encountered, cautions Cheung.</p>
<p>Manifold issues such as currency, local culture and customs, legal and taxation differences suggest that there are and will be many challenges to be addressed when tackling a BRI project. Partners and advisors are available to assist and should be used fully; it does not have be done alone.</p>
<p>Mindful of these concerns, it is also worth bearing in mind the declaration President Xi made at the May 2017 BRI Forum in which he said, “this is the project of the century”. Treasurers are in a good place to help their organisations become a successful part of it.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Embarking on an initial public offering (IPO) is a big step for any company. Obtaining a listing can bring many benefits, from fulfilling the company’s need for capital to enhancing its public image. IPOs are also sometimes used as an exit strategy for startups, as an alternative to selling the business.</p>
<p>Many treasurers will progress through their careers without ever being involved in an IPO. But when an IPO does take place, the treasurer may have the opportunity to play an important role in the process. “Every IPO benefits from having a primary point person,” says Adam Farlow, Partner and Head of Capital Markets, Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa at Baker McKenzie. “The treasurer is often the perfect person for that – someone inside the company who knows where to find information and to pull together the right internal team.”</p>
<p>Farlow notes that IPOs are intense exercises for everyone involved, and that often – particularly late in the process – the CEO and CFO are pulled in lots of directions to do early look investor meetings, analyst presentations and the roadshow itself. “Having a treasurer who knows the business intimately, and that is available, therefore makes a huge difference,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-the-treasurer-help">How can the treasurer help?</h3>
<p>Roger Lamont, Treasury Advisory Services Director at Deloitte, says that treasurers are key to an IPO for three main reasons. “They play an important role in the process, both by raising cheaper debt and using their investor relationship skills,” he explains. “Post IPO, they can also avoid shocks by managing the financial risks in the group properly.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Raising debt.</h5>
<p>Where debt is concerned, Lamont explains that listed businesses typically have lower leverage than privately owned or private equity-owned businesses. “As a result, the business typically needs to deleverage in preparation for an IPO, and that reduced leverage allows the company to raise cheaper debt.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Managing investor relationships.</h5>
<p>At the same time, Lamont says that treasurers are accustomed to managing external stakeholders such as banks and credit rating agencies – as well as bondholders if the company has capital markets debt. “These skills are obviously key while going through the IPO process, and once listed,” he says. “Effectively you already have a team within the group that has the necessary skills and experience of facing the market. The treasurer is therefore best placed to help the company through the IPO in terms of the roadshow and investor management process.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Managing risks.</h5>
<p>The third component of the treasurer’s role, according to Lamont, is managing financial risks such as FX and commodity risks after the IPO has taken place. He explains that once a company is listed, there is more pressure on the company to meet its announced forecast earnings. It is therefore important for treasurers to start managing the relevant risks well before the IPO occurs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="ipos-in-2017">IPOs in 2017</h3>
<p>While 2016 was a quiet year for IPOs, activity in the earlier stages of this year has been considerably higher. “Although the London IPO market is down on prior record years, 2017 has been stronger than 2016 in both volume and number, and the pipeline into 2018 feels stronger than ever,” comments Farlow.</p>
<p>At a global level, EY’s third quarter report on the global IPO market noted that IPO volume in the first nine months of the year had already exceeded the total volume from 2016, with 1,156 deals already completed and US$126.9bn raised. Accordingly, the report notes that 2017 is on track to be the busiest year since 2007 where global IPO activity is concerned.</p>
<p>According to the report, activity was dominated by Asia Pacific, which accounted for 60% of the IPOs taking place over the first three quarters of the year. The report noted that there is a particular demand for technology IPOs in mainland China, which hosted 353 IPOs in the first nine months of the year.</p>
<p>The report also found that exchanges in both EMEIA and the Americas have been more active in the first nine months of this year compared with 2016, noting that activity in the US was “unusually slow” last year, with contributing factors including the uncertainties around the US election and interest rate hikes.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="making-the-most-of-the-treasurers-skills">Making the most of the treasurer’s skills</h3>
<p>No two deals are alike, and the treasurer’s role in an IPO will depend on a number of different factors. “It varies tremendously from deal to deal, much as the role itself varies from company to company,” says Farlow. “In some deals, we virtually never see the treasurer. In others, they are driving the process – and these invariably have smoother execution.” Farlow also points out that many early-stage companies don’t yet have treasurers, with the role sitting with the CFO or FD. “But even for those companies, the earlier they can be on-boarded, the better for the process.”</p>
<p>Lamont adds that the nature of the treasurer’s specific responsibilities will play a part in determining their role in an IPO. “There are businesses I’ve looked at where cash management is the only real issue the treasurer has to deal with, as there is a strong debt structure already in place,” he says. “The treasurer’s role in that type of IPO is likely to be much smaller than at a company where the treasurer’s responsibilities are larger or more complex. This might be the case when the business is being carved out of a group, or where there is a significant FX risk, or if the debt needs to be refinanced.”</p>
<p>It is clear that treasurers can be highly involved in an IPO process. Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer at Greek food company Chipita, experienced such an involvement when Edita, a joint venture between Chipita and the Berzi family, completed a dual listing on the Egyptian Exchange and the London Stock Exchange in 2015. “Myself and Chipita’s legal department were on board for a month and a half, assisting with all the documentation and assignments and working with global coordinators and bookrunners,” Polykrati explains.</p>
<p>With Chipita now in the early stages of exploring and evaluating a potential IPO, Polykrati is involved in several aspects of the process such as optimising the capital and debt structure and managing the logistics. However, she says that her previous experience with the Edita listing is unlikely to be directly relevant to the current process. “The Egyptian market is very unique, and we weren’t involved for the duration of the deal,” she observes. “The treasury’s role in this IPO will be much more thorough.”</p>
<h3 id="hitting-the-ground-running">Hitting the ground running</h3>
<p>For Daniel Jefferies, a timely move to take up the role of Group Treasurer at Equiniti in May 2015 meant that he was involved from an early stage in planning for the company’s IPO later that year.</p>
<p>“I came to Equiniti at a reasonably early stage in their decision-making process,” he explains. “It’s not uncommon in that scenario for an organisation to evaluate a number of different tactical and strategic options – so it might be a trade sale, it might be a merger, it might be another private equity sponsor, or it might be the IPO route.”</p>

</figure>
<p>In the case of Equiniti’s IPO, Jefferies says that he played a part in helping the company work through the different options – although the decision was ultimately driven by the owners, private equity group Advent International.</p>
<p>Once the decision had been made to go up the IPO route, Jefferies’ focus shifted to the debt structure of the deal. “Obviously an IPO is an equity raise,” he says. “You’re normally raising equity to allow an owner to exit or reduce a holding. But there is commonly a debt component as well – and it was the debt component where the bulk of my attention was focused.”</p>

<p>Jefferies actively chose to take on as much of the debt capital process as possible in order to free up management for the work involved in meeting investors and advisors. “On the debt side, our arrangement was fairly straightforward as we were just going for a bank deal,” he says. “We had existing high-yield notes in issuance and a fairly typical structure that you’d find with private equity ownership. Obviously the high-yield notes would be redeemed. We would retire the existing working capital facility and put in place a new debt facility.”</p>
<p>Equiniti secured new bank funding in the form of a term loan and revolving credit facility, which meant the company moved from a highly levered situation to a crossover credit structure. “So we weren’t in high-yield territory, but we weren’t in investment grade territory either – we were some way from that,” says Jefferies. “That’s something you can aspire to and trade into over time as you improve your bottom line.”</p>

<p>An IPO is not without its challenges. Farlow says that the single most important item is not to underestimate the amount of work involved in the process. “Good company counsel and underwriters can do a lot to help manage the process,” he says. “But ultimately, this is the company’s story that has to be told in the way the company wants to tell it. The day the IPO closes, life will be different and the company will have to deliver on that story that has been told to investors, so don’t let the process get in the way of allowing management to tell that story.”</p>
<h4 id="educating-the-market">Educating the market</h4>
<p>In the case of Equiniti’s IPO, Jefferies says that one challenge was that as the company was moving from a high-yield structure to a pure bank deal, the company’s presence in the bank market was limited. “We were coming to the table with a business that wasn’t well known, and that wasn’t known in the bank market,” he explains. “We therefore had to educate people not just about the terms of the deal, but also about the terms of the credit itself – what is the business? What does it do? What drives the top line? What drives the bottom line? How are you going to do it?”</p>
<p>Jefferies says these factors made the IPO process more complicated than in a typical refinancing deal. “In a refinancing, even if it’s a new bank deal, you will be known and people will understand your business,” he says. “There will be information about you in the public domain, whether through S&amp;P or Moody’s or through existing bank lending. But if you don’t have this, you have to work hard with your advisors and your new lenders to educate them on what you’re doing and how you’re going to do it.”</p>
<h3 id="after-the-ipo">After the IPO</h3>
<p>The work involved in an IPO doesn’t stop once the IPO itself has taken place – and treasurers will need to consider how the IPO will affect treasury operations in the future. Jefferies emphasises the importance of getting a deal in place that will be right for the company going forward. He notes that in any financing deal, the most difficult part is delivering on the numbers after the financing has actually been secured.</p>
<p>“After closing the deal in 2015, the business went away and worked very hard in 2016 and delivered on the numbers,” says Jefferies. “And in 2017 we’ve just announced a major acquisition which takes us into a new geographic territory.” He explains that it’s important to remember that rather than seeing the launch of an IPO as the end of the journey, treasurers should regard that as day one. “You then have to keep up the work to get that credit known in the wider market.”</p>
<p>For Equiniti, the success of the process was demonstrated when the company undertook a debt raise as part of the rights offer process. “The uptake on our deal has been very encouraging, both with existing members and new members,” says Jefferies. “I would say that’s due to the hard work the company has put in over that period.”</p>
<h4 id="investing-in-treasury">Investing in treasury</h4>
<p>Treasurers may need to consider other new requirements which can arise following an IPO. “One point to note is that your treasury operations and infrastructure may require some investment post IPO, reflecting the additional requirements,” says Lamont. “You’ll potentially need additional people, processes and systems to deliver that.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have to take on board that this is a unique piece of experience that may never be repeated in your career.”</p>
<p><cite>Daniel Jefferies, Group Treasurer, Equiniti</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, he points out that a smaller treasury team may need to put in place more rigorous segregation of duty controls. “Another example is that with increased scrutiny you may need stronger and better reporting, which may require additional resources or systems.”</p>
<h3 id="stepping-up">Stepping up</h3>
<p>Finally, Jefferies has some advice to offer other treasurers who may be embarking on the IPO process. “You have to take on board that this is a unique piece of experience that may never be repeated in your career,” he says. “You’ve got to enjoy it, as well as working hard and being prepared to engage with the relevant stakeholders. You may not always find that the asks are clearly defined, but you have to be prepared to say, ‘What can I do to facilitate this process?’ That’s how you, as a treasurer, can add value and make a difference.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>eCommerce presents a tremendous opportunity for businesses to tap into new revenue streams around the world. Treasury departments must help their company meet the challenge, with agile eCommerce players ready to eat the lunch of anyone who doesn’t keep up.</em></p>
<p>Did we witness a watershed moment in the development of electronic commerce this summer? Amazon’s announcement in June that it was paying US$13.7bn to acquire upmarket US grocery chain Whole Foods seems likely to mark an opening shot from the world’s biggest online retailer as it moves into America’s US$700bn grocery business.</p>
<p>It’s the latest chapter in the expansion of eCommerce, whose growth is reflected in the market capitalisation of its biggest players. In 2013 Google was first to hit the figure of US$300bn, while Amazon and Facebook climbed above the same level in late 2015. Further growth potential is reflected in the fact that while US online buying reached US$395bn last year, the figure represented only 11.7% of total US retail sales.</p>
<p>In May this year the elite US$300bn+ group was joined by China’s tech giants Alibaba and Tencent, whose Asia Pacific home markets offer the potential for huge further growth. Potential new members include Chinese internet conglomerate and video game company NetEase and search engine Baidu, dubbed “the Google of China”. Each has conditioned consumers to expect not only overnight delivery of goods but also same-day fulfilment.</p>
<p>Such is the power of these online behemoths that when they lobby leaders of the world’s major economies to eliminate barriers to digital trade, politicians respond. At the most recent G-20 summit in July, members put eCommerce and the internet’s steadily growing impact on the global economy top of the agenda. A central part of their efforts will be tougher international and domestic legal frameworks for security, privacy and data protection to engender greater trust in doing business online.</p>
<p>“We’re now seeing acceleration in the growth of eCommerce – even in the relatively developed channels of North America and Europe where it is extending into new areas,” says Yory Wurmser, Senior Analyst at market researcher eMarketer. “Consumers are more willing to go online to buy big-ticket items such as furniture as well as groceries; hence the Whole Foods acquisition. US consumers are now taking up the concept of doing their weekly grocery shop online.”</p>
<p>eMarketer estimates that while total retail sales globally will rise from US$22trn last year to over US$27trn by 2020, double-digit growth will push the figure for eCommerce sales over the period from US$1.915trn to US$4trn+. Asia Pacific, as the world’s largest retail eCommerce market, will dominate, with the region’s total rising from just over US$1trn last year to around US$2.725trn by 2020.</p>
<h3 id="an-evolving-term">An evolving term</h3>
<p>So what is generally understood by ‘eCommerce’? Tom Durkin, Managing Director for Digital Channels at Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that in many respects the term has become outmoded. “Basically it refers to all the transactional activity that has moved to become an online experience although it doesn’t convey the fact that it’s a 24/7 online activity.”</p>
<p>“The concept has steadily shifted to one of mobility, with a growing number of consumers using their mobile phone to make purchases,” adds Durkin. “eCommerce via mobiles helps to establish more of a personal relationship between the buyer and the supplier, with the latter able to develop a better understanding of customers.”</p>
<p>Initially, the PC drove eCommerce’s strong organic growth in Europe and North America back in the 1990s, as businesses and individuals grew increasingly comfortable with transacting online. The emergence of new platforms and social media, such as Facebook, opened up previously untapped opportunities.</p>
<p>“Growth has more recently got impetus from tech-savvy smartphone and tablet users, particularly in countries with logistical challenges, where shopping in traditional bricks-and-mortar locations can be inconvenient in many areas or even unsafe,” says Thomas Lin, Director, Innovation, Mobile, E-commerce, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered. “Even in the US many of the shopping malls are in decline or closing, while Amazon is championing robotic bodies.</p>
<p>“So eCommerce is certainly here to stay, but the distinction between mobile and online payments and the traditional bricks-and-mortar shops will blur – as will that between online and offline transactions.”</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers, eCommerce offers new markets to be reached as there are no longer geographical limits, but Wurmser adds that it also constitutes a threat if they fail to grasp the opportunity. “Agile eCommerce players are ready to eat your lunch if you don’t keep up, so you need a clear strategy,” he says.</p>
<p>“Your customers are already online, so treasurers need to take a more sophisticated view of sales,” adds Wurmser. “The success of eCommerce depends on the strength of your analytics – which role does each channel play and how much of the company’s overall sales does it generate?”</p>
<p>The underlying element of better analytical data allows a supplier to determine, through their customer’s behaviour, where he or she wants to go next, says Durkin. “Amazon was the original pioneer, as evidenced by the buying suggestions it regularly sends to customers based on their purchasing history – an innovation has steadily been adopted by financial services providers and other sectors.</p>
<p>“eCommerce is no longer simply just transaction-oriented but is increasingly focused on the supplier keeping one step ahead – and we’re still at a fairly early stage of the journey.”</p>
<p>Durkin believes many treasury departments are still working out how to navigate their way in this rapidly changing world and digitise their workflows. They can take advantage of processes that eliminate inefficiencies, so digitisation is – among other benefits – helping to make their cash forecasting more accurate.</p>
<p>“It’s also helping with the establishment of completely new businesses, such as Airbnb,” he adds. “Starbucks has been particularly adept at taking full advantage of the rise of mobile apps, using it to gain data on its customers and provide them with special offers, specific services and other promotional activity that keeps them interested.”</p>
<h3 id="apacs-new-consumers">APAC’s new consumers</h3>
<p>While growth in European and North American markets was fairly sedate in the early years, Asian consumers and businesses took to eCommerce more readily, says Nick Howden, eCommerce Market Management Lead, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. Indeed the size of China’s eCommerce market overtook that of the US in 2014 and by last year reached an estimated US$749bn. What’s more, while around 88.5% of US citizens have internet access, the figure is only around 50% for China’s population of 1.3bn, leaving plenty of yet-unfulfilled potential.</p>
<p>“As middle-class populations become more affluent and are able to afford the ever-lowering cost of smartphones, more people are able to come online and mobile access to the internet is the major driver for eCommerce in Asia,” says Howden. “Once they do so, they are able to become a consumer – in the sense that they can actually start to transact in an online environment.”</p>
<p>“The younger generation has particularly taken to it – many are really leapfrogging technology, so they’re moving beyond traditional devices into a mobile environment very quickly,” adds Howden. “When you think of a country the size of India, the region’s highest growth eCommerce market, reports suggest that 64% of its population and 72% of internet users are aged under 35 whilst over 300m individuals are online.”</p>
<p>While Asia’s demographics are particularly favourable for eCommerce, growth for online sales channels requires a greater proportion of its populations accessing basic banking products and services. “Government-backed digital programmes are bringing more people online and availing banking services to populations for the first time,” adds Howden. “So while we’re making great headway – with India leading the charge – in other countries, such as the Philippines, Vietnam or Indonesia, you’re looking at 40% or 50% of the population still without bank accounts. These countries are availing solutions which digitise cash and enable online purchases, or consumers may prefer cash-centric solutions such as cash on delivery or ATM transfers which are after checkout with more friction. There is a gap between card users, bank account holders and smart phone pre-paid subscribers which is a target market for eCommerce growth.”</p>
<p>Howden says India’s progress is thanks to a forward-looking administration. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in office since 2014, recently spoke of a ‘New India’ within the next five years, with digitisation of the economy a key contributor. “The government is trying to digitise many of the paper-based services that were previously very cumbersome and difficult to access – such as pension schemes and state assistance for unemployment benefit,” he says.</p>

<h3 id="bmw-revs-up-for-its-second-century">BMW revs up for its second century</h3>
<p>German car giant BMW, which in 2016 celebrated its 100th year in business, has noted customer behaviour changing in recent years in favour of digital channels.</p>
<p>“Today’s global reality is that customers research and shop online 24/7 when buying high-end commodity products, which includes premium cars and brands such as BMW and the Mini,” says Christina Hepe, corporate and governmental affairs and spokesperson for group business and finance communications.</p>
<p>“Customers expect an omnichannel experience, so the collaboration of traditional retail formats and the ever-evolving eCommerce formats are an essential backbone for the future of car sales. So we aim to offer an integrated, premium customer experience across different customer touchpoints, including shopping on their smartphone, talking to our BMW Genius (an app providing videos and other features on the product range) or collecting their vehicle at a dealership.”</p>
<p>BMW sees the pace of the eCommerce market continuing to accelerate. “The success of our efforts will be determined by the successful combination of online and offline sales,” says Hepe. “The desire of customers for a more flexible sales process is a key factor in our online strategy. It’s vital to link these contact points so that customers can move seamlessly between them; this allows the group to interact with customers in a customised manner, at the appropriate time through their preferred channel.</p>
<p>“Every vehicle sold in the UK market for example can now be bought online – from vehicle selection and configuration to financing and payment. Customers can receive individual support from a Product Genius via chat or telephone or by contacting the dealer directly.” BMW is currently reviewing the extent to which the initiative can be rolled out in other markets and to other of the group’s brands. “It’s important to note that what works well in one market cannot necessarily be transferred or replicated in another,” notes Hemp.</p>
<p>With BMW i Ventures, set up in 2011, the group has its own venture capital unit for investing in fast-growing technology start-ups. The unit invests in the group’s innovation spectrum under Strategy Number ONE &gt; NEXT, an initiative defining BMW’s future goals, which include electric cars and automated driving. Its remit, says Hemp extends “beyond the traditional automotive value chain, from mobility services through vehicle technology to fintech.” A recent example is its investment in Caroobi, which offers a certified garage service, booked online for a fixed price.</p>
<p>What threats and opportunities does eCommerce present for treasurers? Hemp says that BMW’s group treasury believes that new digital formats present great opportunities for improved operational efficiency. “eCommerce is a growing channel and the fastest change is coming from the Asian region, especially China,” she notes.</p>
<p>“One example is the investor communication and interaction for asset-backed security (ABS) transactions in China that, besides using email, also happens via WeChat – among the country’s most important social media mobile apps.”</p>
<p>“If we communicate our bond or ABS transactions for example via new eCommerce channels it is more transparent, often quicker than conventional communication channels and easier for potential investors to access the information.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<p>“Among its initiatives has been signing up some 250m Indians for bank accounts, as well as creating new digital platforms for cross-border settlements which are common in eCommerce businesses.” These initiatives, in turn, encourage banks and third-party providers such as payment aggregators and telcos to devise services such as digital wallets – aka the e-wallet – enabling consumers to make electronic transactions via their tablet or smartphone.</p>
<p>So how can smaller businesses claim a slice of the steadily-increasing pie? Howden reports that Citi has seen the more agile players dominate a local market by identifying a domestic need which needs disruption or creates value, responding with a product or service nuanced to reflect that market and backing it up with great service. He cites Indonesia’s motorbike taxi booking service Go-Jek as a textbook example.</p>
<p>“Go-Jek took a service that has been around for years – roadside hailing a motorbike for transport – and brought it into a mobile phone app-based solution. That works very well in Indonesia, where traffic volumes are intense and traditional car-based transportation services are more challenging. By taking an existing solution and formalising it, they’ve been able to expand beyond their core ride-hailing service into about 15 different business lines, including payment services to their large and growing user space. The data they collect from the various businesses is very valuable.”</p>
<p>Another steadily-growing business is Travelzoo, an online service offering deals on hotels and flights, whose online community globally totals 28 million members with around 3.6 million in the Asia Pacific region. Its service includes a weekly top 20 email newsletter highlighting the best last-minute deals.</p>
<p>Honnus Cheung, Travelzoo’s CFO for Asia Pacific says that setting up an ecosystem in a new territory is less of a challenge than setting up an e-payments mechanism. “That’s why we negotiate with the local acquiring bank and payment processor to accept the local currency. We also use the same agreement to pay our local merchants. The challenge for us is that we have to manage quite a lot of foreign currency right now and many of them – particularly the yen or the Australian dollar – have been volatile against the US dollar.</p>
<p>“We try to centralise our major currencies by having one regional bank, into which we can put the majority of our cash balance.”</p>
<p>A further challenge for Travelzoo is identifying the sweet spot between efficiency and security in the customer payment journey. “Nowadays, most of the customers expect an efficient and convenient online or mobile payment process, especially for small value purchases,” says Cheung. “At the same time they also demand that the payment transaction is secure.</p>
<p>“That’s why if the price is a little high – more than US$500 for example – as the provider you may need to create a more secure mechanism in which to conclude the transaction. As a customer and a credit card holder, I want to be provided with better cyber-security and to achieve it I may have more patience than to demand that it’s completed in just one or two clicks.”</p>
<h3 id="financial-strategy-is-key">Financial strategy is key</h3>
<p>So how should treasurers go about optimising their role in this brave new world? “It’s crucial that treasurers educate themselves. Don’t sit back and watch an eCommerce transformation happen through a purely financial perspective,” suggests Ken Yontz, Global VP, Transformation Management, for product information network 1WorldSync.</p>
<p>“Be strategically involved in the larger business decisions, as establishing an eCommerce presence requires devoted financial investment. Treasurers should understand the eCommerce tools and technologies in place to make smart financial decisions.”</p>
<p>Yontz believes that eCommerce presents obvious valuation opportunities for treasurers, as the more that successful companies open new channels of revenue, the more they will be worth. eCommerce implementation also provides opportunities to explore merger and acquisition strategies, digital strategy and value positioning in the finance space.</p>
<p>“However, setting the wrong digital strategy has serious financial implications and timing on investments – or lack thereof – will severely impact company finances,” he warns. “Growing eCommerce capabilities requires a strong financial strategy that supports digital commerce transformation.”</p>
<p>How might the market change over the years ahead? “As millennial consumers grow older, they’ll continue to take over the market in terms of wallet share,” says Yontz. “This generation grew up with technology in their hands, which is quite a shift from the catalogue-browsing, in-store shopping generation before them.</p>
<p>“As a result, you can expect the commerce experience to become more and more connected in the future, putting technology at the core of every customer interaction. eCommerce certainly won’t become the only channel to shop – there will still always be a need for human interaction in commerce – but the experience will become more convenient and informed through digital.”</p></div>

<p>A credit rating is the considered forward-looking opinion of a professional independent credit rating agency (CRA) concerning the relative ability of an entity to meet its financial commitments. The overarching aim is to provide necessary transparency, independence and consistency to the capital markets to help investors assess and price risk. The rating could be either international or national with ratings running in parallel. The latter concerns only issuers in their home market, meaning a higher rating could be achieved nationally than internationally (<a href="#taking-the-plunge-mahindra-and-mahindra">see the case study below</a>) but giving access only to the domestic markets and currency.</p>
<p>The aim in all cases is to bring transparency and consistency to the assessment of creditworthiness, aiding the accurate pricing of credit risk. Once attained, the chief benefit of a rating is the increased comfort that independent analysis gives to investors, potentially opening up a wider pool of investors. To achieve a rating, a corporate will have undergone a high level of disclosure and evaluation and, so for investors, although prudence suggests other sources of information should be added to the mix (not least the more detailed ‘personal’ story of the corporate issuer), ratings are commonly seen as a benchmark for helping to make investment decisions.</p>
<p>When rating a corporate, CRA analysts will source and sift a wide range of public and private qualitative and quantitative data. Once issued, public credit ratings are thereafter continually monitored and assessed in terms of issuer performance, providing stakeholders with as accurate, timely and consistent a picture of relative creditworthiness as is possible. Of course, it is up to the market to decide if that rating is useful or not.</p>
<p>For companies that have slid down the scale, even if it has moved into ‘junk’ territory (junk is predominantly an investor term, CRAs prefer ‘high-yield’ or ‘non-investment grade’), CRAs will continue rating it all the while there is debt outstanding, although if the information required to maintain the rating is not available (such as if the company is in liquidation) the rating can be withdrawn by the CRA. “Generally, regardless of rating level, investors would want and need a rating on all outstanding debt,” says Anjali Sharma, Head of Business and Relationship Management for EMEA Corporates, at Fitch Ratings.</p>
<p>The reality of deriving a credit rating is complex for the CRA not least because it must put its view into a very broad commercial context. “By assigning a rating, we are not just providing an opinion and a rationale about a company but we are also comparing it to all the other companies that we rate,” explains Moody’s William Coley, SVP Credit Policy, EMEA Corporates. Using a common language to discuss credit quality thus means an individual rating from one CRA allows an investor to compare relative creditworthiness regardless of the class of debt it is applied to. Although not all CRAs will take the same view of that creditworthiness, well-known equivalency amongst their ratings make for easy comparison.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-three-and-the-competition">The Big Three and the competition</h3>
<p>The first ratings agency was effectively created in 1900 by Wall Street errand-boy, John Moody. Poor’s Publishing Company (the precursor to S&amp;P) climbed on the bandwagon in 1916, and both were joined by Fitch in 1913. Today, the so-called Big Three issue an estimated 95% of the world’s ratings. However, there are 94 other credit rating agencies and organisations spread across 44 countries globally.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The obvious power of the three main players has created a desire to break that stronghold. Scope, an agency with offices in London, Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt, vowed to become an “alternative to the status quo”, taking on the Big Three in its European homeland. It first offered corporate ratings in 2012 following its merger with PSR Rating, a Germany-based firm specialising in the analysis of mid-size automotive companies.</p>
<p>In November 2013, credit ratings organisations from five countries (CPR of Portugal, CARE Rating of India, GCR of South Africa, MARC of Malaysia, and SR Rating of Brazil) formed a joint venture to launch ARC Ratings, a global agency that also had its sights set on the Big Three. Today it has 18 offices and about 400 ratings staff. By way of comparison, Moody’s alone employs 10,400 people worldwide and maintains a presence in 36 countries.</p>
<p>Concern that the Big Three credit ratings were not meeting the needs of emerging economies saw the rise of Hong Kong-based Universal Credit Rating Group (UCRG). ‘The only international credit rating agency based in the Asia Pacific area’ was officially founded in 2013 as a partnership between China’s biggest ratings agency, Dagong Global Credit, the US-based investor-funded Egan-Jones Ratings, and Russia’s privately-owned RusRating. Its inception was hailed by former senior World Bank vice-president Ana de Palacio as an “invaluable asset” that can take on companies which now dominate the global industry.</p>
<p>More choice for corporates means more transparency of opinion for investors but also perhaps increased confusion for corporates. Ratings advisors can guide companies through the selection and subsequent processes. This role is often taken by the lead bank employed by the corporate to bring its bonds to market. “A rating advisor can be invaluable for a company considering a rating for the first time,” notes Sharma, adding that more than one CRA may be used at one time and that changing agency is possible.</p>
<h3 id="from-top-to-bottom">From top to bottom</h3>
<p>Issuers will normally be given a rating as a business (Fitch for example refers to this as the issuer default rating). In addition, all its debt issuances can be rated separately (for Fitch, this is the instrument rating). If, for some reason, the company does not agree with the rating decision it can appeal to the CRA if it provides materially new or additional information, but there is no specific right to do so.</p>
<p>Broadly, ratings range from investment grade (where, for example, S&amp;P’s AAA is at the top, down to its BBB- at the bottom) to the non-investment or high-yield grade, which for S&amp;P ranges from BB+ down to D (D being a state of default). For all but defaulted ratings, or (in Fitch’s case) very lowly rated issuers where default risk is already very high in the ‘C’ to ‘CCC’ rating categories, the CRAs also offer a ‘rating outlook’ to guide investors on the likely direction of the rating over a one- or two-year period. This dynamic but self-explanatory assessment ranges between ‘positive’, ‘stable’ or ‘negative’, with the option of placing the issuer on a shorter timeframe (three to six months) ‘rating watch’ where events dictate, again citing a negative or positive stance based on the expected outcome of a major event (such as an M&amp;A).</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>A ratings watch can be applied when something material is expected to change the credit profile, explains Sharma (a debt-funded acquisition that might materially affect the leverage metrics, for example). A rated company will already have, she adds, “rating headroom” at its existing rating level whereby it has a degree of latitude before it would become necessary to consider changing the rating.</p>
<p>Although a low rating may be seen as undesirable or even “insulting”, the high-yield end of the spectrum it opens up for corporates still has an important role to play. “There really should not be a stigma attached to a lowly-rated company because ultimately a corporate can choose to operate at a capital structure that provides an optimal return for its shareholders,” explains Sharma. Indeed, it could decide to operate as a more highly leveraged company which may result in non-investment grade status. “Ultimately it is the company’s decision as to what capital structure it feels is appropriate for itself and for its shareholders,” she notes. And clearly there is an investor base covering all ends of the ratings spectrum.</p>
<h3 id="building-an-accurate-picture">Building an accurate picture</h3>
<p>“When a company is thinking about getting a rating, the sooner they engage with the rating agency the better,” advises Sharma. The reason is simple: at the time a bond is being launched, the company will be going through many different concurrent processes including bond documentation, meeting with lawyers and bankers, and organising roadshows.</p>
<p>The first step forward with the agency in the (typically) two to six-week process, is to create a formal ratings presentation of key facts and figures. This also entails a detailed Q&amp;A session with the CRA. Because CRAs do not give advice, the presentation may be prepared in-house by the company or with the guidance of its ratings advisor.</p>
<p>From here, methodological analysis will call upon a broad sweep of qualitative and quantitative data. It will include aspects such as financial profile, cash flow, earnings, capital structure, financial flexibility, corporate governance and group structure. To achieve a rounded view, typically a CRA would start with the previous three to five years’ of audited accounts giving it a base in terms of historical performance of the company. The base analysis will be supplemented by details on the business plan including its market position, anticipated transformative events (such as major M&amp;A), product portfolio, geographical presence, operational scale and flexibility and so on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a rating must be forward-looking, so history is never going to be the sole source, says Coley. Forecast information will therefore be required and it is likely that once all data has been aggregated, stress testing certain scenarios will help create that view.</p>
<p>It may be that a company wishes only to dip a tentative toe in the credit rating pool, in which case it may opt for a private, rather than public rating. This, Coley explains, allows the company to develop a relationship with the agency and industry analysts in a private setting. The advantage is that it enables the company to understand the way in which external parties view its credit status, how the agency rates it relative to its peers, and also to understand the key ratings drivers in terms of its ongoing ratings performance. It will then be the decision of the company – not the CRA – to choose when it wishes to make its rating public.</p>
<h3 id="managing-the-message">Managing the message</h3>
<p>All ratings are subject to regular reviews by the CRA’s rating committee, typically annually, although awareness of any grounds to examine it will call the rating committee to action at any time. Unlike price-based market-implied ratings, which may change from day to day, the purpose here is not just to provide ratings accuracy but also deliver a degree of ratings stability for investors and issuers. “Part of the essential role of managing a rating relationship and having the right rating out there is that it should be at least somewhat resilient to everyday volatility,” explains Coley. Ensuring this requires the identification and setting out in advance of the key drivers that could influence a rating. Such events might relate to a planned M&amp;A or divestment, or the publication of the annual report.</p>
<p>Of course, as ratings need to be forward-looking, all CRAs value a transparent relationship with their corporates. And, says Coley, wherever possible if a company is announcing a transformative event (such as an acquisition) “it is helpful for us to know what is coming, giving us an opportunity to form our view in advance of it happening”. The alternative is to run the risk of being placed on review, possibly for a downgrade, at least until the CRA has had time to formulate a full opinion and response.</p>
<p>Sometimes though events take on a life of their own. A company that has had an otherwise successful recent history may suffer a negative blip in a run of otherwise good fortune. CRAs must try to assess and calibrate such an event rather than having an automatic reaction. The recent events that led to the Moody’s A3-rated Volkswagen putting aside over €16bn to cover its diesel emissions crisis is a case in point. Because the lines of communication were kept open and management remedial plans were discussed, the firm’s rating was able to be maintained. “There is a lot of interaction and judgement applied,” states Coley. “It is certainly not a mechanical process, we don’t just look at historical figures or react on a hair-trigger basis to results as they come through.”</p>

<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Case study</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="taking-the-plunge-mahindra-and-mahindra">Taking the plunge: Mahindra &amp; Mahindra</h3>
<p class="management-summary"><em>When in October 2015 India-based multinational Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M) was assigned a Baa3 issuer rating with stable outlook by Moody’s (matching India’s sovereign rating) the company – which was already AAA-rated by a number of domestic credit rating agencies (CRISIL, India Ratings, ICRA and CARE) – it joined a select group of Indian corporates with investment grade status.</em></p>
<p>M&amp;M is a $16.9bn multi-sector business headquartered in Mumbai, with a presence in more than 100 countries. K Chandrasekar, the group’s EVP of Corporate Finance &amp; Investor Relations, says the international rating not only enhances the “finance brand” of M&amp;M but also adds credence to its Mahindra Rise programme which aims to place the company amongst the top 50 ‘most admired global brands’ by 2021. “The initiative to get this rating was a step in tune with this aspiration,” he comments.</p>
<p>The decision to go with Moody’s was based on M&amp;M’s pre-rating evaluation of the agency’s philosophy and rating methodology, coverage and industry understanding. This starting point led to “meticulous preparations involving data room, details and presentations”. A “crack team of finance professionals” researched, assembled and presented their findings to Moody’s. “The team undertook to understand Moody’s ratings of various industries and companies and the underlying drivers for ratings, linking this to our businesses,” explains Chandrasekar. Preparations were both “challenged and enriched” by the nature and structure of M&amp;M and the team sought help from M&amp;M’s relationship banks “whose interactions assisted us in appreciation of the process and enhanced our level of preparedness by practising shadow-rating exercises”.</p>
<p>Prior to this exercise, M&amp;M had been “mulling about the ratings for quite some time,” notes Chandrasekar. The team was aware of the resources it had to dedicate to create the right outcome but once engaged, although demanding, he says the process was also exciting. “It was in a sense, also a deeply reflective exercise and at the end of it, despite the toil and sweat, the leadership and the team felt enriched.”</p>
<p>With the rating secured, the importance of dialogue “at good and bad and in fact at all times” is acknowledged says Chandrasekar. “Sticking to agreed information sharing is a hygiene but ensuring a constant level of engagement is the real key. We have now started implementing this in our relationship with all our rating agencies.”</p>
<p>Although having an investment grade rating “gave the entire ecosystem of the group a boost”, Chandrasekar points out that the most “visible and immediate” impact is on treasury activities. “It improved our international access to capital and credit lines – and now even the most conservative of international banks have made a beeline to us,” he notes. “Today we are known not only as a sound treasury but also as an externally benchmarked treasury.”</p>
<p>Having been through the process, Chandrasekar is ready to impart his wisdom to other corporates seeking a rating. For any business aspiring to become a global company “it is an obvious thing to do”, but it is better to be done much in advance of raising capital, and then not just to fulfil a rating requirement. The exercise itself is “a long drawn-out one” in which business and finance functions “have to tango together”. As such, he feels it pays to have a team approach “and to take it in all earnestness as a self-discovery for the company”. However, he adds, the three most important elements for success are “preparation, preparation, preparation”.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>China’s economy is slowing, commodity prices are up and down, and a political crisis is brewing in the European Union. No wonder companies in Asia Pacific are adopting a ‘wait and see approach’ when it comes to their first stock listing. Treasurers, however, will have a key role to play when the right time eventually does come to go public.</em></p>
<p>Few decisions in the life of a company are quite so monumental as the decision to go public. Once a private company’s directors have agreed to do an IPO, the business will never be the same again. New sources of capital may need to be considered, new bank relationships nurtured, new reporting duties executed. And all of this, naturally, puts the work of the corporate treasurer very much in the spotlight.</p>
<p>More companies in Asia Pacific will be undertaking a first public offering this year than in any other region in the world. But before all these firms head to the Hong Kong, Singapore or Shanghai Stock Exchanges, a great deal of preparatory work will need to be undertaken. Here we take a look at what’s likely to be in store for the corporate treasurer.</p>
<h3 id="timing-it-right">Timing it right</h3>
<p>Once the IPO process has been set in motion one of the most crucial jobs for a company’s financial executives will be deciding at what point market conditions will be right to achieve the best result.</p>
<p>Right now it would seem that many firms in Asia have looked at the markets and concluded that the stars are not quite yet aligned. Although Asia Pacific continued to lead other regions for IPO activity in Q116, with 102 deals raising US$6.6bn, this represents a marked decline against the first quarter of last year. According to figures from EY, deal numbers in Q115 were 31% higher and the total capital raised was 55% higher.</p>
<p>“Lately IPO activity has been relatively muted in the Asia Pacific region,” says Max Loh, ASEAN and Singapore Managing Partner, EY. There are no shortage of external factors to blame: concerns over the condition of the global economy, volatile oil prices, and uncertainty in the capital markets. For all these reasons, Loh says, a “wait and see approach” has become the preferred strategy for many companies.</p>
<p>“We think companies are holding off for better valuations,” he says, “especially for the bigger transactions. A lot of the activity is supported by private equity and venture capital, and those companies can afford to wait and ride this volatility out.”</p>
<p>What a contrast with the previous year. In 2015, the Asia Pacific region dominated global IPO activity with Hong Kong, Japan and Mainland China topping the global leader boards by capital raised. Overall, 673 IPO deals (55% of listings globally) were made and nearly half the global capital raised last year emanated from the region.</p>
<p>Understanding what drove the record issuance we saw last year may tell us something about why companies are currently biding their time. “A lot of the companies that are listing in Hong Kong are actually mainland Chinese companies,” says Loh. “I think the the PRC (People’s Republic of China) will remain a key pillar of IPO activity in the short to medium term. But, of course, there is some softness in the market at the moment given increased investor concern over China’s economic fundamentals.”</p>

<h3 id="aurizons-ipo-journey">Aurizon’s IPO journey</h3>
<p>When the Queensland State Government announced plans to sell off QR National Ltd in 2009, Erin Strang, then the rail freight operator’s treasurer, knew she would have her work cut out.</p>
<p>The company would be split into two businesses, with Queensland Rail’s commercial activities to be separated from the government’s passenger services and eventually floated in late 2010. For the company’s treasury, there would be a lot to do in a very short space of time. “Once that decision had been made treasury had an involvement,” says Strang. “The equity market was a bit up and down in the lead up to the IPO but the end result was that we successfully listed.”</p>
<h4 id="raising-funding">Raising funding</h4>
<p>The success of what would become Australia’s largest IPO in 13 years was in no small part due to the hard work of Strang and her colleagues in the treasury department. Amongst other things, the company would need to consider how historical funding arrangements would be replaced with new ones. New bank relationships would also need to be formed.</p>
<p>“We had been government funded up until that point, so we had to think about how that existing debt structure was going to be resolved,” she says.</p>
<p>Even though there were no immediate plans for a bond issue, Strang says the company chose to solicit two credit ratings given the greater flexibility this would provide them down the track: “The initial debt was a bank facility, because of the timing and the ease of execution. But from the start the intention was always to diversify that and get greater diversity and tenor, which is what we have got today. Since then we’ve gone into the euro MTN and A$ bond markets.”</p>
<h4 id="building-relationships">Building relationships</h4>
<p>Forming and fostering the relationships with the credit ratings agencies and new banking partners the company needed post-privatisation was also high on treasury’s agenda during this time. A regular meeting framework was established and the half-yearly and annual updates were provided to give the credit ratings and banks the same transparency as enjoyed by its equity investors. “The value of that has really been seen since then as refinancing has been relatively straightforward. I think that is really because we’ve had a good relationship with our banks, as well as being done through fairly good times from a business perspective.”</p>
<h4 id="advice-for-treasurers">Advice for treasurers</h4>
<p>Asked what advice she would give to a treasurer of a company now planning its own first listing, Strang says it is all about balancing the end goal with the practicalities of the time available to execute the transaction. “Treasurers need to think about where it is the company needs to be and the stepping stones towards that,” she says. “They need to determine the absolutely critical dates from an IPO perspective, and consider how they will manage those dates.”</p>
<p>To that end, working out how one will respond if something does not go to plan can be beneficial, she adds. As anyone who has dealt with debt capital markets will know, rapidly changing conditions mean it is always good to have a backup plan. After all, the last thing any treasurer would want is that the company’s IPO doesn’t go ahead because they have not been able to get funding in place.</p>
<p>However, Strang cautions, the long-term consequences of an IPO leave little room for mistakes. “Whatever funding arrangements you put in place you are going to be living with them for some time, so it’s important that treasurers give themselves some flexibility.”</p>
</div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="where-to-list">Where to list</h3>
<p>At the same time as finance executives monitor market conditions and ponder the timing of their IPO, the small matter of where to eventually list the business will also need to be considered. Here in Asia there are no shortage of options for international companies.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, in particular, had a bumper year in terms of new companies listed and funds raised. “We saw a lot of activity last year,” says Doris Ng, Of Counsel, at Norton Rose Fulbright in Hong Kong, a global legal firm that assisted in some of the region’s biggest transactions last year. “HKEx ranked number one in terms of funds raised last year worldwide, ahead of some major exchanges like London and New York. The Hong Kong exchange is the clear leader of the two. In fact, last year HKEx saw the most activity of any exchange not just in the Asia Pacific but the world, with 38 new companies listing and an enormous HKD 260bn of funds raised.”</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for the popularity of HKEx. To begin with there is the investor base. Norton Rose Fulbright’s Ng says that the exchange’s strong base of institutional investors are a big part of the attraction for Chinese companies. “Traditionally it has been the PRC businesses driving IPO activity in Hong Kong,” she says. “The other exchanges in the PRC tend to be dominated by retail investors. That’s why companies looking for a strong shareholder base often come here to access international institutional investors such as the pension fund and private equity fund investors.”</p>
<p>The legal system is another perceived advantage. Previously a British colony, Hong Kong has a commonwealth legal system in which the rule of (Anglo-Saxon) law prevails and an established regulatory regime that, though not a full democracy, operates in a multi-party environment, meaning that companies listed on the island’s stock exchange are always closely scrutinised.</p>
<p>Such scrutiny offers much comfort to investors, Ng says: “Also in its favour is the fact that HKEx regularly reviews its rules and policies to ensure that they reflect international best practice,” she notes. “The stock exchange has run for many years too. It offers a transparent and well-regulated market for companies of all types and background, and it’s well respected for corporate governance standards and the quality of the companies that list here.”</p>
<p>One final explanation for the salience of HKEx is the China-link. For near three decades Hong Kong has been the most popular destination for share listings from Chinese state-owned and private enterprises, and the exchange has for that reason grown rapidly with the Chinese economy averaging double-digit growth during the same period.</p>
<p>That Hong Kong is a sovereign territory of China has evidently been a factor in the favour HKEx receives from Chinese companies. As EY’s Loh explains: “With everything else remaining equal the home exchange is usually the most favoured destination,” he says. “That’s because the market already recognises and understands the company, meaning its financial executives do not need to spend a lot of time and money convincing investors of the business proposition.”</p>
<p>The Singaporean market, meanwhile, is much smaller than that of Hong Kong. According to the latest figures, Singapore’s total market cap currently stands at $107.18bn, nearly nine times smaller than HKEx’s total market cap of $4.105trn according to Bloomberg data.</p>
<p>But the Singaporean exchange (SGX) does have advantages for certain companies, and is particularly attractive to companies in the APAC region that don’t have bourses in their own countries. With more than 40% of its listed companies hailing from outside the island, the SGX sells itself to investors and issuers as an ‘ASEAN gateway’ bourse.</p>
<p>“The domestic market is small in Singapore, so it has to be augmented by overseas companies wanting to list there,” says Loh. “It’s seen more as a pan-regional exchange – their value proposition has always been on the flow of financial capital for South East Asia, and it continues to attract overseas companies from around the region to list on it.”</p>
<h3 id="ipo-and-beyond">IPO and beyond</h3>
<p>While external conditions are often critical factors in companies’ decisions around when and where to go for that first stock listing, internal issues can also have a strong influence on what is decided. In many of these the corporate treasurer has a very important role to play.</p>
<p>First and foremost the company must be suitable for listing on the exchange of its choice. Suitability for listing is determined by a range of different factors, including legal compliance, commercial conflict and reliance issues. Not only must the business ensure it is in line with every local law and regulation governing its business. It must also be sure to avoid falling foul of conflicts of interest (parties involved in the IPO holding a stake in the company for instance) or over reliance on one or two customers or suppliers. Neglecting to do so might turn off investors or invite fines from regulators.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Ng adds that treasurers and other financial executives will also need to be cognisant of how any acquisitions in the run up to an IPO might influence the outcome. “For any company that is preparing a listing in Hong Kong we would look at its trading record for the last three years before it applied for a listing,” she says. “Since any material acquisition, or significant corporate or business changes might have an impact when the regulator considers an application, companies planning an IPO need to be very careful of how they structure such transactions.” The work around an IPO does not end once all the above internal issues have been considered, underwriters and sponsors appointed, roadshows conducted and the launch successfully executed. On the contrary, for the treasurer little will remain the same going forward.</p>
<p>“An IPO is a momentous exercise,” Loh says, “one that I always compare to getting married.” What he means by that, he adds, is that when two people get married, it is indeed a significant milestone but the work does not stop there. “There are a lot of things that the treasurer will need to get in order – processes, systems, controls and governance – that perhaps people do not pay as much attention to at a private company.”</p>
<p>And given that investors are, at the end of the day, looking for returns, the spotlight tends to fall upon the treasury department like never before. Companies need to be able to show a solid set of books on an ongoing basis and cash and risk management, therefore, become increasingly important. “This is where the treasury department has a really important role to play,” says Loh. “How the treasury manages areas such as liquidity risk, FX risk, and credit pricing risk can give a lot of comfort to investors. Above all they want to know that the company they are investing in has a strong treasury function and is able to sustain itself going forward.”</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Over recent years we have seen numerous examples of multinational companies making changes to their accounting methods for pension plans and other post-retirement benefits. But that is just one of the many new remedies to which treasurers are turning for relief from their pension headaches these days. In this article, we consider the challenges facing company pension plans, and the skills, knowledge and experience treasurers have to offer in overcoming these challenges.</em></p>
<p>Back in the first week of January, Ford Motor Co. announced that it would be changing how it accounts for the performance of its pension plans, a move that the company expects to provide a $1.5bn boost to its pre-tax profits for 2016.</p>
<p>By changing to mark-to-market (MTM) accounting, the second biggest automaker in the US will be following in the footsteps of a host of other US corporates including AT&amp;T, UPS, Verizon Communications, FedEx, and Honeywell, whose treasury team won an Adam Smith Award after the company became the first to make the move in late 2010. Ending the longstanding practice of ‘smoothing’ large deferred gains and losses generated by changes in interest rates and actual returns on assets over several years has allowed these firms to provide a clearer picture of the underlying performance of their business operations.</p>
<p>The new model will mean that changes in the funded status of defined benefit (DB) pension plans, which promise to pay a specified amount to retirees, are now recognised annually as and when they occur. Companies like Honeywell say that this provides for greater transparency in earnings reporting. “I think a lot of these companies came to the conclusion, like we did, that the amortisation of prior actuarial gains and losses limits a clear picture of your businesses’ underlying operating results,” says John Tus, Vice President &amp; Treasurer of Honeywell International. “Accordingly, we began to recognise the impact of the changes in interest rates and actual returns on plan assets annually.”</p>
<h3 id="the-treasurers-business">The treasurer’s business</h3>
<p>The accounting issue and its impact on profits highlights the implications pension planning can have on overall financial performance, and consequently the work of the corporate treasurer. Historically low bond yields and rising life expectancy in most advanced economies has left global companies burdened with ever larger pension obligations to service. According to recent research by S&amp;P Capital IQ, a vast majority (82%) of global pension plans are now significantly underfunded, while in the US fully-funded plans have all but vanished, with just 38% of the S&amp;P 500 firms able to boast plans funded at 90% or above.</p>
<p>Such deficits are part of the capital structure of the firm and, as such, are taken into consideration by lenders, creditors and investors. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, treasurers do not usually have direct responsibility for pension investments (although some may sit on a pension investment committee). Treasurers do have responsibility, however, for understanding how a pension plan fits strategically and how its management impacts the company. Pensions are very much the treasurer’s business, then, and mounting pension obligations seen post-crisis are proving to be a big headache.</p>
<p>“It can have implications from a credit perspective because, generally, the ratings agencies – with the exception of Fitch – consider underfunded pension obligations as debt,” explains Tus. “And so if a company has a very large, underfunded pension plan that could have implications not only on future cash demands but, secondly, credit capacity. If you have an underfunded obligation, it will limit your credit capacity at your targeted credit rating.”</p></div>

<blockquote>I think a lot of these companies came to the conclusion, like we did, that the amortisation of prior actuarial gains and losses limits a clear picture of your businesses’ underlying operating results.

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Because defined benefit pension plans have an economic impact on the company sponsoring them, Tus believes it is critical that each company understand their plan’s design, investment strategy, and the impact that changes in investment returns and interest rates could have on both the funded status of the plan as well as net periodic pension expense. For companies, a weak macroeconomic environment will not only impact the company’s financial performance but also negatively impact the performance of its pension plan.</p>
<p>As well as acting as a check on borrowing capacity, the distortions pension plan performance can have on a company’s reported financial results and how these are perceived by the market may also have a bearing on the pricing of coupons in debt offerings and, of course, the stock price. It is absolutely critical therefore that corporate treasurers, as Tus says, develop an “adequate understanding of the plan’s investment strategy and the potential volatility that could occur as a result of changes in interest rates, and factor in the implications of that with regard to credit metrics and credit capacity”.</p>
<h3 id="adding-value">Adding value</h3>
<p>Other experts in the pensions business agree with Tus on the treasury significance of pension planning. Treasurers, after all, are in the business of managing financial risk – and with many DB schemes having become very significant in terms of size (some, indeed, larger in terms of assets than the companies they are tied to), a spiralling pension obligation is often a risk that the treasurer can ill afford to ignore.</p>
<p>“Defined benefit pensions clearly pose a risk to the business and, quite often, a substantial risk,” says Richard Smith, Consulting Actuary, at Spence &amp; Partners, a company that specialises in advising on and managing DB and final salary pension schemes. “Frequently pension schemes are quite large relative to the business and, given that the treasurer is responsible for managing risks across the company, the treasurer needs visibility of that.”</p>
<p>But short of becoming a trustee and assuming direct responsibility for the plans’ investments, can they do anything meaningful about it? There are numerous other areas connected to pension planning where treasurers might become involved – directly or indirectly – in supporting the company’s schemes. They might, for instance, be required to raise finance from the debt capital markets to cover shortfalls, as Honeywell and indeed a number of international companies did in the wake of the last crisis.</p>
<p>Given the nature of their skillsets, treasurers might also be the ideal people to serve as a form of counsel for the trustees. In the UK, regulatory developments might make this role ever more critical. In its most recent guidance, the Pensions Regulator emphasises the importance of integrated risk management: that is, that trustees should identify and manage the factors that affect the prospects of a plan, especially those factors that affect risks in more than one area. “To me that’s what treasury is all about,” says Smith. “Trustees will have to balance the funding of the scheme with a close eye on the covenant of the employer: how strong the company is and how it would deal with any risks if investments go south. Since treasurers will be familiar with addressing risks in an integrated and a holistic way, they will have the skills that could be utilised effectively in a pension scheme environment.”</p>
<p>Raj Mody, Partner and Head of UK Pensions Consulting at PwC, says that regardless of where it sits in relation to the governance of a scheme, the treasury department has expertise companies ought to utilise one way or another. With the obligations of DB schemes running on over several decades, a means must be found to ensure the asset portfolio continues to meet those long-term cash flow demands. This is something treasurers might be able to help with. “Treasurers should have a good understanding of this challenge, and that is why I am quite excited and energised about the value they can bring,” says Mody. “If you look at the problem properly it is more than just about a deficit calculation at a moment in time, it is about those cash flows. And treasurers can then apply their skills to dealing with that.”</p>
<h3 id="the-long-view">The long view</h3>
<p>Although investment horizons of a typical DB pension scheme tend to be much longer than cash managers will be accustomed to, many treasurers may still have some experience in handling longer-term obligations, such as property or equipment leases. It is this sort of expertise that an amenable pension trustee might wish to draw upon as new asset buying and hedging strategies are explored. And should the current low yield environment persist, new investment strategies are likely to be explored by plans on an increasingly frequent basis as those searching for yield may begin to look beyond the purchase of traditional securities to instruments of a somewhat more esoteric nature.</p>

<p class="source"><em>Source: S&amp;P capital IQ compustat pension data</em></p>
<p>According to global pensions advisory Towers Watson, about $7bn of its clients’ money is now invested in so-called illiquid credit, such as real estate loans, mortgages, infrastructure debt and non-performing loans (NPLs). The money allocated to such assets just five years ago was close to zero. “Clearly the universe is a lot larger now,” he says. At a basic level, funds need assets that can deliver cash flows that meet their liabilities and there is a much wider range of assets today that can help them do that. “Everything from long-term cash flow bond type assets, through to infrastructure to diversified growth funds might be considered,” Mody says. “There is a lot of variety out there.”</p>
<p>More can also be done in terms of risk management, and there are even new derivative products that can be used for hedging non-financial risks to a pension plan, such as longevity. Although still not a commonplace practice, there are easily accessible structures that allow pension schemes to cost effectively transact with reinsurers for the purpose of hedging their exposure to increasing life expectancy. In companies exploring the use of such products, who better to evaluate their efficacy than the corporate specialists in risk management, the treasury? “That is a new development,” Mody says. “There is a structure called Iccaria that effectively allows pension schemes to do that. It was a very complex and opaque process before, but now it can be really transparent.”</p>
<h3 id="a-clean-slate">A clean slate</h3>
<p>All of this demonstrates that while underfunded pension plans are certainly proving to be a big financial headache for many corporate treasurers at the present time, the problem is not an incurable one. On the contrary, there are a whole range of options – some tried and tested and some more novel and experimental – that can be taken to mitigate pension risk.</p>
<p>To begin with, the examples of Honeywell, and more recently Ford, show us that legacy losses need not be a factor weighing on future results; there is a way by which companies who suffered heavily during the post-crisis years can start again with a clean slate. However, the two examples also show us that switching to MTM accounting is not a panacea, rather only a small part of a much broader strategy.</p>
<p>Indeed, prior to switching to MTM accounting both Honeywell and Ford took numerous other steps to address pension funding shortfalls. In the case of the latter, these include the making of close to $11bn worth of contributions since 2012 to help finance its plans, and the paying out lump sums to retirees who give up their pensions that have, to date, totalled $46bn. The measures certainly seem to have done the trick: between 2013 and 2015 Ford’s global pension plans went from being $19bn underfunded to $9.8bn underfunded. Although more recent data is not yet available, given the current trajectory the shortfall may be even smaller now. It was the success of these measures that allowed Ford to press on with the switch to MTM accounting. “Because we’re nearly finished with that strategy...we’re at that point where we can make this change,” Ford CFO Bob Shanks said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>But whether a company ultimately opts to do something similar or take a different approach, treasurers should be involved in the conversation. This is appropriate not only because of the impact pensions evidently have on overall performance, but also because of the role treasurers have in debt issuances needed to plug deficits; the expertise they can bring with respect to risk management; and the counsel some will be able to offer trustees on asset strategies. Pensions are an almost inevitable headache for most corporates and their treasury departments in today’s economic environment, but the expertise and capabilities treasurers can bring to the table may be an important part of the cure.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body">
<p>The point of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) is often to ensure growth and stability; in the current economic climate both are attributes that sit well with boardrooms and investors alike. Perhaps this is why the level of M&amp;A activity has increased significantly in the past couple of years as corporates that have stockpiled cash in a low interest world seek to bring on board new customers, products and R&amp;D effort through acquisition.</p>
<p>The growth of M&amp;A itself is confirmed by Dealogic’s ‘M&amp;A Review Full Year 2014’. It reports that global M&amp;A volume reached $3.60trn in 2014, up 26% year-on-year (from $2.85trn). This was the third highest volume ever recorded, behind 2007’s $4.62trn and 2006’s $3.91trn. The figures for Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) show a market very much alive to the opportunities of acquisition. Although Japan’s M&amp;A volume of $74.3bn was the lowest since 2002, the region’s overall figure realised a targeted M&amp;A volume of $656.8bn; the highest total on record. China dominated with $307.4bn of deals, its appetite for acquisition not letting up on overseas deal-making activity (including many in Europe). According to data from research firm, Mergermarket, China registered a 21.3% increase in the value of its total M&amp;A activity during 2014.</p>
<p>However, increased activity means more failed deals too. The FT Press book ‘The M&amp;A Paradox: Factors of Success and Failure in Mergers and Acquisitions’, states that “many research studies conducted over the decades clearly show that the rate of failures is at least 50%.” In April 2015, China Daily News (CDN) reported “a slew of troubled overseas deals” for the country; this exposes the increasing risks and potential losses faced as M&amp;A activity increases.</p>
<p>One of the causes of the breakdown of outward bound deals is the failure of companies to fully understand the cultural, legal and political environment of their foreign target businesses. Of the 120 failed outbound Chinese deals between 2005 and 2014, CDN claimed that about a quarter were due to political reasons. The China Centre for International Economic Exchanges cites a “lack of talent familiar with international practices” as being a “major shortcoming” for Chinese companies in overseas markets. This signals the need for qualified input from a range of functions.</p>
<h3 id="a-legal-perspective">A legal perspective</h3>
<p>The complexity of international commercial law is such that it requires expertise not just to get the best deal but also to avoid making potentially costly mistakes. A frequent error of judgement is to try to iron out contractual details of a merger before legal counsel has had a chance to advise on suitability. “Not involving counsel early enough can mean issues are not raised in good time which can lead to later difficulties,” warns Emma de Ronde, Partner and corporate lawyer for Norton Rose Fulbright Hong Kong. Businesses are understandably reluctant to incur legal fees before they know they have got a commercially viable deal in place but agreeing to any commercial or legal terms without recourse to legal advice could ultimately prove more costly. It is often the case that once a client has sent a set of pre-agreed terms to its lawyers, it then falls to the lawyers to point out the consequences of going ahead under such terms and even try to extricate the client from unfavourable terms.</p>
<p>Even with this in mind, some companies may still be comfortable tackling the preparation of key high-level commercial terms themselves, only bringing in legal counsel when they want to document what has been agreed commercially. For others, there may be a need to consult at an earlier stage, particularly if there are complex structuring, legal, regulatory or taxation issues, or if there is a cross-border element with which to contend.</p>
<p>Of course, each deal will have its own legal peculiarities but there will be some commonalities too, notably when structuring a deal from a due diligence perspective. There will be an initial investigation of the scope of the business being bought or sold, looking at areas such as ownership, how the sale will take place and the regulatory requirements that must be met to enable the sale to go ahead. The target business will be subject to commercial and legal due diligence, typically including considerations such as its financials, business model, existing legal contracts (with key suppliers and customers, for example), employee and pension issues, intellectual property rights and, increasingly, any anti-bribery and corruption issues. The latter, notes de Ronde, is a big issue in Asia right now, especially in China. Once these point have been satisfied, the preparation of documents may commence.</p>
<p>In addition to the sale and purchase agreement, other documentation may include the acquisition financing agreement with banking partners, and perhaps a transitional service agreement where the seller provides services to the buyer, post-sale, for an agreed period. The final stage for counsel would be signing and completion. “Often there will be a gap between agreeing terms and completion where there may be a series of further external conditions that must be satisfied,” notes de Ronde. “These may be regulatory; for example, we might need to make Merger Control filings if there are competition or anti-trust issues, or there may be conditions specifically related to the business that need to be resolved; a financial services business, for example, may require prudential regulatory approval for the sale to go ahead.” Satisfaction of all conditions should lead to completion of the transaction at which stage counsel can advise on the mechanics of the transfer, guiding the new owner through a number of responsibilities it now has around filings, registrations, how it implements its own governance structure within the new business and so on.</p>
<p>Most developed jurisdictions with stock exchanges will have separate rules that apply to the acquisition of a listed company, notes de Ronde. The Hong Kong Takeovers Code, for example, is regulated by the local Securities and Futures Commission which governs the terms under which a buyer can acquire a listed company. It covers aspects such as the timing of the transaction, what has to be documented and what can and can’t be said to shareholders pre-sale. In addition to Takeover Code rules there are also controls on insider dealing and market abuse issues that must be adhered to.</p>
<p>The process is far from straightforward though, the diversity of legal systems found in Asia often presenting issues for cross-border mergers. “On private deals, where parties are in different jurisdictions, each side will typically want to use the law of its own jurisdiction as governing law,” notes de Ronde. Some jurisdictions might dictate the applicable governing law for transfer of a particular asset, so it is essential to be aware of local rules.</p>
<p>However, it is when a deal takes a turn for the worse that the real “hot debate” starts. It can be a major challenge to agree which jurisdiction will hear a claim; although arbitration is increasingly used in preference to the court system, even this raises the question of where arbitration will be heard and under which arbitration rules. It is strongly recommended that guidance on dispute resolution is tackled and finalised in the initial contract phase.</p>
<p>On the regulatory side, Charlotte Robins, Partner and financial services regulatory lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright Hong Kong, notes that whilst buyers and sellers are much more aware of their regulatory obligations around M&amp;A than they were a few years ago, some still do not think about them “fully enough and early enough.” Where companies need to secure change of ownership approval from the regulator, for example, they should understand that this can take time. And where outsourcing is deployed, either at the transitional services stage or as part of the subsequent integration, it will inevitably invoke rules around the transfer of data – another hot topic in Asia.</p>
<p>Tackling the breadth and depth of regulation means that M&amp;A teams will have more people and agencies to deal with. But, says Robins, it is as much about getting the timing right as it is knowing the regulators and the best approach to take with them. Whilst she acknowledges that it may sometimes be more appropriate that the business, not the lawyers, deal the authorities, she believes that knowledge on the ground “can be key in getting the necessary approvals in the time that you need them.” Ultimately, Robins feels that the diversity of legal and regulatory environments across Asia does not necessarily make M&amp;A more difficult, “it’s just different.” Having the right legal counsel onside is clearly an advantage.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-the-banks-help">How can the banks help?</h3>
<p>In terms of preparation for a deal on the finance side, there are many different dynamics to consider, explains Alexandre Huet, Global Head of Strategic and Acquisition Finance, Société Générale. As a banker, he naturally considers it more provident for buyers to prepare well in advance wherever possible, allowing time to consult a number of internal and external advisors – including banks – who can help draw out the most appropriate deal structure. However, he acknowledges that sometimes a deal runs short of time and although this can often make the process “very challenging,” a sense of urgency can help “crystallise” the terms of engagement. From a tactical point of view, he comments that a short time frame is thus “not necessarily a bad way” to approach M&amp;A.</p>
<p>That said, although each deal must be tackled on a case-by-case approach, Huet believes that seeking bank advice ahead of a deal, besides early engagement with the preparation work, allows their involvement much earlier in the process on the financing side. This is of particular benefit in the case of a hostile takeover or where there are competing bids as funds “must be accessible at the point of need.” Where a listed company is the acquisition target, he notes that the process will almost certainly benefit from advanced planning to head off the kind of regulatory demands seen in the UK, for example, where a buyer’s proof of funds is essential for approval to be granted (it becomes a case of ‘put up or shut up’ in order to protect the target from destabilising exploratory approaches). On the buyer side, such a need illustrates the importance of drawing together as much information as possible pre-deal, says Huet. Treasurers obviously have a key role to play here, (whether the target is listed or not) but banks can also play a vital part in the practical management of an M&amp;A deal, as financier or advisor (or both).</p>
<p>When bank finance is required it may come in many forms but a common way to fund a merger is to use a bridge loan, says Huet. This allows an interim phase that supports the bid and any regulatory requirements to prove funding. If the merger is successful, this facility can either be entirely refinanced on the bond or equity markets or subsequently partially syndicated and turned into term loans. The large corporate and investment banks that typically seek out positions as the book-runners or lead arrangers for a financed merger will steer the funding process, managing refinancing following a bridging loan or securing the participation of other banks where the loan is syndicated.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for Huet, if the terms are agreeable and the market supports those terms, and if the shareholders find the deal attractive, the industrial rationale is there and there is chemistry between the management team, then the deal has a good chance of success. But he accepts that there are many ‘ifs’ here and suggests that failure on any one of these points can reduce even the best laid plans to rubble.</p>
<h3 id="the-treasurers-role">The treasurer’s role</h3>
<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that some treasurers are not involved in deals as early or as deeply as they would like or feel necessary. Just knowing the geography of a deal, for example, means being able to better manage bank relationships. Firms such as AstraZeneca, the Anglo Swedish pharma giant, know the importance of treasury involvement. It has a targeted M&amp;A strategy to build upon its scientific work, said Ian Brimicombe, Group Head of Tax &amp; Treasury, AstraZeneca, speaking at last year’s annual ACT event in Glasgow. Part of that approach demands that its treasury personnel are ready to position the function for each proposal that comes along. These ideas tend to happen very quickly because it is an extremely competitive market, he explained. “If the treasury team isn’t ready to stand together with the management executing and implementing these acquisitions then we will lose out.”</p>
<p>Brimicombe believes that treasury must adopt a collaborative stance, not only with the management teams of the business development and corporate strategy groups that formulate the ideas on what they want to buy and how they wish to implement the acquisition, but also with specialist colleagues in areas such as tax, insurance and group reporting. “It all has to be linked together in order to create a coherent finance perspective on the deals.”</p>
<p>Finding the right seller or buyer and putting the finances in place involves much work but the failure rate of deals must be borne in mind. Tom Greene, Group Treasurer at another pharmaceuticals firm, Shire, knows this only too well. He pointed out at the same ACT event that as a pharma company, Shire uses the acquisition of early stage products as a key source of product development. At any given time it may have up to 20 opportunities on the table, covering companies of various sizes and stages of development, without knowing which will come to fruition. “Acquisitions can be a bit like busses; there’s nothing and then several come along at once.”</p>
<p>For treasurers, not knowing about deals in advance is a disadvantage; forewarned means forearmed and being able to position finances in good time can facilitate a successful deal. “I’d rather be in the loop than outside it,” said fellow panellist, Alan Dick, Director of Tax &amp; Treasury for international engineering firm, AMEC. However, Dick also believes treasurers should seize the initiative. “It requires proactivity; you can’t sit and wait to be invited to take part.”</p>
<p>Until a deal has been completed, understandably, the level of data imparted by the company being acquired may be limited; this could frustrate the acquiring treasurer’s good intentions to move forward. It may be possible to include a contractual element of disclosure post-signing but prior to completion that provides for the needs of treasury. To this end, John Grout, Policy &amp; Technical Director of the UK ACT suggests that it should be part of the training for a company’s M&amp;A negotiators to understand treasury needs and to try to incorporate these at the earliest stage. He also suggests that whilst normal due diligence processes may to an extent be paper-based, a face-to-face meeting of respective treasurers (and between counterparts from other functions) can reveal so much more, potentially heading off any unpleasant surprises.</p>
<h3 id="communication-is-the-key">Communication is the key</h3>
<p>Ensuring the timely communication of all relevant information to all the parties involved in the deal is essential. Achieving a satisfactory result may be more difficult for a business that has either not engaged in an M&amp;A deal before or does so infrequently. This raises the importance of finding reliable advisors to supplement internal resources. Internally, treasury has come to play a crucial role as the intermediary between external bank partners and the other business units involved, acting not just as the risk advisor and efficient expeditor of funding but also as the informed challenger for any advice that is forthcoming from those external partners. Working as a team is essential throughout the M&amp;A process; it is not a stretch of the imagination to suggest that a merger without the input of treasury could be a risk too far.</p></div>

<h5 id="max-loh">Max Loh, ASEAN and Singapore Managing Partner, EY:</h5>
<p>The success of the Alibaba IPO is largely due to the potential that the company has and investors’ appreciation of this. It was therefore a very considered choice for Alibaba to list in the US, as this market is home to many sophisticated investors who understand the complex business model of Alibaba.</p>
<p>Asian companies tend to list in either their home markets or two of the region’s more established exchanges, namely Hong Kong and Singapore. Asian companies tend to do that as investors in the home or regional markets will be familiar with the company, its offerings and brand, and this helps in achieving better valuations. This is especially true for companies in the retail, consumer products and services sectors. The US, on the other hand, is seen by many as a preferred destination for e-commerce and technology companies, given greater investor knowledge and appreciation.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>There are many other factors which influence the decision of where a company can or should list, as each exchange and domain market has its own differing set of criteria, regulations, adopted accounting standards and laws. It was widely reported that another key reason for Alibaba’s listing in the US was the dual share structure the market offered. Otherwise, the differences are quite subtle and companies will often be flexible enough to accommodate and comply with the rules of the exchange of its choice.</p>
<p>Across Asia Pacific, countries are looking to build up their exchanges. Locations like Hong Kong and Singapore currently have the advantage of being international financial centres, with lots of depth and liquidity. They are also popular with foreign companies that view North Asia and South East Asia respectively as their key markets. Other exchanges in the region are more focused on attracting domestic companies.</p>

<h5 id="matt-emsley">Matt Emsley, Partner, Corporate, Herbert Smith Freehills:</h5>
<p>Alibaba hit the headlines following its recent IPO, not just because of its large size, but because it decided to list in the US and not Hong Kong. Traditionally, Chinese companies see Hong Kong as the gateway to global capital markets and look to the Hong Kong market when launching an IPO. However, Alibaba went against this trend and highlighted reasons why some corporates from China may look to the US and not Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The primary reason for Alibaba’s listing in the US rather than Hong Kong was because of the management and voting structure that Alibaba adopted. The current regulations in Hong Kong apply a one share, one vote policy. However, Alibaba wanted a structure that gave greater voting power to the key management, one that is permitted in the US market. Indeed, similar structures have been adopted by a number of Chinese companies seeking listing in the US, and in particular internet companies, in recent times.</p>
<p>The public debate in respect of the one share, one vote policy as a result of Alibaba’s decision to list in the US has seen the Hong Kong Stock Exchange issue a conceptual consultation with the market, seeking views regarding the one share, one vote concept. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has also, in recent years, clarified its approach to the listing of companies adopting variable interest (VIE) structures where the companies are in restricted industries. Such a structure allows the channelling of the economic benefits from the business to the listed group by way of contractual arrangements with a third party who actually owns the business and assets, for businesses where foreign ownership of the business is restricted under Chinese law. As a result, there have been a number of Hong Kong listings of Chinese internet businesses in recent years, where previously they may have sought a listing in the US.</p>
<p>One of the key requirements for a listing on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is compliance with one of the three alternative financial tests. These require the applicant to meet specified thresholds for profit, revenue and market capitalisation or revenue, cash flow and market capitalisation. Companies are also generally required to have management and ownership continuity for the most recent three financial years and one year, respectively.</p></div>

<blockquote>Once the IPO is complete, treasury will finally be required to manage the FX risk and regulations when repatriating its proceeds. In order to carry out these roles efficiently, treasury should be introduced to the process as soon as possible.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Other items to be aware of during the listing process in Hong Kong are the Hong Kong regulators’ expectations of sponsors and the level of due-diligence they conduct, that have become stricter since regulatory changes implemented in the last year. A further regulatory change was the adoption of a requirement that, with effect from April 2014, the application proof of the prospectus filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange be made publicly available on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website upon filing. There were concerns that this may make the Hong Kong Stock Exchange more unattractive to some companies, though the market has quickly adapted to this requirement.</p>
<p>Outside of Hong Kong, Singapore has been a popular IPO destination over the last 12 months and has seen some large listings. The market receives a lot of interest from South East Asia based companies, while Chinese companies have tended to generally look to Hong Kong. This is primarily due to market valuation and familiarity of investors there with Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The treasury can have a key role to play during an IPO, especially around restructuring the organisation. For example, Chinese companies listing in Hong Kong will often reorganise their shareholding structure in advance of seeking a listing so that they are held by an offshore entity subject to compliance with PRC regulatory requirements. As part of this reorganisation, financing will often be required to fund the reorganisation that the treasury will manage, with such funding often provided through pre-IPO investments. Also, in Hong Kong the organisation is required to be financially independent of its controlling shareholders. To achieve this the treasury may need to restructure any loans from shareholders and bank loans where shareholders have provided guarantees in preparation for listing. The negotiations with the banks typically either remove shareholder guarantees completely or otherwise replace the shareholder guarantees upon listing with a guarantee from the listing vehicle. Once the IPO is complete, treasury will finally be required to manage the FX risk and regulations when repatriating its proceeds. In order to carry out these roles efficiently, treasury should be introduced to the process as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>For corporates looking to issue debt on the capital markets, an investment-grade credit rating is not entirely essential. But with many institutional investors prohibited from investing in all but the safest credits, having those three A’s next to your company’s name sure does help.</p>
<p>If you want to make absolutely sure that your company receives the rating it deserves, it helps to have an understanding of how the likes of Moody’s, S&amp;P, and Fitch work when scoring the creditworthiness of corporate issuers. Most treasury teams will be familiar with the corporate credit ratings grids (<a href="#chart-1">see Chart 1</a>) used by the ‘Big Three’ ratings agencies, yet their knowledge of the methodologies behind a rating, and the factors that can trigger a change can often be patchy.</p>
<p>Do you, for example, fully understand how M&amp;A activity is treated by the ratings agencies? If a corporate announces an opportunistic acquisition, against a previously declared strategy of organic growth, how will that impact the credit rating? With Fitch’s methodology, this kind of event would be excluded from the prior rating, and would “typically generate a rating review based on materiality and impact, depending on the funding mix and cost,” according to the agency.</p>
<p>One of the problems with such ambiguities is that they do not tend to breed trust or confidence, two things the agencies have been desperately trying rebuild in recent years.</p>
<p>As we all know, the Big Three agencies came in for robust criticism in the wake of the financial crisis for their ratings of collateralised debt obligations (CDO) – part of a family of instruments Warren Buffett once described as “financial weapons of mass destruction” that were, according to one academic, responsible for $542 billion in write-downs at financial institutions between 2007 and early 2009.</p>
<p>And while many companies continue to attach significant weight to the agencies’ judgement post-crisis, others are reluctant to trust them fully. “The ratings agencies are starting to build up credibility again and they have made great strides, but some corporates still look at them with hesitancy,” says John Coon, Global Treasury Manager at Dow Corning Corporation. “With counterparty risk analysis, for example, most corporates used to give the agencies free rein to get on with their job, and would rely almost entirely on their outlooks and ratings for that. But now, at least for our own counterparty risk analysis, our reliance on the ratings agencies has gone down. They still play an important role, but we combine their information with a greater proportion of research we have conducted ourselves.”</p>
<p>He is not alone in highlighting this pre-crisis over-reliance of corporates on credit ratings. In June 2014 the International Organisation of Securities Commissions IOSCO said “the role of credit rating agencies has come under regulatory scrutiny, mainly as a result of the over-reliance of market participants, including investment managers and institutional investors, on CRA ratings in their assessments of both financial instruments and issuers in the run-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis.” Were the agencies entirely to blame for the corporates that found themselves in hot water during the crisis?</p>
<p>Here it is important to distinguish between corporate credit ratings activity – which has largely performed well for the ratings agencies before, during, and after the crisis – and the mortgage-linked ratings which drew such high-profile censure after the fall of Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ratings agencies are quick to point out that there is a distinct segregation between their mortgage-related securities businesses and that of corporate credit ratings. “A fact that is sometimes lost is that the crisis was largely limited to one asset class – US subprime mortgages, which is a very small piece of our business,” says Mike Dunning, European Head of Corporates at Fitch Ratings. “Corporate ratings have held up very well since the financial crisis, as evidenced by the default and transition data and reports that we regularly publish.”</p>
<p>And while non-financial corporate credit ratings businesses were not implicated in the turmoil in 2007-2009, the agencies have nevertheless taken steps to refine and enhance transparency on this side of their activity post-crisis.</p>
<p>“Since the financial crisis we have taken a number of steps to improve the overall performance of the business. Our criteria function operates independently of our ratings practice, and analysts now rotate so they don’t spend an indefinite amount of time on a single account,” says Peter Kernan, Managing Director, Criteria Officer, Corporate Ratings EMEA at S&amp;P. “We are now regulated, too.”</p>
<p>Regulation is one area in the credit ratings industry that has altered post-crisis, with legislators in Europe and the US putting measures in place aimed at governing the integrity and transparency of the rating process and sustaining confidence in the quality of ratings being produced.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US put a first round of regulation for ratings agencies into effect in 2007; this was supplemented by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and in August 2014 the SEC adopted further requirements for credit ratings agencies. In Europe, agencies are regulated by European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) legislation that came into force in 2010.</p>

<h3 id="adding-value">Adding value</h3>
<p>Beyond the reputational aspect of the ratings agencies, another question a treasurer might ask when it comes to the ratings agencies is, given a large part of their research is based on published historical financial information, where and how exactly do they add value in the ratings process?</p>
<p>“As a cash manager, I don’t really care what happened yesterday when I’m looking at credit ratings, I want to know what’s likely to happen tomorrow or next month,” says Dow Corning’s Coon. “Analysing a company’s financials definitely holds a lot of weight in predicting future performance, but you need to add further analysis and judgement to get something that’s forward-looking.”</p>
<p>“Historical information is always helpful, but it is only ever a starting point in our analysis,” says William Coley, EMEA Corporate Finance Group Credit Officer at Moody’s. “If all ratings were made just on the basis of historical information, you could rate everything by computer. Our analysts provide the additional and important dimension of forward-looking analysis so our ratings have a degree of stability and predictive quality.” He adds that Moody’s recently introduced a forward-looking grid score to its corporate Credit Opinions that demonstrates how it expects different elements of a company’s credit profile to evolve over the next 12 to 18 months in an effort to provide further transparency over their rating rationale.</p>
<h3 id="issuer-understanding">Issuer understanding</h3>
<p>For corporates issuing debt, the treasury department is likely to have considerable interaction with the ratings agencies’ analysts. Here the Big Three have several pieces of advice for the treasurer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Watch the sensitivities.</h5>
<p>“The key area for treasurers to keep an eye on is the rating sensitivities. The treasurers who manage the credit relationship well are the ones who stay close to that process, who actively engage with the ratings agencies’ analysts to keep us informed, to understand themselves what, if anything, it is that’s causing us to be concerned,” advises Fitch’s Dunning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Engage in constant dialogue.</h5>
<p>“We are constantly engaged in dialogue with the companies and entities that use our corporate ratings,” says S&amp;P’s Kernan. “Our strategic goal is to ensure our criteria is very well understood by all parties who use it, and our new criteria make it much easier for corporate treasurers to foresee potential future ratings changes.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Be proactive.</h5>
<p>“In recent years we have seen that, rather than approaching us on a just-in-time basis, many treasurers from issuing companies now come to us early on in the process to use a range of our products, such as unpublished monitored loan ratings, to their advantage, and to establish a sound relationship with the analyst,” notes Coley of Moody’s. “Best practice is that ratings committee outcomes should never come as a complete surprise to the issuer.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mechanisation">Mechanisation</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the ratings agencies are taking steps to improve the transparency around their methodologies. But might these efforts not dilute the judgement element that goes into a rating, thereby diminishing their value to users? Some in the treasury community evidently see it that way.</p>
<p>For example, in 2013 S&amp;P issued a request for comment to gauge the market’s reaction to proposed changes to its revised corporate ratings criteria. The revisions impacted non-financial companies, and included changes to S&amp;P’s corporate methodology, ratios and adjustments, country risk, industry risk, group ratings methodology and ratings above the sovereign.</p>
<p>At the time, the ratings agency said the move was intended to improve the transparency and comparability of its ratings. Although the clarifications in the revised criteria were welcomed by some treasurers, others expressed their concern at what they perceived to be the over-formalisation of the new criteria; something they argued has reduced considerably the role of judgement in the corporate ratings process.</p>
<p>L’Association Française des Trésoriers d’Entreprise (AFTE), for instance, while describing the revisions as a “proactive approach to criteria evolution,” also went on to claim that the new methodology could lead to too mechanical an approach to credit ratings. “Rating must not become scoring,” said the AFTE in an open letter to S&amp;P.</p>
<p>According to S&amp;P’s Kernan, this is not the case at all. “We went to great lengths when designing our corporate criteria to make them transparent but also to continue to embed them within our analytical process judgement calls,” he says. “There are many areas where our analysts and credit committees are having to make judgement calls.”</p>
<p>For example, if a corporate has undergone what S&amp;P describes as a ‘major transformational event’ such as an M&amp;A or significant recapitalisation, S&amp;P’s analysts now have the ability to change the time series used in a rating, giving a reduced weight – or in some cases no weight – to historical information.</p>
<p>“Strategically we will continue to embed this judgement element within the ratings process. We believe we add value in this respect as we have deep, global insight into corporates and their industries, and the ability to make judgement calls in our financial forecasting is clearly very important,” he adds.</p>
<p>Fitch’s Dunning agrees that this judgement factor is key to the ratings agencies’ service. “You have to balance the issue of being visible and adding value to the process, but retaining this element of judgement within credit analysis is absolutely critical,” he explains. “This is something we defend very strongly; this judgement call needs to stay with us as it’s part of the value that we add as an independent third party with an objective opinion.”</p>
<h3 id="new-player">New player</h3>
<p>And for those who are unsatisfied with the Big Three’s corporate ratings, a new player has emerged to offer an alternative, at least in Europe.</p>
<p>Scope Ratings was established in 2011, with its corporate rating business starting up in 2012. It has since begun rating banks and structured finance products, too. Scope intends to offer a local knowledge advantage to Europeans over its US-based competitors of Fitch, Moody’s and S&amp;P.</p>
<p>“We rate smaller and midcap companies – but we will also rate larger corporates in the near future,” Britta Holt, Executive Director of Scope’s Corporate Ratings franchise, tells Treasury Today. “Scope used to be a family-owned business, which has provided us with a natural understanding of smaller and mid-sized companies. Our ratings business is a good option for investors looking for an alternative to the Big Three, who are all headquartered in the US.”</p>
<p>So far Berlin-based Scope has rated corporates in Germany, Austria, Spain, France and the UK. “We only rate European corporates. Our criteria are broadly in line with those of the larger players. We provide forward-orientated analysis, focusing on cash flow generation capability,” adds Holt. “We don’t focus on the sheer size of a company alone in our analysis, but also on its positioning in the market – we concentrate on this aspect much more than the larger ratings agencies.”</p>
<p>However, despite the emergence of Scope, as well as regional players like China’s Dagong Global, the hegemony of the Big Three appears hard to displace: in 2012 they accounted for around 95% of credit ratings worldwide.</p>
<h3 id="ratings-in-the-future">Ratings in the future</h3>
<p>It is interesting to note that despite the adjustments being made around methodologies in recent years, the fundamentals of corporate credit ratings remain, for the most part, familiar.</p>
<p>“Over the past five to seven years we have seen mass volatility in the financial markets, but our corporate ratings methodologies have not fundamentally changed, and they should not fundamentally change in future,” says Fitch’s Dunning. “Companies will be impacted by weaker markets, lower growth, or deflation, but the way we assess them should remain broadly the same.”</p>
<p>Moody’s Coley agrees that the basics of corporate ratings should not change radically. “Our corporate methodologies are not subject to step change, but rather an evolution as they are typically updated on a three- to four-year basis. The methodologies we have in place for traditional industries such as mining, shipping, manufacturing and retail have been developed over decades so our sector-specific views are not likely to change overnight,” he says.</p>
<p>“However, we do adapt to emerging trends – we now have a pay-TV methodology, for instance – and I’m sure we will create new methodologies when and if required to capture new industries that may emerge.” So, while fundamental revision of the ratings process is unlikely, ongoing subtle, incremental changes are a possibility.</p>
<p>That could mean, for example, interactive ratings tools that allow companies to experiment with variables and get an on-the-spot estimate of how these could impact their credit rating. “We are working on a navigation tool that can sit on a banker’s or treasurer’s desktop and allow them to adjust certain financial and operational parameters in an interactive manner to see how these affect the way we rate them,” adds Fitch’s Dunning. “Technological advancements like this should help further inform discussion between analysts and users, making the ratings process as visible as possible. This is to everybody’s advantage.”</p>
<p>Treasurers who use corporate credit ratings would also like to see technological advancements in the way ratings information is delivered. “While some of the ratings agencies’ client-facing products are very slick, from a cash management perspective we want to reduce the number of URLs and portals we have to use to access the information necessary to do our job,” says Dow Corning’s Coon. “The next step would be to systematically feed the ratings information I need into the TMS I already have in place. That is a question for the future.”</p></div>

<h5 id="yann-umbricht-pwc">Yann Umbricht, Partner and Treasury UK Leader, PwC:</h5>
<p>The treasury has a major role to play when a company decides to conduct any M&amp;A activity and this begins even before any transaction is announced. The treasury has a responsibility to understand the strategy of the organisation they operate within and be aware if M&amp;As are part of this. In doing this, treasury will be able to begin planning in advance of any M&amp;A activity allowing it to be in the best position as and when the company decide to make a transaction.</p>
<p>Areas which the treasury can begin to plan for include: being ready to raise funds when the need arises, ensuring that the appropriate documentation is in place ahead of time and also understanding the legal, tax and regulatory issues in countries which the organisation is looking to expand, which will allow them to highlight and address any issues up front. In being prepared and having this information in place a treasury can add value through advising on the costing of an M&amp;A, by providing information on anything which can affect the price of the transaction.</p>
<p>In addition, the value which the treasury can add when conducting an M&amp;A means that it is vitally important that it is involved from day one of the process. This is because the treasury is able to identify important financial risks, such as foreign currency volatility, earlier than other areas of the organisation; they will then be able to manage these to ensure that the risk is mitigated. In fact, we have seen examples of where the treasury’s involvement in an M&amp;A has prevented the transaction from collapsing, due to their ability to highlight these risks.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that no M&amp;A is the same and the role of the treasury will vary depending on the type of transaction, the size of the companies involved, their location and many other variables. However there are a number of areas which a treasury needs to focus on during any M&amp;A. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deciding how the acquisition will be funded and analysing how this will impact the organisation’s own funding arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessing the financial position of the target company and seeing if its debts should be refinanced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating how cash can be extracted from the target company and highlighting any trapped cash issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking if there are any activities which the target company is involved in which would be unfamiliar to the organisation. For example, the management of foreign currencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying any risks which the organisation will be exposing themselves to through the M&amp;A and finding methods to mitigate these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking if there are any potential synergies which the treasury can take advantage of through the M&amp;A. For example, centralising treasury operations and upgrading legacy or implementing new technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key advice I give regarding M&amp;As is to ensure that the treasury’s day-to-day operations are streamlined, efficient and automated. Because when an organisation decides upon M&amp;A activity the treasury is posed with a lot of additional work. However, the day-to-day operations cannot be neglected.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Peter Charles" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/07/2014-07and08-tt-02-qa-peter-charles-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="peter-charles">Peter Charles, Director, Peter Charles Limited:</h5>
<p>A M&amp;A is not necessarily a destabilising time for a company. Companies I work with acquire companies as a method of acquiring customers. Once a year or so they perform a bolt-on acquisition. As a growth strategy it is as effective as a sales force. In that situation an acquisition is not a cause of instability. They are experts at absorbing the bolt-on and have the people, strategies and procedures in place – including treasury – to make that happen. Cash flow is helped by the negotiation of deferred terms to the vendor and the acquisition will be financed through internal resources. The treasury activity is organised around those objectives.</p>
<p>Some treasury teams are hands-off with the operating divisions: a group function may be relying on their relationships with divisional finance directors. They may work on the strategic and financing aspects of an M&amp;A: in contrast others may need to be plugged in to the day-to-day business to provide practical help to the business during a takeover.</p>
<p>We all know the saying ‘cash is king’. But for many companies that is only true when cash really matters, when it is in short supply or great demand. In an M&amp;A situation – where the deal may be significant even if it isn’t transformational – cash is likely to be king. To ensure a smooth transition, treasury needs to be in the loop, plugged into the financing with a tight grip on cash because that is one key way to avoid instability, particularly where the financing dynamics of the two businesses differ. This means treasury needs to be told about the M&amp;A and told in plenty of time.</p>
<p>When the deal is done, those treasury departments which are there on the ground can be an effective force in integration. If they have clear systems and processes in operation they can politely insist soon after the deal that this is the way it is going to be. If the target company doesn’t work in a similar way then clearly there is work to be done to introduce those processes. This should be done quickly to avoid instability and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Many businesses have banks accounts which serve a limited purpose or a specific area, and many have pockets of cash in various places. In terms of integration, good treasury teams I have encountered will make sure that they get hold of all of the bank accounts. After a merger or takeover, it is sensible for treasury to discover and control its cash and bank accounts at once. Having such a grip on the cash is one major antidote to any instability.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Michael Mueller" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/07/2014-07and08-tt-02-qa-michael-muller-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="michael-mueller-barclays">Michael Mueller, Head of Global Cash Management, Barclays:</h5>
<p>Change along this order of magnitude is never easy. Treasury often takes centre stage and the function can quickly turn from financial to technological as it relates to ensuring integrated systems are in place to provide an accurate and aggregate cash position.</p>
<p>Assimilating treasury personnel from both companies is key and not enough can be said on the importance of relationship building in this space. Investing the time in strategy sessions, idea generation and team building is essential to identifying talent from both companies that will lead the transformation process. Each firm will have its own culture and strong leadership is needed to empower the new treasury organisation to leverage this time of change to drive innovation.</p>
<p>The creation of a joint steering committee to manage the transition process is of paramount importance. A project manager should be assigned to lead a cross-functional team (treasury, legal, cash management, compliance, IT, HR) in the creation and execution of a ‘terms of reference’ document that lays out what is in scope for the transformation of treasury, participants and roles and responsibilities. Clear and frequent communication to staff is essential to report progress and invite ideas, through innovation challenges, when roadblocks are identified.</p>
<p>The transition plan should reflect a prioritisation of tasks and those with dependencies across systems and processes. Executing in a phased approach mitigates risk by delivering results in “bite-size chunks” rather than trying to “boil the ocean”. The project should have a beginning and an end date and focus on current and future state:</p>
<h5 id="current-state">Current State (based on a joint review of the treasury function at both organisations)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the financials? What is my current cash position? What is the treasury policy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which banks are in the revolving credit facility (RCF)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What systems are in use (electronic banking, TMS, ERP)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many bank accounts are in place? What is the account structure, globally?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What global transaction banking contracts are held by each bank and who are the signers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What pricing is in place for all global transaction banking services?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What third-party providers are part of the transaction flows (SWIFT, service bureau)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="future-state">Future State (based on a “best of breed” from both treasury functions)</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Visibility to cash through online reporting from all accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revision of treasury policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration and upgrading of systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationalisation and restructuring of bank accounts and relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential change in the geographical location of treasury if a shared service centre (SSC) is part of the future strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New officers, signers and updating of bank mandates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all key decisions have been made, treasury should engage their banking partners to review the new structure. Bankers have a unique role as trusted advisors based on their experience working with other clients who have undergone a transformation of treasury. The success of the transition is based on four pillars: transparency, accountability, communication and commitment. Staying focused on continuous improvement is key for long-term success.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Without doubt, corporate pensions are a burden – not least Defined Benefit (DB) schemes. In fact, legal firm Lane Clark &amp; Peacock (LCP) calculated this burden to be close to $500 billion for FTSE 100 companies in 2013. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Mercer estimated that S&amp;P 1500 companies’ pension liabilities totalled $2.14 trillion in the same year. What is more, both UK and US schemes are largely underfunded, with assets covering 91% and 95% of liabilities respectively.</p>
<p>Understandably, the vastness of these commitments and their impact on the balance sheet means that corporate pensions have largely moved away from their traditional home in the HR department and are creeping up the priority list for corporate treasurers. And with life expectancy increasing in many developed countries, such as the UK, the US and Canada, (all of which carry large DB scheme liabilities) the management of corporate pensions, and their deficits, is a genuine cause for concern. But this has not always been the case.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-got-here">How we got here</h3>
<p>“Up until 2007, pension schemes, especially in the UK, were in a healthy position in terms of their funding levels,” says Chris Coulston, Director, Tax at Deloitte. “Then the financial crisis hit and funding levels across the board deteriorated.” For example, in June 2009, FTSE 100 schemes faced a deficit of £90 billion, a loss of £82 billion on the previous year’s £8 billion deficit, he explains.</p>
<p>Since then corporates have invested billions into their schemes to cover these shortfalls. However, economic conditions have continued to be largely unkind, with market volatility, low interest rates and inflation compounding funding issues. Liabilities have also been increasing, not helped by falling bond yields.</p>
<p>Regulatory changes, such as IAS 19 accounting standards, have further emphasised the challenge for corporates, seeing the complexity as well as the cost of managing DB schemes increase. Corporates are now required to account for the whole value of the deficit on their balance sheet, which last year saw Royal Dutch Shell’s previous retirement benefit surplus of £4 billion sink to a deficit of £8.3 billion. “Overall, corporate focus has dramatically increased on pensions and their risk,” adds Ward. “Schemes have been hit so badly in the past decade that now corporates are making the management of these a high priority.”</p>
<h3 id="risky-business">Risky business</h3>
<p>As the treasurer’s evolving role highlights, since the financial crisis, companies have become more aware of the vulnerability of DB pension schemes and the assortment of risks they are exposed to. One such threat is financial risk – more specifically deficit instability. Over recent years companies have ploughed cash into their schemes to tackle shortfalls in funding; however, deficits often increase. For example, Mercer research shows that between March 2011 and March 2012 UK FTSE 350 companies contributed £20 billion to their schemes, although during that time the deficit increased by £17 billion. This trend was replicated in the United States.</p>
<p>“This is primarily due to volatile growth asset performance, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk,” says Mercer’s Ward. “In recent years these risks have often contrived to go against companies and their plans.” For a corporate sponsor, this affects the cash position and the funding position of the company. A larger deficit also causes the costs of the schemes to increase. For example, in the UK a larger deficit can mean that additional payments need to be made, such as the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy. “Overall, the deficit can be a key concern and may require large amounts of cash to be pumped into the scheme, which could otherwise be used for the business,” says Ward.</p>
<p>Of course, general market and economic activity also affects corporate pension liabilities. Quantitative easing (QE), for example, has resulted in a reduction in UK gilt yields, which in turn has caused an increase in pension liabilities. The National Association of Pension Funds indicates that UK schemes’ deficits increased by £90 billion in 2012 on the back of this. On the other hand, Deloitte estimates that a 1% increase in gilt yields could see funding liabilities reduce by 15% to 20%, which would then also raise the risk of overfunding the scheme and trapping cash.</p>
<p>Once the corporate sponsor has handed over the cash to the pension scheme, they are then exposed to the investment decisions of the trustees. If investment decisions are poor and return on assets low, further cash injections will be required. “It is because of this that we are seeing treasurers increasingly sitting on trustee boards,” says Coulston. “They can then apply their expertise and provide greater input to the investment of the funds.” Some treasurers are also employing independent actuarial advisors to highlight the risks of the schemes and ensure that the trustee board are making the best decisions.</p>
<p>Finally, the complexity of DB schemes means that corporates are also exposed to regulatory and operational risk. An eye must be kept on the ever-evolving regulatory landscape which may bring tougher funding requirements for corporate sponsors. One such example of this is the Solvency II Directive, which, if passed in its current form, will require corporates to fund and reserve their pensions in the same way as insurance companies. This will dramatically increase the impact of pensions on the balance sheet and at worst could add £600 billion to the liabilities of UK company pensions.</p>
<p>“When it comes to the management of pensions, it is primarily about being two steps ahead, and thinking two steps ahead of that,” says Renold’s Hawes. “We need to be aware of what is around the corner to ensure that we can continue to pay the pensions and also ensure the company has sufficient cash.”</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="the-role-of-the-treasurer">The role of the treasurer</h3>
<p>Not only has corporate focus on pensions increased, but the treasury department’s role has intensified in this area too. “As soon as cash becomes a key objective for the corporate, the treasury becomes more integral to the process,” says Deloitte’s Coulston.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the role of the treasurer in corporate pensions is not set in stone and will vary from company to company. In some cases treasurers may take an active role managing the scheme, while in others they may serve just as advisors to pension managers and trustees. Whichever path they take, Mercer’s Ward believes that “treasurers can add a lot to the mix, but what they really bring to the table is their skillset, in terms of understanding risk.” Treasury professionals will be well-versed in many of the tools which are key to managing the risks surrounding pensions, such as interest rate swaps and inflation swaps, to name a few. “Corporate treasurers are therefore well placed to bring pensions into the overall risk management framework,” says Ward.</p>
<p>UK-based manufacturing company Renold introduced its treasury into the management of the company’s pension scheme in 2007. “The reason for this,” says Andy Hawes, Pensions and Treasury Analyst at Renold, “is that we already had a deficit at this point which had existed for around five years. It therefore became much more important to manage the liquidity of the pension scheme alongside the group.”</p>
<p>It is Hawes’ belief that the management of the group’s and the pension fund’s liquidity work hand in hand. “At Renold, we have a substantial pension payroll each month,” he says. “The majority of this is funded through the deficit repair contributions and also from the income from the assets of the scheme.” Funding for the business, however, cannot be neglected. “Treasury is therefore well positioned to take a more hands-on role in the balancing act of ensuring there is enough money to fund the scheme and also the business,” says Hawes.</p>
<p>It is not only the funding side of pension management which treasurers are finding themselves more involved in but also the liabilities side. “The financial crisis put a lot of emphasis on the management of pension assets,” says Rando Bruns, Head of Group Treasury at pharmaceutical and chemical giant Merck, which has large pension schemes across Europe and in the US. “However, I think treasurers now have a more holistic approach to pensions overall and are increasingly focusing on the liabilities. At Merck for example, the treasury takes an active role in looking at the impact of both sides through sensitivity analysis and forecasting future scenarios, thus allowing us to know where risks are and what impacts these will have, not only on the pension schemes but also the company’s overall balance sheet.”</p>
<p>Getting involved in the company’s pension scheme can also help to raise the treasury function’s profile with other departments, and highlights treasury’s ability to add value to the organisation. “For example, we have regular meetings with HR and accounting in order to discuss any changes to the pension plans,” says Bruns. “Together, we can then evaluate the impact on all areas of the business.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-balancing-act">The balancing act</h3>
<p>As such, the treasurer’s role in managing corporate pensions is truly a balancing act between risk and return. “The trade-off between the two is really the million-dollar question, especially in volatile markets,” admits Merck’s Bruns. There is no single right answer as each company will be in a unique funding position. “There is also the balancing act of knowing when to carry the risk and when to reduce it,” says Mercer’s Ward. “If treasurers look to close off the risk too quickly the apparent funding levels would appear to decline and the deficit would increase, seeing more cash required from the company.” When it comes to pensions there are balances within balances.</p>
<p>All pension experts agree, however, that a long-term strategy is needed for managing corporate pensions. Bruns advises that this should include funding and investment strategies which can stand the test of time. “Schemes can’t be ultra-safe and see no return on investments, but on the other hand, they cannot be highly aggressive and leave huge risk on the balance sheet,” he says. “There needs to be something in between.” The strategy also has to have the flexibility to cope with shifts in economic conditions and be able to make the most of opportunities when they arise. For Bruns, “Managing pensions is a lot about looking into the future and carefully waiting for the opportunities – it’s a long-term task.”</p>
<h3 id="de-risking-options">De-risking options</h3>
<p>With no silver bullet to hand, companies are of course looking for methods which can increase their assets, reduce their liabilities, and ultimately remove any deficit. These can be small incremental changes to reduce their pension fund’s risk, or they could be larger, more advanced strategies, depending on the company’s position and needs. There are a number of options available.</p>
<p>Asset-backed funding (ABF) is one such method, offering an alternative to cash funding. ABF sees the corporate sponsor provide an income stream to the pension scheme from a special purpose vehicle, backed by collateral assets such as property, stock, or more imaginative items such as alcohol, made famous by Diageo, which promised £400m of funds to its pension scheme with a structure using maturing whiskey stock. The pension receives a series of cash flows from this asset over a set period of time. This income stream is often given a net present value and treated as an asset by the trustees. “This delivers a more cash-efficient way of funding for the company and helps reduce the deficit,” says Deloitte’s Coulston, “which is exactly what the treasury is looking for.”</p>
<p>Companies can also look to de-risk by offering transfer incentives and increase exchange options to its employees. For example, employees can be offered the option to take money at retirement as a lump sum. “This is a method which Renold has employed and it has helped reduce long-term liabilities substantially and has also created savings on our short-term monthly cash flow,” says Hawes. Other options in this area include offering enhanced transfer values (ETVs), whereby non-retired DB scheme members are offered a certain amount of cash in advance and then the rest is moved to a more flexible pension vehicle, potentially offering greater value for the employee. ETVs have been popular in recent years and allow the corporate sponsor to reduce their liabilities and cost.</p>
<p>Many companies offer multiple pension schemes which are all separately managed. If this is the case, asset pooling can increase control, improve risk management and governance, while also delivering cost savings through economies of scale. “This is something which we carried out at Renold,” says Hawes. “We historically had four or five pension schemes and combined them into one. To have the assets all in one large pot meant the returns became higher. We have also saved in areas such as administration costs.” It must be noted however that there can be barriers to this method, including trustees being unwilling to relinquish control, as well as tax issues.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-for-the-treasury-and-pensions">The future for the treasury and pensions</h3>
<p>With the majority of DB schemes now closed to new entrants and DC schemes fast becoming the norm, can we expect the treasurer’s role in corporate pensions to decline? “If we look very long-term and assume there isn’t going to be a shift back to DB schemes then the role of the treasurer in pensions should in theory decrease and become easier,” says Mercer’s Ward. “The tail of the DB, however, is very long and currently is not shrinking. So the management of these will continue to be challenging for a prolonged period.”</p>
<p>Hawes agrees: “As the DB schemes decrease, management of the assets will be required as contributions will decline. Treasurers will therefore find themselves managing assets which are either static or decreasing, requiring further involvement in following and reporting where the investments are going and how they are behaving.”</p>
<p>There is a light at the end of the tunnel, however. “The closer we get to D-Day, which may be 20 to 30 years away,” says Hawes, “the management of DB schemes will become easier. “With many schemes closed there will be no new entrants and also liabilities will decrease. Once the DB schemes are finished, we can certainly put our feet up as we will know what our contributions will be each month and there will be no pensions deficit to manage,” he says.</p></div>

<h5 id="raj-mody-head-of-pensions-pwc">Raj Mody, Head of Pensions, PwC:</h5>
<p>Deficits remain stubbornly on companies’ balance sheets. This is due to a combination of artificially low interest rates, scheme members living longer than anticipated and pension schemes de-risking – which means schemes have a lower proportion of assets in equities than ever before and so do not really benefit from equity market increases. All of this creates an impression of a hole so deep and dark that there is no escape. But there are actions that treasurers can take to help their employers survive and thrive, notwithstanding their defined benefit deficits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Use available flexibility.</h5>
<p>The UK Pensions Regulator has a new statutory objective to take account of the financial well-being of the sponsoring employer when considering plans submitted to reduce the pension deficit. The regulator has said publicly that employers can use the full extent of that flexibility and in particular can take account of the need to retain cash in the business for investment or to protect corporate solvency. This means that treasurers should assess the annual amount that the company can afford to pay to the pension scheme without damaging future company prospects. This should then set an upper limit to any negotiations between the company and the pension trustees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Ensure input of relevant expertise.</h5>
<p>Treasurers could also participate in discussions on the shape of any proposed deficit recovery plan. It may be that the recovery plan could be lengthened or rear-ended, so bringing down the cost in the early years – particularly appropriate if the company is embarking on a growth phase. There is also scope to check whether trustees’ proposed actions around hedging risks and using financial instruments such as derivatives take advantage of the skillsets and market relationships which a treasury function can likely supply. Treasurers should be actively represented in any trustee discussions on these matters, and should not hesitate to appoint their own strategic advisers to challenge the perspectives of the trustees’ statutory compliance advisers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Examine non-cash funding.</h5>
<p>There may be assets that can be allocated to the pension scheme instead of paying cash either directly, via an intermediate special purpose vehicle, or to back a company guarantee. This is a trend that has grown in recent years. It requires the identification of suitable assets but can help to preserve cash in the company while simultaneously reducing the pension deficit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Look for market opportunities.</h5>
<p>Insurers’ appetite for taking on pension schemes’ longevity risks varies – there are times when longevity can be insured at a lower cost than it appears in the liability values. These opportunities tend to be temporary and often fleeting, so it is necessary to actively monitor the market if you want to have the chance to spot them and to act in time. In practice this requires real-time analysis tools that can help you remain alive to when these opportunities appear. It is only in very recent times that such tools have begun to emerge and the leading example by far is Skyval. Using such a tool enables the treasurer to identify the key variables, see and stress-test cash flows, and plan and execute in good time.</p>
<p>Finally, it remains the objective of many companies that still have defined benefit liabilities to remove them entirely from the corporate balance sheet. In doing this, volatility can be the friend of the treasurer. Undoubtedly there will be short windows of time when opportunities arise and the difference between success and failure may well hinge on the ability to act quickly. Success will look like pension rights secured and protected externally. Failure will look like internal post mortems over why opportunities were not seized. Real-time analysis may make the difference.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Paul Lee" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/05/2014-05-tt-02-qa-paul-lee-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="paul-lee-national-association-of-pension-funds">Paul Lee, Head of Investment Affairs, National Association of Pension Funds (UK):</h5>
<p>When looking at how to reduce their deficits, pension funds face two core challenges, both of which increase their liabilities. The first is a familiar problem – longevity continues to extend. The second is one that is relatively new – quantitative easing, or QE, which has created a bond market where yields are unnaturally low.</p>
<p>Increased longevity is good news for us all but does bring with it a number of issues, not least for pension scheme funding. And while QE makes debt financing relatively cheap, and so may bring positive benefits for treasurers in other aspects of their day job, the flip side of this is that liabilities look far more substantial when assessed on standard yields. There is, however, nothing that a company can do to alter either of these two challenges, so let us consider what other options are available to them.</p>
<p>When looking at how to reduce pension deficits, broadly speaking, there are four possible courses of action: consider the level of benefits; increase funding to the scheme; make an asset-backed contribution (ABC); and, develop a closer working relationship with the pension fund trustees.</p>
<p>Evaluating the level of benefits offered to scheme members is an important option. Some moderation of benefits can be done relatively easily and is often completed early in the course of reducing deficits. The remaining choices are more complicated and often involve difficult discussions with employee representatives. Perhaps the most obvious solution is to provide more funding to the scheme. While bolstering the asset position in response to the calculated liabilities is simple and straightforward it is unlikely to be a financially attractive solution.</p>
<p>ABCs effectively lock up a property, or other asset, often in a Scottish Limited Partnership, for the benefit of the pension scheme – giving the pension scheme greater security while reducing the size of the scheme’s deficit. When structured correctly, they can be reversed should the unwinding of QE lead to bond yields rising and resulting in a fall in the liabilities of the pension scheme.</p>
<p>The statutory role of pension fund trustees is to act as an independent solely in the interest of their beneficiaries. That said, trustees will naturally want to ensure the sponsoring employer remains financially robust as this is clearly an essential element in securing a pension scheme’s future. This sensibility may help trustees and sponsoring employers to develop a measured contributions schedule. In the UK, the Pensions Regulator (TPR) has a new objective to encourage it to be more understanding of sponsoring employees’ needs which should support productive and practical working relationships between trustees and sponsors.</p>
<p>Each one of these may not present a solution in themselves, particularly where a deficit is large, but increasingly we see trustees and sponsors working together to use some, or all, of these options to provide secure long-term futures for their pension scheme beneficiaries.</p>

<h5 id="sean-gilfeather-lorica-employee-benefits">Sean Gilfeather, Head of Corporate Pensions, Actuarial, Lorica Employee Benefits:</h5>
<p>Apart from the usual headline reasons, such as lack of available cash flow, employer lethargy, opportunity cost and so forth, there are many fundamental underlying issues that mean employers are either frightened to tackle deficits or are ill-equipped to tackle them. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Ineffective trustee boards.</h5>
<p>Trustees are empowered to manage significant risks on behalf of the members, but if they get it wrong, the employer pays the price. Despite advances in recent years in the standard of trustee knowledge and understanding, we’re still seeing trustee boards where the constituents lack the experience and skills to have the confidence to manage the underlying risks and deficits effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The role of the Scheme Actuary.</h5>
<p>Many trustees, and indeed employers, still rely too heavily on their Scheme Actuary to provide them with the help and advice they need to reduce deficits. The role of the Scheme Actuary is clearly defined in regulation and employers must realise that a Scheme Actuary’s main driver on a day-to-day basis is compliance with a raft of regulations – it’s not their day job to help the employer to reduce the deficit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Ineffective advisers.</h5>
<p>The way in which advice and management of risks is delivered on behalf of trustees and employers must change. Time and time again, we come across advisers that are ill-equipped to provide clients with the most effective and cost efficient advice available. Many advisers’ primary concern is achieving their chargeable hours or new business targets, rather than providing clients with the right advice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-remedy-these-issues">How to remedy these issues</h4>
<p>Treasurers must have more visibility over how defined benefit schemes are managed by trustees, and this can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintaining an open and transparent relationship with the trustees and their advisers – this can be facilitated by sharing objectives and agreeing a long-term business plan for the scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that the treasurer takes their own independent actuarial advice. Even though this will come at an additional cost, it should reduce the overall costs of servicing the scheme and help to improve their overall understanding of the underlying risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointing an independent trustee, perhaps on a sole basis, as this will dispense with the need for other trustees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving awareness of the powers available to you as the sponsoring employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that there is a robust and transparent operational and governance framework in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The global economic downturn, along with the European sovereign debt crisis, political uncertainty in the US and slower economic growth in India and China, has dampened global merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity. In the first three quarters of 2012, M&amp;A activity had fallen by 17.4% compared to the comparable period in 2011, according to the paper ‘Merger and Acquisitions – 2013’ posted by Andrew Brownstein, Partner in the Corporate Department at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katzon, on the Harvard Law School Forum. However, in 4Q12 a number of large transactions pushed global M&amp;A levels up to their highest in four years.</p>
<p>The paper cited a continuing, post-recession emphasis on deleveraging and strengthening corporate balance sheets, which made cost-saving M&amp;A initiatives particularly valuable. “This is especially true for the many companies that have already exhausted their own cost-cutting opportunities, even as they have accumulated arsenals of deployable cash,” according to the paper. “And global market pressures, economic volatility and industry-specific factors across a wide array of industries put pressure on corporations to increase scale, diversify their asset base, seek operational synergies and spread costs across larger platforms.”</p>
<p>While the global picture for M&amp;A is positive, it is patchy. In the UK, for example, the total number of domestic and cross-border M&amp;A transactions fell by 42% in 2Q13, compared to the same quarter in 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The value of acquisitions of UK companies made by foreign companies in 2Q13 increased sizeably from £3.5 billion in 1Q13 to £23.4 billion. The number of transactions in 2Q13 also increased to 30 from 19 recorded in the previous quarter. However, the number fell when compared with the same quarter a year ago, which saw 48 transactions taking place.</p>
<p>The value of majority ownership acquisitions made by UK companies abroad (outward acquisitions) fell from £1.1 billion in 1Q13 to £0.6 billion in 2Q13 (current price basis). This was the lowest value for outward acquisitions since ONS first collected quarterly data in 1Q1987 (£1.7 billion).</p>
<p>Online information portal Statista reports that the total value of global M&amp;As during the first half of 2013 was $896 billion, the majority of which took place in the energy, mining and utilities sector in the US. This high figure is despite the fact that, says Statista, “the M&amp;A process is notoriously complicated and deals often fall through – empirical data shows high failure rates of M&amp;A deals across the spectrum”.</p>
<p>As a result, corporate treasury and finance teams within global businesses are being called on to take a more strategic role in the whole process. Increasingly, they are tasked with supporting other parts of the business in decisions involving engagements with new markets, the development of new products and M&amp;A activity.</p>

</div>
<p><em>At EuroFinance Miami earlier this year, Ed Paterson, Vice President and Assistant Treasurer, Oracle, presented a session entitled ‘The science of M&amp;A’. He went through a checklist similar to the AFP’s explaining how Oracle maximises its success in integrating new companies. The company is highly acquisitive and has successfully brought on board 85 companies since its first acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2005 – this equates to almost one a month. Paterson’s first tip for the treasurers in the audience was: “Although you can develop a blueprint for M&amp;As, you will always need to refine it because no two companies are alike.”</em></p>
<p>In order to cope with the number of integration projects, Oracle treasury created a dedicated team of three people whose sole job is to focus on M&amp;A activity. “They are involved in the due diligence process to understand the companies that we are buying at a granular level,” explained Paterson. “The key is early participation of treasury. It is easy to get into the mind-set of jumping into the whole integration piece after the company is bought, but it is important to get involved early on as part of an holistic approach.”</p>
<p>He identified two key integration milestones: change in control (CIC), which includes having the governmental approvals needed to close the transaction and pay the shareholders of the company; and the legal entity combination dates, which is the point at which the local subsidiaries are combined, including sales, payroll, etc, so that is just one balance sheet and one P&amp;L statement. The team prioritises subsidiaries in terms of size and works closely with the company’s attorneys and tax department to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Paterson stressed the need to integrate quickly. “The longer integration takes, the more uncertainty begins to creep in and new priorities crop up. With 85 acquisitions over an eight-year period, we have had to move pretty quickly to integrate these companies.</p>
<p>“In order to do this, we focused on the important elements in each integration. We don’t sweat the small stuff. We focus our time are the main areas of finance such as cash management and banking, investments, debt, inter-company loans and FX. That is the bread and butter of all operations.”</p>
<p>Paterson identified the target timelines for each item on treasury’s checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding Oracle signers to bank accounts: 45 days for global banks; 90 days for local banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sweeping cash to Oracle, where possible, within 45 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close AR accounts within 90 days; close AP accounts within 60 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investments: liquidate investment programmes within a week; do not roll into Oracle investment portfolios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debt: outstanding credit lines and revolver agreements are paid off within 30 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inter-company loans: scrub the balance sheets before legal entity combination dates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FX hedging: terminate non-material hedging programmes within a month; or roll into Oracle programme within a quarter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the results are phenomenal. Oracle treasury acquired 1,870 accounts through acquisitions and the team has managed to close 1,648 – this leaves only 222 accounts that remain open and most are related to more recent acquisitions. “We report this metric to the Board and it is always an area of interest for them,” said Paterson. Treasury also has no outstanding investments nor term debt. There are 25 different bank lines outstanding related to bank guarantees, but this is where Paterson doesn’t “sweat the small stuff”. Oracle inherited more than 500 different inter-company loan combinations and at the time of the conference in May had reduced this number down to 50.</p>

<h3 id="role-of-the-treasury">Role of the treasury</h3>
<p>This is certainly true for a European Treasury Manager at a global retail eyewear company, which has been expanding both organically and through M&amp;A activity. Most recently it acquired two companies in Europe, which are currently being integrated into the company’s structures. Treasury was involved in the merger process from the outset, providing capital injections and liaising with the legal departments, as well as staff within the new companies in order to ensure a smooth integration process. This can involve a lot of travelling time for treasury teams, in order to truly understand the new companies’ operations, as well as comprehend the banking and payment requirements if these acquisitions are located in new jurisdictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The total value of global M&amp;As during the first half of 2013 was $896 billion, the majority of which took place in the energy, mining and utilities sector in the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everyone agrees that treasury is on the frontline when it comes to M&amp;A activity. “Whenever an M&amp;A – or some other change in leadership – occurs, the focus tends to be more on the CFO, rather than on the experts in the finance function,” says Suzzane Wood, Leader, Financial Officers Practice at global recruitment firm Russell Reynolds Associates. “The treasury function has more exposure in its relationship with banks, ratings agencies and advisers.”</p>
<p>However, most agree that treasury’s participation in the process is crucial for success. According to Lilian Burke, a Partner at PMC Treasury, fruitful M&amp;A transactions occur only when a high number of co-ordinated treasury activities are effectively executed.</p>
<p>The treasury consultancy has been involved in a number of interim treasury operations. At US Clinical Supplies, for example, PMC was engaged after the company was divested from a global multinational corporation (MNC) and acquired by two private equity sponsors. The transaction was an asset purchase and PMC helped to establish the new business’s treasury and banking arrangements.</p>
<p>This work involved the establishment of operational banking for all the global businesses locally by organising banking arrangements in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia, as well as Asia Pacific in terms of relationships, bank accounts and facilities for letters of credit (LCs) and guarantees. In addition, the company developed a reporting framework for short and medium-term cash forecasting together with liquidity management. It created a debt management model to manage covenant compliance, debt baskets and debt servicing requirements and helped to define treasury policy to govern all activity around the group. Finally, it managed various ancillary projects such as advising on interest rate risk management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The technology available today can allow treasury employees to devote more time to managing risk and banking relationships and to become more involved in business development and M&amp;A.”</p>
<p><cite>Carina Ruiz, a Partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another similar transaction, a large Germany-based manufacturer of industrial compounds – with extensive international operations – was carved out of a major industrial conglomerate. Again, the company was acquired by private equity firms, which asked PMC to provide an interim treasury to manage the new business’s treasury affairs. Among its tasks, PMC reviewed the group’s foreign exchange (FX) exposures and recommended a new approach; organised and executed a redenomination of some of the group’s debt financing; implemented comprehensive debt forecasting; rationalised banking facilities; and developed several models to manage a leveraged debt package, including covenants, debt baskets and payments. Finally, PMC designed the new company’s target treasury structure and recruited the appropriate resources.</p>
<h3 id="change-management">Change management</h3>
<p>According to consultancy PwC, a key driver of the success of an M&amp;A is the performance of the treasury function. The financial importance, operational significance and organisational complexity of the treasury function make it a bellwether of a deal’s success. PwC says it is critical for a treasury function to manage the risks inherent in a large scale transaction while also capitalising on the opportunities to strategically transform the newly formed organisation.</p>
<p>In a recent webcast, Carina Ruiz, a Partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, said many treasury departments were now focused on how they can better use technology to spend less time on day-to-day tactical work; how they can shore up resources to be able to tackle the more complex global issues that companies face; and how they can think more externally to broaden their range of customers.</p>
<p>Standardisation and automation of transactional processes are reducing the amount of time needed for traditional treasury interfaces involving transactional processes for accounts payable (AP), accounts receivable (AR) and other areas. “The technology available today can allow treasury employees to devote more time to managing risk and banking relationships and to become more involved in business development and M&amp;A,” she said. “This is a good time for treasury to be taking a closer look at how technology can be used more extensively to bring value to the business.”</p>
<p>In addition, the discipline of change management is very relevant to M&amp;A activity. Any activity will bring about change, particularly at the top. Moreover, it is unlikely both treasuries will survive an M&amp;A transaction.</p>
<p>Successful change management requires a management-wide approach before, during and after the process. Senior management must ensure that staff are mobilised and engaged in the change. Positive expectations need to be set and a communication strategy – whereby all employees are aware of the change and its implication – needs to be thought through. Any change can generate anxiety and uncertainty among staff and management need to address this from the outset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is incumbent on the corporate treasurer to understand the needs of the newly changed company and develop a strategy of how the treasury function will support those needs after an M&amp;A transaction is closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senior managers responsible for implementing the change often experience different types of resistance to change which can directly reduce the pace, intensity, effectiveness and value of end results of the change process.</p>
<p>Most companies struggle to successfully accomplish change processes, according to Accenture. It says a variety of studies suggest that between 50%-80% of change programmes do not live up to expectations. The consultancy cites a number of capabilities that should be in place – and integrated – to ensure a change, such as a merger or acquisition, is successful. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change strategy and planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership alignment and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stakeholder engagement and communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change measurement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organisation readiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural or behavioural change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing capability to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training and performance support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-to-success">Key to success</h3>
<p>Many observers now believe that treasury departments must become involved in any M&amp;A activity as early as possible. Treasury is responsible for managing cash generation, financial risks and access to capital markets – all of these aspects are critical to a successful merger or acquisition. If treasury staff are omitted from decision-making around M&amp;A transactions, a company risks setting unrealistic goals or misaligning expectations when it comes to transforming the treasury.</p>
<p>It is incumbent on the corporate treasurer to understand the needs of the newly changed company and develop a strategy of how the treasury function will support those needs after an M&amp;A transaction is closed. Areas to consider include IT requirements, external debt financing covenants, organisation structure, business models and operational inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>The Association for Finance Professionals (AFP) in the US has published a checklist for treasury’s role in M&amp;As, from an acquirer’s perspective. The idea of the checklist is to provide a list of the different areas that could affect treasury during the due diligence and integration phases. The AFP says the checklist should help to alleviate some of the burden treasury departments face in making sure they have met and mitigated their concerns around the uncertainty of collecting important information.</p>
<p>The categories in the checklist are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bank relationships and accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FX/commodities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LCs, bank guarantees and comfort letters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefit plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance-related items.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the due diligence phase, corporate treasurers should never assume that the buyer, acquirer or advising bank has ticked all the boxes. Pension liabilities and medical insurance obligations often are overlooked or not fully taken into account during an acquisition. Such liabilities can have a significant impact on the financial aspect of a merger or acquisition.</p>
<p>The role of treasury is also intrinsic to the financing aspects of a merger or acquisition. Acquisitions are by their nature complex and can be financed by a range of different structures. These need to be fully examined, as do the debts held by the acquisition target. Pre-arranged credit lines and structured finance arrangements must be controlled and understood.</p>
<p>Also, treasurers need to ensure that working capital finance is available, all banking mandates are changed through authorised signatures and that all banking accounts are properly arranged. “Treasurers are critical to ensuring continuity of banking relationships,” adds Wood.</p></div>

<p><em>There is an adage in business circles that what cannot be measured cannot be managed. By benchmarking, treasury professionals can measure their performance against their peers and implement improvements if necessary. But what sounds straightforward is, in practice, quite complex.</em></p>
</div>
</div><div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>There are two main approaches to benchmarking: firms can compare themselves to their peers, or they can benchmark their performance against internally set key performance indicators (KPIs). Even if firms choose to benchmark themselves against internal KPIs, they should have some knowledge of what other treasuries are doing in order to set realistic KPIs or understand the differences. Across both types of benchmarking only one thing is clear: there is no ‘one measure fits all’ approach.</p>
<p>The idea of tracking best practice in treasury operations gained popularity following the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in the US in 2002 along with similar legislation elsewhere in the world. In a 2012 Journal of Corporate Treasury Management paper, ‘Monitoring, benchmarking and improving treasury performance: the practical application of KPIs in treasury’, Paul Higdon, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at IT2 Treasury Solutions (now part of Wall Street Systems), stated that these regulations required “a very substantial increase in controls and the scope of documentation requirements in treasury and finance operations”. This development in part defined the emerging standards of best practice for corporate treasury operation, he observed.</p>
<p>Another factor driving this change was the devastating losses suffered by companies such as Enron due to fraud or treasury errors. “At the time when the response to the events that led to SOX introduction was being evaluated, one general conclusion was that specific individuals within corporations or institutions were seen to be at fault,” stated Higdon. “Therefore tighter regulation of organisations was needed to ensure that the company and shareholders were protected against such rogue employees.” This objective was achieved by improving internal processes, reporting and controls.</p>
<p>Fast forward six years and the financial crisis threw another spanner in the works. One of the striking post-crisis changes for treasury is the recognition that once considered routine tasks now carry significant risk and associated overheads. Such tasks included raising cash funds and analysing cash availability. Treasury’s role in cash management, funding, financial risk management and other key areas is now seen to be critical to the profitability, smooth operation and even viability of an organisation.</p>
<p>It is understandable in the light of this new environment that corporate treasuries should seek to determine how well they are performing in their roles. However, there is no standard approach or readily available guidance. For some corporate treasuries, external input from consultancies is seen as the key to benchmarking. Others adopt internal measures but, for many benchmarking is simply not undertaken.</p>
<p>“Benchmarking is essential in measuring the performance of the treasury team as a whole and also for measuring individuals’ performance,” says Paul Stheeman, an independent treasury consultant, based in Germany. “Every company wants to be best-in-class and there is no reason for the treasury function to be excluded from that aim.”</p>
<p>Companies should combine the traditional benchmarking of measuring performance against their peers with the internal, KPI approach. “Treasuries have to follow company strategy and adhere to it, but they also should measure their performance versus their peers,” Stheeman advises.</p>
<p>Here at Treasury Today we have been conducting benchmarking studies since 2009. More recently we have included a separate section on KPIs and, with the input of our corporate respondents we have developed seven key treasury disciplines against which KPIs are deployed. The table below defines these treasury disciplines and the top three KPIs used against each. In more recent studies we are now identifying the actual measures companies are achieving against the above and allowing respondents to benchmark themselves not only against the whole Study universe but also against their respective industry sector.</p>

<h3 id="benchmarking-against-peers">Benchmarking against peers</h3>
<p>One of the most significant challenges of benchmarking how a treasury is performing against its peer group is determining exactly who the company’s peers are. Corporate treasuries – like corporates themselves – come in all different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Dino Nicolaides, Head of the Corporate Treasury Advisory Team in London for consultancy Deloitte, says benchmarking is about understanding how a company’s treasury function compares to those of similar companies. “It is how you define ‘similar’ that can vary,” he says. “This can be based on industry sector, company size irrespective of the industry in which you operate, or based on geographical location. How you define your peer group will determine the value you get out of the benchmarking exercise.”</p>
<p>Bas Rebel, Senior Director, treasury advisory at PwC in the Netherlands, says that for “quite some time” benchmarking should have been higher on the agenda of corporate treasurers, but wasn’t. “The key problem is that treasurers still believe their situation and company structure is unique and therefore difficult to compare with the outside world,” he says. However, recently PwC has been asked more frequently by clients about how other treasuries are organised and what their focus is. “So there is an interest to understand how peers are working. However, that is still not close to formal benchmarking. The one situation where we are involved in a more formal benchmarking against peers is when a business case for change has to be made or approved.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Benchmarking gives us the opportunity to identify where we stand and how we develop over time among our peers. The external comparison is essential for the progress of a unique corporate function like treasury.”</p>
<p><cite>Karsten Kabas, Head of Corporate Treasury, Merz GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to have meaningful comparisons, treasurers need more than a couple of corporates with whom they are comparing themselves. Once a reasonable sample of peers is established, the next challenge is to recognise that every organisation is different, with its own treasury policy, structure and risk appetite. “You need to flex the statistics in order to ensure you are comparing apples with apples. For example, if you compare two FTSE100 companies, one might be operating in ten countries and the other in 150. The latter will be using very sophisticated cash management techniques in order to concentrate cash and move it around the world. Comparing those cash management procedures with the ones employed by the former company won’t be suitable” says Nicolaides.</p>

<h3 id="setting-kpis">Setting KPIs</h3>
<p>In a February 2012 blog, IT2’s Higdon writes that KPIs provide “a structured and objective environment for assessing the effectiveness, accuracy and rate of improvement of critical treasury processes”. Treasury KPIs are valuable at all levels of an organisation, potentially enhancing the quality, level of policy compliance and efficiency of treasury.</p>
<p>“Corporate treasurers are increasingly being encouraged to adopt a KPI programme, under the direction of senior management, often at Board level,” he writes. “A KPI programme is typically delivered through the implementation of an enhanced treasury policy, and manifests as a new set of mandatory processes, integrated with the treasury workflow.”</p>
<p>But as with benchmarking against peers, a similar conundrum exists in setting KPIs – which ones are appropriate for a particular treasury operation? The choice of the optimal set of KPIs for a particular treasury can be an exacting exercise as the wide-ranging objectives include streamlining management reporting, improving the quality of all kinds of treasury operations and measuring, analysing and documenting operational compliance with treasury policy. The set of KPIs ultimately selected for a particular treasury will not only reflect the specific treasury policy and workflows that are in place; it must also reflect the business policies and priorities of the whole organisation. The KPI selection that works best for a given treasury will have been chosen through detailed analysis of those features of treasury operations that correspond to the highest levels of risk exposure.</p>
<p>“The treasury employs a variety of KPIs to ensure benchmarking efficiency. These include transaction costs, refinancing risk, covenant ratios and FX hedging amongst others,” says Daniele Vecchi, Group Treasurer at Majid Al Futtaim in Dubai.</p>
<p>Intelligence gathering for establishing KPIs is a major challenge. A corporate treasurer can contact their treasury peers and friends, and try to glean information about their practices, but such an approach is fairly ad hoc. Ideally the treasurer needs to get a larger statistical sample. But this sort of benchmarking must be used carefully. A large statistical survey may tell you that 35% of treasuries practice A and 25% do B, etc. But what does that really tell you? Jeff Wallace, Managing Director at US-based Debt Compliance Services comments “economic factors drive different behaviours. Benchmarking should take into account what is driving different behaviours in a particular set of treasury practices. Sometimes it will be volume in terms of the number of transactions, whereas sometimes it is the industry itself.”</p>
<p>While many observers believe industry is a big driver of differences in treasury practice, others point out that, at the end of the day, treasuries are pretty much the same. Money goes in and comes out, and there are risks to manage.</p>
<p>Stheeman outlines the main KPIs that companies most often use to measure their performance. These cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Personnel</h5>
<p>– costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cycle times</h5>
<p>– based on regular types of activities such as cash forecasting, bank account reconciliation, cash pooling, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cash flow forecasting</h5>
<p>– balance versus actual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Stranded cash reduction</h5>
<p>– reducing trapped cash or having the amounts at as low a level as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Counterparty risk</h5>
<p>– how high losses are over time and how to reduce them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>FX and interest rate performance</h5>
<p>– there are several ways to choose a benchmark, but an appropriate one needs to be found and measured against.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bank charges</h5>
<p>– how much are you paying for treasury services and which banks are you using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bank relationships</h5>
<p>– related to the above. How well are your banks doing and how do they compare with each other?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cost of credit</h5>
<p>– how does this compare to other organisations and internal targets?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“The main focus of our benchmarking processes is related to maintaining relationships with our banks. In essence this means: how we choose the banks; how we manage our FX exposures; and how we manage our finance costs,” says Kamal Goyal, CFO at Alumco in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The treasury employs a variety of KPIs to ensure benchmarking efficiency. These include transaction costs, refinancing risk, covenant ratios and FX hedging amongst others.”</p>
<p><cite>Daniele Vecchi, Group Treasurer at Majid Al Futtaim in Dubai.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In setting KPIs treasuries should set realistic goals but also ensure these goals are not too easy to achieve. Benchmarking models coming out of spreadsheets that are so complex no-one understands them, are not any use. You need to understand the KPIs and how they are measured or else you will not get a result with which you can be comfortable.</p>
<p>In order to determine the right set of KPIs for any particular situation, the treasurer needs to be very clear about their organisational objectives and about the guidelines defining how those objectives are to be achieved — the treasury policy. When selecting KPIs, the organisation’s current or future capability to deliver the required results, at the required levels of accuracy and timeliness, should be considered carefully. The selection of the appropriate KPIs for a given treasury naturally depends on the nature of the company’s business, as well as treasury’s defined role within it.</p>
<p>Nicolaides says a number of metrics and how they differ between companies should be considered during a benchmarking exercise. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Treasury organisational structure.</h5>
<p>How are treasury activities around the world organised? Some organisations may centralise at headquarters (HQ), while others have group treasury but delegate to regional treasury centres to take over activity in that continent. In benchmarking, the treasury must compare itself to similar companies of similar size in similar countries and ask “are we falling short of this peer group company?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Quality and skills of key people within the treasury function.</h5>
<p>Key individuals that determine treasury policy and strategy at central and regional centres should be compared with the key individuals in similar organisations. Is a company employing people of the same calibre?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Governance.</h5>
<p>The involvement of the Board in terms of overall treasury strategy and how authorities are delegated within the organisations, from the Board to the CTO, finance, treasury committee or even in regions, should be compared and analysed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Policies.</h5>
<p>This can be a difficult area to tackle. You have to isolate the risk appetite of particular organisations. If one organisation has insignificant foreign exchange (FX) risk, their policy will be to ignore it. Another organisation that has extensive FX risk exposures will engage in significant hedging activities. If you compare their treasury policies, you should isolate risk appetite because it is irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Core treasury activity.</h5>
<p>How a treasury identifies, measures and manages risk, including FX, interest rate, counterparty risk, cash management and liquidity risk. Companies should look at procedures and again isolate the risk appetite of other organisations if irrelevant. How do the procedures of one organisation in terms of identifying risk compare with those of another? Does the treasury have a procedure to identify whether there is a risk or whether it has gone undetected? Are there processes over time to manage and observe changes in risk exposures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Operational procedures.</h5>
<p>Such procedures include front office dealing activities such as derivatives trading, hedging, confirmation and settlement. How does the treasury compare with similar organisations? Systems and technology also should be considered – how automated are these processes versus the peer group? Where is the technology in terms of the industry practice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reporting.</h5>
<p>This is strongly related to KPIs, on which the treasury report to senior management. Benchmarking should consider how complete the KPIs are and how the reporting on them compares with other organisations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-it-right">Getting it right</h3>
<p>What is clear is that benchmarking in treasury has to be managed with great care. It is important to measure the right things and it is very easy to measure the wrong things.</p>
<p>For example, a focus on funding costs can overlook the fact that the funding itself may not be required, if the treasury improved its management of working capital. Additionally, a good working capital metric, such as cash conversion cycle (CCC), may push higher costs elsewhere in the business. For example, it can encourage business units to give expensive early payment discounts, or secure longer payment terms from suppliers, who may incorporate a higher funding cost in their base prices. Finally, a focus on bank charges may reduce the bank charges, but will this result in damage to banking relations which causes significant increased cost further down the line?</p>
<p>The main point is that treasury activities, while they need to be monitored for efficiency, also need to be looked at in the context of their overall cost. This is always extremely difficult and it requires a high level of organisational maturity: the organisation as a whole needs to be very clear as to its priorities.</p>
<p>Learning what your peers are doing always helps in this process and our Treasury Today Benchmarking Studies are proving very popular among the corporate treasury world, particularly the KPI section. As a corporate there is only one way to get the full results of this year’s surveys – participate. So if you wish to benchmark your KPIs against the industry and learn what else other companies are doing, please participate in these Studies.</p></div>

<p><em>Enhanced international communication skills can boost revenue, profits and market share for ambitious firms, as accessing and capitalising on overseas markets is recognised as playing a large part in the corporate growth agenda.</em></p>
</div>
</div><div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The world is changing. The ‘old’ industrial countries, especially those in Europe, are losing ground to the increasingly stronger competitors – and potential collaborators – from Asia and other emerging markets (EMs). Understanding regulatory requirements and standard operating procedures (SOPs) in international locations is essential for corporates expanding into overseas markets. But equally as important is the understanding of the critical role language and culture play in doing business with these new regions.</p>
<p>According to a 2012 survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 64% of businesses believe that language differences constrain their international expansion plans. Does this recognition mean that corporates are giving their time and resources to up-skilling their workforce in this respect? And, are the remaining third of those surveyed under the impression that language poses any sort of issue at all?</p>
<h3 id="speak-no-evil">Speak no evil</h3>
<p>Whether in the business or personal field, language is everything, according to Juan Pablo Cuevas, Head of Global Transaction Services (GTS) for Latin America and the Caribbean at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill). In Latin America, Portuguese is the predominant language, while Spanish is spoken in more countries (but with less people). A third language, French, is spoken in certain Caribbean countries. But even in the Spanish speaking countries, the meaning of certain words can be completely different in different countries, says Cuevas. “The word ‘giro’ (‘withdraw’ in English) means something completely different in Chile, versus Peru, Colombia or Mexico.” Effective communication is not just about learning the language – it’s about understanding the wider cultural context and being aware of possible misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Martin, Treasury and Credit Manager at Johnson Electric, agrees that – aside from the obvious linguistic differences – cultural variances can act as huge obstacles in communication, creating barriers that inhibit efficient workload management. “In my role, I deal with Asian, European and North American employees and business partners. As a Canadian, I tend to become informal very quickly, even upon meeting someone for the first time, but not everyone thinks that is appropriate behaviour.”</p>
<p>Martin observes a much more rigid structure when consulting with the company’s subsidiary in Hong Kong, for example, and even reports a certain amount of formality in European hubs, particularly in certain industries. “In France, for example, there is a sort of hierarchy as regards in-house working relationships – it would be inappropriate to be overly familiar or informal with someone on a different ‘level’. Many in the automotive sector prefer business dealings to be conducted in a specific, formal way.”</p>
<p>But the communication stumbling blocks concerned with establishing a treasury hub overseas or relocating an employee to another part of the world to share expertise or skill up may not only stem from within the office. In fact, more issues can arise when the working day ends.</p>
<p>Brazilian native João Paulo Faria, CFO at Microsoft, Chile, jumped at the opportunity to live in the US for a couple of years working for the company. As an American company, English is the standard language within Microsoft and Faria envisioned no issues as he felt comfortable conversing with native English-speaking colleagues on any business topic. “We all follow the same processes and regulations that are unique to Microsoft so the rituals, expressions, phrases and analyses are familiar with everyone, regardless of their mother tongue.</p>
<p>“However, when I was living in the US, even with the same colleagues I easily interacted with in-house, I faced problems when it came to communicating outside the office. There was no more familiar business lingo and it was the cultural aspects that caused the most problems. I spoke the same language but outside the office the cultural themes varied wildly – even when taking a trip to the shopping mall.”</p>
<h3 id="problem-solved">Problem solved?</h3>
<p>One of the key themes highlighted – and lingered upon – at World Trade Day, held in Denver in May this year, is the concept that being social in business operations is best practice rather than a passing fad. In that vein, the issue of conquering communication barriers was also discussed.</p>
<p>However, interestingly Cuevas doesn’t necessarily consider language a barrier in the corporate treasury world. “A derivative is a derivative no matter where you are in the world,” he says. “If you are trying to raise money in the capital markets, it is essentially the same thing in every country – the difference resides in effectively explaining in a local language what your objectives are so that you can achieve the desired results.”</p>
<p>Mikko Sopanen, Director, Global Finance and Treasury at LiteOnmobile, too, maintains that it is not entirely necessary for corporate treasury professionals to be exceptional English speakers. “Many successful international companies understand, recognise and fully accept that their official corporate language is ‘bad English’. The most professional person in finance and treasury might not be the best English speaker, but that shouldn’t be a big issue.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Cuevas does recognise the limitations of some companies which may not have a multilingual person at the HQ corporate treasury centre to speak to each relevant local bank to discern and make sense of the financial anomalies. BofA Merrill, for example, provides a shared service centre (SSC) in Miami that acts as a one-stop shop for the entire region. Cuevas explains: “If I have a client headquartered in Paris without a Portuguese-speaking person that can take care of operations in Brazil, the treasurer can call our SSC in Miami. The client can speak directly to our multilingual staff who will take care of all the required communications on behalf of the client.”</p>
<p>Another method of bypassing varying linguistic blocks globally is to embrace a certain company language as Microsoft has done, with its own phraseology and passion for acronyms, according to Faria. But even this method of communication can take some getting used to and it still does not address the cultural, more informal aspects that can help build solid business relationships. In this vein, Faria reports that it is now mandatory that new recruits for Microsoft subsidiaries have fluent written and spoken English. “Even if you don’t have to travel and are just reporting to someone in the same country, you still have to plan for the day that this information may be shared. Many years ago, some people in Microsoft were not fluent in English and they faced issues when they travelled to a worldwide meeting, for example, as they found it difficult to communicate with their industry peers.”</p>
<p>Martin agrees that, issue or not, this is an area that international companies are currently very aware of and which is being addressed. “In our company, we have SOPs on emails and communication in general. This covers how to construct an easy to decipher mail, what is the best way of getting a point across, etc. For smaller queries, rather than send an email, it is advised to just pick up the phone and clarify that the request or memo is received and understood.”</p>
<p>Combating these communication challenges can be very simple once an understanding of other cultures and a certain amount of patience is involved, believes Martin. Some people can get very agitated with certain communications – they might read too much into a certain phrase or the way in which a request is put across, she explains. “It can be quite helpful to know what the quirks and standards are of the countries and regions you will mainly be in contact with. In Hungary, for example, people use exclamation marks and capital letters as a matter of course, as a way of being friendly.”</p>
<p>Sopanen agrees, as he liaises with Chinese people, speaking Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien or other Chinese dialects as a mother tongue. “In the beginning I found their emails in English very commanding and written in a superior manner. But when I started studying Mandarin myself, I could understand the structure and the way Chinese is translated into English emails.”</p>
<h3 id="building-bridges-not-barriers">Building bridges, not barriers</h3>
<p>Global firms seem to be proactively looking for ways to strengthen their communications with their industry and business partners. Thomas Dippold, CFO at Semikron, is acutely aware of existing cultural and sociological factors in these relationships. “It is very important not to always write emails or forward policies electronically, but to visit the foreign companies and plants and develop personal contact. For example, we try to organise our annual finance meeting so that it doesn’t always take place at the HQ, ensuring each subsidiary feels valued and appreciated.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, an employee that speaks multiple languages will always be a plus, says Cuevas, and this skill is currently promoted in-house with corporate training programmes and externally with government schemes worldwide. “All of corporate America is encouraging not only the ‘cross-sell’, but also the ‘cross-cultural sell’. This means that if I have someone sitting in Iowa who wants to take on a new role in France, why not send them? In the long run, it’s going to greatly improve diversity from a business and managerial point of view.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you are trying to raise money in the capital markets, it is essentially the same thing in every country – the difference resides in effectively explaining in a local language what your objectives are so that you can achieve the desired results.”</p>
<p><cite>Juan Pablo Cuevas, Head of Global Transaction Services (GTS) for Latin America and the Caribbean at Bank of America Merrill Lynch</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fluently speaking two or three different languages can also be the differentiator for a finance or treasury professional in comparison to their peers when it comes to career growth, according to Faria. But there are, of course, exceptions when technical knowledge will trump the depth of the linguistic skill. Yet, Faria echoes the possibility for in-house training in this scenario. “If you need to hire someone with a very specific ability and you need that person regardless, you will consider investing some money on a rotational programme in order to bring this exceptional, ‘top’ talent up to a certain standard of English.”</p>
<p>Regardless of what rung the individual employee falls on this talent ladder, the importance of global exchanges and assignments even on a short-term basis is a practice that is seen as wholly positive by many forward-looking firms. The importance of understanding the culture in addition to learning the language is widely acknowledged across the board – as the end benefits for the company itself are also recognised, especially across such a rapidly changing landscape. Says Faria: “We have seen our customers and partners moving their people around, so this is a natural movement adding to diversity in the company to be better prepared, more flexible and react in a faster way to the changes we have seen in the world.</p>
<p>“We are moving very quickly in technology today – to the cloud, for example – so we need to constantly undergo business transformation and we need people from different cultures and a range of diversity to accelerate this transformation.”</p>
<h3 id="universal-language-of-technology">Universal language of technology</h3>
<p>Certain language solutions, and advances in language solutions (such as the new machine translation (MT) capabilities released by SDL earlier this year) can empower organisations to drive global revenue streams on the back of informed business strategy rather than assumptions or, even worse, inaccuracies. With these developments, the world has become a smaller place; social business and its related communications have allowed corporates to operate in a much more scalable and cost-effective manner. For example, electronic trading (e-trading) has decreased the need for very critical phone calls, which could be challenging due to the accent and dialect differences.</p>
<p>Faria reports that Microsoft has wholeheartedly followed this communication technology trend – and that they are not the only ones. “The CIOs of the majority of our global customers are confident that all of this technology, this unified communication including social networking, the cloud and big data, will soon be pervasive in all companies. Not only can embracing these advances save money, eg Skype and video conferences in lieu of travelling, but I can connect immediately with someone in Ireland or France, or even further afield. I can see these people, share information, and interact during conversations and presentations.”</p>
<p>European treasury is expected to be dominated by the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for much of the remainder of 2013, but positive growth opportunities in EMs – especially with the latest liberalisation of the renminbi (RMB) – have meant that expanding corporates are leaning on other forms of standardisations to allow for a seamless transition overseas. Corporate adoption of SWIFT and an increase in host-to-host communication using standardised connection within enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems may help with this migration, effectively removing the barriers language can create. Yet, there are still more helpful tools coming to market.</p>
<p>From a financial support perspective, BofA Merrill – for one – has recognised the importance of working in multiple languages, and Cuevas reports that the bank made significant investments in order to weave languages into its technology, systems and front desk, in order to make life easy for both corporates and itself. “Our proprietary system, CashPro Online, is a global application available in 11 languages – including Chinese characters and Japanese characters,” he explains.</p>
<p>“We try to make the life of the user easier – just like the globally accepted iPhone has done. We are doing the same from a technology perspective. If I put in a system that only operates in English, I am diminishing my capacity of capturing new, more global customers.”</p>
<p>But technology does not solve all communication problems, according to Martin, as exciting and progressive as it may seem. As she gets emails in so many different languages, one of Martin’s own favourite tools is Google translate – but she recognises the drawbacks, not only of Google’s imperfect device, but also of relying on a remote application. “Naturally, it is essential to be very simplistic in the way we express ourselves and communicate through text. Every phrase has to be extremely basic, clear and concise with no idioms or local terms used. It’s by no means ideal but because of the flood of mails I get from all over the globe, this way of operating is essential,” she says.</p>
<p>“Yet if I were embarking on building a new relationship, or wishing to communicate with someone at a more senior level, I would much prefer to meet face-to-face. Text can limit the scope of discussions but if you can see someone in a meeting, the tone and general argument or discussion is still comprehensible, even if the actual words are lost.”</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Roger Daltrey of the rock band, The Who, sang the legendary words “hope I die before I get old” back in 1965. He is now well into pensionable age (69 at the time of writing) but few would say he’s old per se; life expectancy (from birth) in developed countries with state-funded healthcare systems (such as Japan, Canada and the UK) is now more than 80, with lifespan (the figure calculated for individuals making it into early adulthood) increasingly seeing people live into their 90s.</p>
<p>With such a proportion of life spent in retirement, making financial provision for the later years of life becomes an increasingly important part of working life for many – rock stars included. One of the most common ways of approaching this is through a pension scheme.</p>
<p>Most pensions provided by companies throughout the world are funded schemes. These operate as funds established by the company and will be built up by regular contributions from both the company and its employees. A fund is normally structured as a trust (and thus managed by a trustee), so the assets are kept separate from those of the sponsor company.</p>
<h3 id="defined-benefit-or-defined-contribution">Defined benefit or defined contribution</h3>
<p>The majority of funded pensions provided by companies for employees are either defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) schemes.</p>
<p>DB schemes pay members a pre-defined pension on retirement. The amount is worked out as a proportion either of the average or the final salary of a member, the latter being the most common model. A member leaving a company will often find it administratively difficult to take the pension benefits they have accrued with them; but DB schemes remove the risk related to investment performance. Employers operating a DB scheme can, in lean times, find themselves with a serious funding shortfall: the deficit in UK pension schemes hit a record high of £312.1 billion in mid-2012.</p>
<p>In the last decade, many DB schemes have closed to new members: latest figures in the UK from the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) show just 13% of private sector DB schemes are open to new members (in 2005 it was 46%). DB obligations must still be met and NAPF figures show that more than two million workers are still members and the schemes pay out to over four million pensioners.</p>
<p>Most companies started offering DC schemes as a way of mitigating the risk of future pension scheme insolvency. The aim of the DC pension scheme is to give a lump sum on retirement. This is used to purchase an annuity which pays out on a regular basis for the rest of the member’s life. The value of the lump sum is worked out according to the employee’s contributions (personally and those made by the employer on their behalf) and by the performance of the pension fund as a whole, passing the risk of poor performance onto the members. But employers must commit to a defined level of contribution which must be paid irrespective of the financial health of the company.</p>
<p>Accrued assets for each member are easier to transfer should the member leave the company, but DC schemes typically require more effort (and more expense) on the part of the company in terms of administration than DB because each member has a tailored pension according to their individual circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="trustees">Trustees</h3>
<p>All schemes must remain solvent and must comply with the relevant regulations. This is one of the main tasks of the trustees of the scheme. According to the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), citing IAS19 accounting regulations, “the overriding duty of the trustee is to act in the best interests of scheme members and to be seen to do so”. In remaining at arms length from business decisions, trustees can influence the outcome of major commercial activities.</p>
<p>In July 2004, the trustees of the pension funds attached to UK-based retailer, WHSmith, forced private equity firm, Permira, to drop its plans to acquire the firm after failing to come to an agreement about how to fill the £250m gap in its pension fund. Trustees have been notably vocal in other M&amp;A deals, including Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury (Cadbury’s scheme had a deficit of £500m), the failed takeover of Marks &amp; Spencer by Philip Green (rumours of another attempt abound) and British Airways’ merger with Iberia (the BA pension scheme bearing an estimated £3.7 billion deficit at the time of the merger). In 2007, UK-based high street chemist Boots was acquired by private equity firm KKR, it was reported that there were ‘protracted and heated negotiations’ with the trustees to protect the pension fund.</p>

<p>The investment strategy of the fund is directed by the trustees. In their duty to maintain solvency and comply with regulations, trustees are required to mitigate risk by creating a broad investment portfolio. In taking the safe route, they often achieve relatively poor yield. Some firms took action against such low returns. In October 2001, the aforementioned Boots switched its £2.3 billion fund from equities to AAA/Aaa long dated sterling bonds, including 25% index-linked. In 2002 it increased its 25% index-linked content to 50%, executed through a series of interest rate swaps. That same year, the Financial Times ran the headline: “Bonds switch yields £700m gain for Boots”.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-rocks">On the rocks</h3>
<p>Liabilities have outstripped assets in DB schemes for a number of reasons, not least measures to aid the economy, such as quantitative easing (QE).</p>
<p>QE rounds, first applied in 2009, were intended to kick-start the economy. In the UK, more than £325 billion worth of gilts were bought, forcing down gilt yields and long-term interest rates. Whilst this was intended to drive investors seeking higher yield into riskier securities, it had the unintended consequence of hitting naturally conservative pension funds right where it hurts. “Businesses running final salary pensions are being clouted by QE,” said Joanne Segars, CEO of NAPF, in a statement. “Deficits that were already big now look even bigger because of its artificial distortions.” In the UK alone, NAPF estimates it has cost schemes more than £90 billion.</p>
<p>Even in better times, measures were taken that may not have been as generally helpful as intended. In 1997 the UK’s Advance Corporation Tax relief was scrapped. This meant pension funds were no longer able to reclaim tax on their dividend income, effectively lowering pension returns and reducing the incentive for corporates to put large contributions into their schemes.</p>
<p>The finger of accusation has also been pointed at actuarial miscalculations dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. Acting in tandem with existing regulations on producing valuations, actuaries seemingly took an overly optimistic view on the likely growth of pension investments – spurred on by buoyant stock markets – creating the impression amongst sponsoring companies that their liabilities were all taken care of. Many took ‘contribution holidays’ thinking they would simply catch up later. Boots, for example, had resumed contributions in 1999 after a long holiday, having adopted a market-based actuarial valuation of its fund.</p>
<p>In the UK, the government decided to tax pension fund surpluses in the late 1980s. According to Dr. Ros Altmann, Director General of the over-50s holidays and insurance specialist, Saga Group, these surpluses had built up not just because equities were fruitful, but also because there were more people contributing than retiring. The surplus, she wrote, should have been left to accumulate in order to take care of leaner times and to counter the point when the number of people retiring started rising.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is now a demographic shift to contend with. Where once people may have been expected to live another 15 to 20 years after retirement, now it is more like 25 to 30 years. Pension funds will struggle to cope.</p>
<p>The age of receipt of state pension can be raised to match changes of longevity, as it has in many countries including the UK and France, and the US is currently debating the issue. Plans are also afoot to bring private sector pensions in line by adjusting the benefit structure and UK retailer, Tesco, is noted for linking its scheme for new members to longevity.</p>
<h3 id="pension-fund-legislation-update">Pension fund legislation update</h3>
<p>In recent years there has been a general tightening of regulations governing pensions, with several new pieces of legislation being introduced covering areas such as mandatory indexation, re-valuation and spouse benefits, which together have increased sponsor liabilities (some NAPF members report increases of up to 30%).</p>
<h4 id="ias-19">IAS 19</h4>
<p>In the preparation of accounts, International Accounting Standards (IAS) 19 covers employee benefits such as wages and salaries as well as pensions. It requires the assets and liabilities of a scheme to be noted on the balance sheet. DC accounting is relatively simple in that contributions and pay outs are recorded as they take place. DB accounting is more demanding as the value of the fund’s future liabilities are, at best, an estimate. IAS specifies the use of actuarial calculation methods to arrive at an appropriate figure.</p>
<p>As such, IAS 19 asks for DB assets and liabilities to be recorded at ‘fair value’. In terms of assets, market-based assumptions are most commonly used. Liabilities are more complex as they are calculated by discounting anticipated future outgoings of the scheme by the current return on high quality (normally AA-rated) corporate bonds.</p>
<h4 id="solvency-ii">Solvency II</h4>
<p>Solvency II, due to go live in January 2014, is intended to standardise EU insurance regulation. It covers the level of capital that insurance companies need to hold to reduce the risk of insolvency. Imposing insurance standards onto DB schemes could have a negative effect on the liquidity and credit profiles of those still running these schemes.</p>
<p>Another component of Solvency II for pension funds is the deployment of the ‘holistic balance sheet’ (HBS). HBS is intended to iron out the differences across schemes in Europe and offer easier insight into, and comparison of, a fund’s long-term financial position. The goal is to itemise and account for all the fund’s assets and its liabilities.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-not-to-be-cheerful">Reasons not to be cheerful</h3>
<p>According to the NAPF, the EU’s assessment of Solvency II-type rules for pension funds (under the auspices of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and its Quantitative Impact Study), is “seriously flawed”. NAPF’s Seggars has commented that HBS is not a sound analytical framework for assessing the strength of pension schemes because it does not take adequate account of the “complex structures of many large, multinational companies and their pension schemes”.</p>
<p>Whilst it might be appropriate for insurance firms, Mel Duffield, Head of Research and Strategic Policy for NAPF, argues that most occupational pension schemes are already backed by an employer covenant indicating an ability to fund the scheme and underwrite investment risk. There is, she adds, also a compulsory insurance system (the Pension Protection Fund) which is funded by risk-based levies on all UK-based DB schemes. Adding strict requirements around what discount rates have to be used and what assets have to be held could see DB schemes facing an extra £300-£400 billion hit, she comments. As Solvency II rolls out over the next ten to 15 years, she feels it will “go against the government’s growth agenda”, as corporates needing to hold the extra funding will do so in safe but low yield assets such as fixed income and gilts, in order to be seen to be sufficiently de-risked. “When there’s a drop in gilt yields an employer can be looking at millions of pounds being added to their deficit overnight. If you’re forcing the corporate to put more cash into the pension scheme in the short term that is obviously cash not being invested elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Not only that, notes Duffield, but the legacy of DB may take another 60 years before all the benefits accrued in those schemes are paid out. In the meantime, corporates will probably be looking at managing “a whole series of pension offerings”. When auto-enrolment was introduced by the UK government in October 2012 (to ensure most people have access to a pension plan), some firms will have to create additional schemes on top of their existing DB and DC schemes to cater for the new influx of members. This could create “significant levels of administration” for companies.</p>
<p>An observed effect of this is that DC schemes can often become “a bit of an afterthought”, simply because they do not carry the same risk for the employer as DB, in which trustee time tends to be absorbed by the funding issues and the required level of interaction with the regulators.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges, therefore, is to reduce time taken in dealing with those issues. Tom Wood, Head of Professional Services Industry at Barclays, believes that it is essential for a trustee to grasp as soon as possible what is going on in the markets in terms of regulation and key risks, and to consider the resources needed to manage these changes. “Because of the extra challenges trustees have to deal with, our aim is to provide them with slicker systems and processes to carry out their day-to-day tasks, to give them time back,” he says. The bank’s insight puts trustees in a position to stop fire-fighting and start taking “a more considered approach”.</p>
<p>Creating a high level awareness of impending issues and pointing the way to the appropriate specialist advisors is a vital part of the role for Wood’s team of directors. Discussion may, for example, concern how regulations will impact upon the way in which funds are reported at the P&amp;L level, or provide commentary on how volatility in the Eurozone will pan out. However, he says, there is “a real challenge in predicting what the potential shortfall would look like in any DB scheme”, and so direct bank-led finance solutions are an option, such as a letter of credit (LC).</p>
<p>Dealing with investment strategy is difficult because much of the regulatory pressure centres on fund de-risking, but at the same time the fund needs to get the best return. NAPF’s Duffield notes that in the past few years there has been “a big shift away from equities into fixed income”, and where speculation that the bond bubble “might be about to burst”, some funds have been looking for other growth assets (stopping short of a shift back to equities).</p>
<p>In terms of the shift from DB to DC schemes, the trend will continue, says Wood. As the general level of awareness of the important issues necessarily increases, so some trustees are becoming “a little more sophisticated” in the management of their funds. By putting in place “early warning” trigger points which reflect market changes, he believes they are better able to foresee the risk of those changes and to take appropriate action.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>With concerns over a ‘hard landing’ still weighing on the world’s second largest economy, many multinationals will be wary of the impact that a Chinese downturn might have on their operations. But how should a corporate approach hedging their FX exposure to a currency such as the renminbi when the PBoC still has strict controls in place? Here we explore one of the main tools that corporate hedgers use for getting around convertibility restrictions – NDFs.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-forwards">What are forwards?</h3>
<p>When a company requires a certain amount of foreign currency at a certain point in the future, it faces the risk that the exchange rate may move unfavourably in the meantime. In order to mitigate this risk, it can – subject to exchange control regulations – purchase the currency using a spot contract. However, this will tie up the company’s liquidity until the currency is actually needed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it can – again, subject to exchange control regulations – enter into an agreement known as a forward outright, to buy the foreign currency at a specified point in the future, at a price fixed today.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the forward prices are based on the current spot rate and the interest rates on the two currencies in question. The cost of entering into a forward contract is the same as if a company were to purchase the currency in a spot transaction and then invest the currency until it was needed.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-ndfs">What are NDFs?</h3>
<p>Large-scale NDF trading began in the early 1990s in Latin America, but had its roots in Australia in the 1970s and 80s. An NDF is a type of forward derivatives contract used for trading where one of the currencies is non-convertible – that is it cannot, due to local restrictions, be traded freely in the foreign exchange markets with other currencies. Non-convertible currencies are typically found in emerging market nations, where the government may put them in place to protect their economies from speculative attack.</p>
<p>One key distinction between an NDF and a traditional forward contract is that upon maturity NDFs are paid in cash rather than settled through physical delivery of the underlying.</p>
<p>Trading in the NDF market, because of the legal restrictions, takes place in offshore centres. The market for NDFs is typically divided by regions – Latin American currencies are typically traded in New York, Singapore and to a lesser extent Hong Kong tend to dominate trading in Asian NDFs, while London spans both of these markets. The key thing to remember about NDFs is that no exchange of the principal sums takes place – the only money that changes hands is the difference between the NDF rate and the prevailing market spot rate. This is settled in a ‘hard’ or fully convertible currency – usually US dollars.</p>
<p>Daily NDF volumes are still very small in comparison to traditional FX products, around 3% of daily FX volumes according to data. NDF markets are usually bigger in those currencies that have considerable cross-border capital movements but still have convertibility restrictions in place, such as South Korea. Conversely, in countries where adjustments to the regulatory regime have allowed greater convertibility, NDF markets have over time, dissipated. Australia, for instance, also had an NDF market that evolved in the early 1970s in the presence of currency restrictions. These restrictions were removed by the authorities when the Australian dollar was floated in 1983, removing the need for a non-deliverable market for the currency.</p>
<p>Demand for NDFs has increased substantially in recent years. According to Alfred Schorno, Managing Partner at the multi-bank FX platform 360T, there are two main reasons that explain the recent growth in NDF volumes. Firstly, the fact that NDFs are being used more frequently by corporate hedgers is most likely a reflection of the increasing importance of emerging markets in the global economy.</p>
<p>Secondly, speculative investors, who remain the most active players in the market, are moving away from major currencies because of the lower levels of volatility which have been witnessed in these assets of late, says Schorno. “When we look at institutional volumes, bank-to-bank business, hedge funds, macro funds – due to lesser volatility in major currencies lots of people have been driven to deal in currencies with more volatility, and the NDF market is definitely a playground for that.”</p>
<p>This shift, he believes, may have been accelerated by technological developments. “A lot of market makers are quoting NDF currencies by machine nowadays,” he says. It’s no longer like the old days, or even five years ago. With manual quoting you had to wait quite a while to get a good market overview, nowadays for currency pairs like Brazil, China, Malaysia, you can easily get quoted by machines in seconds. And that, I think, has helped volumes to grow.”</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits">The benefits</h3>
<p>So why should corporate treasurers be interested in NDFs? Here is a summary of the instrument’s key benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>A tool for hedging.</h5>
<p>An NDF can provide you with protection from adverse movements on foreign exchange markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A way round capital restrictions.</h5>
<p>NDFs can be purchased where restrictions prohibit the physical delivery of the currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Flexibility.</h5>
<p>The maturity date and the contract amount can be tailored to meet your particular needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>But, as with any derivative, there are considerations to bear in mind too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Opportunity loss.</h5>
<p>You could miss out on the opportunity to benefit from favourable movements in foreign exchange markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Early termination expense.</h5>
<p>Although a trader can vary or terminate an NDF early a cost will be incurred by doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Counterparty risk.</h5>
<p>As is the case with many financial markets products, you risk exposure to market exchange rate fluctuations if your provider defaults and is unable to fulfil its obligations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, NDFs are an over-the-counter or OTC derivative product, as opposed to an exchange traded product. This can make it difficult to find accurate data regarding volumes of contracts traded.</p>

<h3 id="regulatory-changes-an-uncertain-future-for-ndfs">Regulatory changes: an uncertain future for NDFs?</h3>
<p>In recent years, NDFs have become embroiled in attempts by US regulators to reform the world of OTC derivatives which for a long time has existed in the shadows. The proposals, which at the time of writing have yet to come into effect, are aimed at reducing the systemic risks associated with derivatives and address concerns regarding a lack of market transparency. The US legislation stipulates that NDFs in Latin American currencies should be moved to clearing houses and even exchanges and subject to trade reporting, a migration which some clearing houses, such as the CME group, have already begun ahead of implementation of the Dodd-Frank mandates.</p>
<p>However, the proposals have proved incredibly contentious. Some analysts argue that the changes will significantly drive up trading costs. While conforming to the regulatory changes is unlikely to trouble larger organisations, the inevitable costs that the migration involves could, so the argument goes, squeeze smaller players out of the marketplace. If that scenario was to play out then one obvious consequence would be a drop in volumes, which would translate into reduced liquidity.</p>
<p>This is far from being a consensus view – some industry experts, such as 360T’s Schorno believe that the forthcoming changes will have little impact upon overall market volumes for NDFs. “360T is one of the multi-bank portals which has quite big volumes in NDFs which have built up over the last three or four years,” he says. “During this period, NDF volumes have increased 200%-300% year on year. And since the announcement of the Dodd-Frank proposals volumes we have not seen any downturn.”</p>
<p>Despite regulatory changes, corporates will still need to hedge their exposures to the currencies of emerging market economies and while exchange controls remain in place the NDF will continue to be the instrument of choice for carrying out this task, says Schorno.</p>
<p>One of the other issues arising from the Dodd-Frank proposals Schorno highlights, is the possibility that institutional investors will move to areas beyond the jurisdiction of the new Dodd-Frank regulations to avoid the additional reporting requirements that the US market will be subject to. “Market makers might transfer their business into areas where they don’t have to comply with Dodd-Frank and other related regulation. And the question is could there be a shift in terms of volumes from existing markets to places like the Middle East and the Far East, due to the regulations coming into force?” If this happens then corporates, he argues, may have a problem. Conversely, institutional investors, who are not bound to particular booking centres, will have no issues following the liquidity, especially in the era of electronic portals. “But for corporates”, he says, “this is not so easy”.</p>
<p>This is the main reason why Schorno believes that there should be an exemption for NDFs under the Dodd-Frank regulatory proposals (this is looking unlikely but it is yet to be confirmed at the time of writing), particularly with respect to corporate hedgers. “I would strongly vote for exempting corporates who use NDFs”, he says. “It would have totally the wrong effect if corporates were to stop hedging and therefore increase their risk on their balance sheets – because the regulatory issue is that there should be more transparency and therefore less risk – not more.”</p>
<p>Outside of the US the picture is no clearer. Dodd-Frank is US legislation and the proposals only have bearing on markets that reside within the jurisdiction of US law. Derivatives, including NDFs, sold in non-US financial centres such as Hong Kong or London will therefore not be subject to the mandates contained in the Dodd-Frank. But the EU has, however, brought forward its own proposals for regulatory reform of the derivatives marketplace – The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).</p>
<p>The proposals, like in the US, have not passed to the implementation stage unopposed and legislators are currently considering whether to introduce a Dodd-Frank style exemption for FX forwards.</p></div>
