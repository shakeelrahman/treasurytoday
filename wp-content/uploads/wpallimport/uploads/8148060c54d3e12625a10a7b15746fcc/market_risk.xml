<p><em>Didi’s Wall Street dreams falling by the wayside and the ride hailing company’s decision to list in Hong Kong shows decoupling between China and the US gathering pace. Meanwhile, other sectors of the Chinese economy like healthcare are next in line for the government’s regulatory crackdown as investor, bank and corporate risk spikes.</em></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Chinese ride hailing app Didi Chuxing’s announcement at the end of last year that it will delist from the New York Stock Exchange and relist in Hong Kong has repercussions well beyond the fortunes of those who bought into the US$4.4bn IPO five months ago. “After a careful study, the company will start delisting on the New York Stock Exchange immediately, and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong,” wrote Didi on its verified account on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like platform in the country.</p>
<p>The decision is a consequence of relentless regulatory scrutiny from Chinese authorities, including a wide-ranging government investigation into Didi’s cyber-security practices. The Chinese government wants to regulate new, online tech companies that have escaped traditional regulatory frameworks around business rules and consumer protection, argues Fraser Howie, author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise in an interview from Singapore. The clampdown was first witnessed in the halt to Ant Group’s dual listing on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in November 2020.</p>
<p>Nor does the Chinese government want foreign investors to have the granular knowledge of Chinese companies’ customer base – Didi’s mapping data, for example – that is granted by modern technology. And the pressure on Chinese firms to delist isn’t just coming from Beijing. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has drawn up rules that would allow it to delist Chinese firms that refuse to open their books over three straight years to US regulators – China has long rejected US audits of its firms, citing national security concerns.</p>
<p>Today’s backdrop has put the wind up Chinese NYSE IPO hopefuls, all shelving their plans to follow in the footsteps of companies like Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and NetEase and list on the most sought-after global stage. And although none of these big Chinese names have yet to mirror Didi’s decision and pull out of New York, everyone is watching the next move and manifestation of China’s gradual decoupling from US capital markets. “The West got it wrong; China is closing down once again,” predicts Howie.</p>
<h4 id="long-wait">Long wait</h4>
<p>At the very least Chinese companies hoping to float in the US are in for a long wait for further clarification of the rules. Companies still wanting to list will then face rigorous scrutiny and regulatory clearance from different government agencies and authorities. “The State Council’s special regulations on overseas equity fundraising and listing will be amended; the responsibilities of domestic industry supervisors will be clarified, and cross-departmental supervisory coordination will be strengthened,” lists Bruce Pang, Head of Research at investment bank China Renaissance, who predicts a much more difficult climate for Chinese companies hoping to raise funds overseas ahead. Looking to the future he says the NYSE listing door may open slightly, but only to small and mid-cap companies in less controversial industries and low-profile sectors holding less sensitive data.</p>
<p>Positively, he hopes that investors and companies’ concerns will be allayed by clearer communication. He expects Chinese authorities to better manage the pace and intensity of the regulatory campaign; communicating with the market about the motives behind the regulatory push and telegraphing future regulatory hotspots. Besides, the Chinese government is still keen for local companies to tap alternative sources of finance. China’s state-controlled local banking system needs to be freed up to service SOEs and the “commanding heights of the economy,” says Howie.</p>
<h4 id="homecoming-in-hong-kong">Homecoming in Hong Kong</h4>
<p>Didi had decided to swap New York for Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong Stock Exchange my not provide the growth capital or platform for expansion Chinese companies seek. Initial public offerings in Hong Kong raised less than US$26bn in 2021, down 10% compared with 2020, according to data from Dealogic. By comparison, global IPO fundraising jumped 75% in 2021 compared to 2020, with deals in New York alone rising to about US$300bn.</p>
<p>Hong Kong will appeal to companies wanting to raise foreign currency capital and the region has deepened its capital market reforms: valuations, analyst coverage and liquidity have all improved. The Hong Kong Exchange recently announced consultation results regarding further facilitating dual primary and secondary listing in Hong Kong. “We expect the listing requirements to become more flexible and convenient, spurring a recovery in sentiment with a strong potential pipeline of Hong Kong listings ahead,” says Pang.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong may struggle to draw the deep pools of foreign capital Chinese companies seek. Foreign investors remain wary of Hong Kong’s different rules and weak disclosure. For example, demand for listed stocks could be dampened by rules or conditions that make critical research difficult. “Hong Kong could become a dumping ground,” says Howie who observes that Hong Kong’s Zero Covid policy and strict quarantine rules will continue to hinder investors’ ability to travel to the region and conduct due diligence on Chinese companies listing on the exchange. “It’s difficult to build a financial centre if you can’t get in or out,” he says. “It’s a lazy idea to think that Hong Kong will become the replacement for listing in NYSE.”</p>
<p>Limits to listing in Hong Kong, and unable to expand their capital base, brand and reach through the US, Chinese companies will have to rely on domestic investors on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Most of China’s biggest tech companies still derive the bulk of their revenues from customers in China, and these businesses will continue to thrive, says Howie. Listing on the mainland has also grown more appealing because of recent reforms in China’s A shares, adds Pang, “A-share market reform is helping to facilitate listings with streamlined processes and more flexible options for companies with key technologies and market recognition.”</p>
<p>However, Chinese tech companies’ ability to expand geographically and compete internationally has been crimped. Going forward this means their valuations will be more aligned to a utility than the explosive growth profiles they could have had. “Chinese firms will need to rely primarily on organic business growth or domestic markets to fund their expansion. A decade ago, listing on a foreign exchange would have been the goal of many IPO-bound mainland firms, but this has certainly been de-prioritised by regulators,” says Zennon Kapron, Director of Kapronasia, a financial technology research and consulting firm. “Longer-term, it may actually inhibit growth and kill the golden goose that has been such a big part of China’s international story.”</p>
<h4 id="not-just-tech">Not just tech</h4>
<p>The government’s crackdown on the country’s US$100bn-a-year tutoring industry shows its regulatory sweep goes beyond thwarting overseas listings, the tech sector and business models around customer data. Chinese companies across all sectors face a new perilous regulatory landscape. “In our view, regulators look likely to crackdown on anything relating to anti-trust, abuse of dominance, monopolisation, M&amp;A, controversial industries and juvenile protection,” lists Pang, adding that financial holding companies and variable interest entity (VIE) structures are also in regulators’ sights. A VIE involves creating an overseas holding company that allows investors to own a stake in a Chinese company that would otherwise be difficult because of restrictions in the mainland. Companies like Didi, Alibaba, Pinduoduo and JD.com have all benefited from the system.</p>
<p>Healthcare groups targeting the middle class with prescription drugs and services is the next sector most likely to see the government come in over the top. President Xi wants to support moderate wealth for all under the banner of “common prosperity,” yet the health-care industry is one of the country’s so-called “three big mountains” (alongside education and real estate) where spiralling prices are posing obstacles to affordable living. “As well as house prices and education, China is struggling to regulate healthcare fees,” says Pang. “My guess is healthcare will be next to reduce inequality and maintain social stability because China’s medical bills are rising steeply, outpacing government insurance provision.” It holds damaging repercussion for healthcare groups, flags Howie. “Will they allow healthcare companies to set prices, or force them to act as a utility just delivering a service?”</p>
<h4 id="banks">Banks</h4>
<p>Banks that have tapped into lucrative IPO business will also start to feel the pinch. “As the majority of Chinese IPOs aimed for US exchanges are either suspended or diverted to other venues, some banks’ underwriting fees have been axed,” says Pang, adding that company valuations (and potential fees) are now vastly different. “Chinese firms are tempering their expectations for valuations amid regulatory overhang.” Meanwhile foreign banks get very little business from China’s onshore IPO pipeline where deals are dominated by mainland lenders like Citic, the state-owned financial services group that oversaw 17% of a record US$65bn in fundraising this year from new listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to Dealogic data.</p>
<p>Banks, investors and corporates are only just beginning to feel the effects of decoupling in a sweeping reminder of the power of China’s communist party, concludes Howie.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As a region, Asia Pacific is nothing if not diverse. Home to 60% of the world’s population, the region includes a heterogenous collection of countries, currencies, cultures and languages. And where treasurers are concerned, the region’s diversity presents considerable challenges in the form of diverse tax regimes, regulatory requirements and liquidity management practices – alongside attractive opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>“The Asian markets present growth opportunity to most businesses and industries,” says Adesh Sarup, Head of TB, North Asia, ANZ Institutional. “The region consists of 25+ different markets, c. 57% of the world’s population and consumers – including some of the largest economies in the world, together with some of the most rapidly emerging. It is also a highly attractive region for manufacturing and procurement.”</p>
<p>Harnessing these growth opportunities has, of course, long been a focus for companies in the region. “Growth remains a critical objective for most companies, even though some Asian economies are showing signs of slowing down,” says Faisal Ameen, head of Asia Pacific Global Transaction Services, Bank of America (BofA), adding that companies are keen to leverage Asia’s expansion to drive growth in their operations globally. “They are also looking at repositioning their businesses in the wake of a shift in trade corridors, relationships and exploration of new supply chain locations,” he notes.</p>
<p>“While Asia’s growth may have slowed as compared to a few years back, it remains a key growth driver for most global MNCs,” Ameen continues, noting that the World Economic Forum (WEF) has predicted that Asia’s GDP will overtake the rest of the world combined in 2020. “The key difference is companies are now starting to look beyond China and India at some of the emerging economies like Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Ameen predicts that companies headquartered in Asia will continue to look for growth opportunities within the region, and even more so in other parts of the world. “This trend underlines the continued emergence of Asia MNCs,” he says.</p>
<p>Sarup, likewise, notes that the last decade has seen a growing list of Asia MNCs, which “often have the advantage of understanding the Asian markets better”. He adds, “Many such companies in Asia are also evolving their respective treasury and supply chain models to enable further growth.”</p>
<h4 id="barriers-to-growth">Barriers to growth</h4>
<p>But while companies continue to focus on growth opportunities, it’s also clear that economic conditions have moved on since the very high growth rates experienced by China and India in previous years. In India, a decline in consumer spending and a reduction in factory output contributed to a reduction of GDP growth to 4.5% in the quarter ending September 2019 – the first time in seven years that GDP growth has fallen below 5%. Meanwhile, the China-US trade war has contributed to a reduction of GDP growth in both economies, with China’s GDP growth slowing to 6.1% last year, down from 6.6% in 2018.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the prospect of slowing growth in emerging markets – or indeed a global recession – is one that treasurers are keeping an eye on. In a survey carried out at the 2019 J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific CFO and Treasurers Forum in Shanghai, respondents identified top risk factors as a potential global recession (30%), the impact of global tariffs (27%) and an emerging markets slowdown (24%). Other concerns included cyber threats (10%) and the impact of Brexit and the future of the Eurozone (9%).</p>
<p>More recently, economists have downgraded 2020 growth forecasts in light of the current outbreak of the new coronavirus, Covid-19, with some predicting China’s first quarter growth could drop to as low as 3%. Other economies expected to be affected by the outbreak include Australia, which is also counting the cost of the recent devastating wildfires.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">US-China trade war: where next?</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The 18-month trade war between the US and China has been a key topic for treasurers in Asia and beyond. Since January 2018, the US has imposed or proposed tariffs on US$550bn of Chinese goods, while China has retaliated with tariffs on US$185bn of US products.</p>
<p>President Trump began imposing tariffs in January 2018. Initially focusing on washing machines and solar panels, the tariffs rapidly multiplied to include steel and aluminium. China responded with tariffs on US goods, ranging from soya beans to whisky. In July 2018, the US announced further tariffs on US$200bn of Chinese imports. Despite the two countries calling a truce in December 2018, last year brought additional tariffs alongside the continuing negotiations.</p>
<p>On January 15th 2020, a possible breakthrough came with the US and China signing the Phase One Deal. Under the terms of the deal, the US has committed to halving the tariff rate imposed on US$120bn of Chinese goods in September 2019, with other tariffs to be potentially removed under a Phase Two Deal. Other tariffs that had been due to come into effect have also been suspended. China, meanwhile, has agreed to increase purchases of US goods and services by US$200bn over the coming two years. Other conditions include restrictions on currency devaluations and increased protections for intellectual property.</p>
<p>The actions agreed in the Phase One Deal are already under way, with China halving tariffs on US goods worth US$75bn in February. But while the agreement has been welcomed, a White House official has warned that the current outbreak of Covid-19 could have an impact on China’s planned purchases of US agricultural products this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, companies have been taking action to protect themselves from global supply chain disruptions. Thirty-four percent of respondents to a poll carried out at the 2019 J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific CFO and Treasurers Forum in Shanghai said they were exploring price options with suppliers, while 32% said they were sourcing alternative supplies. Fifteen percent said they are shifting production from China to other countries.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="shifting-sands">Shifting sands</h4>
<p>Since the term BRIC was first coined to encompass the fast-growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China (and later expanded to BRICS to include South Africa) numerous other acronyms have been deployed to group other emerging markets together, such as CIVETs (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt and Turkey) and TICKs (Taiwan, India, China and South Korea). There continues to be considerable interest in pinpointing markets which have the potential for rapid growth – although different companies will have different priorities when it comes to identifying the most interesting markets.</p>
<p>ANZ’s Sarup says that despite macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions playing some part in tactical activity shifts, “each market presents growth opportunities that will be of interest to different industries and businesses. Our view is that there are clusters of markets that will be ‘hotspots’ depending on the business or the industry.”</p>
<p>Among the factors contributing to this are dependency on technology and changing consumer behaviour, including the development of online marketplaces, demand for faster and more secure digital/internet capability and changing consumer choices, with a greater focus on healthier and more sustainable food, Sarup says.</p>
<p>Where specific markets are concerned, BofA’s Ameen notes that shifting supply chains are supporting steady trade growth in Southeast Asia. “The region continues to develop increasing manufacturing capacity, infrastructure and talent to support their growth,” he says. “Vietnam and the Philippines in particular are expected to emerge as key beneficiaries.”</p>
<p>Ameen also says that India will be interesting to watch this year. “Growth is slowing and inflation is rising, but at the same time, there is a shift towards increased manufacturing capacity and expertise,” he says. “This could drive corporates to look to India as they consider continued diversification away from China for their supply chains.”</p>
<p>Technology is another major consideration when it comes to growth. According to Ameen, the rise of the digital economy and ever-expanding coverage of unserved populations will also be a key consideration – “particularly in markets such as India and Indonesia, which have a huge population of the middle class entering the global economy.”</p>
<h4 id="complex-landscape">Complex landscape</h4>
<p>Alongside the opportunities presented by high-growth markets, Asia is also characterised by considerable diversity. As Jason Tan, Regional Head of International Countries, Global Liquidity and Cash Management at HSBC observes, some say the diversity across Asia does not provide a consistent way to do business – “but Asia as a market is very different from its more established European and American counterparts – notably, in terms of its growth stage.”</p>
<p>Tan points out that the diversity of Asia Pacific allows international corporates with a global footprint and an in-depth knowledge of regulators and market practices to support the growth of this dynamic region. “This is particularly relevant to cash management, where that insight is there to help navigate the diversity, including local regulations and local payment infrastructures,” he adds.</p>
<p>For treasurers, the region’s diverse market conditions and business practices bring numerous challenges. For one thing, the region encompasses a multitude of regulatory environments, with different rules on areas such as accounting, tax and know your customer (KYC), as well as industry-specific regulations. What’s more, the pace of regulatory change can be very rapid in some markets, meaning that companies need to work proactively to stay on top of upcoming developments.</p>
<p>Likewise, where liquidity management is concerned, treasurers operating in Asia will find the complex landscape can make it difficult to gain visibility over cash in different countries. What’s more, different countries will have different rules about cash management structures such as physical and notional cash pooling, making it difficult to consolidate cash balances and thereby reduce borrowing or maximise interest. In more highly regulated jurisdictions, treasurers will need to address the challenges brought by trapped cash.</p>
<p>Other challenges faced by treasurers in the region include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Numerous currencies and diverse hedging techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The adoption of real-time payments, with varying levels of maturity in different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade-related risks and shifting relationships as a result of geopolitical considerations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these obstacles, Sarup points out that treasurers also have to navigate the risk of sudden business changes, such as adjustments to the business model as a result of geopolitical factors. “Another example is the risk imposed by cyber threats and events – both these can vary widely in different Asian markets,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="overcoming-the-obstacles">Overcoming the obstacles</h4>
<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of steps that treasurers can take to address these issues. For one thing, technology can be a powerful tool when it comes to achieving greater efficiency across the region. Vijay Shankar, Head of TB ASEAN &amp; India and Head of Regional Sales, ANZ Institutional, says that treasurers can mitigate challenges “by implementing an effective treasury management system (TMS) platform by integrating real-time API feeds from ERPs and banking platforms.”</p>
<p>Ameen, meanwhile, argues that technology “is no longer an enabler” but has become a key driver behind businesses, citing the adoption of API technology to connect treasury with bank systems for real-time interaction and exchange of information. “Companies can leverage technology such as AI and machine learning to drive automation,” he says. “This reduces dependency on human intervention, and with digitalisation, processes can be shifted across borders more easily.”</p>
<p>Other strategies treasurers can use to overcome the challenges of Asia Pacific’s diverse landscape include:</p>

<p><strong>Stay informed.</strong> BofA’s Ameen says treasurers should look to their banking partners as a good source of information, alongside industry sources such as news outlets, associations, forums, journals and newsletters. “Besides regulations and local practices, banks can also provide case studies which provide useful insights into how other companies are managing similar issues,” he says.</p>
<p>Shankar, meanwhile, notes that treasurers have multiple sources to consult. As well as banking partners, he cites companies’ empanelled legal/tax advisors, well-established consulting companies, government and industry trade associations, companies’ country CFOs and company secretaries, consulting websites – “and finally, practical experience of being in the industry from local management.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build strong bank relationships.</strong> Ameen points out that a company’s choice of banking partner is important when it comes to addressing the challenges, noting that treasurers “can leverage the expertise of their banking partners, who can provide insight to industry and market trends such as cyber-security and fraud trends.” In addition, he says, treasurers should aim to understand their banks’ technology and innovation roadmaps for the next five years “to see how they can harness emerging technologies to help them stay on top of changes.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Ameen notes that treasurers should remain flexible, “so they can respond quickly to any changes in the regulatory environment and market, given the uncertain macro backdrop.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hedge effectively.</strong> Shankar says that treasurers can leverage low-cost funding options by “hedging base currency with effective deposit optimiser solutions offered by banks.” He also notes that adopting “optimum and effective hedging solutions” can address short to medium-term geopolitical uncertainties.</p>

<p>Given the diverse conditions of Asia Pacific, there are a number of characteristics that a successful treasury team is likely to possess. BofA’s Ameen notes that agility is key: “Today, changes are taking place at a faster pace. It is critical for treasurers to stay ahead and act quickly to manage the changes that would impact their businesses.” He also emphasises the importance of having a clear roadmap of the treasury’s role, clearly articulated and supported by senior management, as well as the adoption of technology to automate and reduce manual tasks.</p>
<p>ANZ’s Shankar, meanwhile, says the following steps may help treasurers navigate Asian markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having an efficient shared service centre to drive a consistent, accurate and standardised approach to processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a regional treasury centre in Singapore or Hong Kong to manage liquidity pools and implement a hedging strategy to mitigate risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing optimum cost-effective working capital access to operating entities in Asia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a regional multi-currency long-term borrowing programme to complement group capital induction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging bank-agnostic technology such as SWIFTNet, APIs, host-to-host connectivity and RPA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It’s clear that Asia Pacific is characterised by both attractive growth opportunities and the challenges brought by the region’s diverse countries, currencies and regulatory regimes. For corporate treasurers, taking advantage of the former will also involve spending time addressing the latter – but by harnessing opportunities for centralisation, building robust relationships and harnessing technology effectively, treasurers will be well placed to overcome the challenges.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Commodity prices are often characterised by a high degree of volatility, and any fluctuation in the price of a commodity has the potential to affect a business’s production costs, its pricing and its earnings – not to mention the availability of credit.</p>
<p>There are a number of inherent risks for any business operating in today’s commodity markets. For both producers and consumers, the most important is price risk – the uncertainty which surrounds future commodity prices.</p>
<p>Recent research by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) found that, between September 2008 and September 2018, the average spot price of Brent crude oil fluctuated between US$125 and US$31 per barrel. In the same period, the average monthly price of copper at the London Metal Exchange fluctuated between US$9,900 and US$3,000 per ton.</p>
<p>Price isn’t the only risk associated with commodities. Agricultural yields, for example, are subject to production risk, whilst the delivery of commodities from producers to traders, and then on to consumers, is associated with transportation risk. Throw in counterparty risk of a supplier’s creditworthiness, currency risk and climate-related risk, and the task of managing commodity risk is anything but straightforward.</p>
<p>“The impact that this can have can be very dramatic – particularly in terms of credit risk,” says Ian Tobin, Head of Credit Risk at Brady plc. “Apart from settlement risk, the real concern is replacement cost – the loss associated with replacing the transaction with another counterparty at a worse price if the original counterpart defaults.”</p>
<p>Any volatility in commodity prices means that it is essential for any business reliant on a specific product to manage the impact of potential price fluctuations across its entire value chain. Having an effective commodity risk management process in place is therefore the only way for a business to manage both its financial performance and its overall profitability.</p>
<h3 id="fx-and-commodity-risk">FX and commodity risk</h3>
<p>But commodity price volatility can impact different businesses in different ways, depending on where they lie on the value chain. A UK airline dependent on the daily price of oil, for example, could be more impacted than a business in the same country that produces products reliant on commodities which aren’t typically as volatile, such as wheat or sugar.</p>
<p>This is because there is an underlying link between commodity and FX price risk. As the US dollar is the worldwide pricing mechanism for most raw materials, any changes in the dollar’s value against any other currencies often translates into buying or selling pressure in commodity prices.</p>
<p>Should the price of a commodity fall, it could decrease sales revenue for producers. This, in turn, will impact profitability, and production levels may be altered in response to lower prices. For businesses that consume such a commodity, this could potentially increase profitability and thereby increase the value of the business.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the price of a specific commodity rises, it will increase the sales revenue for producers, thereby increasing the value of the business. As producers start to see the benefits of the price increase, competition in the space may intensify as new entrants seek to take advantage of the higher prices. Furthermore, the profitability of consumers of the commodity could reduce, which could potentially have a negative impact on the value of the business.</p>
<p>For David Daniels, Group Treasurer at National Express, commodity risk and FX risk can be managed separately or together – it all depends on a number of factors such as organisation policy, the size of exposure to a commodity and the capability of the organisation.</p>
<p>“You can hedge your commodity risk in USD and enter into a separate contract to cover resulting transactional FX exposure – which may result in double spread,” he says. “Any organisation should have systems and processes in place to identify other activities which can also offset the exposures.”</p>
<p>Yet for David Stebbings, Director, Treasury Advisory at PwC, there remains an inherent problem in the management of both commodity risk and FX risk, in that in the past they may have typically been managed independently within many organisations. But this is changing. “Previously, the price of a commodity was typically a procurement issue rather than one for treasury except in the most obvious cases such as airlines. Treasury may previously have only hedged the FX risk, but now they are getting much more involved in commodity price hedging decisions,” he says.</p>
<p>However, he notes that this has brought internal challenges for some organisations. “Some procurement departments believe that price is their domain because treasury may not understand the key determinants of price such as the quality of the commodity – particularly soft commodities such as corn or grain,” Stebbings says.</p>
<p>“What treasury must do is work with procurement to determine a strategy as to what and how to hedge and which financial instruments to use. A lot of companies have struggled with commodity risk, simply because they do not have a strategy in place that is joined up between procurement and treasury.”</p>
<h3 id="commodity-hedging-instruments">Commodity hedging instruments</h3>
<p>There are various financial instruments that can be used to manage commodity risk. Known as derivatives, these instruments include futures, forward contracts, options and swaps. Over the past few years their complexity has steadily increased. The main ones used in this arena are:</p>
<h5>Commodity futures</h5>
<p>Futures are essentially contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a specified future date. They are typically cash settled and rarely end in physical delivery. Futures are not typically contracts between producers or buyers looking to hedge price risk, but are used more by investors from outside the commodity space who aim to make a profit from movements in commodity price volatility. They are traded on numerous exchanges across the world, such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).</p>
<h5>Forward contracts</h5>
<p>Although forward contracts share many similarities with commodity futures, the main difference is that they are not traded on exchanges, but are traded ‘over the counter’ (OTC) – in other words, negotiated between two parties. With no clearing house involved, forward contracts carry the risk of default by one of the contract parties. Unlike commodity futures, forward contracts are often used by physical commodity traders to hedge price risk.</p>
<h5>Options</h5>
<p>As the name suggests, options are instruments which give buyers the option of buying or selling a commodity at a designated price until a designated date. Traded on both exchanges and the OTC market, the buyer pays the counterparty a premium for the right to buy or sell the underlying commodity.</p>
<h5>Commodity swaps</h5>
<p>This is a contract where two parties agree to exchange cash flows which are dependent on the price of an underlying commodity. They are typically used by commodity consumers and traded OTC in order to lock in commodity prices over the medium to long term.</p>
<p>For an airline company, for example, a commodity swap would allow it to hedge the risk of rising oil prices. Should the price of oil rise beyond the pre-specified price, then the company would receive payment equivalent to the price difference.</p>
<p>“The management of commodity exposure using any of these instruments would largely be dependent on the company risk management policy and would vary by sector,” says Daniels. “A major oil producer might use options to reduce earning volatilities, while end users like airlines might use a swap to hedge the risk of rising fuel and fix procurement costs.”</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits of hedging commodity price risk, and top of the pile are the cash flow benefits it brings, because when commodity prices fluctuate, so does a business’s cash flow. The task of forecasting and protecting future cash flows is therefore paramount. Any difficulty in liquidity means that a business may have to undertake a short-term financing arrangement to deal with the deficit, and this could impact the bottom line.</p>
<p>In essence, hedging can shield a business from any volatile price movement, whilst stabilising cash flow volatility through offsetting the risk.</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">“Don’t go about it the wrong way”</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Andy Hartree, Senior Adviser at Gneiss Energy, believes that too many treasurers go about managing commodity risk in the wrong way. He explains:</p>
<p>“The corporate treasurer is in no better position than anybody else in trying to anticipate commodity price movements.</p>
<p>“What I have seen in over 20 years of watching people trying to anticipate market fluctuations is that far too many of them don’t follow the first golden rule in managing commodity risk: focus on your business. Treasurers need to look at the business and think:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the objectives of my business?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do potential market movements threaten my ability to achieve my objectives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I mitigate those threats?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Once treasury has identified what puts the business at risk, it’s vital to analyse how big a particular commodity risk is: whether it’s existential, or whether it is just a mild irritant. Only then can treasurers judge it accordingly and come up with ways of how best to manage it.</p>
<p>“It is far too common to find companies that almost go around managing commodity risk the wrong way. They start with a ‘we need to do some hedging’ attitude, and don’t come at it from actually working out what they are trying to achieve with the hedging process – proving the adage that ‘hedging is not risk management!’ Only if you do the work to understand the impact of price (or any risk factor) on your business, can you devise a risk management strategy with clear objectives. Then, when you hedge as part of that policy, you can objectively assess the effectiveness of your actions to achieve those objectives.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="measure-for-peace-of-mind">Measure for peace of mind</h3>
<p>Aligning any hedging strategy with the overall business strategy requires ongoing and close cooperation with senior management. Communication and integration of hedging is crucial, and doing so will improve the business’s ability to respond to changes in commodity prices, whilst ensuring a shared sense of responsibility for results.</p>
<p>However, businesses should not be complacent. “A business should be able to identify their exposure to commodity risk before being able to reasonably measure the risk,” says Daniels. “This requires a holistic review of operations and key business areas that are impacted by commodity price movements – and this is a good place to start. A business must also have tools to provide appropriate and timely data in order to measure the risk.”</p>
<p>For Andy Hartree, Senior Adviser at Gneiss Energy, the first step in this analytical framework should be to embed commodity price projections. In doing this, there are two important elements: first, to make objective price assumptions. The only thing we all know about price forecasts is that they will always be wrong, but more seriously, they are inevitably biased. This raises the risk that not all scenarios are properly considered. Secondly, the business should be reviewed across a price range. By using even a simple model based on an objective understanding of how prices move (regardless of market drivers), this can throw enormous light on a business’s sensitivity to different price environments. And this leads to a much better understanding of the business’s real exposure to commodity price. Then you can devise an appropriate strategy to mitigate that exposure.</p>
<p>Hartree says that the second step is to work closely with senior management to agree risk management policy. Treasurers are in a key position, because they ‘have all the right information to be able to do the analysis at their fingertips’. “They can say to the board ‘this is what the risk profile looks like’ and make a sensible policy proposal about how commodity price risk should be managed,” he says. “The more self-evidently aligned that policy proposal is with the core business objectives, the easier it becomes to secure the all-important senior management buy-in – because it will be obvious it is what needs to be done.”</p>
<p>Brady plc’s Tobin, agrees – but adds that managing commodity risk comes down to not only having effective tools that can predict future commodity prices, but being able to react faster to adverse credit events and mitigate exposure increases.</p>
<p>For example, if a ratings agency issues an outlook that is deteriorating for a particular counterparty, the credit team can quickly place trading restrictions or request some form of credit mitigation, such as a letter of credit or guarantee. “This means that traders will instantly know what the restrictions are for this particular counterparty,” says Tobin. “It’s really about speed when it comes to reacting to market events.”</p>
<h3 id="align-to-thrive">Align to thrive</h3>
<p>Regardless of how a business chooses to manage commodity risk, tackling this area successfully can be a significant game changer when it comes to maximising business performance for those that are involved in trading commodities. Companies involved in this ever-changing marketplace, particularly within consumer and industrial products, have to be active in their management of risk.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing commodity risk, one thing is clear – it is imperative to align all areas of the business, from the board to finance, and from treasury to procurement. Only then can commodity risk be successfully managed.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">The insurance benefit</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Commodity price risk insurance can be a useful tool in the treasurer’s armoury.</p>
<p>For Keith Flury, Chief Analyst at Stable, which is a price insurance company for food and farming businesses dealing in commodities, price risk insurance is a no-brainer. “What we do at Stable is offer a more democratic way to deal with commodity price risk,” he says. “We offer a product that can give treasurers piece of mind and offer a risk management tool for a commodity price, be it anything from eggs to walnuts.”</p>
<p>What Stable aims to do is allow treasury to peg a price risk to a specific index – anything from those published by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), to an egg index offered by a local municipality in the Netherlands or a grain index offered by a price reporting service such as Reuters or Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Because these indexes give a very good indication of local regional prices, and often do so in a local currency, treasury has the opportunity to take out a price insurance policy to put a limit on exposure to price risk. “If you were a buyer of walnuts in the UK or the US for example, commodity price risk insurance can resolve worries such as a major drought, weather issues or geopolitical tensions,” says Flury.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Climate change is the biggest threat the modern world faces. Experts and critics may argue about the causes (and some deny it), but the increasingly extreme weather systems seen around the world and the rise of the oceans are bad news for us all.</p>
<p>Individuals, businesses and governments have myriad of other issues to tackle, but the bottom line is that if climatic conditions deteriorate much further, those issues may not matter. An existential crisis? Maybe, for future generations.</p>
<h4 id="doubt-it">Doubt it?</h4>
<p>Changes in global temperature are nothing new. In the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat. The start of the modern climate era was signalled by the end of last ice age, about 7,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Most of these climate changes are attributed to small variations in Earth’s orbit, subtly altering the amount of solar energy received by Earth. However, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/" target="_blank">Fifth Assessment Report</a>, the current warming trend has a “greater than 95% probability” of being man-made.</p>
<p>Information gathered by <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/" target="_blank">NASA</a> indicates that Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by 0.9°C since the late 19th century. The majority of this increase occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010.</p>
<p>What will be the legacy of the current inhabitants of this planet, then? Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg is doing a remarkable job in raising awareness of the risks posed by climate change. If someone so young can stand on the world stage and hold politicians to account for their paucity of action, then surely worldly-wise professionals, including treasurers, can take a stand too.</p>
<p>Of course, few can garner the kind of public profile achieved by Thunberg, but all can take action of some kind. And it needs everyone’s input. Globally, US$90trn will be needed by 2030 to achieve sustainable development and climate objectives, according to figures from the City of London Corporation’s Green Finance Initiative.</p>
<p>The precision of the figures is uncertain, but the scale of the potential problem for humanity is not. This is why the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda both ask for commitment from financial institutions and businesses to align their financial flows with a pathway towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development.</p>
<h4 id="fringe-benefits">Fringe benefits</h4>
<p>The motivation to make a difference should be self-evident. Some companies make a much larger contribution to global warming than others, and it is reasonable to recognise that responses can be relative.</p>
<p>But we live in challenging times and bludgeoning people with the cold, hard facts of climate change, when it is perceived that there are more immediate issues to tackle (poverty, inequality, financial crises et al), is not always the most persuasive method. Sometimes a ‘what’s in it for me’ approach is necessary (as if survival of the human race was not sufficiently persuasive).</p>
<p>According to DARA (an independent non-profit organisation working for populations affected by armed conflict and natural disasters) and the <a href="https://daraint.org/climate-vulnerable-forum/" target="_blank">Climate Vulnerable Forum</a> (a global partnership of leaders of countries most vulnerable to climate change), climate change is already costing US$1.2trn a year, with five million deaths each year related to weather impacts and a carbon-intensive economy. Without strong action, the UK government ‘Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change’ predicts that costs could be equivalent to at least 5% of GDP each year globally, or up to 20% of GDP regionally.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, and at a corporate level, if tackling climate change is viewed in terms of sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy, then there is some evidence that putting it high on the agenda improves financial performance.</p>
<p>In 2018, Switzerland-based academic publisher, MDPI, produced a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/494/pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>, ‘The Impact of Sustainability Practices on Corporate Financial Performance: Literature Trends and Future Research Potential’, presenting an analysis of the impact of corporate sustainability on corporate financial performance. Using content analysis techniques to examine current research, it concluded that from a total of 132 papers from “top-tier” journals, 78% reported a positive relationship between corporate sustainability and financial performance.</p>
<p>There is some evidence too for treasurers and CFOs that sustainable finance is prudent from a purely financial perspective. Within the investor market there appears to be a continuing and significant growth in mandates, to the extent that demand outstrips supply of ‘green’ assets – lending or bonds. This can lead to a pricing advantage for issuers.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="awareness">Awareness</h4>
<p>To what extent are treasurers professionally aware that they can do something about climate change? Not enough, says Anne van Riel, Head of Sustainable Finance, Americas at ING Capital. “Typically, treasurers are not very aware of the company’s sustainability initiatives unless it concerns the budget,” she notes. “Many do not know that their company is externally rated on its ESG performance either.”</p>
<p>It’s not that treasurers are not aware per se of the problem that is climate change. When van Riel and her team meet treasurers to discuss sustainable finance opportunities she says they appreciate the bigger picture. But with many sustainability investments, the impact is long-term and quantifying that can be difficult. It needs someone to relay outside experience to bring it into perspective.</p>
<p>“As we provide the viewpoint of investors and other stakeholders, they are better able to justify internal initiatives,” explains van Riel. The impact is akin to the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. “When sustainability teams have a closer relationship with treasurers and their goals are better aligned, the company can make a bigger positive contribution towards climate change goals.” Amplify this the world over and many small but co-ordinated activities suddenly have a vastly more powerful resonance.</p>
<p>It is not hyperbole to suggest that treasurers knowing they can make a difference will play an important part in the success of every global movement such as the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda.</p>
<h4 id="treasury-action-stations">Treasury action stations</h4>
<p>The most important role the treasurer can play is that of internal alignment and acceleration of certain investments or initiatives. “One client told us they had several initiatives internally to improve energy efficiency of their operating facilities, but by making the greenhouse gas reduction KPI transparent and linked to their financing, they would likely execute on it faster,” says van Riel.</p>
<p>This is not the only way in which treasurers can make a difference; other approaches are emerging as the understanding grows. Indeed, another important development is that of the increased focus of credit rating agencies on this topic. Van Riel notes that both S&amp;P and Moody’s are starting to show how ESG factors are affecting the credit rating. “That will automatically bring the ESG focus on the agenda of the treasurer and incentivise them to engage internally on initiatives.”</p>
<p>It’s important for treasurers to work with other functions in their organisations in the response to climate change. An organisation is most successful if its sustainability initiatives have strong senior management support and are carried out by the entire organisation, van Riel believes. “To make sure ESG factors are identified and positive actions are undertaken, coordination and cooperation between all different functions is key.”</p>
<p>In this context, it is difficult for treasurers to make the right sourcing decisions in isolation from operations or design. “I think they increasingly understand the role they play to ensure the company has access to liquidity and is able to raise funds from a wide range of investors. Communicating ESG strategies is increasingly important in that respect.”</p>
<p>It does make a difference. By having a good ESG score (as defined on a broad level by the ISMA’s <a href="https://www.icmagroup.org/green-social-and-sustainability-bonds/green-bond-principles-gbp/" target="_blank">Green Bond Principles</a>, and on a sector-by-sector basis by the likes of the major ratings agencies, the banking sector’s own experts and third parties such as Sustainalytics) it allows investors to come on board who otherwise would not invest. Diversification of funding is in itself a prudent risk management tactic; an ESG/sustainability led approach opens up the market.</p>
<p>If there was any doubt about this, consider, for example, that Swiss Re, one of the world’s largest institutional investors, announced last year that it was moving its entire US$130bn investment portfolio to ESG indices.</p>
<p>Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) is also taking a strong stance. “The investment risks surrounding climate change have become so urgent that, for the first time, we are going beyond solely engaging with companies in order to hold them to account on the issue,” Meryam Omi, LGIM Head of Sustainability told Treasury Today Group.</p>
<p>“All companies, whether they emit carbon or not, need financing. They require banks, pension funds and insurance companies to buy their shares and debt. How they invest or allocate capital holds the key to financing a 2°C world rather than a 3-4°C world, because what gets financed today is the world we will build for the future.” (She is referencing the impact of average temperatures rising <a href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_campaign=Redirect" target="_blank">above pre-industrial levels</a>.)</p>
<p>Companies that fail to embrace the transition to a low-carbon economy by demonstrating adequate strategy, governance and transparency will be excluded from LGIM’s new Future World Fund, says Omi. “In all other funds where we cannot divest, we will vote against the chair of the board to ensure we are using one voice across all of our holdings. This is the first time we have pledged to do so on a global scale for the issue of climate change.”</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Off the rails?</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Not all experts agree with the doomsday scenario. World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas, <a href="https://www.thegwpf.com/wmo-boss-says-climate-discussion-has-gone-off-the-rails/" target="_blank">offers a moderating take on the subject</a>. He told Talouselämä magazine in Finland this year that he disagrees with “climate extremists” who call for radical action to prevent a purported apocalypse. He believes that we should “consider critically, and with reservations, the thoughts of experts” before becoming overly anxious or adopting a radical stance.</p>
<p>“While climate scepticism has become less of an issue, now we are being challenged from the other side,” he said. “Climate experts have been attacked by (radical climate alarmists) and they claim that we should be much more radical. They are doomsters and extremists. They make threats.”</p>
<p>For Taalas, “it is not going to be the end of the world. The world is just becoming more challenging. In parts of the globe, living conditions are becoming worse, but people have survived in harsh conditions.”</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="bank-action">Bank action</h4>
<p>Banks have a major role to play here and they need to commit fully to the cause. ING has launched an approach that will begin steering its €600bn lending portfolio towards alignment with the Paris Agreement’s re-asserted target of preventing global average temperatures from rising 2°C (it was actually ratified by 192 countries as part of the 1997 Kyoto Agreement).</p>
<p>Known in-house as the ‘Terra’ approach, this bank is using open source technology, developed with the <a href="https://2degrees-investing.org/" target="_blank">2˚ Investing Initiative</a>, a global think tank on developing climate and long-term risk metrics and related policy options in financial markets.</p>
<p>Terra is a scientific approach to measuring the technology shift needed across certain sectors to keep well below the 2°C target. It works on the basis that real progress on decarbonisation is dependent not on emissions targets per se but on major changes to <a href="http://thebreakthrough.org/issues/Climate-Policy/does-climate-policy-matter" target="_blank">domestic energy, industrial and innovation policies</a>, and that these efforts should be supported at source.</p>
<p>In the automotive sector, for example, lowering emissions must be complemented by changed manufacturing models (the efficacy, in this respect, of electric motive power, where it needs charging from national grids, is debatable but progress will be made). Terra effectively quantifies the gap between current and future practices, defining what needs to shift, by how much and when. With other banks having been invited to join the programme, funding development along these lines will gain momentum.</p>
<p>A number of banks, united under the Banking Commission of the United Nations Environmental Programme Finance Initiative (<a href="http://www.unepfi.org/" target="_blank">UNEPFI</a>), have also launched a <a href="http://www.unepfi.org/publications/banking-publications/positive-impact-manifesto/" target="_blank">positive impact manifesto</a>. This is a commitment from members – notably also including some investors – “to think more holistically about their role in the economy, society and the broader environment”.</p>
<h4 id="hoping-for-the-best-preparing-for-the-worst">Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst</h4>
<p>“The business impacts of climate change risks should be assessed and modelled in similar ways to any other business risk,” advises David Nayler, Financial Institutions Industry Practice Leader, UK &amp; Ireland, Marsh. This happens through the process of identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring.</p>
<p>He suggests four key questions to ask to begin testing whether an organisation is prepared:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Is our strategy climate ready?</strong> What effects might different climate futures have on our ability to execute our current purpose and strategy? How will the products and services we currently offer, and the markets we operate in, need to change?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can our existing risk management, resilience and corporate governance controls cope?</strong> How will changes in climate alter the balance of investments the company might need to make in its risk management and resilience?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will our key assets be protected?</strong> Which assets might be affected the most? Does climate change alter the balance of investment in asset management; will it drive the need for divestment, early decommissioning or changes in maintenance regimes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will we still be able to rely on our current supply chain?</strong> Who are your most critical suppliers, and how vulnerable are they to the effects of climate change?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“In our experience, this approach, coupled with scenario analysis, is the most common across a range of industries,” notes Nayler. However, he believes that much of the scenario work is still in its infancy and sees the work on developing relevant scenarios as “ever-evolving”.</p>
<p>This means that the use of the output in the strategic decisions at executive level can sometimes be limited, he maintains. “This is partly because climate change as a risk can impact many parts of the organisation; perhaps the only comparator being people or conduct risk as a risk that straddles the whole organisation and involves the risk, financial, investor relations, reputational concerns and executive functions.”</p>
<h4 id="adapt-and-survive">Adapt and survive</h4>
<p>In many ways the climate change issues are not new issues per se, comments Nayler, but there is an increase in frequency, severity and locations, and the resultant financial and reputational impacts. Engaging with the best futurists, and understanding the current realistic thinking, is, he says, important.</p>
<p>“Businesses need to adapt their risk frameworks and response options to consider the longer-term ‘creep’ issues as well as the short-term shocks, to horizon-spot for the next regulatory issue, clash or change of view, and to engage with the changing consumer views,” he explains. “If businesses get this right, then climate change is not just a risk but also an opportunity to drive value and grow the business, while creating a positive environmental impact.”</p>
<p>Of course, continues Nayler, it’s important to remember that the available models reflect the current climate. “While the scientific community agrees that climate change is happening, opinions can differ on the consequences and speed of change. This means, currently there is no ‘easy solution’.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>What does rising populism mean for the future of Italy, the European Economic Union and global markets?</em></p>
<p>Central banks addressed the credit crisis by printing vast amounts of money (quantitative easing) and keeping interest rates at 0% or below for a long time. This strategy was intended to accelerate economic growth and boost employment by promoting more corporate borrowing. This would cause unemployment levels to fall and wages to increase, allowing consumers to spend more without having to borrow.</p>
<p>A decade on, the US has nearly realised this objective and Europe is close as well. However, at the same time, concerns around deflation are shifting to concerns about inflation. If inflation occurs, economic growth will have to be pushed back to potential growth (potential growth is the sum of the increase in the workforce and productivity growth). Otherwise, inflation and/or trade deficits will rise.</p>
<p>Presently, potential growth is at 1.75% in the US. Hence, it is quite odd that the US economy receives fiscal stimulus – as this boosts growth to 3%. Incidentally, potential growth in Europe and Japan is not much higher than 1% and 0.5% respectively.</p>
<p>A substantial increase in the potential growth rate requires far more investment in areas that improve competitiveness. However, the question is where the governments will source the necessary funds, as most governments have maximised borrowings.</p>
<p>How about printing additional money? This is not an option once concerns about deflation shift to concerns about inflation. In other words, cutbacks on social security would be required – expenditure on social security has been driven up to ever higher levels in order to absorb/obscure the loss of competitiveness. However, it is virtually impossible to find a political majority for this anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="fertile-soil-for-populism">Fertile soil for populism</h3>
<p>This situation creates an ideal breeding ground for populists. Indeed, since the credit crisis and the introduction of increased competition, globalisation and modern technology, the personal situation of half of the world’s population has barely improved. The top layer, on the other hand, has certainly seen an increase in incomes and the value of assets they hold. This brought Trump to power in the US. He promised lower taxes for everyone as well as economic stimulus to the extent where the labour market would tighten to the point where everyone would enjoy wage increases. Trump promised he would create a climate conducive to corporate investment, resulting in productivity growth.</p>
<p>However, he overlooked the fact that the Fed would not tolerate growth exceeding potential for a long period of time. Furthermore, he had a simple solution to excessive foreign competition: raising import tariffs and forcing other countries to lower theirs. Whilst this strategy may improve the US trade balance, the potentially positive effect on US exports will soon be cancelled out by a higher dollar exchange rate. Moreover, higher import tariffs will result in higher consumer prices.</p>

<h3 id="italy-likely-to-get-the-upper-hand">Italy likely to get the upper hand</h3>
<p>In Europe, the appeal of populist solutions has also increased, resulting in Brexit and the swelling popularity of populist parties across the continent. However, there is a major difference for European Monetary Union (EMU) countries: central banks in the US and the UK are able to absorb heavy blows. This is also possible in Europe provided most countries move in the same direction.</p>
<p>Italy is a case in point. Italy has an outdated legal, social and economic system. In addition, it has a complex political structure, born out of efforts to prevent a figure like Mussolini from ever rising to power again. The end result is that Italy has lagged behind most other European countries for decades. The lira was always being an important lightning conductor, and the currency was devalued many times. However, after the introduction of the euro this was no longer possible.</p>
<p>The rise of international competition has therefore resulted in stagnating or declining incomes among large groups of the population. In addition, public finances have been deteriorating for a long time, to the extent where it is not possible to borrow much more.</p>
<p>This means that any additional borrowing should come from the private sector. The central bank is supposed to stimulate this. However, this is not possible in the current circumstances because the ECB focuses on the average of the EMU countries. It should actually tighten its policy based on the average. The fiscal route is therefore the only remaining option, but this would only be possible if Italy were to violate the Maastricht rules.</p>
<h3 id="wishful-economic-thinking">Wishful economic thinking</h3>
<p>The two major populist parties in Italy that have formed a new government have stated they want to increase public spending and lower taxes but have no intention of leaving the EMU. Although their fiscal plans will, according to many economists, breach the Maastricht rules, Lega and the Five Star Movement (M5S) expect higher economic growth will increase tax revenues to such an extent that the budget deficits will remain below 3%. This reasoning is very similar to that of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>In other words, we will be dealing with an Italy that wants to stay in the EMU, but which does not want to comply with the associated rules. As there are no rules in place to oust a country from the EMU, the question is how the other EMU countries will react to the developments in Italy. We assume they will accept a great deal for the time being because a European crisis and the collapse of the EMU would entail far greater drawbacks.</p>
<p>At a time when China is on the rise, Russia is becoming more aggressive and the US wants to leave Europe to its own devices, Europe will have to stick together if it is to amount to anything on the world stage. If necessary, the stronger countries will simply have to foot the bill.</p>
<p>This situation carries the following major risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Europe reaches the point at which concerns about deflation shift to concerns about inflation. In this case, European economic growth would have to be pushed back to approximately 1%. In this scenario, the soaring debts and massive public deficits would be increasingly difficult to sustain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It cannot be ruled out that Italy’s policy will be adopted by other European countries – not that this policy will provide any solution in the long run, but it is initially very appealing to large sections of the population.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="market-coercion"> </h3>
<h3 id="market-coercion">Market coercion?</h3>
<p>An important question remains: will the markets force Italy back in line? We believe the ECB will continue to gear its policy towards the average of the EMU countries and not towards that of Italy. This average will not change due to problems in Italy, as rising tensions will push down interest rates in the stronger EMU countries and weaken the euro.</p>
<p>This will boost growth in the stronger EMU countries. Consequently, Germany and the other stronger EMU countries would actually require higher interest rates in this case. This is why we ultimately do not expect the ECB to come to Italy’s rescue to any great extent, all the more so because the majority of ECB members are quite willing to impose sanctions on Italy for violating the rules.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the question as to whether or not the markets will bring Italy back in line. Indeed, it is not nice to have to pay a higher interest rate in a situation where the public debt is 130% of GDP. The higher interest rates will also affect Italian economic growth. We believe this will indeed be the reason why Italy will have to make concessions in the long run. However, we do not see this happening any time soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A large proportion of Italian government bonds are held domestically. In addition, the average term to maturity of the public debt is approximately seven years. As a result, rising interest rates are not immediately tangible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The populists use this as an argument to say that the rules from Brussels should be amended rather than their policy. This reasoning appeals to many Italians for the time being. The market movements only make the Italians more militant for now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We think tensions in the EMU will increase in the coming months and these tensions will not be easily addressed, as the causes are rooted in developments in the last decades. Other Western economies are, or will be, affected by this too, but the biggest problems will likely occur in the EMU due to the lack of flexibility the ECB has in addressing problems in one country. Despite some very sound fundamentals of the EMU (lower government deficits and a positive trade balance), the euro will be under downward pressure in the coming quarters.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Last year, corporate treasurers faced unexpected challenges in the form of Brexit and the outcome of the US elections. But to what extent have geopolitical challenges affected the world of corporate treasury this year – and what are treasurers doing differently as a result?</em></p>
<p>If 2016 had just one defining characteristic, that could be said to be the geopolitical uncertainty which was manifested in developments such as the UK’s decision to exit the European Union and the election of President Trump in the US. These events have had wide ranging consequences which continue to affect treasurers in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>For one thing, Brexit continues to have a lasting impact on FX rates: the value of sterling has remained considerably lower since the referendum took place. Consequently, many UK importers have seen their costs rise – although exporters have conversely benefited from the higher value of overseas sales. “As the unexpected result of the Brexit referendum demonstrated, major political changes can have a rapid and drastic effect on currency and foreign exchange risk management strategies,” comments Steve Wiley, VP Treasury Solutions at FIS.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Indeed, the challenges of these currency movements have proven insurmountable for some companies. The recent collapse of Monarch Airlines, which left 110,000 passengers in need of repatriation, has been attributed in part to the drop in the value of the pound following Brexit – both because of rising fuel and aircraft costs, and because a weak pound has deterred many UK-based holidaymakers from travelling abroad. Many other companies have likewise seen profits suffer as a result of currency movements, although some have been insulated to an extent by hedging strategies implemented before the referendum took place.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-brexit">Beyond Brexit</h3>
<p>Treasurers are paying close attention to these issues: a survey carried out by the ACT, The Business of Treasury 2017, found that 61% of the treasurers surveyed were worried about Brexit. But while the impact of Brexit looms particularly large for companies operating in or trading with the UK, numerous other geopolitical developments are also causing a considerable headache for corporate treasurers.</p>
<p>“More recently, worries in Spain related to Catalonian independence have resulted in similar, though less significant fluctuations in currency, driving the euro down against the dollar,” says Wiley. “Political changes in the United States have added an additional element of uncertainty, leaving treasurers confounded as to how foreign and economic policy changes will impact their business.”</p>
<p>For example, President Trump’s position on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) continues to generate uncertainty across the region. The US is currently in the process of renegotiating the proposals, with the Trump administration seeking adjustments such as a sunset clause which would require the agreement to be re-approved every five years. The president has also indicated that the US could even exit the agreement entirely if a deal cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that while European regulators have focused on opening up relationships with countries such as Iran, the US has perhaps been moving in the opposite direction. “There are certain things that banks with operations in the US appear more reluctant to do,” explains David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC. “So if you want to develop business with Iran, a focus on non US banks has been the preferred route for many.”</p>
<h3 id="challenges-for-corporates">Challenges for corporates</h3>
<p>For companies operating internationally, these issues bring considerable challenges. “Geopolitical shifts complicate a treasurer’s ability to forecast risk, whether related to cash flow, external financing, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates,” comments Patricia Hines, Senior Analyst at Celent.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ACT survey found that 69% of respondents were concerned about geographical uncertainty aside from Brexit – higher even than the number of treasurers who were concerned about Brexit itself. Meanwhile, the 2017 AFP Risk Survey similarly found that 52% of treasury and finance functions are considering the impact of geopolitical events in general on their organisations’ growth.</p>
<p>The AFP survey also illustrated that geopolitical risk can incorporate a number of different risks: respondents cited loss of customers/revenue (53%), currency/volatility risk (49%) and supply chain disruptions (30%) as the most pressing issues.</p>
<p>Inevitably, different companies have been affected by these developments in different ways. In some cases, the net outcome has been a positive one. Rick Martin, Group Treasurer at GasLog, an owner, operator and manager of liquified natural gas, says that while the wave of populism has thrown up some “interesting political outcomes”, these have not – so far – impacted the company’s business model.</p>
<p>“Indeed, if anything, these outcomes have been beneficial,” explains Martin. He notes that President Trump is supportive of US natural gas exports, while “a number of governments rightly see natural gas as the cleanest fossil fuel going, and by a long chalk, looking to replace other sources such as coal”.</p>
<p>Martin also points out that central bank actions to date have been benign, “helping to keep the global economy ticking over rather well”. He says that whether these waves of populism ultimately lead to unhelpful uncertainty, or even anti-business policies, remains to be seen. “However, to date, we have been able to stick to our business plan, and gratefully so!”</p>
<h3 id="diversification-and-flexibility">Diversification and flexibility</h3>
<p>However, the picture for other companies is somewhat different. For Greek food company, Chipita, geopolitical turbulence looms large in the current environment. “It’s the first time in all the years I’ve been working for Chipita that political events have had such a huge impact on the treasury,” comments Marianna Polykrati, the company’s Group Treasurer. For example, she explains that recent political turmoil in Turkey has affected the value of the lira – meaning that the company most probably needs to revisit a previously approved budget rate for the following year. Likewise, Polykrati says that turmoil in Russia and Ukraine has had an impact on the group’s companies in these markets.</p>
<p>“In the past, due to the Group’s diversification across several geographies – including Western Europe, the US, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and India – we felt quite secure and ring fenced, meaning that when one country/region was not performing very well due to political and economic issues, it would be offset by others that were,” she explains. “But today, we are seeing that increased globalisation results in a butterfly effect – so if something happens in Russia, it can have a knock-on effect in many other markets.”</p>
<p>As such, Polykrati says the company is working on different ways of minimising the risks that the company faces in different countries. For one thing, the company is looking at hedging more than in the past. Flexibility is also important: Polykrati says that because Chipita has factories all around the world, it is straightforward for the company to change which of those factories are used to provide particular products. “Being flexible allows us to allocate the sourcing in accordance with the costs and expenses,” she explains. “This enables us to absorb any sudden and extraordinary costs.”</p>
<h3 id="changing-role-of-the-treasurer">Changing role of the treasurer</h3>
<p>One of the more positive consequences of geopolitical turbulence is a growing awareness of the role played by the corporate treasurer in managing risk. “Developments such as Brexit and the US elections have created financial uncertainty, which always raises the profile of treasurers in their organisations,” explains Stebbings. “For example, many companies have seen unexpected FX gains or losses as a result of the recent fall in the value of the pound – and questions about whether or not to hedge FX exposures put treasurers centre stage.” Stebbings says that while political turbulence brings challenges, it can also have a positive impact on treasurers by “giving them more influence and an opportunity to be more involved in the business than they are in quieter times”.</p>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<p>Polykrati agrees that geopolitical pressures have contributed to the evolution of the treasurer’s role in recent years. “In the past, the treasurer was envisaged as an accountant or a cashier, focusing on the flows of cash in and cash out,” she says. “At Chipita, the role has transformed a lot the last couple of years, especially after the Greek crisis. The treasury reports directly to the deputy CEO in order to advise on topics such as bank relationships, commodities and risk management. So my role has been upgraded due both to changes in the business and due to the challenges brought by the political landscape.”</p>
<p>That said, treasurers still need to play a proactive role in seizing the opportunities. “The definition of a good treasurer is the one who is leading the discussion, putting the issues on the table and presenting the solutions, rather than simply letting it happen and then responding to what the business wants,” Stebbings says.</p>
<h3 id="adjusting-to-the-new-normal">Adjusting to the new normal</h3>
<p>In many cases, companies have not been fully prepared for the impact of recent geopolitical events. “Few of these recent events have been widely or effectively factored into company risk management strategies, and so the question for treasurers becomes how to best manage global political, economic, and regulatory uncertainty,” comments Wiley. He notes that planning for and reacting to changes in the global political landscape has always been a tricky task for treasurers, “due to the fact many of these changes occur abruptly, unexpectedly, and have uncertain ramifications for currency rates, interest rates and counterparty risk”.</p>
<p>It is clear that there is a need for some companies to adjust their approach in light of recent developments. According to Wiley, corporates have responded to the ever-changing global economy and more uncertain political landscape by taking a fresh look at their risk management strategies and existing technology. “The risk management function has expanded within treasury to include not only those areas most sensitive to the global political landscape, such as interest rate, and foreign exchange risk, but also cyber risk,” he notes.</p>
<p>Consequently, Wiley says that treasurers are taking a fresh look at the technology used to manage these risks, in order to mitigate the negative effects of the next unexpected Brexit-scale event. “Treasurers without best in class risk management processes, and the latest technologies which can accommodate these processes through stronger analytics and decision-making tools, will find themselves the most challenged,” he adds.</p>
<p>Likewise, many treasurers are keeping a close eye on the banking landscape – particularly in the UK, where a question mark also remains over the longer-term impact of Brexit on banks. “There’s a lot of uncertainty right now about what the banks are doing,” says Stebbings. “Treasurers are keen to know what services banks will offer post-Brexit and whether they will move certain of their teams out of London. That’s very difficult to ascertain right now, but it should become clearer if and when a transition deal is done.”</p>
<h3 id="brexit-seeking-a-transition-deal">Brexit: seeking a transition deal</h3>
<p>While the outcome of the 2016 referendum caught many by surprise, this year has brought further controversy where Brexit is concerned. After triggering Article 50 in March, Prime Minister Theresa May announced the following month that she was calling a snap general election. This was intended to secure a mandate for Brexit – but the move backfired, with the Conservative party losing its overall majority in Parliament.</p>
<p>As Brexit talks continue, considerable uncertainty remains about the outcome of the negotiations. Particularly significant is the question about whether a transition deal will be signed which will protect companies from a ‘cliff-edge’ departure.</p>
<p>With the UK set to exit the EU in early 2019, the need for a transition deal is becoming more pressing. In a recent speech, Sam Woods, a Deputy Governor at the Bank of England, warned that a Brexit transition deal is needed by Christmas – otherwise firms will “start discounting the likelihood of a transition in the central case of their planning”.</p>
<p>In the absence of a formal agreement, trade between the UK and the EU would become subject to WTO rules, with large tariffs imposed on some goods. Without a transition deal, EU nationals in the UK would also face considerable uncertainty. Meanwhile, the imposition of a new customs regime could bring considerable disruption for businesses as well as congestion at the country’s ports.</p>
<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>
<p>Moving into 2018, treasurers are continuing to monitor geopolitical developments closely. Jack Spitzer, Treasurer of Isagenix, comments: “Obviously we are curious how any US tax reforms from Trump and Congress will impact the company and ownership, being privately held. We are trying to understand and predict what might happen, if anything, and be in a position to take advantage of any opportunities.”</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, Spitzer says the company is currently considering expanding into a few locations around the world which have high levels of political tension, and that the company remains concerned with any potential changes around free trade agreements. “All of these issues are fraught with uncertainty due to the current US political leadership,” he adds.</p>
<p>In the meantime, treasurers are likely to proceed with caution while paying close attention to the impact of political developments on everything from their banking relationships to their hedging decisions. Above all, the events of last year illustrated the importance of expecting the unexpected – a worthy lesson for treasurers everywhere to keep in mind.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As the anniversary of last year’s referendum vote approaches, developments continue apace. On Wednesday 29<sup>th</sup> March, Prime Minister Theresa May sent a letter to Brussels triggering Article 50 and setting in motion the UK’s departure from the EU. More was to follow: on 18<sup>th</sup> April, May called a snap general election for 8<sup>th</sup> June, remarking that “division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit.”</p>
<p>News of the snap election comes as yet another surprise at a time when surprises are becoming commonplace. Few had believed a year ago that the referendum would result in the UK leaving the EU. A poll carried out by Deloitte a few months earlier found that only 26% of CFOs had embarked on contingency plans covering the eventuality of an EU exit. Meanwhile, research carried out by Greenwich Associates in May 2016 found that fewer than a quarter of the treasurers surveyed had hedged against currency or interest rate volatility in the run up to the referendum – even though more than half believed there was a medium to high risk that the UK would vote to leave. As Tobias Miarka, Managing Director of Greenwich Associates, noted at the time, “These risks are much on the mind of corporate executives, but companies have taken little or no action to mitigate them.”</p>
<p>Almost a year on, the risks have become more tangible. The UK lost its last remaining AAA rating following the referendum, while the value of the pound fell to a 31-year low against the dollar. Higher costs for importers have led to price hikes in UK supermarkets, with the impacts of Brexit also including a slowdown in business investment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while it appears certain that the UK is going to leave the EU – barring further shocks during the upcoming election – considerable uncertainty remains about the exact form that Brexit will take, and what this will mean for corporations. “In the longer-term, there are a lot of outstanding questions that nobody can give the answer to,” says David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC. “How is it going to affect my business? How will it affect the banks that I deal with? Will my cash management structures survive? Should I still base my pooling in London? Will my bank still offer the same services on the same basis that it does now, or will I have to go elsewhere for them? We don’t know the answers to these questions because we don’t know the nature of Brexit, or how the banks and the London financial markets will be in once Brexit takes effect.”</p>
<h3 id="possible-outcomes">Possible outcomes</h3>
<p>Article 50 may have been triggered, but with a two-year negotiating period ahead there are still a number of different possible scenarios when it comes to the form Brexit will eventually take. Points which will need to be determined include the status of EU nationals in the UK, the transition of EU regulations and whether banks retain their passporting rights.</p>
<p>Each of the possible scenarios could have considerably different implications for UK’s economy and business environment. Research carried out by Oxford Economics before the referendum found that the range of possible outcomes extended from an increase in business investment of £2.4bn to a fall in business investment of £21.1bn.</p>
<p>The details of Britain’s trade deal with the EU, which could be crucial to the economic implications of Brexit, may not be complete by the time the UK exits the EU. At this stage a number of different outcomes remain possible, with some of the variables including membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), membership of the customs union, a free trade agreement for goods and trade with the EU based on World Trade Organisation rules on tariffs.</p>
<p>Arrangements which are already in place in other countries give some sense of the possible outcomes. Norway, for example, is a member of the EEA and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), contributes to the EU budget and has full access to the single market. Switzerland, which is a member of EFTA but not the EEA, has a free trade agreement with the EU but does not have full access to the single market. Turkey has a customs union with the EU but is not a member of the EEA or EFTA. However, while these arrangements may give some idea of the different directions Brexit could take, at this stage most of the questions remain unanswered.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-impact-for-treasury">Understanding the impact for treasury</h3>
<p>For corporate treasurers, the possible impacts of Brexit include both short-term and long-term challenges. The fall in sterling since the referendum last June has been particularly notable. “While that hit last June, the effects are now becoming apparent,” comments Stebbings. “Many companies that import into the UK had hedged for a certain period. We’re now seeing that hedging come to an end, and the effects of the fall in sterling are hitting company results or forcing them to raise prices.”</p>
<p>While there are actions that companies can take to address the fall in sterling, Stebbings points out that the longer-term picture is less clear. He notes, “One of the key issues is what the banks are going to do – how are they going to operate in three or four years’ time? What services will the banks provide from London – a lot of companies have got London-centric header cash pooling structures; will London still be the place to do this? Will the banks provide it, and will it work for the corporate depending on where it has its treasury vehicle?”</p>
<p>It is unclear at this point whether companies will need to move either their own operations or their banking relationships as a result of Brexit. Research published by Ovum and Temenos following the referendum found that over 42% of UK corporates believed that some of their operations will need to be moved out of the UK, while a quarter said that they would need to explore additional or alternative banking relationships. For 17%, that could include moving – or considering moving – their lead banking relationship.</p>
<p>While the exact form of the trade arrangements to be negotiated post-Brexit are clearly a concern for corporate treasurers, there are also other details which will affect treasury – particularly regarding issues such as passporting and equivalence. Currently, financial services companies use the EU passporting system to operate in other member states across the EU. At this stage, it is not clear whether the UK will still be able to use passporting after exiting the EU. While this is one possibility, the concept of equivalence, whereby markets recognise each other’s standards, may also have a role to play.</p>
<p>Nick Burge, Head of Structural and Regulatory Solutions, Global Corporates at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, outlines the major scenarios that Brexit could include from a banking/markets perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Continuation of current regulatory access arrangements – passporting and equivalence.</h5>
<p>Corporates would be able to continue with current treasury activity on an unchanged basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Hard Brexit with no passporting and no equivalence.</h5>
<p>If there were no provisions for cross-border services, companies would need to have arrangements with providers in each of the 27 EU countries as well as for UK based activity. This could have an impact on different services including syndicated lending, cash pooling and derivatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A new equivalence regime.</h5>
<p>There is uncertainty around whether the existing equivalence provisions under MiFID will apply to the UK following recent comments from the Commission. Additionally there are no equivalence provisions in the capital requirements directive for banking services. There will be much discussion around a bespoke equivalence regime as part of UK exit negotiations which will have an impact on treasurers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these uncertainties, Burge says he is not seeing treasurers changing strategy or adopting any knee-jerk reactions. He adds, “The overriding view from companies is that they will be able to continue to source financing and financial services as they do today, backed up by banks and policymakers to ensure market continuity.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say that treasurers are not paying close attention to the implications for their companies. Burge notes that treasurers have mixed opinions on the impact of Brexit, depending on the size and structure of their business. “One main concern is how they will be able to operate across borders if there is a hard Brexit,” he observes.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-consider">What to consider</h3>
<p>While the impact of Brexit will vary depending on individual companies’ business models, industries and geographical footprints, there are a number of questions that many treasurers should be asking. Rick Martin, Group Treasurer of GasLog, says the company, which owns, operates and manages liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers, is looking at a number of different factors where Brexit is concerned:</p>
<p>“Being a global shipping company, we are looking at what it might mean for world trade, and are articulating how the global gas trade is just that – not at all tied to the perturbations within a particular geography,” says Martin. Other considerations include understanding the possible implications for the company’s financing arrangements and “making sure that we are ahead of the curve, should it have unhelpful impacts on our lenders and/or where we are depositing excess cash.”</p>
<p>In addition, Martin says the company is seeking to ensure that it has the best possible handle on what Brexit could mean for interest and FX rates. “We are also ensuring that we do all we can to provide assurances to colleagues from outside the UK regarding their stable employment with GasLog.”</p>
<p>Martin says that given the uncertainty regarding the process of negotiation with the EU, the company is working hard to keep a range of options open to address the various potential outcomes. He adds, “Fortunately, we believe that the combination of our industry, corporate structure, broad network of business partners, and flexibility of our workforce are such that we will be able to deal with such changes as might reasonably occur in timely and effective fashion.”</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="preparing-for-brexit">Preparing for Brexit</h3>
<p>What steps should treasurers be taking to prepare for the challenges ahead? “First off, a treasurer should have a structure in place to sit down regularly with the CFO and management team,” comments Carl Sharman, a Director in Deloitte’s Treasury Advisory practice. “This will require the treasurer to have an understanding of how Brexit impacts the whole business community as well as their own organisation.”</p>
<p>Sharman notes that Brexit is essentially “a challenge like any other”, and that poor business performance is likely to be a reflection on management’s ability to respond rather than being down to the macro environment. “By now, many senior management teams will have identified risks and moved to manage them,” he says.</p>
<p>Before making any commentary on the markets, Sharman says that treasurers should consider whether it is actually necessary, and that they should be careful to only reference specific impacts to their sectors or businesses. He adds, “be positive – support the business to take advantage of new levels of exchange rates and explore new markets. Take the lead in providing the confidence expected for your colleagues across the business.”</p>
<p>Sharman notes that how banks prepare for, and react to, potential changes in the regulatory framework may also change how they transact with their corporate clients. He points out that this could result in some activities being routed through a different entity in the banking group, for example.</p>
<p>“Talk to relationship banks, lenders, analysts and debt investors, and understand what they are thinking and what their worries are, and if your business is seen externally by them as a risk,” he advises. “In other words, is it especially exposed to European markets, import or export, workforce impacts, etc? Effective PR is also paramount and good internal management can strengthen market perceptions.”</p>
<p>Finally, Sharman suggests that treasurers should also talk to legal advisers, particularly about continuity of contracts and covenant compliance. “Deregulation (especially MiFID decoupling) is going to be a huge part of the exit process, so keep an eye on your documentation and make sure your internal governance is fit for purpose,” he says. “Remember that many European directives have been transposed into national law and as such will survive intact post-Brexit.”</p>
</div>
<h3 id="rising-to-the-challenge">Rising to the challenge</h3>
<p>While it is clear that Brexit will present considerable challenges for corporate treasurers over the next couple of years, it is also worth considering the opportunities that may arise. Just as the financial crisis helped to elevate the profile of treasury within the organisation, Brexit could give treasurers an opportunity to shine – and, indeed, to further the goals of their departments following years of budget constraints.</p>
<p>“Brexit may give a greater focus on the financial risks that the business is facing,” explains Stebbings. “So it makes you look at forecasting and systems, and may raise the business case for treasury to have more resources. We’re certainly seeing more companies thinking about treasury management systems, automation and improving the way that they do treasury in order to understand the risks more effectively.”</p>
<p>At the same time, treasurers should take the opportunity to get their house in order so that appropriate actions can be taken when the need arises. Straightforward improvements such as gaining a clearer view of the number of bank accounts held by the company can help to position treasury so that any necessary changes can be made as the situation develops.</p>
<p>For the time being, treasurers should also take the time to understand what their main banks are currently planning and what the impact would be if certain services were changed. Treasurers should also understand how their cash pooling structures could be affected by different scenarios and what, if any, actions should be taken so that they can adapt quickly if needed. “The main thing is to be ready when things become clearer,” says Stebbings.</p>
<p>While it is important to monitor the situation as it develops and understand the implications of different possible outcomes, treasurers should also be aware that Brexit is not happening in a vacuum. “Brexit isn’t the only thing that’s affecting treasurers – there’s also the new BEPS legislation, new accounting regulations and the impact of cybercrime,” points out Stebbings. “So there are a number of things on the treasurer’s agenda, and Brexit is just one of them.”</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As the UK prepares for its third major vote in as many years, the direction Brexit will take remains unclear. But while this makes it difficult for corporate treasurers to assess the longer-term impact of Brexit on their businesses, there are plenty of steps that treasurers can and should be taking now to understand the different possible exit scenarios and the potential implications of these for key banks and suppliers.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The famous British mantra of ‘Keep calm… and carry on!’ may be sound advice in the aftermath of the United Kingdom’s referendum vote to leave the European Union. After all, no-one yet knows what the UK and Europe will look like when more than two years of difficult negotiations come to an end. But for corporate treasurers the ensuing uncertainty presents a number of headaches that need careful thought, planning and action, over and above a simple phlegmatic approach.</p>
<p>Clearly corporate treasurers in the UK and Europe, many of which were caught by surprise with little contingency planning, have the greatest challenge. However, those in Asia, perhaps having undertaken no planning for Brexit, are having to deal with similar difficulties. Currency repricing and volatility is at the forefront, with around a 10% fall in the value of sterling and the political and economic Brexit spillover weighing heavily on the euro. Risk aversion ‘contagion’ has driven the yen and other safe haven currencies higher. The costs of hedging strategies and the wider impact on results and balance sheets, especially when dealing directly with UK and European markets, is significant. Credit and counterparty risks are also changing, with the economic impact scenarios for many UK and European companies being far from clear, though all against a backdrop of a downgrade of UK sovereign risk.</p>
<p>Asian trading relationships with Europe need additional monitoring. In the longer-term, Brexit and the European tariff and regulatory environment may limit Asian headquartered European subsidiaries or counterparties from the current full access across UK and European markets – possibly requiring a structural and governance rethink, as well as changes to budgets and forecasts. New trading relationships, and possibly tax treaties, between the UK and the rest of the world are likely to emerge, albeit in the medium term.</p>
<p>Asian MNCs’ European operations may also be impacted by Brexit induced changes in the European labour markets and impacts on the use of shared service centres across UK/European borders. The impact on banks and the financial services sector is also unclear, but certain banks may be constrained by macro-economics, or refocus, resulting in a changing financing environment for corporates.</p>
<p>The economic shock of Brexit, whilst epicentred in London, is rippling across the global economy; Asia will feel the impact. Whilst this is bad news for business activity, policy makers have shown determination to act despite a depleted arsenal of weapons post the financial crisis. One positive for corporate borrowers seems likely to be that globally interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer. Stock markets are buoyed by the prospect, but sight should not be lost on the fact that a slower return to normalisation cannot be a good prospect for international trade.</p>
<p>So whilst corporate treasurers should, indeed, keep calm and carry on, their jobs have just become considerably more difficult. With Brexit uncertainties set to linger for many years to come, on top of the plethora of other global risks, the life of a corporate treasurer is set to be become more ‘interesting’, to say the least!</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The true impact of Brexit on corporate treasuries in Asia Pacific (APAC) is in its infancy and will develop and mature over time. Initially, many treasuries may have already felt the impact of the almost 10% volatility in the GBP exchange rate when it fell to a 32-year historical low. Significant analyses post Brexit indicate that most of the volatility was actually recovering from the inflated GBP rate leading up to the referendum based on the polls citing a “Remain” vote. However, either way, experiencing that kind of volatility on a portfolio of foreign exchange exposures is likely to have an impact on profit and loss. Volatility was not only experienced in the GBP exchange rate, but there were also knock on effects to JPY and CNY and impacts to commodity prices. Companies fled to safe haven assets (like gold) rather than property or bank stocks, which suffered as a result. Linked to the bank stock prices falling, is the reviews of both country ratings and counterparty ratings, hence we might see a surge in credit risk that will likely be passed on to corporates. For many large multinational corporations, at least one, if not all, of the above would have an impact on cash flows, profit and loss or even on pension stocks and reserves.</p>
<p>On a longer-term basis, if a company has treasury centres based in the UK, there might be reasons to relocate, depending on import and export requirements and new laws that come into effect. Relocating a treasury centre will be a significant investment both in terms of financial and physical resources, but here is where companies currently undergoing treasury and risk management (TRM) system selection reviews will want to consider the ease of change that cloud-based solutions afford. No doubt there will be new treaty and exchange laws that will come into play, and these could have significant and far-reaching consequences for any companies outside of the UK and EU.</p>
<p>On a positive note, a low interest rate environment leads to a buyers’ market for M&amp;A and an attractive market for those looking to borrow money to invest. Not least to say, a negative interest rate environment comes with its own challenges.</p>
<p>So what can treasurers in APAC be doing now? Well most importantly, companies must be able to respond quickly and effectively to situations such as these. Talks of another …exit are not unfounded, and so lessons can be learnt from those companies that were building out different scenarios and plans of attack depending on the outcome of the referendum. As an example, one company entered into binary FX options to hedge against Brexit and were significantly in the money on June 24<sup>th</sup>. Other companies had run cash flow at risk scenarios to ensure relevant facilities and buffers were in place. Global visibility and exposure identification across asset classes and across the enterprise is vital to enable companies to be agile, receptive and responsive to significant shocks in the market, and to be able to seize opportunities as they arise.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>There are a number of questions for Asia Pacific (APAC) corporate treasurers following the UK’s vote to leave the EU and the resultant uncertainty created. Across the region, treasurers and their advisors are still digesting the implications, process and timing of Brexit.</p>
<p>Given bank market uncertainty, companies should first conduct due diligence and consider: implications of ratings downgrades for financing arrangements; collateral requirements for hedging exposure or increasing the cost of borrowing; checking the availability of credit lines; ensuring they are committed; examining dependency on uncommitted lines of credit; the need, timing and ability to tap capital markets for needed liquidity; and the long-term implications of movements in exchange rates. Companies disproportionately dependent on uncommitted credit lines should consider whether to turn them into committed funding lines if they are critical for liquidity.</p>
<p>Companies may over time look to the non-bank funding market for alternatives to bank funding. The US private placement market is well-developed and extensively used. The European private placement market has not really been tapped so far for corporate financing. The Asian private placement market is (outside of Australia and Japan) at a far earlier developmental stage, but does also present a financing alternative. Availability is yet to be tested, however.</p>
<p>In addition, companies that have historically or were otherwise planning to tap into liquidity in the capital markets need to consider the timing of any such issuance of securities. While markets have stabilised in the immediate wake of the referendum vote, it is yet unknown the extent to which, in APAC, primary deals with a strong European/UK element involved can clear the market and at what price. Accordingly, companies’ dependent on capital markets liquidity will need to carefully consider the timing and logistics of their financing needs.</p>
<p>For many APAC companies operating in Europe, there also remains the question: what will happen to our European relationship lenders? Currently many financial services firms rely on the EU “passport” regime to provide their services in other member states. Although the UK does not require lenders to be authorised to make corporate loans, some EU countries do impose such a restriction. Therefore, in the longer-term, a highly relevant question for APAC based MNCs with European operations is whether their financial services providers in Europe can still provide their services across borders.</p>
<p>It will be some time before it is clear what the nature of a post-Brexit UK/EU relationship will look like and therefore what regime(s) will allow cross border access. As things become clearer, companies can begin a dialogue with existing lenders and other financial service providers as to whether they can provide their services on an ongoing basis. This may be through their existing model or under a new model – for example, could a lender book loans through a local facility office?</p>
<p>Ultimately, if it did become illegal for a lender or financial service provider to continue its activities, illegality protections in contracts would apply and would likely require loans by that lender to be repaid or possibly transferred to another lender.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>From the first female Prime Minister since Margaret Thatcher to the selection of Boris Johnson as the man to ramp up Britain’s overseas exports – not a day goes by without some surprising fallout from the political earthquake that was Brexit. The trouble is that away from the Westminster soap opera, businesses across the world have been left scratching their heads about what the future holds.</p>
<p>At the start of this year, no organisation could have predicted that the sterling to dollar rate would fall below 1.30. Nowhere is this more challenging than in Asia – as a weak pound calls into question whether importing/exporting with Britain is an advantage or disadvantage. In theory, markets across the region should be opened up for UK businesses to sell into, since British goods will be cheaper. On the flip side, due to the uncertainty that has arisen since the result, it is likely that many Asian corporates will now decide to put the brakes on trade agreements until more clarity is provided on what Britain’s relationship with Europe will look like.</p>
<p>Even though sterling has recently crept back up against the dollar (thanks in part to stocks’ recent rise), the truth is that because of all the uncertainty, nobody knows what level the British currency will be at over the coming months. Regardless, the only thing Asian-based corporates can be sure of post-Brexit is that it will have a direct impact at month or quarter end when they close their books. Not only will corporate treasurers across the region have to budget forecast their revenues for the quarter, they will also have to budget for what their hedging risk is likely to be. If market volatility from Brexit has taught corporates anything so far, it is that they can ill afford not to have weekly or even daily views of their risk exposure to sterling.</p>
<p>The question businesses need to ask themselves is how much should they increase their hedging by. Nobody is ever 100% hedged, but since Brexit, it is likely that many Asian treasurers would have increased their hedging ratios in the wake of the result. Approaches of course differ from organisation to organisation. For example, a Nikkei-listed firm with a large corporate treasury team and highly sophisticated technology is likely to be ahead of the curve. Corporate treasurers at small and mid-sized firms, on the other hand, need to first ensure that they have a reliable and accurate source of FX rates – before they can even think about hedging. After all, these rates are only as good as the data at their disposal. With more fallout from Brexit to come over the coming months, and with the price of sterling fluctuating almost daily, the last thing any corporate wants is to make financial transactions based on inaccurate data.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The recent slump in the price of oil is already having far-reaching consequences for corporates and their treasury departments. In this article, we consider what treasurers might be faced with were we to see yet another big collapse in the commodity’s market price. Considering the impact of the most recent price shock will be key to understanding how such a scenario might play out.</em></p>
<p>Who guessed in the summer of 2014 that the price of a barrel of oil would be less than half of its value by the beginning of the following year? One or two now very wealthy hedge fund managers aside, the answer was almost nobody.</p>
<p>Back in June 2014, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a commonly used market benchmark, would have set a buyer back $109. By January 2015, the price hit $48 – a decline of around 55%. One year later, in January 2016, the benchmark had slipped to below $27 a barrel, its lowest in nearly 13 years.</p>
<p>Although this event was the fourth market correction oil has seen since 1980, financial markets seem to be perpetually surprised by large swings, hence the ‘price shock’ label. The difficulty experts have in predicting where the price will go next poses a challenge for market participants given how hugely consequential price shocks can be for the global economy. Soar too high and the oil price will, as we saw during the 1970s, trigger deep recessions. Plunge too low and the oil price can spell trouble for economies which are geared around production.</p>
<p>Corporates are subject to a similar dynamic. A very low oil price is usually good news for some companies – downstream oil consumers – and bad news for firms producing the commodity. The consequences for treasurers of another dramatic decline in the price will, for that reason, vary accordingly between individual companies and sectors.</p>
<p>Very broadly, the implications are likely to fall principally within the field of risk management for treasurers of manufacturing companies, airlines and manufacturers, who consume oil and its derivatives. Treasurers of oil producers, on the other hand, may face much bigger challenges. Just as we have seen in the wake of the most recent correction, the very survival of some companies may hinge on how well their treasury adapts in the face of the challenges it poses in the area of liquidity management and funding, as well as risk management.</p>
<p>Attempting to forecast precisely the timing and extent of the next price shock would be a perilous endeavour. But by looking back at how the last market correction played out, treasurers can get some sense of what might be in store when it eventually comes around.</p>
<h3 id="credit-crunch-reprise">Credit crunch reprise</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most troubling of all that might be in store is a potential repeat of the sort of turmoil we saw at the height of the last financial crisis. Back then, of course, a banking crisis was triggered when billions of dollars of dodgy subprime loans sold and then resold by banks and investors began to unravel and default. Those defaults then put those who had bought and sold the securities under near existential pressure.</p>
<p>If there is another, even bigger oil price shock in the coming years, experts worry we could see a spill over into the credit markets of similar proportions. All the ingredients would appear to be already there in the markets. According to data from Barclays, junk-rated energy producers expanded their borrowing on the bond markets 11 fold to $112.5bn at the height of the shale boom from 2004 through to 2014. This debt is naturally becoming a lot more challenging to service with the price of oil where it is now, and defaults are beginning to mount. In 2015 alone, 42 oil companies filed bankruptcy proceedings, according to law firm Haynes and Boone. Were the price of oil to go into freefall again in the near future, the numbers could get even worse.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>If there was a very significant drop in oil prices I think the impact could be almost similar to the housing crisis that we had in the US. It will perhaps not be quite of that magnitude, but I think the credit tightness that we saw back then, could definitely remerge if we started to see new lows in oil.</blockquote>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“If there was a very significant drop in oil prices I think the impact could be almost similar to the housing crisis that we had in the US,” says Daniel Stauffer, Commodity Risk Consultant, Intl FCStone. “It will perhaps not be quite of that magnitude, but I think the credit tightness that we saw back then could definitely remerge if we started to see new lows in oil.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Stauffer believes the tipping point would be WTI breaking through the double bottom around $25.50 set back in February 2016 and began heading towards the “high teens”. “That would really start to cause some pain,” he says, “and unfortunately the fear would spill over into the credit and equity markets, potentially leading to credit constraints throughout the wider economy.”</p>
<h3 id="upheaval-upstream">Upheaval upstream</h3>
<p>Perhaps, then, the aftermath of the next major oil price shock will look not too dissimilar to what we saw back in late 2008 and early 2009. During that period corporates learned, some the hard way, of the existential importance of effective cash and liquidity management. When banks begin to become more selective in their lending, treasurers have little option but to look more closely at how they can get the most out of their own resources. Using new technologies as an enabler, many treasuries have since endeavoured to centralise operations to achieve better visibility and control over liquidity and, ultimately, put isolated pockets of cash to work.</p>
<p>In the energy sector, we have been seeing a revival of this trend over the past several years. Indeed amongst oil producing companies – and firms heavily exposed to oil producing economies – the 2014 oil price shock put treasury efficiency in the spotlight like never before.</p>
<p>“When the crude price was around $148 per barrel, these companies were somewhat flushed with cash,” explains Lance Kawaguchi, Managing Director and Global Sector Head, Resources and Energy Group for HSBC’s Payments and Cash Management product group. “They didn’t worry that much about efficient liquidity management.”</p>
<p>A prolonged down cycle in energy prices impacts these companies a number of ways. The first effect is that liquidity begins to dry up. The second is that companies’ credit ratings are put under downward pressure, leading to a decline in debt capacity. Thirdly, staff levels are commonly reduced leaving treasuries tasked with doing more with less. That banks say interest in liquidity solutions has been growing in the oil dependent nations of the Middle East in particular lately is not perhaps that surprising then. “It’s a hot topic,” says Kawaguchi. “In fact, liquidity has been the number one topic for clients in every country I’ve visited this year.”</p>
<p>Kawaguchi says more clients now want to know what industry best practices are with respect to liquidity management. They want to know what practical steps they can take to acquire better visibility over trapped pockets of cash and they want to know about solutions that can help them bring this cash home in an expedient fashion.</p>
<p>Many of them are still carrying out their cash forecasting manually on spreadsheets he discovered. If there is a bright side to the turmoil an oil price shock can provoke, therefore, Kawaguchi thinks it is that it at least encourages treasuries to think about how legacy processes and systems for liquidity management might be due for a revamp. “What is so exciting for us at the moment is that these companies are now focusing and investing in ways to improve their days sales outstanding (DSO) and days payables outstanding (DPO).”</p>
<h3 id="growing-awareness">Growing awareness</h3>
<p>Along with a renewed focus on working capital, a new oil price shock might also precipitate a change to risk management processes. Although conventional wisdom says a low oil price is good news for airlines, car manufacturers and other heavy consumers of the commodity for whom oil is a significant influence on revenue, a new approach to hedging commodity price risk may be just as necessary for these firms as for their upstream counterparts. In fact, the extent of the volatility seen in energy commodity markets since the oil price began to plummet in 2014 has already precipitated a review of risk management technology and processes at some companies producing finished goods derived from oil or oil derivatives.</p>
<p>To begin with, more companies are showing an appetite for using derivative instruments to offset their oil exposures, rather than simply agreeing to do a forward buy on the physical. “We have been seeing an influx of new clients, both on the consumer and producers side, who have been enquiring about hedging products,” says Intl FCStone’s Stauffer. “Many of these new customers are companies who have never hedged before. If a treasurer or CFO was not familiar with hedging commodities before the downturn, they should be familiar with it now.”</p>
<p>The traditional model in which responsibility for managing commodity risks commonly resides with the purchasing department is also being questioned by a growing number of companies. Many are now endeavouring to incorporate the management of commodity risk into treasury departments. After all, not only are corporate treasurers experts in managing market risk, trading derivatives and hedge accounting: they also have an advantage in that they are able to look at commodity related risks more holistically, understanding better their relationship with other forms of market risk.</p>
<p>“What we’ve seen over the last 18 months or so is that CFOs and treasurers are becoming increasingly focused on breaking down the barriers between procurement and treasury,” says Mark O’Toole, Vice President of Commodities &amp; Treasury Solutions for OpenLink. For a vendor like OpenLink, which offers companies the means to obtain better visibility of both commodity and financial risks through a single platform, this is evidently good news. Indeed, O’Toole says his team have been inundated over the past twelve months with enquiries from multinationals, including a number of household names, now looking to take a more integrated approach.</p>
<p>But it may take the pain of another price shock and spell of severe volatility for some companies to make the switch from the way they have traditionally approached commodity risk management. “Something I am still noticing within some treasury departments is that treasurers say they are managing FX risk, for example, but are completely ignoring the FX exposure that comes from the procurement side of the business – their commodity exposures,” O’Toole says. “Procurement may have a lot of commodities denominated in US dollars, so you may be buying a physical commodity and it has an embedded exposure already built in it. However, that is not always visible inside treasury, so you may have a large outlier that treasurers may not be accounting for in their overall positions.”</p>
<p>Technology can help in giving treasurers the visibility they need over such exposures by providing faster access to data that is part of the network. It is common, O’Toole says, for OpenLink to go into companies and find numerous different systems in place covering different areas such as cash management, currency, credit, investment and debt and enterprise risk management and procurement. Consolidating all of this data onto a single platform – as OpenLink do – can benefit corporates not only by reducing the cost of paying different vendors, working with multiple integration pain points, but also in terms of operational efficiency. Positions taken by the purchasing team affecting a particular exposure are automatically visible to treasury and accounting teams.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the reasons some companies have been slow to make such changes is that, like the oil producers only now beginning to work on working capital efficiency, it is only lately market conditions have highlighted the shortcomings of the traditional approach. According to the Deloitte Global Corporate Treasury Survey 2015, only 22% of the treasurers surveyed cited commodity price risk management as a system functionality used by treasury. Were there to be yet another price shock in the near future, one might reasonably expect to see still more companies reaching the conclusion that an integrated approach is required.</p>
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-unexpected">Preparing for the unexpected</h3>
<p>Looking at how the recent collapse in oil prices was felt in the treasury community evidently tells us a lot about how the impact of a hypothetical future market correction might be felt. We can see that another oil price shock, together with the market volatility that usually follows such a correction, would mostly likely force companies downstream and upstream to review traditional treasury processes and consider new ways of working – as many have already been doing since the last price shock.</p>
<p>Under pressure to implement drastic cost cutting measures, upstream oil producing companies (and others closely linked to oil producing economies) will be strongly incentivised to focus on optimising working capital and liquidity management. Meanwhile downstream, we may see yet more companies in oil exposed sectors such as manufacturing, retail, food and beverages, seeking to actively hedge their exposures with financial derivatives for the first time and develop more advanced and integrated procurement and treasury methodologies.</p>
<p>It would be better, of course, to begin taking action now rather than waiting until the pressure of a crisis necessitates it. Although few people could have guessed the timing and the scale of the last oil price crash, the number of price corrections we’ve seen over the past several decades suggests they are events worth preparing for. In the long run, the changes introduced by companies in the wake of the recent oil price shock should be a very positive development for treasurers and their companies. The time is now for treasurers to take the lessons that can be drawn from the last price shock and start planning for the next one.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Commodities pricing is at the mercy of a number of factors as diverse as market mood, political intervention and the weather. For corporates, managing the risk of price swings is crucial to protect the bottom line. Where does risk materialise, why, and how can it be mitigated?</em></p>
<p>Commodities such as gold and oil have, for a long time, proven to be a rich seam of literary inspiration as the quote, “there’s gold in them thar hills – and there’s millions in it,” from Mark Twain character, Mulberry Sellers, attests. But in today’s volatile markets, they can also be a source of great consternation for corporate end-users.</p>
<p>Commodities are the key elements used in just about every production facility the world over. As raw materials, commodities will either be soft (agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa or sugar) or hard (mined or extracted products such as iron ore, copper, gold or oil). Although traded in the primary economic sector (as opposed to the manufactured), they still appear to have a life of their own. Indeed, from a financial perspective, the purchase and sale is often carried out using futures contracts through the 50 or so specialist regulated commodity exchanges around the world – in Asia the list includes the likes of Central Japan Commodity Exchange, the Vietnam Commodity Exchange, the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange and the Australian Securities Exchange. Derivatives of futures are also increasingly traded using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options.</p>
<p>All commodities exchanges operate to a standardised quantity and minimum quality (the basis grade) of the commodity being traded. This helps to satisfy the sale so that in effect, the commodity is pretty much the same wherever it is bought. The problem with commodities traded in this way (and in this quantity) is that price can be very easily affected by political and regulatory change, seasonal variation, weather, technology and general market conditions (including supply and demand). All of this, for the commodity-exposed corporate, translates into risk which must be managed. And at the moment, there is much to consider as the commodities markets demonstrate just how fragile they are.</p>
<p>According to a December 2015 edition of the BondSquad ‘Making Sense’ newsletter, commodity prices have been “beaten down” for more than a year and for the past several months conditions have “deteriorated dramatically”. As with most asset routes, the crash in commodity prices started with the fundamentals, said the report’s author, Tom Byrne. These include lower-than-expected demand (or demand growth) and significant over-supply of many commodities. Oil is a case in point as the over-production war between OPEC and the US rages on, but other commodities have been impacted too as production capacity had been massively expanded to feed Chinese and EM market growth that has stalled, leaving the world in a state of glut. For buyers, this seems like a good thing, but it is not as simple as that.</p>
<h3 id="the-regional-view-of-a-rollercoaster-ride">The regional view of a rollercoaster ride</h3>
<p>Asia Pacific is a major source of global commodity exports. The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Trade Insights paper issued in Q2 2015 reported that regional economies currently accounted for 38% of global mineral and metal exports, as well as 29% of global fuel exports. Asia Pacific harbours many commodity-exporting economies, accounting for over a quarter of global fuel and metal exports, as well as over a third of global mineral exports. Some countries in the region play a significant part in global commodities production, with Australia, for example, producing 28% of global mineral supplies. The extent to which extraction and trade of commodities forms part of some economies means that if markets fall they can have a serious impact on local economies – there are 18 net commodity-exporters in the region, with commodity-trade surpluses ranging from 0.11% of GDP in Myanmar to 59% of GDP in Brunei Darussalam. When prices slump, ESCAP notes that export revenues and economic growth can expect negative impact in these countries.</p>
<p>At a macro level there is cause for concern as some international commodity prices continue to fall. In August 2014, oil stood at $115 a barrel but prices settled under $37 a barrel (the first time since the financial crisis) after data from the OPEC reported in mid-December 2015 that the group increased its crude production in November. Furthermore, recent stock market falls are perhaps based on the pain likely to be felt by oil producing countries and the companies that sell to them (luxury goods and car manufacturers remain on edge).</p>
<p>ESCAP reported on continuing falls of many commodity prices (from June 2014 to January 2015) which extended across all commodity sectors in the region. Energy saw a 50% decline, metals and minerals a 16% decline and agriculture a 7% decline. In the energy sector, oil and gas prices fell between 37% and 54%. In the minerals and metals markets, coal, copper, lead and tin prices fell between 12% and 24%, while iron ore prices plunged 47%. In the agricultural sector, corn, cotton, palm oil, and soybean prices also fell between 12% and 26%. However, the prices of some commodities actually increased. Zinc, aluminium and nickel prices increased in the period due to export bans and supply-side issues, whilst orange, cocoa, cattle and coffee prices rose, due to crop failures and poor weather.</p>
<h3 id="metal-market-mayhem">Metal market mayhem</h3>
<p>A business using base metals will need a certain amount of raw material on its factory floor at any given time. The nature of the business and its prevailing business model will inform the precise stock level, according to whether it needs to hold substantial inventory or if it can take delivery just-in-time. Of course, high volatility brings great opportunity to those corporates heavily exposed to such metals if they are in a position to lock in record-low prices now through a derivatives strategy enabling future gain. On the other hand, those with a large unhedged inventory have a challenge on their hands: not only does forecasting become difficult, but also a price crash could be seriously damaging to their balance sheet.</p>
<p>This volatility underscores the importance of taking a proactive approach to commodity trading and risk management for corporates. Today we are seeing a ‘what-if’ scenario made real as base metals head out on a wild rollercoaster ride, with iron ore prices plummeting to 2009 levels and copper also sinking to its lowest level in six years. What’s interesting about the dramatic fall in the copper price is that it was triggered by a seemingly unrelated factor – problems in the Chinese equities market where in August 2015 it very nearly saw the biggest possible decline.</p>
<p>Although the metals market can exhibit periods of relative stability, with steady rises or falls, prices tend to be more generally mobile compared to other asset classes, with rapid movements often being driven by major economic events or even just talk of an event. In the past, the main market players, apart from a small group of speculators who created the liquidity, were the mines, the processors and the end-users. Whilst the industrial supply and demand of metals changes little from one period to the next, even more volatility has been introduced because metals started to gain traction as investment products for fund managers, ETFs and macro-economic hedge funds, many of whom are now trying to bail out.</p>
<p>The current level of movement is therefore not likely to be just a blip that can be ridden out by commodity-exposed firms. As investors are becoming more sophisticated in terms of the investments they make, they are still looking at metals and other commodities as an asset class, albeit a bumpy one. And as long as this pattern of behaviour exists (and OPEC and the US producers slug it out over oil), there will be spikes of volatility in the market and these spikes will impact the industrials as they go about their day-to-day business. There is thus increased urgency for treasurers in these organisations to mitigate risk. Hedging against price volatility is a common response but the decision to hedge is far from simple.</p>
<h3 id="measure-and-analyse">Measure and analyse</h3>
<p>The simple spreadsheet is still the technology of choice for some businesses when managing their commodities deals. Unsurprisingly, this is becoming less of a practical proposition as volatility, compliance issues, regulatory reporting and market complexity reigns. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly necessary for treasurers to analyse what happens to their portfolio of commodities contracts as market prices rise or fall and they need to correlate this information with the downstream effects on functions such as production and sales in terms of cash and planning. But whilst it is important to understand the ‘here and now’, it is advisable also to evaluate a number of what-if scenarios, to stress-test all assumptions about pricing and risk and create optimal hedging strategies for a number of outcomes.</p>
<p>The need is to be able to see what the production plans are, what the requirement is for components for these plans, what is held on inventory, what the forward commitments are in terms of those components, and what has to be purchased. As this is being calculated, it will be necessary to assess the effects on the overall position of assumed price, currency and interest rate changes over that period. Armed with this information it will be possible to create different hedging strategies based on these scenarios actually playing out.</p>
<p>From a treasury perspective, gaining insight into the real exposures and risks of multiple contracts for different commodities across all regions could be a major challenge. If a particular exposure cannot be fully rolled up across the group, there is a chance that inefficient hedges will be placed. Treasury is also faced with the challenge around understanding and gaining visibility to the sub-components of physical purchases and their embedded risk. Without an ongoing appreciation and understanding of the organisation’s positions in relation to market conditions, it is possible that hedging policy becomes stale very quickly. The goal surely is to protect the downside so that if prices move against the organisation, it already has an appropriate hedge in place. But hedging by region, plant or even by individual trade simply because the bigger picture is not available will be more expensive than leveraging a consolidated global position, particularly if those hedges are placed individually with banks or brokers.</p>
<p>An accurate and timely view of commodity inventory, current forward purchases and exposures across the business, can facilitate more accurate tracking not only of the pricing of each deal but also of how effective existing hedges are. The challenge is being able to handle all the physical commodities contracts, with their underlying sub-components (such as basis, freight and grades) and combine that information with the financial hedges. Being able to report this view inside treasury will give the treasurer better insight to their overall risks and underlying cash flows. Having this information means that as prices move, the decision to exercise any options, for example, becomes that much clearer. To this end, a number of trading and risk management solutions are available from vendors such as OpenLink, Reval, Thomson Reuters, SunGard or Triple Point. Again, there is a cost and another layer of complexity to consider but these have all been tried and tested using years of best practice and market knowledge; the business case for in-house development and maintenance may not withstand close scrutiny in this light and in any case having all commodities and treasury functions on a single platform is an advantage.</p>
<p>With a fuller appreciation of commodity positions – calling upon data from purchase contracts, production requirements, procurement needs and sales forecasts – comes the opportunity to engage with more sophisticated (and thus effective) hedging tools (beyond simple futures and options). Being able to understand and isolate the component risk of non-financial items (now permissible under IFRS 9 Hedge Accounting rules) for example, is potentially far more effective and efficient: an airline’s jet fuel trades may only need hedging of the crude oil component. Of course, where a non-US airline or other business is hedging in USD (because that is how oil and many other commodities are priced) as USD strengthens, so the embedded currency risk of the deal fortifies; this is another consideration for treasury.</p>
<h3 id="the-sustainable-model-of-production">The sustainable model of production</h3>
<p>Despite the current slow-down in countries such as China, continued economic growth in emerging markets has driven demand for resource. This contributes to higher and more volatile commodity prices. The projected growth for steel consumption between 2010 and 2030 has been reported as high as 80%, with the demand for energy set to increase in the same period by 33%.</p>
<p>Manufacturers can create value, cut costs, and reduce exposure to volatile commodity prices by improving their resource productivity, according to McKinsey &amp; Company. The concept it espouses effectively means using fewer resources for each unit of output. In the spirit of sustainability and corporate responsibility initiatives, collaboration with suppliers and customers “can keep used products, components and materials in circulation”. Rather than engaging in the traditional supply chain, which creates a linear relationship between stakeholders, McKinsey refers to a business model that requires rethinking ownership of materials in terms of a “supply circle”. This proposes the regeneration of natural assets through repair, maintenance or recycling of materials or products at every stage of production, across the full supply circle.</p>
<p>At the core of this effort is a need to analyse how raw materials are extracted, how components are produced, how products are designed and how return (recycling) markets are organised. McKinsey suggests that large companies can start to exercise influence in the supply circle where previously it would have no direct control.</p>
<p>There is a cost. McKinsey warns that without digital supply chain management, it will be almost impossible to co-ordinate all the moving parts a circular supply chain requires in real-time. There may be a need to consider a new business model, where producers lease rather than sell in order to retain ownership of materials embedded in products (the automotive industry could adapt in this way). There may even be a requirement to rework the cash flow demands of a circular supply chain, compared to a linear one, and although margins might improve, the suppliers’ need for cash may change which will need addressing.</p>
<h3 id="take-a-decision">Take a decision</h3>
<p>The prices of commodities have generally fallen in recent years but this situation will not last forever. Some businesses are better prepared for change than others. In 2008, Southwest Airlines in the US took the decision to lock in the price for about 70% of its jet fuel based on oil at $51 per barrel. For 2009, it locked in 55% of its jet fuel based on that same price, and its strong financial position allowed it to continue to lock in fuel prices over the next few years. Many did not understand this move at the time, but as oil went to $100 and beyond, Southwest’s strong financial position allowed it to turn a profit when most others were reporting losses.</p>
<p>For corporates in Asia, managing commodity risk and any imbedded currency risk is now an essential part of the job: taking a proactive stance at the right time can – as Southwest demonstrated – make all the difference. In essence, real-time visibility of commodities trade allows treasury to become a more pro-active partner for the rest of the business. For companies where margins are thin to begin with, this approach seems logical. However, the proactive management of commodities risk is not an Asian issue per se; there is clearly a commonality of themes and issues across all regions. For treasurers, knowing when and how to react is becoming another crucial part of the skillset and making sure they have the right tools to do the job can set them apart from their competitors.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>What burning issue is keeping corporate treasurers awake at night? Seven years ago, the health of banking partners would probably have topped the list, while two years ago many would have cited the mounting compliance burden. But ask that question to a corporate CFO or treasurer today, and many will tell you it is the geopolitical environment that they are losing the most sleep over.</i></p>
<p>Growing business concern about geopolitical risk is quite apparent in recent surveys of senior financial executives. Take the McKinsey Global Survey 2014, for example. In this study, 80% of the executives surveyed highlighted geopolitical issues as their top threat to global growth in the year ahead. Moreover, the survey appears to indicate that people expect things to get a lot worse before they get better. Only 39% of those surveyed said they anticipated global economic conditions to improve over the course of the next six months – nearly a quarter less than the 59% who said they expected improvements when asked three months prior.</p>
<h3 id="growing-dangers">Growing dangers</h3>
<p>Financial executives are exhibiting growing concern because the geopolitical environment is becoming ever more unstable. Over the past several decades, globalisation has been the dominant force in both economics and politics. The world, we have been told, is becoming smaller with the development of a global marketplace indifferent to national borders. According to a recent report, however, we may now be entering into a new phase.</p>
<p>Disillusionment with globalisation is mounting, according to the “Global Risks 2015” report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in late 2014; and this change is driving nation states to pursue ever more protectionist, beggar-thy-neighbour policies (see box opposite). “Growing nationalism is evident around the world: in Russia, as seen in the Crimea crisis; in India with the rising popularity of nationalist politicians; and in Europe, with the rise of the far-right, nationalistic and Eurosceptic parties in a number of countries.”</p>
<p>That is not all. Corporates are finding themselves more exposed than ever to developments in the geopolitical sphere. The interplay between geopolitics and financial markets is one reason. When a crisis occurs, such as the outbreak of conflict in Ukraine last year, it doesn’t usually take long for financial corollaries to manifest in data rolling down the screen of the treasurer’s terminal. And when the news is particularly bad, it can mean sizeable FX losses, rating downgrades, credit difficulties or disruption to the supply chain.</p>
<p>Today, financial markets are more interconnected than ever before. The ripples from such incidents tend to travel further, and at much greater speed, than witnessed in the past. “Since 2011, there has been a huge increase in political risk,” says Dr Tazeeb Rajwani, Senior Lecturer in Strategic Management at Cranfield University School of Management. “There is this classic interconnection of financial markets. For example, if something happens in Hong Kong and China begins to intervene, it can have implications in another country like the UK. We are seeing these interdependencies more and more, and it’s going to continue to increase.”</p>
<p>Given the region’s prevailing economic troubles, for European companies in particular, global interdependencies are almost certainly set to continue strengthening even more quickly in the years ahead. Since the financial crisis and ensuing downturn we have seen export-led growth strategies become the priority for many multinationals grappling with deflationary pressures on their doorstep. But by growing the business abroad, especially in some emerging markets, companies are likely to find themselves facing heightened political threats to their operations.</p>
<p>This, Rajwani believes, could be a second factor explaining the growing focus on political risk. “China is obviously very attractive,” Rajwani offers as an example. “But if you are a manufacturer going into China today, for example, then you are going to have to learn to deal with varying degrees of interference from the government. This is something we have seen recently with some car manufacturers and, of course, Google. Companies who go abroad obviously need to consider these tensions.”</p>
<p>There is also a third factor that helps explain the heightened political risk environment: the past year’s dramatic collapse in energy prices. From the Middle East to Russia, energy price volatility is, without a shadow of a doubt, exacerbating much of the political instability seen in the world at the present time. In fact, a 2015 report by political risk specialists Aon identified heavily oil dependent countries such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Venezuela as those facing the greatest political risks in the year ahead. The trend means that any business operating in or thinking about moving into energy export dependent economies needs to develop a greater understanding of the different policy directions in these countries and how these might, in turn, lead to significant financial consequences for their organisation.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-the-four-ts">Beyond the four T’s</h3>
<p>The McKinsey study would suggest that the volatile geopolitical outlook highlighted by the WEF has not gone unnoticed by corporate executives. However, a growing awareness of geopolitical threats in some foreign markets does not necessarily translate into optimal risk management practices. Dr Rajwani has conducted numerous studies in recent years into market entry strategies and, in light of all the attention political risks are receiving from financial professionals, what was discovered was quite surprising to him. “What we found was that while companies are getting better at looking at political risk, many are still struggling in some ways to understand how to develop methodologies that utilise in-house knowledge or external knowledge to reduce those risks,” he explains.</p>
<p>Most corporate executives are well versed in the basic tenets of political risk mitigation; that is the “Four T’s” (tolerate, transfer, treat, terminate). This framework dictates that one either tolerates the risk, purchases insurance to transfer the risk and lobbies government for more favourable treatment, or avoids the risk entirely by terminating a certain activity or presence in a problematic area.</p>

</figure>
<p>Deciding on which of these steps represents the best course of action to mitigate a particular political risk a business may face is rarely straightforward, however. Take, for instance, the concept of ‘treatment’ in which companies seek to influence, through one method or another, the direction of government policy on matters that impact their interests. In some circumstances this strategy might be effective. But not in every instance. Research conducted by Rajwani on multinationals in Latin America found that in some cases, counterintuitive as it may initially sound, the best strategy is often to stay under the radar.</p>
<p>“If you are going into Venezuela, for example, where there is a lot of political risk, it might not be a good idea to attract attention to your firm by bargaining with officials,” he says. “There is often a high cost associated with networking and sometimes it can be counterproductive.” That is often because attempts to proactively engage with officials, explaining how much interference is going to cost the firm, the government will see it as an opportunity to extract more from the company in tax or other charges. “It’s a bit like shooting yourself in the foot,” he adds. “Sometimes the safest option is non-bargaining.”</p>
<h3 id="too-little-too-late">Too little, too late</h3>
<p>Another problem, say the experts, is that companies are exhibiting complacency before they have entered into a particular country and been confronted by a political threat. According to Henry Wilkinson, Director of the Risk Advisory, some companies have yet to fully appreciate the value of a preventative approach when it comes to political risk matters. These are companies that will turn to markets without undertaking any kind of formal risk assessment beforehand. Only then, once the company is committed and its operations are up and running, will executives begin to become conscious of the political environment. At this point, the risk manager will no doubt initiate a retroactive risk assessment – which is better than no assessment at all, of course – but by this time much of the damage may already be done.</p>
<p>“Companies are not always taking steps to assess political risks before they begin a particular venture,” Wilkinson explains. “This is not so much a problem for larger organisations who have teams of dedicated staff looking at these things. However, in smaller or mid-sized enterprises they might think that kind of expense is too much for them. Later on, they often wish they had looked at it sooner.”</p>
<p>Sven Roeleven, Vice President of enterprise platform company Software AG, agrees that corporates need to be less reactive in their management of political risks, identifying risks before they enter new jurisdictions and on an ongoing basis thereafter. In the past this would have been a very challenging task, to say the least. But the advent of sophisticated technologies, such as big data streaming analytics software, makes this task a whole lot more manageable for the modern corporate. “Instead of taking a reactive approach to risk, [companies] must take advantage of real-time data analysis tools to identify emerging and impending risks – in time to do something proactive to mitigate or avoid these risks,” says Roeleven. “Instead of acting retrospectively and executing controls at set intervals, organisations need to shift to control systems that operate continuously and that can facilitate business decisions on predictive analytics.”</p>
<h3 id="justified-anxieties">Justified anxieties</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this article, we noted an apparent increase in concern amongst financial executives around geopolitical risks. These anxieties, it would be reasonable to conclude, are nothing more than an understandable reaction to everything that has been going on in the geopolitical sphere over the past several years. On the one hand, disillusionment in globalisation and rising nationalist sentiment is unsettling both emerging and developed economies. But the interconnectivity of today’s markets, coupled with the need to look beyond domestic borders for growth opportunities means, for many multinationals, greater exposure to geopolitical turmoil.</p>
<p>That the financial executives of companies are showing signs that concerns are stirring and, as a result, actively demonstrating the wish to take some kind of action is undoubtedly a positive change. In the past, political risk analysis has sometimes been treated as something of an afterthought for companies when foreign expansion is on the agenda. Not any more. Now, corporate executives appear to be recognising that they need to fully understand the political environments of the markets that they want to do business in and have plans in place should events take a turn for the worse. That may not be enough to insulate the business fully from geopolitical shocks, but everybody concerned should sleep a little easier knowing those steps have been made.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="in-focus-political-risks-in-russia-and-cis">In focus: political risks in Russia and CIS</h3>
<p>It would be fair to say that the political events that unfolded in Eastern Europe last spring took nearly everybody by surprise – corporate treasurers being no exception.</p>
<p>The Russian economy has paid a very heavy price for its government’s aggressive foreign policies. Since President Putin began his military incursion in Ukraine, the deteriorating business environment, exacerbated by declining energy prices, has been reflected across almost every economic indicator. Sovereign, and by extension, corporate debts were downgraded to junk while Western sanctions prevent Russian corporates from raising US and European capital. And the Russian rouble, of course, entered into a tailspin, losing nearly half of its value against the dollar over the course of 2014.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Russian economy is expected to shrink by 6% in 2015 according to AXA Investment Managers. Meanwhile, although the rouble has somewhat recovered recently as a result of stabilising oil prices, analysts do not believe implied volatility (which increased by a factor of seven in 2014) is to return to levels seen prior to the annexation of Crimea anytime soon.</p>
<p>Treasurers preparing hedging strategies for Russia in the year ahead would be advised to keep a close eye on political developments; these will continue to be the most crucial factors in determining the risk environment in the region moving forward. But help may be required, such is the complexity of the geopolitical environment in the region at the present time. “Businesses should seek out advice from people who can very quickly grasp an unfolding situation and see order in the chaos,” says Dr Daragh McDowell, Senior Russia Analyst. This is an essential step for multinationals with an interest in the region because, whether or not the new ceasefire agreed in Minsk back in February holds (and there are serious doubts around whether it will), Dr McDowell does not foresee any let-up from Putin in the near future. “If that happens then I think Russia will retrench and look for a new target,” he says. “I don’t think this aggressive foreign policy is going away.”</p>
<p>But Putin has not negotiated in good faith so far and, as such, there is no reason to believe he is now. What is perhaps more likely is that Russia will attempt to use the ceasefire to sow confusion in the western ranks insisting that Ukrainian forces keep withdrawing while separatists keep advancing. If this happens we could well see another, more severe, round of sanctions imposed on Russia. Evidently the conflict in Eastern Europe – and the region’s economic woes – are still far from over.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Switch on the TV on any given day and you are likely to see the results of political instability around the world. From Argentina’s debt crisis, to ongoing troubles in Ukraine, the past year has seen new political risks erupt that look set to rumble on throughout 2015. The question many corporates will be asking is, what is the knock-on effect on us?</i></p>
<p>“The impact of political risk on corporates is vast,” says Charlotte Ingham, a Principal Political Risk Analyst at risk and strategic consulting firm Maplecroft. “This risk can be operational in nature, in terms of the physical security of their facilities and staff or the potential disruption to their logistics, or legal, if you look at things like corruption risk and the potential ramifications of violating the US Foreign Practices Act or the UK Bribery Act, as well as financial.”</p>
<p>At the extreme end of the political risk scale is the forced expropriation or nationalisation of a company’s assets in a country. While this is extremely rare, there have been cases of this occurring over the past century, including in Libya, Iraq and Venezuela. “This is the worst-case scenario for a corporate, where the company loses not just its profit, but its entire means of making money in that country – everything it’s invested, everything on its balance sheet in that country, is taken away,” says John Drake, Head of Intelligence and Risk Mitigation at AKE Group.</p>
<p>Wholesale expropriation of privately owned assets aside, there is a wide spectrum of less drastic ways political decisions can hit corporates. “Changing tax regulations and the revision of tax codes can significantly impact a company’s bottom line. Similarly, if a country’s government chooses to impose a tariff on certain commodities, this can make a big dent in profitability for foreign investors,” says Drake.</p>
<p>Beyond the purely financial consequences, political risk can damage a corporate’s image as well. “There are big potential reputational risks for corporates with operations in countries which have poor records on democratic governance, political violence, or human rights. There are a lot of challenges in these countries, but also lot of opportunities if the risks are managed well,” says Maplecroft’s Ingham.</p>
<h3 id="business-carries-on">Business carries on</h3>
<p>Often the highest-profile risks are not necessarily the most detrimental from a corporate perspective. Despite the awful human cost of terrorism, countries with a high incidence of terrorist activity are not necessarily no-go zones for corporates.</p>
<p>“Terrorism generates a lot of headlines, but often the impact on companies might not be very significant if they are able to mitigate the risk. Many companies are still making a lot of money in Iraq, for example, especially in the oil and gas sector, despite some of the terrible atrocities that are going on in the country at the moment,” adds Drake. “The political violence risks from terrorism, riots, and war can have a big impact on private companies, but not as much as full nationalisation, because if a country nationalises a whole sector without paying proper compensation, you lose everything. However, even in a war situation, you might not lose your assets in the longer term – you might be able to come back and reclaim them after a few years.”</p>
<p>While political risks – in particular the risk of political violence – are often a significant deterrent to potential investors, with sound advice companies can successfully mitigate many of the risks. Implementing appropriate security measures, engaging with local communities, and selecting lower-risk parts of the country to do business in are just some ways corporates can cover themselves in higher-risk countries.</p>
<p>Beyond monitoring political risk hotspots, tell-tale macroeconomic signs – even in jurisdictions where political risk is not currently high – can help predict regions where problems may erupt in future. “We don’t just look at risks and perils,” explains AKE’s Drake. “There are lots of indicators to look out for too, including macroeconomic developments. If there is a massive economic downturn, that usually raises the risk of political risk incidents occurring – it could lead to more unrest in the streets, it could lead to the government resorting to hostile and unpredictable actions in an effort to restore its control and authority.”</p>
<p>Take the Eurozone, for instance. “We are seeing rising threats to the level of institutional stability which could have a knock-on effect on the investment climate,” says Drake. “There is a major risk of deflation in the Eurozone over the coming years and this could have a huge impact on voting patterns, and the overall trajectory of EU and Eurozone evolution, with quite significant threats to the ongoing existence of the Eurozone and the European currency.”</p>
<p>The Middle East also presents some interesting cases for the student of political risk. Political and social upheavals across the region have created challenges for corporates – some of which are easier to cope with than others, in this land of contrasts.</p>
<p>“Tunisia is a really good example of how a post-Arab Spring political system can evolve into what looks like an emerging credible democracy, where governance is more stable and there is potential for development. However, right next door you have got a complete basket case – Libya, which is falling apart with virtually no institutional framework, and is totally lacking in the evolution of civil society,” says AKE’s Drake.</p>
<p>Yet even in Libya some corporates are finding opportunities. “Despite the political environment in Libya, the oil industry is continuing to function – albeit under major threat with lots of interruptions – these companies are still pumping oil out of the ground and generating revenue.”</p>
<p>This goes to show that countries which appear to be disaster zones from the outside could still offer attractive opportunities to corporates. Lebanon is another example. “Throughout the civil war in Lebanon, the country’s banking sector managed to function completely, and it’s still regarded as one of the better run banking systems in emerging markets around the world.”</p>
<h3 id="enhancing-reputation">Enhancing reputation</h3>
<p>Companies that do business in politically risky countries not only stand to get an advantage on competitors who refuse to take the risk. They can also help bring stability to the country in question. “Corporates could be playing a major role in the stabilisation of the world by going in and investing in countries that are seen as more hazardous because that investment will eventually provide job security and stability in a country,” says AKE’s Drake. “By helping companies do business in unstable regions, this helps build an economic framework and eventually assists the development of those countries into something less volatile. You can’t build civic society without economic progress.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, by investing in a country when times are hard, companies can establish crucial reputational benefits if and when stability improves. “If you invest when a country is unstable and provide jobs to a number of people in a community, when the situation starts to stabilise in the longer term and the market becomes more competitive with more companies moving in, provided you have managed to remain in that environment, your company will be at an advantage, because there will be local brand recognition,” says Drake. “Investing in the local market during times of turbulence as opposed to leaving the country is likely to result in favourable treatment from local consumers, as well as the authorities, in the longer term.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Drake says the ‘three Ps’ are crucial when investing in countries with high political risk: presence, patience and perseverance.</p>
<p>However, while investing in politically risky countries when they are not ‘en vogue’ can bring reputational benefits to a corporate, reputational damage can also arise if this investment is not carefully controlled. “When countries are unstable, there’s more susceptibility to corruption – and the massive reputational risk that can result from this,” warns Drake. “Signing contracts with illiberal governments brings a high risk of corruption, which could come back to haunt the company in the longer term. If you are going to invest in an emerging market with high political risk, you have got to know who the key players are, and be mindful of the reputational risks of doing business – especially of doing bad business.”</p>
<p>In addition to the in-country risks of corrupt practices, many corporates are also subject to anti-corruption laws at home which extend to overseas operations. The UK Bribery Act, for example, has extra-territorial reach both for UK companies operating abroad and for overseas companies with a presence in the UK.</p>
<p>Corporate awareness of the political risks they are subject to varies widely. Given that they often operate in more unstable regions of the world, oil and energy companies typically have more sophisticated political risk monitoring capabilities. “In our experience, a number of corporates in the oil and gas sector have paved the way in terms of their knowledge, understanding and monitoring of these kinds of risks,” says Maplecroft’s Ingham. Shell, for instance, has a dedicated ‘Scenarios Team’ which is responsible for monitoring geopolitical shifts, as well as long-term trends in economics, energy supply and demand, and social change.</p>
<p>However, as supply chains become more and more internationally interconnected, corporates in other sectors are starting to pay more attention to political risk. “As a result of the increasing complexity of global supply chains, large corporates in several sectors are increasingly looking at the impact of political risk on their business in the way that companies such as some of those in the oil and gas sector have been doing for some time,” adds Ingham. “Many companies, either directly through their own operations or through their supply chain, are going into territories they have not been in before, and an increasing number are using systematic, comparable ways of assessing this risk.”</p>
<p>Maplecroft indexes the political risk of 197 countries across 52 indices. Its political risks include what it calls dynamic political risks, which focus on short-term challenges, such as rule of law, political violence, the macroeconomic environment, resource nationalism and regime stability, as well as structural long-term political risks, such as economic diversification, resource security, infrastructure quality, societal resilience and the human rights landscape.</p>
<p>In its 2014 Political Risk (Dynamic) Index, Somalia was ranked as the country with the highest political risk in the world, and was in the ‘extreme’ risk category, followed by Syria, Afghanistan, DR Congo, Sudan, the Central African Republic, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan, and Iraq (<a href="#diagram-1">see Diagram 1</a>).</p>
<p>And according to Ingham, the world is getting riskier. “Since 2012, we have seen a notable increase in the number of countries that we would consider extreme and high risk,” she says. “This category has gone from about 32.5% of countries in 2012 to 36.5% in 2014, and this growth has been driven by events in the Middle East and North Africa following the Arab Spring. Four out of our top ten riskiest countries are in the MENA region.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, countries tend to deteriorate much more rapidly than they improve. “At the end of last year, Ukraine was medium risk by our dynamic risk assessment. We have done two updates since then, and it has now moved to the 36<sup>th</sup> highest risk in the world,” explains Ingham. “The political violence level is the main driver behind that.”</p>
<h3 id="global-fragmentation">Global fragmentation</h3>
<p>But besides high-profile outbreaks of instability, such as that in Ukraine, why does political risk seem to be on the up in the longer-term? “There’s now a general trend of fragmentation in the world at all different levels – on a global level, regional level, national level, supranational level, and individual level,” says Andy Langenkamp, Global Political Analyst at financial research consultant ECR Research.</p>

<p>“The world is increasingly being divided into regional blocs. On the one hand this can be positive, because it encourages co-ordination and stability, but at the same time it undermines global corporates because these blocs are competing with each other. On a national level, there is increased nationalism – such as in India, Japan and Russia, and at the level below that there is a push for autonomy, as we have seen in Catalonia and Scotland recently. At the individual level it is much easier for people to contact like-minded citizens in other countries using the internet and mobile phones, which played a big part in events like the Arab Spring. This all goes to make the world much more unpredictable,” adds Langenkamp.</p>
<p>Often companies – even ones operating on a global scale – integrate their political risk policy within their broader risk management policies and leave it at that. But AKE’s Drake thinks many corporates could be doing more given the level of risk they face. “The potential losses in terms of assets, people, profits and reputational harm that can come about as a result of political risk is huge. Every company should have a board member who specialises in security and political risk, because something like the nationalisation of a company’s operations – even though it doesn’t happen very often – can wipe out your entire investment in a country,” he says. “Political risk needs to be addressed as part of an organisation’s core culture if it wants to specialise in investing in challenging parts of the world – and these challenging parts of the world might not be that far away at all.”</p>
<p>ECR’s Langenkamp believes companies are waking up to the importance of the risk. “Geopolitics is a big part of the backdrop of financial markets,” he says. “It is having a much bigger impact on financial markets and economies than it did five to ten years ago. Since the financial crisis, the corporate world has taken politics increasingly seriously as companies have started to notice that politics has a very big influence on their activity,” he says.</p>
<p>Maplecroft’s Ingham concludes that political risk per se should not deter corporates from entering a country. “We would never say to a company not to invest somewhere – it’s just about fully understanding the risk profile, and then making sure that a very robust risk management policy is put in place,” she says. “Continuity is important. It is not the particular level of risk, but uncertainty which creates the most challenges for corporates. If you know there is a high risk of political violence in a country, measures can be put in place to mitigate that – the challenge is if you don’t properly assess the risk and plan for the possibility of a rapid deterioration.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Investing in emerging markets (EMs) can be something of an acquired taste. Even while investors struggle to achieve a decent yield in developed markets, some still balk at the high risk they perceive to be inherent in EMs. Recent performance of EM stocks has done little to inspire investor confidence.</p>
<p>Indeed, EMs underwent a torrid end to the third quarter of 2014. In September, the FTSE Emerging Index, comprised of large- and mid-cap securities from advanced and secondary EMs, declined for seven days in a row, dropping almost 3% for the week. This was both the longest run of falls – as well as the largest weekly decline – since November of the previous year.</p>
<p>Increasing Treasury yields have historically harmed developing markets, and talk of the Fed potentially raising its benchmark interest rate has had this exact effect. “EM assets have again come under pressure as fears of higher US rates and a stronger dollar have outweighed the promise of additional liquidity from the ECB,” wrote Robert Burgess, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, in a research note published in September.</p>
<p>However, as has been widely reported by the financial press, some EMs’ current and prospective growth dwarfs that of many developed markets. For instance, both India and China have exceeded GDP growth in the US by at least 1.5% every year since 2001. What exactly are EMs, and what are the risks investors need to understand before venturing beyond developed markets?</p>
<h3 id="defining-emerging-markets">Defining emerging markets</h3>
<p>One challenge with emerging markets is actually defining what they are. The term itself is not particularly helpful. Considering that EMs now make up more than half of the world’s GDP according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the word ‘emerging’ appears to be something of a misnomer. Many of these markets have very much emerged already.</p>
<p>While it is reasonably safe to assert that some economies, such as the US, are developed, and others, such as Chile, are emerging, the exact measure of why some are EMs and others are not can be ambiguous. And many countries qualify as EMs according to some criteria but not others.</p>
<p>“There is no hard and fast rule for defining EMs – it’s an amalgam of lots of different things,” says Timothy Ash, Head of EM Strategy, Ex Africa at Standard Bank. “You can look at per capita GDP, but it is more subjective than that. There are also factors such as institutional capacity and strength, business environment, rule of law, legal system, and political stability. Some countries are clearly emerging markets, while others are borderline, and on top of this the parameters are constantly shifting.”</p>
<p>The Czech Republic, for example, makes it onto the FTSE Emerging Index (as one of its ‘advanced EMs’), but it does not qualify as one of the IMF’s ‘emerging economies’. Conversely, the IMF considers Estonia an EM, although the Baltic republic does not feature on the FTSE’s Index.</p>
<p>Another EM yardstick is the G10 currencies. The 11 economies that make up the confusingly named Group of Ten (comprising Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, the US, Germany and Sweden, as well as the 11<sup>th</sup> member, Switzerland, which joined later) are widely considered to be developed by most measures. Some investors and economists consider that anything beyond G10 could reasonably be an EM, although opponents claim it is an overly broad definition.</p>
<p>While there is some ambiguity as to what an EM is, there is more consensus around the benefits they present investors. The biggest of these is pure and simple yield.</p>
<h3 id="chasing-yield">Chasing yield</h3>
<p>“Yield is a big selling point for EMs, as there is really no yield left anywhere else,” Benoit Anne, Head of EM strategy at Societe Generale tells Treasury Today. “Quantitative easing policies undertaken by the Fed and other big central banks in developed economies have pushed rates to record lows for quite a few years now. This has driven a strong appetite for EMs among investors.”</p>
<p>Despite the attractiveness of EM yields, the markets are not immune to turbulence. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index hit 1,083 at the beginning of 2013, before falling to as low as 883 in June of that year – a fall of almost 20% (<a href="#chart-1">see Chart 1</a>). Only in Q3 2014 has it started to reach the heights of January of the previous year.</p>
<figure class="center">

</figure>
<p>“Of course last year there was a massive correction in EMs, simply because markets sometimes need to correct themselves when they become over popular and overpopulated,” adds Societe Generale’s Anne. “But overall EMs still offer a favourable environment. The European Central Bank’s recent big policy signal (to cut interest rates to a record low and to buy up private sector bonds, in September) is promoting this environment, and until the Fed starts hiking its rate, EMs will continue to be well positioned.”</p>
<p>This favourable environment for investment has been facilitated by economic, infrastructural, and political advances in many of the larger EMs.</p>
<p>“EMs have undergone a tremendous change with respect to the economic fundamentals over the past ten to 15 years,” says Maria Laura Lanzeni, Head of Emerging Markets Sovereign Risk at Deutsche Bank Research. “There is a very long-term structural trend in many of these markets towards better management of external debt, reduced exposure to dollarised debt and dollarised banking sectors, increased fiscal prudence as well as more central bank independence and anti-inflationary policies. These trends are obviously not present in all EMs, but overall the average EM is much better placed from an investment and risk perspective than in the 1990s.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, this contrasts with conditions in certain developed markets, which in recent years have not progressed in this respect, and have indeed in some ways regressed. A number of large developed markets have gone backwards, especially in terms of their fiscal accounts and public debt, including the Eurozone, Japan and the US. Given the very serious fiscal problems the governments of these developed nations are grappling with at the moment, EMs can therefore look relatively attractive to investors.</p>
<p>Standard Bank’s Ash concurs that recent events have made the case for EM investment somewhat more attractive in relative terms. “Some EMs are arguably less risky than some developed markets these days,” he argues. “Particularly in the case of sovereign debt, the European periphery crisis has proven that many developed markets are perhaps not what you think they are, and that perhaps the ability and willingness to pay off sovereigns in some EMs are better.”</p>
<p>He cites Poland as an example of this. Though an EM according to many measures, its balance sheet and willingness to pay off sovereign debt is superior to many Eurozone periphery countries, he says.</p>
<h3 id="first-world-problems">First world problems</h3>
<p>Beyond the yield benefits, diversification is another factor drawing many investors to EMs. “There is a structural drive among the investor base to allocate more of their assets to EMs simply to reflect these markets’ greater share of global GDP,” explains Standard Bank’s Ash. “Especially from a fixed income perspective, investment funds’ investment mixes are still generally underweighted in their exposure to EMs.”</p>
<p>However, as they compete with developed markets for investment, EMs have also started to experience some of the ‘first-world problems’ their more developed counterparts are used to. Rapid growth must also be handled sensibly and sustainably, otherwise it may be short lived.</p>
<p>Brazil, for example, once the darling of many EM investors and part of the BRIC group (also comprising Russia, India and China), has struggled of late. Partly on the back of foreign direct investment, its GDP rocketed from $504 billion in 2002 to a whopping $2.5 trillion in 2011 – almost a five-fold increase. In 2012 its GDP decreased to $2.25 trillion, and in September 2014 economists reduced their forecasts for the country’s expansion – the 15<sup>th</sup> downgrade in Brazil’s growth outlook so far in 2014. Brazil, which is the largest economy in Latin America, fell into technical recession in Q1 2014.</p>
<p>“As EMs come into the mainstream, they also become subject to the same trends and fluctuations in their business cycle that affect more developed economies” says Deutsche Bank’s Lanzeni. “Much of the euphoria that surrounded Brazil five years ago was perhaps premature, as lots of money flowed into the country, but reforms then started to falter, with obvious repercussions for the country’s growth. As economies grow, so too does the extent to which they are subject to global economic conditions at large.”</p>
<h3 id="currency-restrictions">Currency restrictions</h3>
<p>One key challenge to investing in EMs is the currency restrictions in place in certain jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“Currency controls and direct intervention in FX markets are key factors impacting both equity and fixed income investments in EMs,” says Societe Generale’s Anne. “The exchange rate policy a government pursues also needs to be considered before you invest there.”</p>
<p>The difficulty for those looking to invest in these markets is that these controls are often subject to rapid change. However, this change can also work to the advantage of investors. China is a prime example of an EM where rapid regulatory change is benefitting foreign investors.</p>
<p>“The possibilities from a currency standpoint in China today are significantly greater than they were two or three years ago. While a full-scale hedging programme for RMB risk is still not as easy as it is for euro-dollar risk, it is now feasible at least,” says Kevin Lester, Co-CEO at Validus Risk Management. “A fast-changing regulatory background is one of the defining features of EMs. It is important that treasurers take this into account when drawing up a risk management programme for EM investment, and that they remain adaptive and open to rapid developments.”</p>
<p>In addition to tighter currency restrictions, another argument sometimes made against EM investment is that many less-developed jurisdictions are rife with corruption. Obviously generalisations like this are of extremely limited value.</p>
<p>The Corruption Perceptions Index, published by NGO Transparency International, is a ranking of 177 countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. Countries are scored from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). In the most recent Index published in 2013, two-thirds of countries scored below 50, with none scoring the top 100 score and none the minimum 0.</p>
<p>Denmark and New Zealand topped the index with scores of 91, with Finland and Sweden in joint third (with a score of 89) and Norway and Singapore joint fifth (with 86). The most highly corrupt countries, according to the index, are Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia (joint 175<sup>th</sup> place, with a score of 8).</p>
<p>The Index suggests that EMs do tend to be more corrupt on average than developed countries. There are, however, some notable exceptions. Italy, a developed economy by most measures, comes in joint 69<sup>th</sup> place (tied with Kuwait and Romania on 43 points). Barbados, meanwhile, is ranked joint 15<sup>th</sup>(tied with Belgium and Hong Kong on 75 points), while Chile and Saint Lucia come in at joint 22<sup>nd</sup>(tied with France with a score of 71).</p>
<p>Of the BRIC nations, Brazil is the highest ranked, in joint 72<sup>nd</sup> place (tied with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sao Tome and Principe, Serbia and South Africa, with 42 points). Russia is the lowest-ranked of the ‘big four’, ranked joint 127<sup>th</sup> place (tied with Azerbaijan, Comoros, Gambia, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mali, Nicaragua and Pakistan with a score of 28). China comes in at joint 80<sup>th</sup> place (tied with Greece on 40 points), while India is ranked joint 94<sup>th</sup>(tied with Algeria, Armenia, Benin, Colombia, Djibouti, the Philippines and Suriname on 36 points).</p>
<p>Standard Bank’s Ash points out that the problem of corruption is not limited to EMs. “Corruption is everywhere, and we have seen high-profile corruption cases in developed markets. Clearly, high levels of corruption stall economic growth, slow investment, and make the business environment more challenging,” he says.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank’s Lanzeni concurs that there are a number of examples of corrupt jurisdictions in developed markets and ‘cleaner’ EMs. “Long-term corruption has a negative impact on a country’s growth prospects, and while this remains a problem in many emerging economies, there are examples of ‘islands of cleanliness’, such as Uruguay and Chile in Latin America, and Botswana in Africa – that is, economies in a region not characterised by above-average governance but which have themselves managed to stay relatively clean.”</p>
<h3 id="geopolitical-risk">Geopolitical risk</h3>
<p>Perhaps even more than corruption, geopolitical risk is a key consideration in investing in EMs.</p>
<p>“With multiple confrontations and conflicts taking place at any one time, the geopolitical context is a crucial risk point in weighing up EM investment decisions,” says Lanzeni. “While you may be able to know where there are tensions and unrest and analyse the environment that could lead to conflict, you cannot really predict exactly when something will erupt. The fact that the Arab Spring came as such a surprise to most if not all analysts, is proof of this.”</p>
<p>Despite this apparent difficulty in predicting when conflict situations might flare up, there are ways of assessing which countries are most at risk. Risk consultancy Maplecroft publishes an annual ‘Political Risk Atlas’, ranking countries in terms of the risk and placing them into five categories: extreme risk, high risk, medium risk, low risk, and no data. In its 2014 Atlas, Somalia was ranked the country with the highest political risk, followed by Syria, Afghanistan, Congo, Sudan, Central African Republic, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan and Iraq. All these countries were categorised as at extreme political risk.</p>
<p>In the study, Maplecroft said that since 2010, almost 10% of countries worldwide have seen a significant increase in the level of dynamic political risk, “with foreign investors facing increased risks of political violence, resource nationalism and expropriation.”</p>
<p>Beyond potential conflict situations, political events can influence the business environment in a country too. The Brazilian general election set for October 2014 is one key date that EM watchers will follow with interest.</p>
<p>Similarly, Argentina has been under the spotlight of late since the country’s debt default in July. The economy is not currently an attractive market for foreign investors, with the central bank’s foreign currency reserves at their lowest level for eight years, and inflation bordering on 40%.</p>
<p>“The situation in Argentina illustrates the political risk dimension that investors in EMs can be exposed to,” says Validus’ Lester. “Not only is the currency risk very significant, but the fact that an entire company can be seized from an investor without warning is even more of a danger.”</p>
<p>In the short to medium term, it seems the recent rocky patch EMs have experienced, with investors taking capital out to move to developed markets (particularly the US), will continue amid speculation that the Fed could bump up interest rates before long. One defining risk of EMs is that they can be much more prone to swings based purely on market confidence than more developed markets.</p>
<p>However, despite the risks, as long as interest rates in developed economies remain low, and provided that the BRIC countries, particularly Brazil, can get back on track, investors may well see EMs as an asset class to keep an eye on.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As part of their core business, a large number of companies are exposed to commodity prices over which they have no control, just as they have no control over exchange rates or interest rates.</p>
<p>“Commodity risk matters to treasurers for the same reason that most financial risks matter – it impacts the valuation and the underlying financial performance of the business. Indeed, commodity risk can have more of an impact as the price of some commodities can be much more volatile than foreign exchange movements,” explains Kevin Lester, co-CEO at Validus Risk Management.</p>
<h3 id="impact-on-operations">Impact on operations</h3>
<p>“The overall impact of commodity prices on companies’ cost bases has increased as a general trend over the last decade or so. Commodities are now a much more noticeable line item on the financial statements compared with other constituent costs, and the proportional impact of commodity inputs has attracted attention to the importance of managing this risk effectively,” adds Lester.</p>
<p>If, for example, an airline has a quarter of its cost base in jet fuel, and the jet fuel market is subject to a volatility of 20%, the company’s bottom line is de facto exposed to 5% of uncertainty deriving from the cost base. And if the airline is only making a profit margin of between 1% and 3% (US airlines achieved a 2% profit margin on average during the first half of 2013, according to the trade organisation Airlines for America), this 5% exposure to the price of jet fuel could have a significant bearing on whether they make a profit or a loss.</p>
<p>So what can companies do to help minimise this risk? “Treasurers need to focus on the big items – the big commodity risks to their business. After looking at their exposure on a commodity-by-commodity basis, corporates should identify the risks, understand the risk dynamics, seek out the solutions that are out there, and, if necessary, address those risks. This can be a painstaking process,” says Dimitris Papathanasiou, Financial Risk Manager at Coca-Cola HBC.</p>
<h3 id="hedging-your-bets">Hedging your bets</h3>
<p>Using hedging instruments to mitigate commodity risk is one such solution. The commodity markets allow both producers and consumers to hedge their commodity risks. For corporates with significant exposure to commodity prices, this is often a more effective approach than simply self-insuring using the company’s working capital.</p>
<p>Getting the right hedge is all about finding a derivative product which is highly correlated to the underlying price of the raw material that is required for the business. In general terms, the more liquid the market for a commodity, the easier it is to hedge. Oil, for example, is traded on many exchanges around the world and myriad derivatives are available on it. Crude oil – oil in its natural state – is traded in the form of a number of trading classifications: two of the most widely used benchmarks are Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent. Refined oil, in the form of diesel fuel, heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene, is also widely traded and hedged.</p>
<p>In less liquid markets, where there are fewer derivatives available for a corporate to hedge against the commodity risk to which it is exposed, basis risk increases. Basis risk is the risk of divergence between the price of a future and the price of the underlying instrument.</p>
<p>As a result of the relatively limited liquidity in the commodities markets, banks often avoid presenting sophisticated hedging structures to their clients. Many corporates therefore end up using quite basic instruments in hedging their commodity risk. “The derivative instruments used are very vanilla. The majority of what corporates do to hedge their commodity risk is plain, such as swaps on whichever index they’re really exposed to,” says Andy Hartree, Head of Commodity Solutions at Lloyds Bank. For example, one-, two- or three-year diesel swaps would be included in Hartree’s definition of a plain commodity hedge. “Even the corporates with reasonably sophisticated execution strategies often use straightforward instruments,” he adds.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="instruments">Instruments</h3>
<p>Derivatives represent a promise to buy or a right to sell an underlying commodity as opposed to outright ownership. Some of the instruments available include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Forwards</h5>
<p>– an agreement to exchange a commodity at a specified future time and price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Futures</h5>
<p>– an obligation to buy a commodity if the future is not liquidated before maturity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Options</h5>
<p>– the choice, rather than the obligation, to buy the underlying commodity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Swaps</h5>
<p>– an agreement whereby exchanged cash flows are dependent on the price of the commodity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Exchange of futures for physicals (EFP)</h5>
<p>– an agreement whereby a futures contract is traded for the actual commodity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Commodity derivatives are typically priced by comparing prices for the same commodity over different times, geographies and quality differentials (such as one grade of oil against another).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="thinking-outside-the-box">Thinking outside the box</h3>
<p>In extreme cases, corporates with high exposure to commodity risk can take matters into their own hands if they can’t find suitable hedging instruments. In 2012, Delta Airlines bought its own oil refinery in an effort to address high fuel costs. Delta said the refinery in Pennsylvania, for which it paid $150m, could ultimately save the company $300m a year in fuel costs. The problem for most corporates with fuel price risk exposure is they do not have the resources to purchase their own oil refinery!</p>
<p>Thankfully, even with esoteric commodities for which there are no direct derivatives, hedging can often be achieved through proxy hedges. These ‘derivatives through substitution’ enable corporates to partially hedge their risk in less liquid commodities by using derivatives in more liquid commodities that bear a positive correlation to the one they want to hedge. For example, a technology company with an exposure to the price of ruthenium could hedge this risk using, for instance, platinum or palladium derivatives, if the company were confident in the correlation between the price of ruthenium and the hedged commodity.</p>
<p>However, hedging these rarer commodities is not always an exact science. “When you buy in certain metals which are related to – but not perfectly correlated to – the price movement in underlying metals like copper, platinum or palladium, movements in the price you’re charged by your supplier may not fully reflect price movements in the market. Hedging these less liquid commodities can definitely take away a large portion of the risk, but it’s difficult to hedge out all of the risk,” says David Madden, an analyst at financial derivatives trading firm IG Group.</p>
<p>Of course, if corporates hedge against the risk of commodity prices going up, and prices go down, they can potentially lose out on their hedges. In 2008, United Airlines lost $544m in a single quarter on fuel hedges. However, even though United Airlines was hit by the hedging cost, it saved money from the fuel itself being cheaper.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="ifrs-9-chapter-6">IFRS 9, Chapter 6</h3>
<p>Evolutions in hedge accounting have also changed the landscape for those looking to manage their commodity risk exposure. The IFRS 9 Chapter 6 standard on hedge accounting, among other changes, allows corporates to hedge individual component inputs that were previously impossible, or at least extremely complicated, to hedge.</p>
<p>Under the old rules, it was not possible to individually hedge the components of non-financial items – such as the oil component of diesel fuel purchases. Under the new rules, these components can be hedged, provided the risk component is separately identifiable. Chart 1 shows some of the industries which stand to benefit from the new standard.</p>

<p>As we explain in this issue’s Back to Basics article on page 41, the previous IAS 39 hedge accounting rules had been the subject of criticism for not accurately representing corporates’ risk management practices, as well as for being overly complex and difficult to apply. Many believe the new rules will free up companies that previously wanted to do hedges that were sensible from an economic perspective, but prohibitively complicated from an accounting perspective.</p>
<p>Jeff Wallace, Managing Partner at Greenwich Treasury Advisors LLC thinks the new rules on hedge accounting will make things better for corporates looking to hedge commodity risk. “This is a sea change. More companies should now be seriously looking at hedging some of their smaller commodity risks that they couldn’t hedge under the old rules. With hedge accounting under IFRS 9 Chapter 6 corporates can get more effective hedges – and proving that they have an effective hedge is much simpler than before,” he says. “After years and years of complaints that hedge accounting was too difficult, didn’t meet corporates’ needs or hedge the legitimate risks of the business, the IASB has made a complete turnaround. Now corporates need to take advantage of this change and have another look at their commodity risk,” he adds.</p>
<p>However, others fear that any positives the new standard may deliver will be outweighed by other changes in regulatory conditions that have the opposite effect. “While the evolution of hedge accounting standards has undoubtedly helped relax previously over-rigid restraints, other regulatory changes such as Dodd-Frank and EMIR could put up further barriers to commodity hedging, discouraging a considerable amount more hedging than IFRS 9 Chapter 6 could ever encourage,” says Andy Hartree, Head of Commodity Solutions at Lloyds Bank.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="quotas">Quotas</h3>
<p>An interesting quirk in the world of commodities hedging is quota management – in particular in the agricultural space. These quotas often regulate supply and price, which can make planning ahead much more predictable for corporates exposed to fluctuations in the prices of those commodities – they do not need to (and in some cases cannot) go to the financial markets for these commodities.</p>
<p>The EU is the world’s biggest producer of beet sugar, producing around half of the total. As part of its Single Common Market Organisation, the EU regulates its sugar market in terms of a quota, reference price and a minimum guaranteed price to growers. While the world market price of sugar has fluctuated significantly in recent years, the EU reference price has remained constant since October 2009.</p>
<h3 id="awareness">Awareness</h3>
<p>As simple as it may seem, raising awareness of the impact of commodity risk is another fantastic tool in ensuring it is appropriately managed. Some corporates already have significant resources devoted to handling their commodity risk exposure.</p>
<p>”Many of the big household name companies often have teams of people focused on the full range of treasury requirements. They are experts in commodity risks, not to mention the other risks they are exposed to, so they have sophisticated, well thought-out strategies and a very good idea of what’s going on in the fundamental markets. They are almost like small trading operations in their own right,” says Hartree.</p>
<p>However, others, particularly in the mid-market space, are less aware of how to manage their commodity risk exposure. “They might not know how the fuel price they’re actually paying is generated, how it relates to an external benchmark market from which they can then get derivatives, and what their alternatives are in terms of fixed prices from their physical suppliers,” adds Hartree.</p>
<p>Lester believes that treasurers sometimes give commodity risk exposure less consideration than other risks. “Even in large Fortune 500 or FTSE 100 companies, in a lot of cases there is a much higher level of expertise in other financial risks, like currency and rates than the level of expertise in commodity risk. One of the main reasons for this is that the management of that risk is a lot less clear in terms of where it gets managed. So typically if you look at currencies and interest rates and most pure financial risks, they’re clearly managed within the treasury organisation,” says Lester.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that these financial risks can be extracted to a greater degree from a company’s underlying business processes.</p>
<h3 id="holistic-approach">Holistic approach</h3>
<p>It is also important to no longer view commodity risk management as an isolated discipline. Indeed, Yuri Polyakov, Head of Financial Risk Advisory at Lloyds Bank, believes commodity risk must be viewed as part of a corporate’s risk landscape as a whole. “Treasurers would also do well to take a more holistic view when looking at commodity risk. Commodity risk is not the only risk exposure they’ve got – they need to compare this with their FX and inflation risks,” he says. Think about a sterling-based company with exposure to the price of dollar-denominated fuel, for example.</p>
<p>“Looking at commodity risk as part of their wider risk picture, they need to play the integration game, and understand that ultimately the goal is to reduce earnings volatility,” adds Polyakov.</p>
<p>In 2012, management consulting firm Oliver Wyman set out a six-step approach to assessing commodity risk exposure, starting with commodity price projections and resulting in a holistic commodity risk profile (<a href="#chart-2-six-steps-to-create-a-holistic-commodity-risk-profile">see Chart 2</a>).</p>
<p>This should provide a good starting point for any treasurer looking to better manage their commodity exposures. But professional advice from strategic business partners, such as specialist risk advisory firms, or relationship banks, should also be sought.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Cash flow forecasting has long been a pain point for corporates. In this Back to Basics article, Treasury Today canvasses the experts for top tips to take the pain away.</em></p>
<p>Year after year corporate treasurers identify cash flow forecasting as one of the top areas in need of improvement. In Treasury Today’s European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study in 2012, it was ranked as the third priority, behind cash management/pooling structures and banking relationships.</p>
<p>But what makes it so difficult? A group treasurer at a Middle Eastern airline focuses on the complexity of the task due to the variability in the amounts, currencies and timing of business cash flows, as well as the impact of unpredictable changes in market prices for commodities (eg oil and fuel prices), exchange rates and interest rates. Many treasuries struggle with forecasting in countries where there are strict foreign exchange (FX) controls. In addition, there are more intrinsic issues related to the business, its infrastructure, organisation and geographical spread.</p>
<p>With a myriad of different technology systems and applications, including accounting, treasury management systems (TMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), spreadsheets and emails, having a consistent and integrated view across the company is a significant challenge. According to Joerg Wiemer, CEO of Treasury Intelligence Solutions (TIS) and a treasurer for 12 years previously: “Even the questions ‘how much cash does the company have?’ or ‘what is the cash flow over the past six months in a certain subsidiary, currency or customer?’ can be extremely difficult for a treasurer to answer. This is because of multiple ERP systems, data sources, the thousands of customers and hundreds of bank accounts that contain the information needed for forecasting analysis. The first step to accurate forecasting is to establish a single source of truth.”</p>
<p>Lisa Rossi, Managing Director and Global Head of Structured Liquidity Products (SLP) for Global Transaction Banking at Deutsche Bank, agrees: “Treasurers use spreadsheets and emails to share data, which creates a disjointed view between actual and forecasted positions, and does not provide for a seamless flow of information. If you don’t have a complete picture or full transparency how can you undertake solid cash forecasting?”</p>
<p>The infrastructure challenge may be tough, but so are the internal organisational hurdles. Brian Titus, Treasury Cash Analyst at global brewer SABMiller, says: “It is a challenge to make colleagues understand what information you need for forecasting. Sometimes they don’t fully comprehend the bigger picture and how important it is to get that information.” This isn’t helped, he adds, by a wide geographic spread which can affect the timing of the data. “If the data is out of date, it is less reliable.”</p>
<p>Relying on information sent by others is the main problem, according to Paul Stheeman, ex-treasurer and currently an independent consultant. “The difficulty for a treasurer is that they are not 100% in control of the numbers and are effectively relying on information provided by others. They need others to send good quality data on time and in the correct format.”</p>
<h3 id="is-the-gain-worth-the-pain">Is the gain worth the pain?</h3>
<p>Despite the level of difficulty, a reliable and trusted cash flow forecast is hotly sought-after and is considered to be a key performance indicator (KPI) for treasury. Respondents to Treasury Today’s European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study 2012 indicated that it was the number one KPI for core cash management efficiency and liquidity management.</p>
<p>Forecasting can also be the shareholders’ principal metric. Stheeman says, “I became aware of this in the private equity world, where I have been active during the past few years. Cash flow forecasting is the first metric they look at. More important than EBITDA numbers, it is the cash that they are interested in.”</p>
<p>For the Middle East group treasurer, an accurate forecast allows a company to be proactive in preparing for liquidity issues, as opposed to reacting to them. “This can have a significant impact on working capital costs, such as improved return on excess cash or lower funding cost on drawn facilities. In addition, it instils discipline and maintains a focus on cash throughout the business.”</p>
<p>Titus agrees, adding: “In the short term, it is all about cash management and ensuring that we have the right currency in the right place. If our forecast is not up-to-date, it may mean we have to go to the spot market and swap currencies when we could have planned it better. The long-term view is all about liquidity risk and whether we have covered our funding gap one or two years out.” Even though SABMiller can obtain a decent fixed interest rate at the moment, this won’t always be the case and therefore cash forecasting will only gain in importance for the company. His colleague, Alan Chitty, Treasury Controller, adds that with better forecasting, companies can also pay short-term debts back earlier and save money that way.</p>
<p>Successful liquidity planning, including analysing the gap between actual and forecasting, helps to better manage the company, according to Wiemer. “This will allow the treasurer to position their team as a business partner to the CFO because finally they can help the CFO to better manage the whole company. It is not just about better working capital management or optimising financial results, but also determining how important certain customers or suppliers are to the company.”</p>
<p>Both Deutsche Bank’s Rossi and Nancy Pierce, Senior Vice President (SVP) and Manager of the Capital One Bank’s Treasury Management Product Management Group, touched on the importance of good cash flow forecasting in risk management. As Rossi explains: “A lack of information can create blind spots – nobody wants blind spots when managing cash.”</p>
<p>Pierce talks of one client who used cash flow forecasting as a risk mitigation tool during the financial crisis. When a large proportion of the company’s lending froze up, treasury had to find other sources of funding. The company had a TMS in place but realised that it was only using about 10% of its functionality, mainly as an operating system for payments and receivables. Treasury worked with the software vendor on a project to reap the benefits of its technology much more broadly.</p>
<p>In addition, treasury put processes in place across the company to ensure that all the subsidiaries were using the tool and knew what they needed to input, as well as the proper controls around accuracy. It also switched to a more regional-based treasury structure so that all its subsidiaries were close to a centre of excellence. As a result, treasury was able to find trapped cash throughout the company that could help with its current commitments. That enabled it to alter the balance between bank funding and utilising internal cash. “It’s a great story of what this company accomplished in an urgent situation – it was able to marshal its forces and get it done quickly,” says Pierce.</p>
<h3 id="tools-for-improvement">Tools for improvement</h3>
<p>Technology plays a critical role in forecasting, but it is also a question of process governance, according to Wiemer. TIS’ cloud-based platform, which is delivered as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, includes a governance module which helps to define data collection and aggregation processes. “These need to be automated and streamlined,” says Wiemer. “Although it is possible in theory to roll out a treasury guideline and try to get people in a local subsidiary to stick to your rules, in real life they probably won’t even read them. This is why you need to roll out governance processes and technology as well. For example, TIS technology provides a step-by-step workflow that the local staff need to go through in data collection.”</p>
<p>Governance is hindered in many ways by the prevalence of spreadsheet usage in companies of all sizes. Christian Mnich Director Solution Management – Treasury Applications at SAP AG, spoke of a client that previously used an Excel spreadsheet globally – its subsidiaries access the spreadsheet on a single server and create rolling forecasts for the coming 12 months: “They struggled with the spreadsheet because they couldn’t see which subsidiary has already submitted a forecast or if someone has altered it.”</p>
<p>A client of Deutsche Bank used multiple spreadsheets to forecast their overall position, with subsidiaries sending cash updates via email on a weekly basis. The data would then have to be consolidated and evaluated. By using Autobahn’s Liquidity Manager app, the treasurer was able to take all account information, segmented in a way the team could understand and analyse so that each subsidiary’s account information was easily visible. “This meant he could see how effective their daily planning schedule was against actual payment flows – the system has a reconciliation tool that can match cash receipts and payments,” explains Rossi.</p>
<p>The platform also has an investment dashboard to monitor the company’s overall investment position. This allows the treasurer to understand their liquidity profile in addition to the allocation of counterparty risk, which are both important. Therefore, if a particular event is pending where he needs more funding, the treasurer can easily see where and when funding was available and accessible.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite implementing a new TMS globally SABMiller still relies on spreadsheets for capturing forecasts but they have been able to significantly improve its cash flow forecasting. As part of its ongoing ‘Project Griffin’, SABMiller rolled out IT2 NET, which is a remote, browser-based solution, around the regions. The majority of the subsidiaries’ forecasts come into IT2 NET through a pre-determined spreadsheet which looks and feels the same business-to-business. The treasury team was able to construct the spreadsheet’s rules and logic, and also prompts in terms of data ranges. Treasury also has macros embedded, so that it can pull specific information. The spreadsheet itself can’t be incorrectly uploaded into IT2 NET, so it is a combination of “an easy spreadsheet for people to use, reflecting what they are already accustomed to, and more controls over that information before it is imported into the IT2 system,” says Chitty.</p>
<p>“We could have gone down the route where they plug the numbers directly into IT2 NET screens, but in reality they would just be using their own spreadsheets, taking the numbers out and typing them in, which could introduce transposition errors. Therefore, we decided to let them use spreadsheets but have greater control over them,” he adds.</p>
<p>It is clear that both processes and technology are critical components of improving cash flow forecasting, but where do the banks come in? A number of banks say that the answer lies in their proprietary electronic banking (e-banking) systems, but many corporates are looking to be more bank-agnostic in their relationships. Robert Pehrson, Global Head of Liquidity Products, SEB, says that the most important thing that a bank can bring to the table is experience from other clients. “We too have a tool that supports the forecasting process. However, the tool itself is not the major benefit for the customer but the knowledge that we have built up working with other corporates.”</p>
<p>One of the first clients SEB worked with didn’t have centralised forecasting at the beginning. Today, the company has a daily process in place – by 8am it has a consolidated view of the balances for all subsidiaries, approximately 300-400 accounts. It also has daily, weekly and monthly forecasts. “This means they can act during the day on securing positions based on reliable data,” says Pehrson. “They also developed a rigid follow-up process for subsidiaries that don’t report according to plan. This is extremely important to give feedback to subsidiaries that might report late or with poor quality information. They have also put in place KPIs so that the subsidiaries are given an incentive to improve their information.”</p>
<h3 id="top-ten-tips-to-better-forecasting">Top ten tips to better forecasting</h3>
<p>When asked their advice on how to achieve better accuracy in cash flow forecasting, the experts interviewed for this article were not short of comment. Here are some of their top tips.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Use technology to your advantage</h5><br/>
<p>As SABMiller’s Chitty says: “You must embrace your technology and make it work for you”. Technology is a great enabler, but it must be calibrated for your organisation; according to Capital One’s Pierce, “you could have a lot of power there that isn’t used.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Integrate your systems</h5><br/>
<p>Once you have the technology in place, the systems need to be able to speak to one another. “Integration plays a major role, so the more operational systems you can integrate as sources the better the forecast will be,” says SAP’s Mnich.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Automate as much as possible</h5><br/>
<p>Almost everyone touched on this. The Middle East group treasurer comments: “Make sure you are able to obtain cash balances daily for all accounts in as automated a way as possible. This starting point forms the basis for forecasts.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Define your terminology</h5><br/>
<p>This starts with specifying the difference between short-, medium- and long-term forecasts and defining their parameters and usage. Nomenclature and formats are also critical, as well as a definition of global liquidity, which “shouldn’t be underestimated in terms of effort,” says Mnich.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Develop and standardise processes</h5><br/>
<p>“This relates to your internal information flows and accuracy, and people’s willingness and ability to follow the corporate practices and policies that are key,” says Pierce. “It is important to standardise processes and make sure your subsidiaries are all following the same practices and are able to capture the data needed for analysis.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Build internal relationships</h5><br/>
<p>The Middle East group treasurer suggests working closely with planning and budgeting to make sure both P/L and cash perspectives are understood and generated. In addition, build a close relationship with the big spenders in the business and set up a process to get their updated cash forecasts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Get buy-in from top management</h5><br/>
<p>“Very often people preparing cash flow forecasting at operations level consider this to be just another task that they have to do every week or however often you require it. To have CFO buy-in helps underscore the importance of cash flow forecasting. Otherwise people won’t be properly engaged,” says Stheeman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Feedback</h5><br/>
<p>It is important to go back to the subsidiaries with feedback as to how accurate it was and build in some KPIs into the process. “Over time you can view how well or how poorly they have done,” says SABMiller’s Titus. “That is the area we are looking into next – now that our colleagues are used to the process, it is all about improving it and having a KPI measure attached to it.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Make people accountable</h5><br/>
<p>Both Stheeman and Chitty advise making people accountable for forecasting, so that they actually make an effort with this. “If it just becomes a cut and paste job then people can quite easily carry forward mistakes,” says Chitty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Communicate, communicate, communicate</h5><br/>
<p>Although everyone touched on this point, Stheeman succinctly says: “Let everyone know what you are doing and its importance. Don’t roll out something and just say ‘this is our new cash flow forecasting tool, use it as of next week’. Make an effort to visit and educate the subsidiaries and business units.”</p>
<p>“People often talk about cash flow forecasting, and with Basel III and banks being more strategic about balance sheet, funding costs will be under even greater pressure. It is time that we stop analysing cash flow forecasting, and instead grab the bull by the horns and just apply good cash forecasting techniques using progressive technology,” says Rossi.</p>

<h5 id="krishnan-iyengar-vice-president-of-global-solutions-reval">Krishnan Iyengar, Vice President of Global Solutions, Reval:</h5>
<p>We’re seeing an increasing number of corporate treasury departments institute programmes to manage the risks associated with volatile commodity prices. Historically, commodity price risk management resided in procurement, but because treasury already manages exposures from fluctuations in foreign exchange (FX) and interest rates, bringing commodities into the purview of treasury’s holistic approach to risk management makes sense.</p>
<p>Sustained periods of commodity price volatility since 2005 have materially impacted corporate performance. For example, coffee prices fluctuated dramatically between 2011 and 2012, while during the same time metals dropped 68% and then spiked by 172%. This type of volatility has wreaked havoc on profit margins and many companies’ ability to price their products. It is natural that treasury, with its mandate to strategically guide the company’s financial health, manages risk across all asset classes.</p>
<p>We also have seen a decoupling of price risk from supply chain risk. This decoupling has allowed procurement to concentrate on managing supply chain risk (the risk of procuring commodities and delivering them when they are needed by the organisation), while treasury take ownership of managing the price risk associated with procuring these commodities. The major trigger for this decoupling seems to have been the global financial crisis, which allowed treasury departments to showcase their financial risk management acumen and cast into the spotlight the inherent risks prevalent in physical fixed price contracts.</p>
<p>Prior to the financial crisis, the most common method for procurement departments to use in managing the price risk of commodity purchases was to require suppliers to provide their commodities at fixed prices over a given time horizon. In times of low volatility, this strategy worked well; however in times of extreme volatility, this strategy pre-supposed that the supplier had the appropriate risk management acumen to run its own business. As the global financial crisis made painfully clear, this was not always the case.</p>
<p>The results we have seen from companies taking over the management of commodities indicates that treasury has successfully applied the financial risk management techniques they have always used, including examining natural offsets across the enterprise and the prudent use of derivatives.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Michael Schwartz" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2013/03/2013-03-tt-02-qa-michael-schwartz-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="michael-schwartz-svp-chief-marketing-officer-triple-point-technology">Michael Schwartz, SVP, Chief Marketing Officer, Triple Point Technology:</h5>
<p>The short answer is yes. Corporate treasurers must make managing commodity price risk a high priority in order to protect profits and remain competitive. Volatile commodity prices cause fluctuations in the cost of ingredients and subcomponents that, if not properly managed, will adversely affect profit margins and ultimately earnings. According to Gartner’s Predicts 2012 report, without effective risk management processes, commodity volatility easily translates to a double-digit percentage hit to the bottom line.</p>
<p>Many manufacturing and consumer products companies make the mistake of assuming that price spikes are a temporary thing, and think that they don’t need a strategic, long-term strategy for managing volatility. The fact of the matter is that commodity volatility is here to stay and companies that don’t take steps to mitigate its effects are in severe danger of being left behind.</p>
<p>In order to be successful in today’s environment, organisations must see commodity management as a strategic issue, not just a procurement challenge. They must move away from spreadsheets and embrace technology solutions that are specifically designed to manage commodity risk, such as Triple Point’s Commodity XL™. Commodity XL™ enables manufacturers to manage costs and risk exposures related to the price of raw materials, packaging and energy. It provides full transparency into commodity risk across all categories, divisions and geographies, along with access to real-time data and analytical tools that drive fast, accurate decision making.</p>
<p>Commodity risk exposure is no longer an issue confined to traditional commodity buyers, sellers and traders – it now encompasses companies further down the commodity value chain. Commodity volatility is not going away and the companies that implement a viable long-term strategy to manage volatility that includes leveraging the appropriate technology will secure a large competitive advantage. Those companies that continue to bury their heads in the sand, relying on massive, error-prone spreadsheets to manage commodity exposure, are setting themselves up for failure.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Jeff Wallace" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2013/03/2013-03-tt-02-qa-jeff-wallace-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="jeff-wallace-managing-partner-greenwich-treasury-advisors">Jeff Wallace, Managing Partner, Greenwich Treasury Advisors:</h5>
<p>If commodity risk is a significant factor in the pricing of the company’s revenue, then the answer is no treasury should not be concerned. In that case, the company is economically a trader in commodity risk and needs to profitably manage that risk. Trading skills are needed and typically corporate treasury by deliberate design has hedging, risk minimisation skills – not trading, profit-maximisation skills. The two mind-sets are quite different.</p>
<p>However, if commodity risk is a significant factor in the manufacturing input process, then the answer is yes. The alternative is allowing the purchasing department to manage the risk, and purchasing managers typically do not have any training in managing market risk, trading derivatives or hedge accounting, nor do they have the systems infrastructure. However, what they do have is an understanding of the supplier market in which the commodity is purchased, a market which is often quite different than the applicable derivative market.</p>
<p>Since the biggest challenges in any corporate commodity hedging programme is managing the basis risk between the particular purchase index and adder and the derivative index used to hedge it, the purchasing department should be involved as part of the commodity hedging team with treasury, accounting and operating management.</p>
<p>The volatility of this basis risk – which can vary substantially if the physical index is not highly correlated with derivative index and/or there are significant, frequent changes in the adder – can affect the economic and accounting effectiveness of hedge. Purchasing’s expertise is needed in negotiating purchase contracts that have indices more highly correlated with the available derivative indices and have adders that are fixed for as long as possible.</p>
<p>However, it is treasury’s job to explain to purchasing the contract restructuring alternatives for achieving this better matching. It is also treasury’s job to have a good technical understanding of the commodity derivative market, who the major market makers are (which are not always the global banks), buy the derivatives on a competitive basis, manage the counterparty risk and explain how the hedge accounting will work for the accountants.</p>
<p>These are easily transferable skills from treasury’s FX hedging. Since the objectives of hedging purchased commodity risk and FX risk – smoothing volatility or to lock in rates – are often the same, the trading tactics treasury uses to manage FX risk are often directly applicable to managing commodity risk. In addition, and equally critically, the systems infrastructure treasury uses to manage FX risk can be quite easily adapted to manage commodity risk.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Environmental pressures, extreme weather events, uneven supply and demand and the political landscape – all causes of volatility in the commodity markets and all potential risks for treasurers to manage. OpenLink’s front to back office treasury and risk management system (TMS) gives corporations the tools and the knowledge to measure, manage and mitigate those risks.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Commodity prices can have a significant impact on a corporation’s performance, and recent market volatility is a cause for concern. Prices of foodstuffs, such as wheat, have spiked in recent years for unexpected reasons – dry Russian summers and Indian export bans, for example – whilst others like cocoa and key industrial materials such as oil have risen and fallen again on the back of political turmoil in north and west Africa. Meanwhile, the backdrop to this is growing demand for a huge range of materials from China and other emerging market giants.</p>
<p>The breakdown of corporate ‘silos’ means the treasury function is increasingly responsible for monitoring overall risk exposures, including commodity risk. As a result, integrated solutions which monitor risk exposures and their impact on the business are required. Furthermore, the ability to take action to mitigate and hedge these exposures should be available within the same centralised system to ensure maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>The solution can be delivered in a number of ways, via ASP/hosted, or locally installed by the client. Most customers typically deliver the application to users via a thin client (eg Citrix), giving them the ability to provide global users with access to the application, via either mobile devices (eg iPad) or computers. This allows easy access, and controls are implemented from within the application – the customer has the ability to select which users have access to which specific functionality without needing to involve the vendor, allowing them to grow their use of the system as their business demands it.</p>
<p>Designed to boost automation in the treasury, OpenLink’s platform integrates with ERPs and other systems to minimise manual data entry and re-keying. The aim is to provide decision makers with the information they need to add value to the business. For companies with less need for constant updates and smooth automation, the system also allows data and other information to be uploaded/downloaded on a regular basis, as required, in either an ad hoc or automated fashion.</p>

<h5 id="what-are-the-major-challenges-treasurers-are-facing-in-the-commodities-space-today">What are the major challenges treasurers are facing in the commodities space today?</h5>
<p>Every business that produces goods has exposure to the volatile commodities market – whether it is grains, oil, metals – all of these corporations are at risk. In some markets, like the airline industry, the rising costs can be passed onto the consumer in the form of, for example, fuel surcharges. But that is not always an option: basic foodstuffs cannot be increased in price as commodities become more expensive without a major impact on society. This is not just about profit and loss for traders – these price changes have a very strong impact on real people.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-openlinks-platform-address-that">How does OpenLink’s platform address that?</h5>
<p>We allow treasurers to manage the firm’s risks across asset classes, enabling them to better monitor risk and view exposures, all within the setting of their business forecasts and budgets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All transactions can be shown alongside the business forecasts and exposures in real-time, allowing treasurers a clear view of their current positions and the status of all trades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treasurers want really useful, high quality output from their systems, rather than having to spend time re-keying and managing inputs. OpenLink can interface with a huge range of systems, from ERP to deal execution systems, all as part of a flexible framework, allowing data to be sucked in or pumped out easily, in real time if required, and in the required formats. There are as few re-keyings as possible, saving time and minimising potential for error.</p>
<p>OpenLink can be used as a platform for hedging and trading. For example, the trade orders can be entered in OpenLink, interfaced through to and executed in an online dealing portal system like FXall or 360T and reported back into the OpenLink systems in a completely automated manner.</p>
<p>All transactions can be shown alongside the business forecasts and exposures in real-time, allowing treasurers a clear view of their current positions and the status of all trades. That covers all asset classes treasurers need to see – fixed income products like money market funds, interest rates, swaps, options, equities, futures; right through to hard and soft commodities, energy, power, gas, and so on, within the same system. The required categories can be selected and shown in real-time, whilst unnecessary ones can be hidden from view.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-openlinks-tms-cover-the-full-commodity-lifecycle">How does OpenLink’s TMS cover the full commodity lifecycle?</h5>
<p>In one deal ticket, OpenLink’s system can capture all of the inputs required. To take the example of a business manufacturing and packaging a product, those might include the power and raw materials to make the required packaging and also the conversion of the raw materials for the finished product, as well as transportation inputs and associated costs. All of those constituent parts can be monitored through the whole process and hedged appropriately, through a single transaction, allowing the business to manage forecasts and budgets based on end products, rather than constituent parts.</p>

<h5 id="what-are-the-systems-additional-key-features">What are the system’s additional key features?</h5>
<p>Market and credit risk checks are available as standard in real-time. Counterparty limits can be checked both pre- and postexecution, giving users the ability to see where limits are still available for the particular trades, and on execution you can block trades with counterparties which are very near their limits, if required. Any number of combinations of limits can be configured by users.</p>
<p>All of the downstream, back office processing is managed – the resets happening on, say, floating commodity trades can happen automatically as trades move through their lifecycle. Payments and confirmations, invoice reporting and forecast updates can also all be managed in the system, enabling centralised viewing of the firm’s positions in real-time.</p>

<h3 id="suiting-each-treasurys-needs">Suiting each treasury’s needs</h3>
<p>A common criticism of software as a service (SaaS) systems is that they are very much ‘what you see is what you get’. “That might suit some treasurers, and keeps costs down for the vendors, but is an inflexible approach to providing treasury solutions,” says Richard. OpenLink’s service, however, is completely configurable. For example, a company which does not need the capability to hedge energy does not have to buy the licence for that aspect of the service. If their requirements change, they simply need to contact OpenLink to ask for a licence key to be sent over. The functionality is then enabled with no technical installation required. As this is one complete system, no feature is inaccessible and all features integrate with each other smoothly and seamlessly.</p>
<p>Indeed, the cross asset-class nature of the system means this configurability is vital to usability. A treasury is unlikely to need all of the commodities, equities and other instruments so they can be removed from view, meaning that the system is not cluttered and does not look more complicated than it needs to be.</p>
<p>“The system can be pared down to just one button which takes you to everything you want, or you can have, say, five buttons depending on the role you are performing at the time,” explains Richard. “When new features are licensed they can be configured to the treasurer’s specific needs and aims at the time.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“During the implementation phase, treasury staff are taught how each relevant task is conducted, when and why, how to control the tools and how to use the permissions they have.”</p>

<h3 id="training-the-trainers">Training the trainers</h3>
<p>To get the most from any system, internal resources must be used – but OpenLink makes sure these resources are put to the most efficient use. During the implementation phase, treasury staff are taught how each relevant task is conducted, when and why, how to control the tools and how to use the permissions they have. This is a vital step, allowing the treasury to stand alone without needing regular help from OpenLink once the system goes ‘live’. It also means that the treasury can further add functionality/configuration as the business develops.</p>
<p>User support groups exist too, with online ‘intercoms’ where customers can talk to each other to discuss common questions. OpenLink has established similar forums for specific groups of users with certain sets of requirements, so the wider community can become involved in a directed and easy to use way.</p>
<p>Support is still offered directly by OpenLink, though, with customer teams based in Vienna and New York. Customers can interact with these teams via web portals, email or phone. Every customer is assigned an account manager who has a strong knowledge of their implementation, the uses to which the system is usually put, and the most popular features. This strong and detailed relationship allows the most appropriate member of the OpenLink team to be assigned to any specific issue the corporate would like to address.</p>
<p>In addition, “OpenLink allows treasurers to manage risks across the whole supply chain, monitoring exposures alongside cash flow forecasts and hedged positions to give maximum visibility – at a time when these capabilities have never been more vital.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>An effective risk management policy is essential for treasurers looking to support business strategy while protecting the company from uncertainty in the financial markets. This Business Briefing looks at the key ingredients for a successful risk management policy.</p>
<p>In recent times, much has been written about the increasing importance of corporate treasury in the building and managing of successful businesses. Recent market volatility, an unstable economic environment and constantly changing economic forecasts have meant that most companies face higher earnings volatility, lower margins and tighter covenants than three years ago.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some corporates are presented with unique opportunities driven by very favourable movements in the financial markets. These challenges require companies to increase their efficiency at every level.</p>
<p>An important milestone in achieving this goal is formulating and implementing an effective risk management policy. For those companies which already have an established policy, this may be the time to re-examine the relevance and effectiveness of that policy in this new market paradigm. In this Business Briefing, we examine key elements of a strategic approach to financial risk management that will help treasurers to design and implement a risk management strategy which is well aligned with the business strategy and which provides adequate levels of protection from uncertainty in the financial markets, while controlling the costs.</p>
<h3 id="considering-risk-at-every-step-of-corporate-decision-making">Considering risk at every step of corporate decision-making</h3>
<p>A company’s overall risk exposures depend, amongst other things, on its asset mix, capital structure and funding strategy. For example, reducing the volatility of revenues by diversifying the asset mix could allow the company to be more leveraged. This, in turn, would dictate a proper proportion of floating rate debt in the funding mix. Additionally, a company’s revenue mix will have an impact on the optimal currency composition of its liabilities.</p>

</figure>
<p>Furthermore, the evolving nature of a business should be taken into account. What may not represent a significant exposure today could become a key risk factor five years from now. The complex relationship between financial and non-financial risks further increases the importance of aligning the risk management strategy with the business strategy.</p>
<p>Companies are also faced with the issue of absolute hedging vs. relative hedging. In particular, every company should balance its own risk tolerance with the risk appetite and hedging strategies of its close competitors. While it is important for companies to protect their own businesses from extreme adverse market movements, excessive hedging can become a competitive disadvantage in a favourable market environment.</p>
<h3 id="risk-management-strategy-is-the-key-element-of-success">Risk management strategy is the key element of success</h3>
<p>To ensure that a company is adequately prepared for dealing with the uncertainty of the financial markets, a rigorous, yet flexible risk management strategy should be in place. Three major components of such a strategy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evaluation of risk. Measure the company’s current risk exposure across different classes, taking into account that some of the risks enhance each other while others offset each other. At this stage a number of important questions need to be considered. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What role does business strategy play in establishing the risk management programme?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the total risk exposure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much does each risk factor add to the total risk exposure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the natural diversification benefits of non-perfect correlations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What move in each risk factor may cause a company to breach financial covenants?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining risk tolerance. Set the risk management targets based on the company’s risk tolerance, benefiting from the fact that total risk exposure is less than the sum of individual exposures. In the course of this exercise, the following points need to be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How much financial market volatility can a company absorb before the performance targets are compromised?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the appropriate risk measures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How should the risk tolerance thresholds be established?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining acceptable risk mitigation strategies and conditions for their implementation. Identify key ‘contributors’ to total risk, find optimal ways to mitigate them and choose the right instruments to implement the risk mitigation strategy. The focus should be on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When to initiate or change the hedging program and how to optimise hedge ratios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the relative value of different hedging strategies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to use the debt portfolio as a natural hedging instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the ways to reduce the net income or asset volatility?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is an optimal fixed/floating duration profile of the liability portfolio?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the impact of regulatory and accounting frameworks on risk management discussions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the tactical corridor to implement strategic changes?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Analyse company’s business strategy and balance sheet and establish whether FX, interest rates, inflation, commodities can impact future earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Monte Carlo methodology to simulate the various sources of uncertainty and future market dynamics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take into account historical and market implied relationships between all modelled market factors.</p>
</li>

<p>Identify appropriate risk metrics, eg worst case for interest expense, interest cover, net income, profit before tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate company’s performance on each of the modelled paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a natural distribution for each risk of the identified metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each relevant risk metric, establish the levels which should not be breached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify an individual contribution of each risk facet, taking into account its volatility, degree of exposure and diversifying impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dimension the hedging exercise by comparing the current risk levels with established risk tolerance thresholds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account hedging, market constraints, accounting and regulatory implications, identify the most efficient hedging strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering tactical indicators, establish a timeline for executing the proposed hedging programme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choosing-appropriate-risk-metrics">Choosing appropriate risk metrics</h3>
<p>The definition of risk is individual for every company. There are two fundamental decisions a person focusing on risk management should make:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In what terms do the exposures have to be measured? In other words, should the company focus on net income, margins, free cash flows, interest coverage, interest expense, etc?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much uncertainty is acceptable to the company around the chosen risk measure?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to run the risk management exercise on more than one parameter. For example, when hedging FX exposures, both cash flow hedging and net investment hedging are usually considered. When this complex approach is adopted, it is also important not to underestimate the impact of related risk factors.</p>
<p>To keep matters simple, some treasurers believe that measuring risk on the single parameter and single risk facet basis is more practical. However, the importance of risk diversification cannot be underestimated. While a single variable approach may make the risk analysis easier, it may lead to significant over-hedging which, in turn, leads to unnecessary cost and loss of opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="certain-volatility-can-improve-risk-profile">Certain volatility can improve risk profile</h3>
<p>The important parameter of risk tolerance is the amount of uncertainty that a company is willing to tolerate. Some treasurers prefer to manage their portfolios to the ‘minimum volatility targets’, in other words, to focus almost exclusively on the reduction of volatility of interest expense.</p>
<p>This approach can often create more cost than benefit. As can be seen from the graph below, if companies’ liabilities are completely hedged, the revenue volatility can cause the EBITDA coverage ratio to be breached. While the absolute level of interest expense remains the same, lower EBITDA will reduce the coverage ratio. Clearly a hedging strategy that would align top line movements with changes in interest expense could provide better protection in this case.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-measure-risk">How to measure risk</h3>
<p>It has become a standard practice to use the Value-At-Risk (VaR) approach to measure financial risks. In simple terms, VaR is very similar to volatility, or uncertainty, around the future value of a certain market factor or performance parameter. This approach to measuring risk, however, does not give proper credit to strategies that significantly improve expected outcome while introducing additional volatility.</p>
<p>Let us consider an example. We take a very simple debt portfolio which consists of one USD fixed rate bond issued today with the tenor of five years and paying 3.67% (reflecting a 1.67% five year swap rate and 2% credit spread). Over next five years this portfolio will not have any interest expense volatility – the bond will continue to pay 3.67%. Let us now assume that this bond is swapped into a floating rate. Generally speaking, this portfolio will now incur the interest expense of USD LIBOR + 2%, or around 2.29% if the current rates prevail.</p>
<p>If interest rate risk is measured as volatility, then our new, swapped, portfolio is clearly riskier. However, once the fact that the volatility of the swapped portfolio is centred around the lower number is taken into account, we may find that not only expected interest expense, but also ‘worst case’ interest expense of the new portfolio are better than those of the original fixed rate portfolio.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming of measuring risk as volatility should be mentioned here. As a measure of uncertainty, volatility is only informative for normal and log-normal distributions. Once the focus is turned into real life, uncertainties may not follow the rules of mathematical distributions and volatility measures can be deceitful. For example, for any so-called ‘fat tailed’ distribution, volatility measures would fail to capture the extent of the possible losses.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, more and more treasury professionals recognise the need to consider ‘worst case’ outcomes instead of volatility and at the same time turn their attention to those tools that allow the analysis of natural or so called ‘non-parametric’ distributions.</p>
<h4 id="measure-in-time">Measure in time</h4>
<p>Once an appropriate risk metric is chosen and a measuring methodology is in place, it is important to follow the risk dynamic over time. A number of key risk factors change with time, impacting the total risk exposure. First of all, the markets move. Second, the balance sheet’s exposure to the market changes due to business volatility. This means that the risk exposures today are not the same as they will be in one year, two years, three years and so on. Moreover, the economic risk, that is to say the total impact over a period of time, may be very different from reporting risk or uncertainty experienced from one period to another.</p>
<p>The chart below demonstrates the evolution of a company’s interest cover ratio over time depending on the fixed/floating composition of the company’s debt portfolio. The blue lines correspond to the 100% fixed rate portfolio (expected and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile worst case). The red lines correspond to the 100% floating portfolio (expected and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile worst case). As the chart shows, what is not a concern today can easily become a critical risk factor three years from now. This analysis, prepared for a major UK corporate, became an integral part of the company’s risk management discussion.</p>

<p>Balancing economic and reporting risk is an important task. Whereas from the value creation perspective, a treasurer should focus on the overall economic impact the financial markets can have on the business, from the reporting stand point, period-to-period uncertainty needs to be managed. To find an appropriate trade-off between these two objectives, risk professionals turn to the ‘path dependent’ approach.</p>
<p>When risk is evaluated it is important not only to measure it, but also to gain an understanding of the market dynamics that would lead to the worst case performance outcomes. Interestingly, it is quite often the case that a perfect financial storm is caused by insignificant movements of individual market factors. For example, a UK-based industrial company could sustain a wide range of individual volatility in EUR/GBP, electricity cost and UK and European interest rates. However, if a number of these market variables move together a company will experience a noticeable impact on earnings.</p>
<p>As a part of the risk management exercise the risk factors should be modelled consistently, on the period-by-period basis. A risk manager can then study those paths that cause a company to breach its risk tolerance target. Gaining the insight into the ‘problematic’ paths is very useful for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The extent of the moves in each risk factor can be better appreciated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This approach can be utilised as an early warning mechanism to prepare for financial storms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The efficiency of hedging instruments can be evaluated under the stressed market conditions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dont-dismiss-optionality">Don’t dismiss optionality</h3>
<p>When evaluating the efficiency of hedging strategies, many risk professionals have to find a balance between the level of protection and the cost of hedging. This cost can come from premiums paid for protection or from the opportunity costs associated with buying certain instruments. In the very same way that we evaluate the insurance premium relative to the level of protection we obtain by purchasing an insurance policy, we should always compare what it will cost to achieve a desired level of protection in the financial markets.</p>
<p>There are times when opportunity costs are simply too high and paying an option premium (to gain protection without losing the opportunity) makes it more prudent. For example, when a yield curve is very steep and market implied volatility is relatively low, it may potentially be better to go with a capped floating solution rather than a fixed rate debt.</p>
<h3 id="choice-of-instruments-accounting-friendly-or-not">Choice of instruments – accounting friendly or not</h3>
<p>When choosing hedging instruments, companies often limit their choice to those with favourable accounting treatment. These are selected mostly because they do not add any accounting volatility and are easier dealt with internally. However, in certain cases, instruments with embedded optionality provide very efficient protection. Under these circumstances it is important to evaluate the degree of net income volatility reduction which is achieved by these instruments, add back a possible mark-to-market volatility generated by the hedging instruments and then decide if there is a net benefit.</p>
<p>This calls for a higher degree of integration between the risk analytics and accounting evaluation of proposed risk management strategies.</p>
<h3 id="choose-the-right-tools">Choose the right tools</h3>
<p>As risk management gets more and more complex, access to a good set of tools becomes a key component for the successful design and implementation of a risk management programme. These tools should allow a treasurer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Measure current risk exposures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model relevant market factors on the period-by-period basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress test the relationships between relevant market factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overlay the balance sheet and its evolution over the modelled market environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the universe of hedging instruments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate hedging strategies, taking into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transaction costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounting implications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce intuitive analysis which will allow for suggested strategies to be vetted and accepted internally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Questioning assumptions, re-evaluating models and adapting conclusions form the basis of the risk manager’s inquisitive mind-set, which is essential to good risk management in a world of ever-changing financial risks.</p>
