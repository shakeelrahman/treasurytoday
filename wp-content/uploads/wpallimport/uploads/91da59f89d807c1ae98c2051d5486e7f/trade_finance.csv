<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Today, supply chain disruption and rising inflation are effectively driving each other, says Andrew Burns, SVP EMEA at working capital solutions provider C2FO.  “Obviously, supply chain disruption causes restrictions on goods and the timing of goods, and costs go up,” he says. “That fuels inflation, which then itself fuels increased costs and restricted supply.”</p>
<p>As Burns observes, this is a damaging situation for supply chains. “Ultimately, what you’ve got is rising costs going up through the supply chain to the buyers, who then have to consider whether to pass this on to customers – which is the worst thing to do really, because it then makes inflation much more structural.”</p>
<p>For economists, says Burns, a key question is whether or not the inflation arising in today’s market is here to stay. If the current inflation is temporary, the impact on wages, supply chains, organisations and consumers will be less severe. If, however, inflation becomes more ‘sticky’, it will have a lasting impact on core services such as energy and food prices, locking in higher prices and exacerbating supply chain disruption.</p>
<h4 id=""breaking-down-silos"">Breaking down silos</h4>
<p>As companies look for ways to overcome supply chain challenges, internal silos can present a real obstacle. <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/responding-to-inflation-and-volatility-time-for-procurement-to-lead"" target=""_blank"">An article published last year by McKinsey</a> cited the example of a company that stockpiled steel from various suppliers, expecting prices to rise further. “However, because procurement did not coordinate with the supply-chain team, the warehouses were inundated with so much steel that it had to be kept outdoors,” notes the article. The result: “a pile of rusty steel – and a bleeding balance sheet.”</p>
<p>During the pandemic, says Burns, many companies have spent time working to remove internal silos so that they can coordinate internally more effectively – an approach that is now helping to offset some of the disruption brought by inflation. He adds, “When you put different people in a room together, it allows for innovative ideas to be nurtured. That’s where I’ve seen companies be the most successful in reacting to these black swan events.”</p>
<p>Also important, says Burns, is that this collaboration should be directed towards helping the company’s suppliers: “A lot of organisations feel they’ve got a good handle on their more strategic suppliers – but when you deal with massive supply chains, with tens of thousands of suppliers, there is so much risk building up in the supply chain that it’s difficult to see and judge the impact of disruption.” Likewise, says Burns, collaborating with suppliers can help to mitigate the impact of inflation and rising costs.</p>
<h4 id=""supply-chain-sustainability"">Supply chain sustainability</h4>
<p>Inflation is not the only challenge companies are facing in today’s market. As the focus on sustainability continues to grow, Burns notes that in the context of supply chains, this can mean both ensuring the continuity of supply, and building an environmentally friendly sourcing and supply chain. “Increasingly, ESG is a major priority for organisations, and we’re seeing a huge shift towards making sure suppliers have green credibility,” he adds.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about energy supply arising from the Russia-Ukraine war is also prompting companies to review their energy sources, with a focus on making sure future access to energy is environmentally friendly. “I think we’ll see much greater investment in green sources in order to prevent these kinds of shocks and help companies be more sustainable – not just in terms of supply, but also in their green credentials,” Burns notes.</p>
<h4 id=""supporting-flexible-liquidity"">Supporting flexible liquidity</h4>
<p>In the current environment, Burns says, liquidity “is absolutely key for suppliers” when it comes to purchasing the goods they need to do business on a timely basis and at an affordable cost. However, he argues that existing tools such as supply chain finance and access to credit lack the flexibility companies need to provide liquidity for all their suppliers.</p>
<p>“In a supply chain finance programme, banks buy receivables from suppliers, which requires a lot of Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering documentation,” he explains. “So you can’t suddenly expand your supply chain finance tool to tens of thousands of suppliers. And if you’re looking at debt, there’s a lot of regulation, and a lot of time and costs are involved in the documentation, which means it isn’t flexible enough to react to business needs.”</p>
<p>Offering a different approach, C2FO provides a single platform that suppliers of all sizes – not just the largest or most strategic – can use to accelerate invoices that have been approved by their customers in return for a small discount that is typically cheaper than their alternative cost of funding. As Burns explains, suppliers can access liquidity without having to work through all the documentation required for debt and SCF – “giving everybody the flexibility they need to react in the short term.” Procurement teams also face challenges when rolling out programs due to resource constraints – an issue that Burns says C2FO has addressed by taking ownership of engaging and educating suppliers through hundreds of supplier support representatives.</p>
<p>In today’s environment, says Burns, larger organisations with access to liquidity are increasingly looking to use that liquidity on a short-term basis to support their suppliers. “Suppliers can buy goods quicker and purchase more stock, which then prevents costs from being driven up to the buyer,” he says. “Everybody benefits – you’re strengthening your supply chain by reducing the risk built up in your suppliers, and you’re preventing inflation from seriously impacting the organisation.”</p>
<p>In summary, the prospect of rising inflation poses a significant challenge for companies around the world – but there is much that companies can do to address this issue, from breaking down internal silos to adopting a more flexible approach to liquidity.</p>

<p><em>In 2021 Treasury Today Group and Citi bring you a new series dedicated to the topics of the moment. This audio centred content series brings together leading voices from across Asia Pacific. From academics to corporate treasurers to financial leaders, we will focus on the issues affecting corporate decision makers against a backdrop of the pandemic and global risk.</em></p>
<p style=""margin:2em 0 2em 0;""><a class=""button--red-stroke"" href=""/podcasts/citi-digital-dialogues-2021"" target=""_blank"">Listen to podcast</a></p>
<p>In this episode of Digital Dialogues, Citi’s Kanika Thakur spoke about trade finance trends in APAC, while Nanyang Technological University’s Kwok-Yan Lam shared his views on developments in data security.</p>
<h4 id=""innovation-in-trade-finance"">Innovation in trade finance</h4>
<p>Kanika Thakur explained that the last year has brought plenty of innovation in the trade space, including the adoption of blockchain and the digitisation of processes and flows. As Thakur said, “We’ve seen shippers looking at electronic bills of exchange; we’re seeing insurance partners looking at potential electronic solutions; we’re looking at governments finding more digital ways to engage with exporters, importers and banks.”</p>
<p>Other developments include the increasing sophistication of supply chain financing solutions, which are now extending to the second and third tiers of supply chains, as well as taking advantage of partnerships with fintechs. “Last but not least, the increased interest from our clients in ensuring that their whole ecosystem is part of the supply chain solutioning space is a very key development – and this has extended to sustainability,” said Thakur, noting that ESG is set to play an even bigger role in the future in terms of how trade can help clients achieve their own sustainability goals, as well as making their suppliers more sustainable.</p>
<p>Thakur turned to the collaborative work that Citi is undertaking with clients, citing a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) client in Asia, which was keen to unlock sustainability within its supply chain. She described how Citi worked with the company to encourage its suppliers to set sustainability goals, with a financing benefit available from the bank for suppliers that meet their goals.</p>
<h4 id=""next-developments"">Next developments</h4>
<p>Turning to future developments, Thakur said she was looking forward  to seeing the current trade digitisation journey continue, adding that where ESG is concerned, “I’m very excited about the contribution that a bank like us can make in that space.”</p>
<p>Thakur also referenced the growing levels of acceptance of electronic bills of exchange in markets such as Singapore. In India and China, she added, the regulator is playing a very active role in the digitisation of trade, while fintechs and marketplaces are increasingly playing a role in intermediating the market via consortiums. “Banks like us are playing a key partner role in Singapore, for example, where we’re one of the investing and key members of a blockchain platform called Contour, that helps digitise and hasten the whole documentary trade process.”</p>
<h4 id=""tackling-the-cybersecurity-threat"">Tackling the cybersecurity threat</h4>
<p>In the second half of the podcast, Professor Kwok-Yan Lam from Nanyang Technological University spoke about the work he is doing in the areas of data security and computer science. “In the last year or so, we have done more work on the cybersecurity of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially with relevance to smart cities or smart nation applications,” he said. Going forward, Lam said he expects to see a lot of IoT devices sensing the environment and transmitting data to the cloud, where analytics and automated decision making will take place. “So there will be different types of cybersecurity issues.”</p>
<p>Another area of focus is the use of AI to improve cyber attack detection capabilities. Lam said that one problem today is that people are able to access a lot more data – “and when there’s so much data, inspecting the transaction logs, audit logs or network logs will be overwhelming.” With this in mind, a spin-off from the university is looking to commercialise analytic techniques to automate the analysis of cyber threat intelligence reports.</p>
<p>Lam also discussed the role of blockchain in the trade finance space. “People have been talking about the use of blockchain in order to allow different stakeholders in trade finance or supply chain to ensure data integrity, or to eliminate fraudulent transactions,” he noted.</p>
<h4 id=""security-and-data-privacy"">Security and data privacy</h4>
<p>Turning to the importance of security and data privacy, Lam spoke about the vulnerability of client devices to malware or cyberattacks, and the risk that if a laptop is compromised by malware, fraudulent transactions will then be performed on the user’s other devices. As such, there is scope to focus on the use of secure multi-party computing to support wallet transactions, “so that even if one device is attached, at least it will not automatically enable the attackers to generate four million transactions.”</p>
<p>Finally, Lam shared his thoughts on what corporates need to be aware of this year. Alongside IoT security for smart cities and the use of AI techniques to enhance cybersecurity, he noted the importance of addressing privacy issues. “What we are looking at is how to address the security and privacy aspects when people try to perform analytics for fintechs, or for the digital economy,” he explained. “The other thing is that when assets are virtualised, the protection of the title of the asset could be another emerging problem that I think we need to focus on.”</p>

<h4 id=""japan-as-a-market"">マーケットとしての日本</h4>
<p><strong>日本は、非常に近代的で、技術志向が強く、世界的にイノベーションを推進しているデジタル国家だというのが、海外からの一般的な評価です。トヨタのような日本企業は、最先端の製品を作るだけでなく、その革新的な働き方を輸出することでも知られています。では、多くの日本企業がいまだに専門的なシステムを使わずに手作業で貿易書類を処理していることに驚きましたか？</strong></p>
<p><strong>KL:</strong> そうですね、ちょっとした驚きです。現地の銀行や企業を直接訪問して調査し、理解したことは、パンデミック状況に紙文書の使用を減らすよう求めるESGの圧力のおかげで、日本の貿易のデジタル化への取り組みが活発化していることを明らかにしています。貿易金融サービスを強化するために、メガバンクはブロックチェーンや企業とのネットワークを構築し、文書の共有を促進するために多くの投資を行っています。 しかし、地方銀行やその顧客である中小企業の場合は、開発の範囲は限られており、銀行は依然として紙やファックス、電子メールを使ったコミュニケーションの処理で顧客にサービスを提供しています</p>
<h4 id=""the-trade-digitisation-journey"">貿易デジタル化の旅</h4>
<p><strong>日本も参加している今年初めのG7宣言により、日本のデジタルトレード導入は転換期を迎えているのでしょうか？</strong></p>
<p><strong>EBW:</strong> G7宣言はまさにターニングポイントでした。最近発表されたICCの報告書によると、すべての参加国が完全にデジタル化され、電子貿易文書の転送に関する新しい基準を採用すれば、G7の貿易額は2026年までに40％以上増加し、9兆米ドルに達すると考えられています。日本の企業は、規模の大小を問わず、今こそ銀行に変革を求めるべきであると思います。消費者の世界では、日本は他のG7諸国と同様にデジタルサービスで飽和状態にあり、私たちはそれ以上のものを期待するようになっているからです。ビジネスの世界、特に日本の経済の健全性と幸福の基盤である貿易の世界でも、同じことが言えるでしょう。銀行がより良い顧客サービスを提供するために、貿易金融業務のデジタル化を余儀なくされているのであれば、企業は変化の推進者であるだけでなく、その恩恵を受け、成長の促進者でもあるのです</p>
<p><strong>では、日本の銀行、ひいてはその顧客である企業のデジタル化のニーズに応えるために、Surecomp社は何をしているのでしょうか？</strong></p>
<p><strong>KL:</strong> Surecompは、デジタル貿易金融の分野で確固たる地位を築いており、また、世界有数の銀行や欧州最大級の企業を含むグローバルな顧客基盤を有しているため、当社のグローバルスタンダードを日本に導入するのに最適なタイミングだと思います。例えば、社内のインフラが整っていないためにデジタルチャネルを持たない中小規模の銀行が、業務効率化のために貿易金融のバックオフィス処理を改善しようとしているケースが見受けられます。Surecomp社のTrade Finance-as-a-Service（TFaaS）ソリューションは、中小規模の銀行向けに特別に設計されたウェブベースのバックオフィスソリューションで、わずか10週間で導入することができ、クラウド導入への需要の高まりに対応しています。これにより、銀行は必然的に、紙ベースのマニュアル処理から完全に脱却するために、フロントオフィスのコーポレートチャネルをデジタル化したいと考えるようになるでしょう。また、企業は、Surecomp社のデジタル貿易金融ソリューションを直接利用することで、業務効率を改善し、貿易取引量の増加を図ることができます。</p>
<p><strong>企業を対象とした仕事についてもう少し詳しく教えてください。？</strong></p>
<p><strong>KL:</strong> 私たちは、世界中の企業と提携して、取引のライフサイクルを効率化するために最適な貿易金融ソリューションを提供しています。例えば、日立エネル ギーと提携し、同社が世界各地でクレジットライン契約を結んでいる30行以上の銀行との間で、大量の銀行保証の処理を支援しています。当社は、あらゆる規模の企業と協力して、貿易金融業務の自動化による時間の節約、コストの削減、成長の促進を支援しています。様々な業種の企業に対して、銀行保証、グループ保証、受入保証、輸入・輸出・スタンドバイ信用状、輸入・輸出回収、未決済口座、輸出金融など、すべての金融機関の貿易金融ポートフォリオを一元的に把握することができます。これにより、企業は可視性と管理性を高め、成長を促進することができます。</p>
<h4 id=""the-journey-ahead"">これからの旅</h4>
<p><strong>日本は他国に比べてやや閉鎖的な市場であるため、外部から顧客を獲得するのは困難です。これをどのように克服しようと考えていますか？</strong></p>
<p><strong>EBW:</strong> 適切なアプローチを見つけることが重要です。日本に関しては、現地のアプローチが不可欠です。オフィスを開設した後の最初のステップは、日本語のウェブサイトを立ち上げ、グローバルな活動をサポートする現地チームを作ることでした。現在、現地のスタッフを増員しているところですが、日本で事業を展開しているお客様と長年にわたって築いてきた関係を活用していきたいと考えています。日本の市場は、人間関係と信頼で成り立っています。Surecompがこれまでに培ってきたこの2つの特性が、お客様の信頼につながっているのです。</p>",,https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/trade-and-supply-chain/trade-finance/2022-02-10-tt-00-sf__financial-graph-on-technology-abstract-background-1689685042__1920x1080.jpg,2022-02-01,Trade Finance,True

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h4 id=""japan-as-a-market"">Japan as a market</h4>
<p><strong>A common outside view of Japan is that it is a very modern, very tech-oriented, very digital nation that is driving innovation globally. Japanese corporations like Toyota, are not just synonymous with building state of the art products, but also in exporting the innovative way they work. So, has it been surprising to find that lots of Japanese corporations are still processing trade documents manually without using specialised systems?</strong></p>
<p><strong>KL:</strong> Yes, it is a little surprising, although it’s a tale of two halves. Through research and understanding from talking directly with local banks and corporates, it is clear to see that - thanks to the pandemic and increasing ESG pressure to reduce the use of paper documents - Japan’s trade digitisation efforts are now ramping up. Poised to enhance trade finance services, there is a lot of investment from the megabanks into blockchain and into building networks to connect to their corporates and facilitate document sharing.  However, for the regional banks and their clients who are mostly SMEs, the extent of development is limited, and banks are still servicing their clients through physical paper, fax and email-based communication and processing.</p>
<h4 id=""the-trade-digitisation-journey"">The trade digitisation journey</h4>
<p><strong>Are we at a turning point for the country’s digital trade adoption thanks to the G7 declaration earlier this year of which Japan is a part?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EBW:</strong> The G7 declaration was absolutely a turning point. In the recently published ICC report it is now thought that trade across the G7 could increase by over 40% to US$9tn by 2026 if all the participating countries fully digitise and adopt the new standards pertaining to the transfer of electronic trade documents. Now is absolutely the time for Japanese corporates, big and small, to start demanding change from their banks. Afterall in the consumer world, Japan like all the other G7 countries, is saturated by digital services and we have come to expect nothing less. So why should it be different in business, especially in the world of trade which is fundamental to the countries’ economic health and wellbeing. If banks are forced to digitise their trade finance operations in order to provide a better customer service, the corporates are not only the drivers of change, but the beneficiaries of it and facilitators of growth.</p>
<p><strong>So, what is Surecomp doing to address the digitisation needs of Japanese banks and in turn their corporate clients?</strong></p>
<p><strong>KL:</strong> Surecomp’s strong heritage in digital trade finance and our global customer base, including many of the world’s leading banks and some of Europe’s largest corporates, mean it is the perfect time to bring our global standards to Japan. For example, we are now seeing many small to mid-sized banks who don't have a digital channel through which to service their customers simply because they lack the internal infrastructure, seeking to improve back-office trade finance processing to accelerate their own operational efficiency. Surecomp’s Trade Finance-as-a-Service (TFaaS) solution which is a web-based back-office solution designed specifically for small to mid-sized banks, can be onboarded in just ten weeks and meets the demand for an increasing appetite for cloud adoption. This will inevitably lead to banks then wanting to digitise their front-office corporate channel to completely move away from paper-based manual processing. Corporates themselves can also benefit directly from Surecomp’s digital trade finance solutions to improve their own operational efficiencies and drive trade transaction volume growth.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit more about the work you specifically do with corporates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>KL:</strong> We partner with companies across the world to provide trade finance solutions that are perfectly tailored to streamline the transaction lifecycle. For example we work with Hitachi Energy to help process its high volume of bank guarantees across the thirty plus banks with which it has credit line agreements across the globe. We work with corporations of every shape and size to help them to save time, reduce costs and drive growth by automating their trade finance operation. Serving a diverse range of industry sectors, we provide a single consolidated view of their trade finance portfolio across all financiers including bank and group guarantees, incoming guarantees, import, export and standby letters of credit, import and export collections, open accounts and export financing. It empowers companies to drive growth through increase visibility and control.</p>
<h4 id=""the-journey-ahead"">The journey ahead</h4>
<p><strong>Japan is a slightly closed market compared to others and this can make accessing clients from the outside a challenge. How do you plan to overcome this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EBW:</strong> Finding the right approach is essential, and where Japan is concerned taking a local approach is essential. Our first steps beyond establishing an office presence have been to set up a Japanese website and build a local team to support our global efforts. We are in the process of recruiting more local resources and will be leveraging the relationships we have built over many years with our customers who already have operations in Japan. It’s a market built on relationships and trust, the very two attributes that Surecomp has successfully fostered and upon which our customers rely.</p>","As a market leader in digital trade finance, Surecomp is bringing its trusted global experience, knowledge and expertise, partnered with local talent, to offer Japanese corporates the next generation of trade finance processing.

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Supply chain finance has come a long way in recent years. Having risen to prominence through the 2008-2009 financial crisis, it has since become increasingly prevalent as a method of supporting suppliers. And growth has continued apace since then: BCR’s <a href=""https://bcrpub.com/system/files/WSCF21.pdf"">World Supply Chain Finance Report 2021</a> found that the estimated global volume of SCF has increased from $330 billion in 2015 to over $1.3 trillion in 2020.</p>
<p>The arrival of the COVID-19 crisis presented supply chain finance with its first major test. But while some small business lenders have struggled during this period – as illustrated by the fate of US firm OnDeck Capital, an online lender which was sold for less than 10% of its 2015 market value – supply chain finance funding has remained available and adoption has continued to grow. Indeed, the BCR report found that SCF volumes were 35% higher in 2020 than in 2019.</p>
<p>In practice, the pandemic prompted a need for supply chain finance both for companies that saw sales dry up, and for those that experienced a surge in demand, says Bob Glotfelty, VP of Growth at Taulia. “For companies like consumer goods businesses that needed to produce more supply and sell more of their products, supply chain finance was a great option to get paid early, get more cash, and reinvest that into the business,” he explains. “Meanwhile, companies like automotive parts suppliers found their products weren’t being purchased when plants had shut down, so they found themselves in a very difficult position. Supply chain finance enabled them to get access to cash, and really secure and strengthen their businesses.”</p>



<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">What is supply chain finance?</h2>
<p>Supply chain finance is a type of early payment solution that offers working capital benefits to both buyers and suppliers. It enables large buyers to offer their suppliers early payment of their invoices at a funding rate based on the buyer’s credit rating. As such, it gives suppliers cost-effective access to working capital, as well as providing more certainty about the timing of receivables. Funding is provided either through a single financier, or through a platform offering multi-funding capabilities.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h4 id=""role-of-technology"">Role of technology</h4>
<p>Having weathered the challenges of the last 18 months, it’s clear that supply chain finance has much to offer businesses. What’s more, the types of solutions available are continuing to evolve rapidly, with more development on the horizon.</p>
<p>For one thing, technology has an important role to play in driving development in this area. Glotfelty cites the role of technology in helping to automate processes, such as invoice approval times: “The sooner an invoice gets approved, the sooner it can be paid, and the more opportunity there is to get your money faster.” Likewise, he notes that technology can speed up reconciliation and the way in which credit notes are handled. There is also considerable potential when it comes to taking advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to transform the way in which risks are assessed.</p>
<p>Also significant is the potential that technology has in terms of bringing the benefits of supply chain finance to smaller suppliers than has previously been possible. “When supply chain finance was purely driven by banks, it was a very manual, labour-intensive process to set up every party on the solution,” Glotfelty explains. “So typically, the penetration of the solution within the supply chain was very low, and it really ended up with large corporations using it between themselves.” But with technology providing more opportunities for automation, supply chain finance solutions can now be accessed by small and medium-sized businesses as well, providing more opportunities for companies to provide support to the whole supply chain.</p>
<h4 id=""rise-of-the-bank-tech-partnership"">Rise of the bank-tech partnership</h4>
<p>As supply chain finance continues to evolve, another important development is the rise of closer partnerships between banks and technology companies. Both parties have something important to bring to the table: banks have been providing supply chain finance for many years, with extensive expertise in assessing risk and providing liquidity – but what they typically lack is the ability to harness technology effectively and provide a slick user experience. “Banks are lagging behind in terms of technology, so they need tech companies to bridge the gap,” says Ali Ansari, Director for Global Supply Chain and Payables Solutions at Taulia. Technology companies, meanwhile, have the ability to offer a highly automated and streamlined solution – but they may not have the existing relationships, or the deep knowledge of credit and legal structures.</p>
<p>As such, partnerships between banks and technology firms can provide the best of both worlds. “Technology companies can bring in experience of connectivity, data insights and AI-based predictive information in order to facilitate digital decisioning,” comments Ansari. “And banks can continue providing risk assessment and liquidity for assets that are generated through this exchange of information, facilitated by technology firms.”</p>
<p>By combining the agility and innovation offered by technology companies with banks’ stability, funding and client knowledge, the rise of the bank-tech partnership offers a way for all participants in the supply chain to maximise the benefit of SCF. Announced in 2020, Taulia’s strategic alliance with J.P. Morgan offers an example of how this can work well. More recently, J.P. Morgan led a consortium that provided Taulia with $6 billion in funding following the collapse of Greensill earlier this year.</p>
<h4 id=""esg-and-scf"">ESG and SCF</h4>
<p>Technology is not the only factor moving SCF forward. As well as providing stability for supply chains, supply chain finance also has the ability to have a positive impact on the way in which businesses behave – and that, in turn, means it can help to safeguard the future of the planet.</p>
<p>As companies identify growth opportunities and risks, they are focusing more closely than ever before on sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) concerns. Increasingly, companies are recognising that they need to look beyond their own operations and consider the ESG impact of the whole supply chain – indeed, a <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/starting-at-the-source-sustainability-in-supply-chains"">2016 McKinsey report</a> found that more than 90% of the environmental impact associated with consumer companies is embedded in supply chains.</p>
<p>With that in mind, there is a clear opportunity for companies to address ESG by taking steps to improve their suppliers’ sustainability performance. Depending on the nature of the business, that might mean encouraging suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, embrace more ethical practices or improve the way in which they handle waste products. In practice, however, this is a course of action that requires a clear strategy, as suppliers may not change their practices unless they have a compelling reason to do so.</p>
<p>One option could be to end relationships with any suppliers that fall short of the expected standards. However, supply chain finance once again offers another way forward: by using a well-designed SCF programme, companies can offer suppliers a ‘carrot’ for good behaviour. For example, SCF can be used by companies to encourage more sustainable behaviour from their suppliers by assigning suppliers a sustainability score, and offering the highest-performing suppliers access to financing at slightly more favourable rates.</p>
<p>Notable developments in this area include a supply chain finance solution developed by tire manufacturer Bridgestone in conjunction with Taulia and J.P. Morgan. The solution uses sustainability ratings from ratings platform EcoVadis to determine a sustainability-based discount for each supplier. “The Bridgestone solution has been well publicised,” says Glotfelty. “We’re consistently hearing from our customers and prospects about the desire to go down this path and tie in their programmes with an ESG element.”</p>
<p>This approach is gaining momentum. “Businesses want to do the right thing – whether it’s for employees or communities, or whether it’s environmental factors like greenhouse gas emissions,” comments Glotfelty. “And as part of that, many companies are looking down their entire supply chains and are saying, ‘I want to make sure the people I’m buying from are doing things sustainably.’”</p>
<h4 id=""shape-of-the-future"">Shape of the future</h4>
<p>What could supply chain finance look like in five years’ time? For Ansari, the most interesting opportunity is the way in which technology will lead the way. “You’ll see these programmes becoming more integrated, more insightful, and bringing the most efficient finance into play,” he says. “While the core SCF offering will remain the same, you won’t recognise these next-generation offerings as the programmes that exist today.”</p>
<p>Alongside the rise of bank-tech partnerships, Glotfelty predicts that adoption, volumes and usage of SCF will continue to rise. “Think about it – it’s an arbitrage opportunity,” he says. “You’re taking the creditworthiness of a large corporation, and you’re extending that value to a supply chain. While some of those are also large corporates, many are small and medium sized businesses that aren’t able to access financing at a low cost. So there’s a natural fit for a product like that.”</p>
<p>Last but not least, Glotfelty notes that the role that supply chain finance can play in helping companies embrace ESG is particularly encouraging. “It’s really creating a reason to publicise your work around ESG, and give a very tangible solution to the problem,” he concludes. “I think that’s really exciting.”</p>



","The pandemic has highlighted the benefits of supply chain finance for buyers and suppliers – and this area is continuing to evolve rapidly. So how is technology driving development, why are bank-tech partnerships important, and how can SCF help companies achieve their ESG goals? Taulia’s Bob Glotfelty and Ali Ansari share their views.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/trade-and-supply-chain/trade-finance/2021-09-09-tt-00-sf__taulia-containers-ship-shipping-ports-logistic-sea-2027967470__1920x1080.jpg,2021-09-01,Trade Finance,True
Asia addresses widening trade finance gap,"


<p><em>The global trade finance gap - the difference between the need for financing and the actual lending - has dramatically increased since the onset of the pandemic. In Asia, small and medium enterprises are particularly affected, and although technology solutions show promise in addressing their needs, fintech alone cannot plug the widening gap.</em></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>The estimates may be different, but they tell the same story: a staggering number of companies are still being rejected for trade finance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated the global trade gap in 2018 was a staggering US$1.5trn. And since then, the numbers have only got bigger. “The coronavirus pandemic has only worsened the situation,” says Steven Beck, Head of ADB’s Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program.</p>
<p>Now the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates another US$1.9trn to US$5.0trn would be needed to plug the gap. Add this to the original figure, and a total of US$6.5trn is missing when the financing needs are compared with the actual lending that is taking place. If businesses in Asia don’t have access to trade finance, it ultimately affects their ability to bounce back from the pandemic, stunts economic growth and could halt development in the region. While corporate treasurers may think that trade finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) does not affect them, shocks to their supply chain will, and the current lack of financing could be an issue for their strategic suppliers in Asia.</p>
<p>Covid has accelerated and exacerbated trends that were already in existence. For SMEs and the trade finance gap, “the urgency of access to finance has been amplified,” says Alexander Malaket, President of OPUS Advisory Services International.</p>
<p>The trade finance gap is by no means a new issue, and various industry experts in Asia have been grappling with it for a number of years. Malaket comments on one of the reasons for the gap: “We haven’t yet solved the economics of deep-tier financing into global supply chains.” He adds that traditional trade finance providers cannot finance micro-enterprises and SMEs on commercially viable terms. “It’s not that the banks don’t want to lend – the economics do not make sense,” says Malaket.</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons for this, including the due diligence, know your customer (KYC), onboarding and compliance costs, as well as the complexities in trade finance and in supply chain finance – including payables finance – and negligible margins generally earned in SME financing. Also, there are “significant demands on time and resources to help coach SME founder-managers on the esoteric mechanics of trade financing,” says Malaket.</p>
<p>Beck also points to the anti-money-laundering (AML) and KYC requirements as a major barrier for banks. In the wake of the financial crisis, when tougher regulations came into force, banks cut back on their correspondent banking relationships, as well as corporate and commercial relationships – in a move dubbed as ‘derisking’. This left parts of the world dangerously disconnected from the global financial system and, therefore, from international trade, says Beck.</p>
<p>Explaining the existence of the financing gap, however, is more complex – it is not just about shedding business that was deemed too risky. “De-risking has been justified based on the need to exit relationships that failed to meet thresholds related to financial crimes compliance. This is undoubtedly the case in some instances. But profitability and the commercial viability of relationships were also part of the calculus, even if they were less widely discussed,” comments Beck.</p>
<p>Newer regulations are also looming over the banking industry, which also affects its willingness to lend. Christoph Gugelmann, Co-Founder and CEO of trade finance platform Tradeteq, comments on the hurdles for banks in bridging the trade finance gap: “The single biggest external concern for the industry is the incoming Basel IV rules. This will significantly increase the capital requirements that banks are required to put aside when extending trade finance to corporations and small businesses,” he says.</p>
<p>In the face of such pressures, one way to address the gap is for development banks – which don’t have the same profit motive as commercial banks – to step in. The ADB, for example, has been active through its trade and supply chain finance programme. Beck explains that in 2020, the programme executed over 7,000 transactions valued at over US$5.8bn, a 50% increase in transaction numbers over 2019. And in the first five months of this year, there has been a 45% increase in the value of transactions that the programme has supported. “These transactions, executed with our bank partners, have helped, albeit in a small way, to reduce market gaps. Over 2,000 of the 2020 transactions support small and medium sized businesses,” explains Beck. He adds that the programme is active in 22 countries in the region, with the most active being Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>There are other ways for the difficulties with trade finance to be solved. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system, for example, makes it easier to do the KYC and AML checks on small and large companies alike. This in turn lightens the load on banks, reduces de-risking, and increases the access to finance for SMEs as there would be more reliable information available about them.</p>
<p>One initiative that supports the use of LEIs is the Digital Standards Initiative (DSI). “The pandemic showed just how vulnerable global trade and supply chains can be when confronted with shocks. The pandemic also showed how important it is to make supply chains more robust and reliable to ensure critical goods get quickly to where they’re needed,” says Beck. He explains how the DSI aims to create digital standards and protocols so that the various parties – fintech platforms, exporters, shippers, ports, customs, warehouses, banks, importers and so on – are using standards that are interoperable. “This will make global trade and supply chains more robust. Interoperability and connections between supply chain stakeholders will also lead to greater transparency, enabling ‘tracking and tracing’ of component inputs throughout the supply chain. This will underpin greater sustainability controls throughout the supply chain,” says Beck.</p>
<p>This is an example of one initiative that seeks to make the wheels of global trade turn more efficiently. There are numerous other ways that technology – particularly digitisation – can be used to solve the issues that are affecting the financing of small businesses in Asia.</p>
<p>Alisa DiCaprio, Head of Trade and Supply Chain at R3, a blockchain development company, comments, “Trade finance has earned a reputation for an industry reluctant to adapt in the face of change. Characterised by unwieldy and cumbersome legacy processes, the industry has seemingly remained stagnant whilst other sectors have steamed ahead with digitisation.”</p>
<p>DiCaprio continues: “The pandemic has prompted the call for change that the trade finance industry has sorely needed for years, and steps towards technological innovation have been made. These technological advancements are helping to revolutionise the trade finance space and, hopefully, trigger a coordinated, global approach to creating more efficient trade.”</p>
<p>“Companies of all sizes will benefit from better visibility into trading relationships and easier access to financing options, narrowing the trade finance gap as a result,” DiCaprio adds.</p>
<p>The move toward digitisation echoes the thinking of entrepreneur Gert Sylvest, Co-founder of Tradeshift. Prior to establishing the trade technology platform, he worked on a digitisation project in Denmark that moved the public sector to electronic invoicing. From that project he realised that there was very little digitisation with trade finance – ultimately affecting billions of invoices globally – and an outdated model was being used. “It seemed fundamentally that the economic model was wrong,” Sylvest says.</p>
<p>In addressing this, the first step was to digitise the antiquated way of doing things and move to e-invoices, for example. Corporates were communicating with thousands of suppliers using reams of paper, emails and pdf documents. The starting point for Tradeshift, Sylvest tells Treasury Today Asia, was to make this process digital and create a system so that the seller could send information directly to the buyer.</p>
<p>When it comes to the trade gap, even getting access to data in a digital form is a challenge, says Sylvest. Also, there tends to be a one-sided view; someone could say they sent the invoice, for example, but only they really know if they did. When processes are digitised effectively, there is a two-sided view and the data relating to such transactions can be checked – and looks more like a ledger.</p>
<p>Sylvest comments that it is not digitisation alone that helps address the inefficiencies in trade finance, but rather getting the digital data into a network setting. Although Tradeshift is known for its e-invoicing and accounts payable automation, for example, digitisation is just the first step. The real impact comes when companies are able to participate in a network: “That has 1,000 times more value than just digitising,” Sylvest says. Tradeshift aims to connect companies and create economic opportunities through such a network, he adds.</p>
<p>There are various other efforts under way that seek to apply the latest technology – and thinking – to finding ways to close the trade finance gap. For example, in March this year, the ICC announced that it was teaming up with technology vendor Finastra to tackle the trade finance gap by developing a financing marketplace for small companies. This ICC Tradecomm marketplace would give SMEs more financing options and would aim to match supply and demand. Bank and non-bank lenders would be able to transact on invoices from SME suppliers and later versions of the marketplace may also include other trade documents, such as letters of credit, bills of lading, and other bank-syndicated products, the ICC said in a statement at the time of the announcement.</p>
<p>Following on from this March announcement, the ICC had more to reveal on how it was addressing the trade finance gap. A couple of months later, in May, the ICC launched Trade Now, which is a suite of digital solutions. ICC Trade Now aims to connect SMEs to a number of providers, and the small businesses will choose the one that suits their needs best. Three solutions were announced under the ICC Trade Now campaign, including the already-mentioned Tradecomm marketplace with Finastra. Another solution, TradeFlow Capital, enables investors a solution based on the direct ownership of commodities – rather than extending credit. And FQX uses IBM’s distributed ledger technology Hyperledger Fabric to digitise promissory notes.</p>
<p>Frank Wendt, Chairman of the Board at FQX, explains to Treasury Today Asia how the company has taken the promissory note – a debt instrument with a 2,000 year history – and brought it into the digital age with the eNote. These eNotes, like the traditional paper-based promissory notes, are an unconditional promise to pay. These securities are attractive because they can be sold and transferred to other parties, such as investors – thus encouraging the flow of financing. And, because they are based on an international framework, the eNotes are enforceable in courts around the world. Unlike the paper version, these notes can be settled instantly, creating new efficiencies for the trade finance process.</p>
<p>Such a solution can aid the trade finance gap by making the process more efficient and ensuring smaller companies get paid quicker. One area that is ripe for disruption is in government contracts. “The government is one of the worst payers,” says Wendt. This exacerbates problems that suppliers are already experiencing. Wendt estimates that the government can take the largest share of GDP – in some cases 50% – and if eNotes were used, it would make a massive difference.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are other issues that have been addressed. Gugelmann at Tradeteq also comments on the inefficiencies his company has tackled. The first was to develop artificial intelligence so that banks and issuers could accurately assess the riskiness of clients, vendors or individual transactions. This technology is now being used by participants of Singapore’s Networked Trade Platform, which includes multinational corporations, SMEs, financiers and shipping companies.</p>
<p>Also, so that banks can reduce their balance sheet pressures, Tradeteq has made it easier to repackage trade finance into capital markets products. “The ability to distribute these assets can free up cash which banks can lend to corporations and SMEs that otherwise would not be able to access financing. Of course, this requires a buyer to purchase that asset. Fortunately, there are many ‘cash-rich’ non-bank investors looking to invest in the trade finance market and benefit from the lower levels of risk and potential yields it offers,” says Gugelmann.</p>
<p>Gugelmann also explains how Tradeteq operates an electronic trading platform that allows banks and institutional investors to transact trade finance assets with each other.</p>
<p>These are just some of the ways in which technology companies are seeking to make the trade finance market more efficient, and in turn facilitate the flow of funds to those companies that need it.</p>
<p>However, on plugging the trade finance gap, Malaket says, “Neither technology nor fintechs alone will solve this issue.” He adds, “Technology will play an important role in changing the cost of servicing the SME segment, and fintechs have advanced matters through agility and innovation, as well as inspiring the banks to raise their game.”</p>
<p>Also, he says, fintechs have realised that banks are important to the overall ecosystem. “A collaborative posture makes more sense,” says Malaket, who in his years as a consultant to the industry has seen new entrants take a more combative approach. “Fintechs do not bring balance sheet capacity, clearing capacity or relationships with central banks.”</p>
<p>There are other factors that can address the growing trade finance gap. “There are things that should be done on the policy front to help drive liquidity to the SME sector, and one might suggest that SMEs themselves can help by actively working to become more compelling to lenders,” says Malaket. He also makes the point that not all of the trade finance gap should be filled. “A material amount of [the trade finance gap] is legitimate and includes transaction that simply are not bankable or represent bad credit risk,” says Malaket. Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess the proportion of this compared to the overall trade finance gap.</p>
<p>“One thing that may happen, as it did in the context of digitisation, is that the Covid crisis will accelerate a confluence of events to help address the SME finance and trade finance gap, given that trade – and SMEs – will be critical to our shared recovery,” Malaket adds.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the global trade arena, the need for digitisation is widely understood. “The current process for trade is notoriously paper-heavy, manual and iterative,” explains Peter Jameson, head of Asia Pacific Trade and Supply Chain Finance, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America. “Digitisation can help treasurers create simpler workflows, track flows of goods and funds in real time, and make smarter financing and funding decisions based on available data.”</p>
<p>While various initiatives have been attempted over the years, these have tended to create digital islands that fall short of digitising the industry in any meaningful way. But with numerous industry initiatives under way, not to mention the opportunities brought by emerging technologies, could trade finance digitisation finally be an achievable prospect?</p>
<h4 id=""why-digitise-trade"">Why digitise trade?</h4>
<p>Given the costs, delays and potential for error associated with traditional processes, everyone in the trade ecosystem stands to benefit from greater digitisation. Indeed, the abundance of paper and the lack of common standards can sometimes mean that the paperwork related to a transaction is still being processed days after the actual goods have arrived – particularly when it comes to trade finance instruments such as guarantees and letters of credit (LCs).</p>
<p>“In a digital process, a guarantee can be issued within minutes, rather than days,” says Enno-Burghard Weitzel, SVP Strategy, Digitization and Business Development at Surecomp. “And documents under an LC can be reviewed within hours rather than days.” In addition, with participants able to access full transparency over the status of the transaction, “such instant feedback allows corporates much better planning and greater reliability.”</p>
<p>Beyond the ability to speed up individual transactions, digitisation also has the potential to improve the resilience of global trade on a much wider scale. “Digitisation – in other words, not having to rely on physically moving pieces of paper around the world to support the movement of critical goods – makes global supply chains and trade more robust, more reliable and less prone to shocks,” says Steven Beck, Head of Trade &amp; Supply Chain Finance at Asian Development Bank.</p>
<p>Beck explains that digitisation could drive numerous improvements throughout the trade ecosystem, which includes exporters, shippers, ports, customs, warehousing/logistics, finance and importers. “Digitisation would reduce costs, lowering barriers to entry for SMEs. It would drive higher productivity – and it would also drive transparency, thereby improving environmental and social safeguards while reducing trade-based money laundering,” he says.</p>
<p>In addition, he notes, digitisation has the potential to create metadata that can support the closing of trade finance gaps by providing “granular information on risks including credit risk, performance risk and money laundering risk.”</p>

<h4 id=""developments-to-watch"">Developments to watch</h4>
<p>Various developments and initiatives currently under way could pave the way for greater digitisation. For one thing, Weitzel notes that the rise of digital transferable records, together with relevant legislation, has the potential to replace paper with digital tokens.</p>
<p>One notable development is the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). Adopted in 2017, the MLETR provides legal recognition for electronic transferable records and has so far been enacted by Bahrain and Singapore.</p>
<p>Digital identity is another area of focus. Weitzel explains that the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) has created a framework for a chain of trust relating to the “digital identities of corporates and the natural persons acting on behalf of these entities.” He adds: “There is a growing number of very interesting fintechs that provide an ecosystem with services around these digital identities. Ultimately, this will drive down the effort for corporates and banks/financiers alike to verify counterparties.”</p>
<p>Another notable initiative cited by Asian Development Bank’s Beck is the Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) which has been created by ADB together with the Government of Singapore and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). “DSI is bringing together industry from each component part of the trade ecosystem to agree common standards and protocols that will drive digitisation and interoperability,” says Beck.</p>
<p>In addition, when it comes to facilitating interoperability between digital islands, Vinay Mendonca, Global Head of Product and Proposition Management at HSBC, says the ICC’s Uniform Rules for Digital Trade Transactions (URDTT) “is a key initiative which would create a framework for an end-to-end digital trade transaction and adoption.” He adds, “HSBC is an active participant in the design and construct of these standards, which are in the final stages of release.”</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Innovation through digitisation</h2>
<p>Enno-Burghard Weitzel, SVP Strategy, Digitization and Business Development at Surecomp, says innovation is key when it comes to enabling corporates to compete successfully. “Think of an import of dried fruits from Namibia to Hamburg,” he says. “The fruits need a certain temperature band and also humidity level. If the temperature or humidity are outside the bands, the fruits will be rotten and worthless.”</p>
<p>In the traditional process, says Weitzel, the status of the fruit would only be discovered at the destination port – and if the fruit is worthless, the importer would have to wait for three of four weeks to receive the next shipment and get funds from the insurer.</p>
<p>In a digital process, says Weitzel, “there are almost no barriers to the scope of innovation that can be adopted.” In this case, he says, a sensor within the container could continually measure temperature and humidity. “In case one of them is outside the bands, the insurance would automatically pay, the importer could immediately order a new lot, and the container could be discharged at the next best harbour.”</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""digital-trade-finance-tools"">Digital trade finance tools</h4>
<p>Alongside these initiatives, efforts are under way to bridge the trade finance gap and support digitisation through the adoption of technology. “One of the most meaningful by-products of the pandemic for trade finance is the renewed drive to digitise its historically manual and paper-based processes,” comments Bank of America’s Jameson.</p>
<p>He adds that this has led to a greater emphasis on accessing trade finance online portals remotely, converting non-digital data into a digitised format, leveraging e-signature capabilities, “and simply being able to operate effectively outside the office environment in a fully electronic manner with enhanced visibility and control.”</p>
<p>Different companies have different requirements where trade finance digitisation is concerned – and as such, Jameson emphasises the role of “digitisation opportunities across multiple technologies which can offer the right mix of digital solutions”. He adds that digital trade finance tools include secure trade finance online portals which can automate workflows for traditional trade and supply chain finance transactions.</p>
<p>Also of interest, says Jameson, is “an innovative concept called ‘supply chain as a service’, which creates the ability to integrate bank systems directly with clients’ ERP systems to identify transactions that can shore up the financial health of a client’s supply chain through early payment financing.”</p>
<h4 id=""blockchain-and-beyond"">Blockchain and beyond</h4>
<p>Where technology is concerned, Jameson also notes the role blockchain can play in tracking goods and funds in real-time, while providing transparency to instruments throughout the lifecycle of a transaction.</p>
<p>Indeed, blockchain/distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a key enabler for digitisation. As HSBC’s Mendonca points out, this is due to its ability to offer decentralisation, real-time visibility for all participants, and tokenisation. “Digitalising and tokenising assets enables banks to have better control over the financing of trade assets,” he comments. “It also opens possibilities to finance deeper into the supply chain to lower tiers.”</p>
<p>Mendonca adds that HSBC has pioneered the use of blockchain technology in global trade since the first blockchain-enabled letter of credit transaction in May 2018. “Since then, we have been instrumental in the evolution of the Contour platform, and we’re currently working with several clients to help them to move their flow transactions onto the platform,” he says.</p>
<p>In addition, Mendonca says a number of other technology developments have a role to play in trade finance digitisation, from big data and advanced data analytics to artificial intelligence (AI), Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""overcoming-the-obstacles"">Overcoming the obstacles</h4>
<p>While there are plenty of developments and initiatives in the pipeline, adopting technology in the trade finance space is not always straightforward due to the complexity of global supply chains and the proliferation of different standards and practices in different markets. As Bank of America’s Jameson notes, “End-to-end automation is hampered by the least sophisticated party (or country) in the supply chain, which in turn is governed by local market rules.”</p>
<p>In addition, he says there is sometimes a perception that the adoption of technology is too expensive or futuristic, or that only large or newly set up companies have the luxury of being able to put funding aside for investment in technology. “Unless all parties in a supply chain are aligned in moving towards paperless, there is little incentive for a company, especially a smaller player, to make the first move and invest in digitising their internal trade processes,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""forward-thinking"">Forward thinking</h4>
<p>So what is needed in order to accelerate digitisation? Where specific solutions are concerned, Surecomp’s Weitzel emphasises the importance of focusing on users in order to encourage the wide adoption of digitisation. “The smaller the change for the user, the more likely is the adoption,” he points out.</p>
<p>At the industry level, Jameson notes that as governments recognise the importance of keeping supply chains moving during the pandemic, “many policymakers are re-examining how legal and regulatory environments need to evolve in order to accommodate greater digitisation of trade finance, whilst providing the same level of certainty and risk mitigation afforded by paper-based predecessors. These moves should set the framework for – finally – enabling trade finance to move towards a digitised future.”</p>
<p>He adds, “To realise the full potential of digital trade, it is also crucial for industry leaders and practitioners to drive the development of digital standards that will enable trade digital solutions to function and communicate with one another.”</p>
<p>As such, the coming years could be critical. Citing the importance of developments such as the widespread adoption of MLETR and the standardisation of API interfaces, Weitzel predicts that in 2030, “If we look back to the year 2021, we will realise that the pandemic was a great shift towards digitisation, and that the years until 2025 saw a steady growth in the adoption of digital solutions.”</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Accelerating digitisation</h2>
<p>When it comes to accelerating trade finance digitisation, Steven Beck, Head of Trade &amp; Supply Chain Finance at ADB, cites the importance of the following developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Closing legislative gaps for the digitisation of trade – countries should adopt UNCITRAL model laws on legislation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global implementation of standards and protocols for digitisation, which would drive interoperability between IT platforms and between the component parts of the trade ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global implementation of the Legal Entity Identifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id=""holistic-solutions"">Holistic solutions</h4>
<p>Kanika Thakur was named Head of Trade for Asia Pacific at Citi in August 2020, at a time of change and challenge.</p>
<p>In the year of the pandemic, her relationship with her clients evolved to reflect changes in their businesses and working situations as well as a shift in the very nature of trade itself.</p>
<p>She talks us through the learning curves of 2020 and highlights the disruption and innovation that digitisation and COVID-19 have brought to Asia and the world.</p>
<p>Corporates rushed to shore up liquidity and borrow in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, says Kanika Thakur, Head of Trade for Asia Pacific at Citi, as she looks back over the tumultuous year. “Our clients were primarily focused on resilience.” Next, companies in the region quickly turned to finding solutions for their wider ecosystem of buyers and suppliers, solving problems beyond themselves in a holistic approach. “We advised on business-friendly solutions that allowed companies’ entire procurement chains to benefit from their corporate standing,” says Thakur, who is based in Hong Kong, upon her promotion.</p>
<p>“Clients increasingly looked at the sustainability of their supply chains and entire ecosystem to ensure they could buy from them. The ability for companies to interact with their buyers and sellers became critical.”</p>
<p>This led to an uptake in supply chain finance and receivable finance solutions. Citi also explored how its corporate clients could mitigate risk by partnering with export credit agencies. “We saw classic trade instruments like letters of credit and guarantees make a comeback. Open accounts based on trust and openness were not always feasible.”</p>
<h4 id=""advisory-demand"">Advisory demand</h4>
<p>More than a year on from the initial impact, Thakur observes a new client demand for conversation and advice. Noting that travel restrictions are not an impediment to the bank’s advisory role, she says Citi has successfully built on existing relationships with corporates in the region through ongoing client engagement. Regular webinars on topical ideas featuring expert speakers continue to see interest from clients.</p>
<p>In September 2020, when the bank hosted its Asia Pacific Treasury and Finance Virtual Week, over 3,300 participants attended the five-day conference.</p>
<h4 id=""digital-trends"">Digital trends</h4>
<p>The pandemic has also accelerated existing digital trends. Before the pandemic, trade was still paper intensive for many of Citi’s clients, but many are now focused on building up their technological efficiency. “Technology is shaping the future of trade and many businesses accelerating their digitisation efforts,” she says, counting Citi’s own ongoing digital transformation amongst the cohort. “COVID-19 has accelerated the digital journey for us. We are looking at how we as a bank process our transactions,” she says.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also led the bank to connect and engage with clients differently, including linkages via APIs rather than traditional transaction banking models.</p>
<p>On the digitisation of trade more broadly, Kanika points out that trade involves numerous third parties like shipping and insurance agents that need to be included on electronic platforms. “The really interesting part is getting all these different parties onto electronic platforms so it can truly be seamless and without paper,” she said. “We are linking with platforms to make trade more electronic and digital”.</p>
<p>This includes partnering with fintechs, and Citi has made a number of investments in platforms leveraging blockchain. “We are looking at this in a holistic fashion, so that we can make significant changes more broadly, in addition to client connectivity,” she says.</p>
<p>Thakur also notes that governments are increasingly pushing for digital reporting of the whole trade cycle. “Governments are coming to the fore and we are working with regulators through ongoing dialogue and discussion,” she says.</p>
<p>As we look to the rest of this year, it seems clear that there have been some lasting shifts that have taken place this year as digitisation has been accelerated and relationships have adapted and evolved within a very new situation.</p>
<p id=""video-interview"">Where things will go next remains to be seen, but it is clear that the evolution of trade will continue and that the journey to digitisation that Citi is navigating its clients through, is ongoing and irrevocable.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:2em;""><a class=""button--red-stroke"" href=""#video-infographic"">Watch video infographic</a></p>
<p>When Singapore Customs launched its Networked Trade Platform (NTP) in 2018, it described it as a ‘one-stop trade and logistics ecosystem’. Its aim is to bring together players across the trade value-chain, on a single platform, to enable end-to-end digital trade. It sounds ideal. But there is a way to go before all trade practitioners reach digital nirvana.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Edwin Chan, Head of Transaction Banking Product Management, APAC, BNP Paribas, notes, “trade currently flows in many shapes and forms, with multiple standards across the ecosystem.” The great paper-chase that makes up the information exchange between multiple parties along the trade flow make it inefficient.</p>
<p>According to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), global trade generates some four billion pages of documents every year. This is both ecologically unsustainable, and inefficient, says Chan. He contends that digitisation can solve both issues. But, he acknowledges, whilst NTP is a strong proposition, it is but one link in an enormous trade chain around the world; there needs to be tighter systemic integration.</p>
<h4 id=""tech-solution"">Tech solution</h4>
<p>In digital terms, recent innovations aiming to make trade finance more efficient have seen several successful proofs of concept, including those using artificial intelligence, and blockchain. It’s clear to Chan that digitalisation of key trade functions is an essential component of the successful future trade-ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, he notes, because these projects mostly focus on discrete sub-ecosystems (finance, logistics, storage and so on), it has created what he calls “digital islands”. Progress in enabling the sharing of data across the whole trade ecosystem is slow partly because of the insular view of each stakeholder, where each only understands its own needs and not those of other participants.</p>
<p>Disigtalisation can break these barriers, says Chan. But it requires every standalone trade ecosystem to be interoperable; only then will the information flow freely from end-to-end. For this to happen, all participants need to see a benefit and be able to understand and respond to the needs of others.</p>
<p>As the nexus of trade activity, Chan feels that banks have a duty to be actively participating in digitisation, becoming the bridge between the different islands that currently form the wider trade ecosystem. For BNP Paribas, the creation of a holistic trade ecosystem is based on the 4Ts: Technology, Transparency, Trust and Truth.</p>
<h4 id=""trade-confidence"">Trade confidence</h4>
<p>Although he espouses technological agnosticism, Chan sees technology as the catalyst, bringing stakeholders together as they seek transparency across trade data flows. With transparency comes trust. “Without involvement in the different stages of information flow, trust in the ecosystem cannot be formed,” he says. “But build trust in the data, and truth is established.” With open account trading in particular founded on trust, any solution that facilitates greater confidence should be welcomed.</p>
<p>Current rates of development have seen barriers to using technology in this context lowered for more businesses, with price and complexity reducing, and availability of development talent increasing. This, says Chan, is why technological access, not one specific technology, is the true catalyst for change.</p>
<p>Further progress though will require far greater interoperability and standardisation. The notion of the 3Cs – Connectivity, Commercialisation, and Collaboration – is essential to lead the final charge against trade’s paper-dependency and inefficiency.</p>
<p>At a simple level, connectivity, between individual stakeholders and sub-ecosystems, is helpful for other participants, for example in supporting trade analytics, notes Chan. “But connectivity also encourages collaboration between players that previously had never collaborated; it creates new opportunities for all stakeholders to work together, and with that collaboration comes new opportunities for commercialisation of information.”</p>
<h4 id=""role-call"">Role call</h4>
<p>For Stéphane Gaboriaud, Head of Traditional Trade Finance, APAC, BNP Paribas, the 3Cs concept is driving proactive banks to explore co-designing of solutions with trade clients. “With technology as the enabler of faster and closer relationships, stakeholders can move towards closer participation and greater alignment,” he notes. As standardisation of trade practices becomes more achievable, so too does easier, quicker, cheaper and paper-free processing for all.</p>
<p>With many different regulatory approaches across the world, Gaboriaud believes that it is also essential for all authority-driven ecosystems to be able to connect. NTP in Singapore is a clear example of what can be achieved when regulatory support is given, perhaps offering a glimpse of the unified end-game.</p>
<p>Indeed, he says talks are already under way to connect NTP with Hong Kong’s eTradeConnect blockchain-based platform. “It’s a clear demonstration that the regulators know they have to connect with each other for a global trade ecosystem to work; isolated ecosystems can deliver only limited advantage.”</p>
<p>From a series of interconnected ecosystems, driven by technology and perhaps with a regulatory push for the final mile, trust and truth in trade can benefit all stakeholders. The banks have a natural commercial role to play in this development.</p>
<p>But, says Gaboriaud, they also have a duty to listen to the needs and challenges of clients, facilitating their journey towards digitisation and standardisation. The ability to accompany clients along this journey will differentiate the leading transaction banks.</p>
<p id=""video-infographic"">For the treasurer, on either the buyer or supplier side, Chan says simply taking the lead by joining digital initiatives such as NTP, and bringing in trade partners, such as banks and logistics firms, “will help to move the world a bit faster towards a more efficient and sustainable trade ecosystem”.</p>

<p>When it comes to digitisation, trade finance is lagging behind other business activities, such as cash management, notes Marie-Laurence Lepetit-Faure, Head of Digital Trade. In the context of a truly global theatre of operation, there are a number of explanations for this.</p>
<p>The complexity of the trade ecosystem, the lack of an overarching legal and regulatory framework, applicable to digital exchanges, and slow progress towards the adoption of open systems, in particular, are all acting as an anchor on progress, impeding trade efficiency. It is, she notes, still a manually intensive and paper-based process from end-to-end, and this is driving costs and turnaround times ever-higher.</p>
<p>In terms of digitisation, open systems – APIs, for example – can resolve issues to an extent, says Alain Verscheuren, Head of DLT, Trade &amp; Treasury Solutions, but interoperability is essential for full digitisation to be unlocked. And that, he says, demands standardisation and appropriate legislative adaptation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a demonstrable will within trade to move towards standardisation. Indeed, with many initiatives in this space drawing voices from right across the ecosystem – from banks and fintechs, to shippers and logistics firms – a collaborative mood is already at work, notes Verscheuren. With support from domestic trade authorities and the wider ICC community, standardisation amongst existing mechanisms, such as UTN, is becoming a distinct possibility.</p>
<p>It’s not an overnight fix, and all stakeholders must continue to think collectively, he warns. But when the stars align, he believes that every trade stakeholder will benefit. Paper will be eliminated to a large extent. Transactions will speed up as straight through processing becomes increasingly possible: technologies such as APIs and cloud are facilitating easier integration, lowering the number of touchpoints and reducing risk of error. Improved traceability, transparency and compliance management can be anticipated too, as the potential of blockchain is unleashed.</p>
<p>Before this transformation can occur, businesses must first map their trade pain points to their digital ambitions, says Bruno Francois, Deputy Global Head of Trade Finance and Network Management. Top of the agenda, he says, is likely to be visibility over aspects such as trade risks, exposures, and maturity dates, across the entire organisation.</p>
<p>Closely following– again, across the whole organisation – will be control, ensuring all trade participants are compliant with internal expectations. A third vital component will be cost-efficiency. As with every major capex, the cost-benefit of digitisation must be tightly managed, says Francois. To this can be added the importance of allotting sufficient time and securing on-tap expertise for every project.</p>
<p id=""video"">To help treasurers through this critical transition, BNP Paribas is prioritising the immediate short-term corporate pain-points, investing heavily in its trade platform. It is tackling medium-term issues by offering, for example, connectivity to multi-bank solutions such as SWIFTNet Trade. Looking to the long-term sustainability of trade, Francois reports that BNP Paribas is actively exploring the potential of distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain. This, he feels, could finally eliminate trade’s paper lock-in, letting it flourish.</p>

<p><em>Trade finance plays an essential role in supporting cross-border trade. But research shows there is a sizeable gap between demand for trade finance and availability, particularly for smaller firms. What initiatives and projects are currently seeking to close up this gap – and what role can new technology play in helping to address the issue?</em></p>
<p>Trade finance plays a vital role in supporting business expansion, economic growth and financial inclusion. But it’s no secret that at a global level, there continues to be a significant gap between demand and availability.</p>
<p>“The market gap for trade finance is serious,” says Steven Beck, Head of Trade Finance at the Asian Development Bank (ADB). “It is large and has a major impact on our ability to create the growth and jobs that improve living standards and lift people from poverty.” He points out that the UN’s Addis Ababa Declaration on Financing for Development identified short-term trade finance as important to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>“Yet ADB’s Trade Finance Gaps, Growth, and Jobs study of 2017 identified a US$1.5trn global market gap, 40% of which was in Asia,” says Beck, noting it is “no surprise” that most of the gap is concentrated in the small and medium sized company segment.</p>
<p>Indeed, banks reported that 74% of rejected trade finance transactions came from micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and midcap firms, according to the 2017 survey. The research also found that female-owned firms “were 2.5 times more likely to have 100% of their proposals rejected by banks than male-owned firms.”</p>
<p>In addition, the ADB report shed some light on the reasons why banks reject trade finance applications. These included KYC concerns (29%), the need for more collateral or information (21%) and low bank profits (15%). The report noted that around 36% of the rejected trade finance transactions were considered viable.</p>
<p>Since the 2017 report, access to trade finance has continued to be constrained for many companies. A 2019 Global Survey by BNY Mellon found that trade finance transaction rejection rates had accelerated in the last 12 months for a third of participants. Compliance constraints and an inability to provide quality KYC constituted the leading reason for trade finance rejections, cited by 34% of respondents. A further 21% said rejections were caused by the poor credit quality of applicants/the inability for applicants to provide financial statements.</p>
<h4 id=""solutions-and-initiatives"">Solutions and initiatives</h4>
<p>Finance supports growth – and it’s clear that the trade finance gap has implications for businesses, trade and economies. The ADB’s report found that 86% of firms said more trade finance would allow their businesses to grow and generate more employment. The report also noted that a 10% increase in trade finance “is associated with a 1% increase in the number of workers employed.”</p>
<p>Addressing the trade finance shortfall is therefore an important goal – and around the world, numerous efforts and initiatives are focused on closing the gap.</p>
<h5 id=""the-trade-finance-program"">The Trade Finance Program</h5>
<p>Beck explains that ADB’s trade finance business, the Trade Finance Program (TFP), provides guarantees and loans to banks to support trade and “helps close market gaps.” He adds that the business grew nearly 40% in both 2017 and 2018, with last year seeing 4,500 transactions valued at US$6.2bn.</p>
<p>“TFP focuses on more challenging markets and does not assume risk in PRC, India or Thailand,” Beck says. “Of the 21 markets where we operate, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia and Armenia are our most active. We’ve never had a default or loss in any of our transactions, never.”</p>
<p>According to Beck, this “flawless default rate” begs questions about why there is a gap. “Limited country risk appetite among the private sector in the more challenging markets is one obvious answer,” he says. “Costs and concerns about anti money-laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CFT) is another.”</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: ADB, 2017 Trade Finance Gaps, Growth and Jobs Survey</em></p>
<p>In the meantime, Beck says that ADB’s TFP is closing market gaps through loans and guarantees, which also mobilise private sector resources to these markets. “We have strong partnerships with banks and insurance,” he says. “But TFP also closes market gaps through non-transactional initiatives.”</p>
<p>In March, TFP convened a meeting of bank regulators, industry associations and commercial banks in Singapore “to discuss how we can drive more transparency in trade and make the due diligence process for know your client (KYC) more efficient, less onerous,” Beck notes. “There are a number of initiatives that came out of this meeting which we hope to get done by the end of the year, including an effort to standardise ‘suspicious transactions reporting’. Progress on these initiatives would help close more of the gap.”</p>
<h5 id=""gathering-data"">Gathering data</h5>
<p>While the ADB is focusing closely on this topic, other initiatives may also play a role in helping to close the gap. One is the ICC Banking Commission’s Trade Register project, which illustrates the low-risk nature of trade finance.</p>
<p>“Banks contribute to the ICC Trade Register, which can then demonstrate in a quantitative manner how low the default ratios are in trade finance,” explains Surath Sengupta, Head of Trade Portfolio Management and Distribution at HSBC. “It’s a big thing for banks to share data which gives more transparency and allows both banks and investors to be more comfortable financing trade,” he adds.</p>
<h5 id=""making-trade-finance-an-investible-asset-class"">Making trade finance an investible asset class</h5>
<p>At the same time, Sengupta says there is growing interest in trade finance from non-bank firms, such as funds, asset managers and insurance companies. He explains that over a long period of time, banks have created the infrastructure needed to on-board and serve this asset class – making it difficult for other parties in the financial industry to achieve something similar. “However, now they are interested in this asset class because it allows them to invest in a short-term, low-risk real economy asset,” he says. “So the question is, how can banks partner with these investors to make this asset class more investible?”</p>
<p>As a step in this direction, HSBC has recently announced a partnership with Allianz Global Investors which involves converting trade finance assets into a securities format. “It’s a format which is very conversant with investors, and allows them to invest in trade finance assets more easily,” says Sengupta. “And it’s also a way for us to access that liquidity. So this is a big move forward in terms of turning trade finance into an investible asset class.” He adds that there has been considerable interest from non-bank investors in this asset class and the ability to access trade finance assets.</p>
<p>Geoff Brady, Head of Global Trade and Supply Chain Finance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), agrees that there is growing interest among the investor community in “getting investment dollars into trade finance.” He cites the rise of buyer-led supply chain finance programmes – a structure “that is becoming more and more ubiquitous in the US and abroad.”</p>
<p>According to Brady, this type of short-term, self-liquidating funding can generate better returns than other types of credit that banks can use on behalf of a client. “Insurance companies have become interested in supply chain finance as an investment, and we’re starting to see funds showcasing supply chain finance paper,” he says.</p>
<p>However, Brady also notes that supply chain finance paper has a few key characteristics that make it a little more challenging for investment. “Most prominently, it’s not publicly rated and it’s not publicly traded on an exchange,” he says. “So you have to be comfortable that you understand it, and it also has to be inside your investment parameters.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-role-of-technology"">The role of technology</h4>
<p>Technology is a particular area of interest when it comes to tackling the trade finance gap. When asked what would help address this, respondents to BNY Mellon’s survey placed enhanced technology solutions joint first with revising the regulatory environment. But questions remain about the extent to which technology can really make a difference, and whether this is happening yet.</p>
<p>“We’re convinced fintech can help close gaps,” says ADB’s Beck. “But there is no evidence at this point that tech is reducing gaps – only cutting banks’ operational costs.” To realise the full potential for technology in closing gaps, Beck says progress is needed on three fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Global adoption of UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) draft laws, so that digital bills of lading and other basic documents in trade have legal standing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation and adoption of global technical protocols and standards to drive inter-operability between fintech (including distributed ledger and blockchain) pilots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global adoption of the Legal Entity Identifier, “an 20-digit unique globally harmonised identifier that verifies who’s who, who owns whom.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, Brady cites supply chain finance as an area where technology can play a role in closing the supply chain finance gap. He explains that in the past, large buying organisations have tended to exclude their smallest suppliers from supply chain finance programmes, because the level of spend is not enough to justify the resources required to onboard them.</p>
<p>“Some of this gap has been filled by some of the fintechs that have come in and partnered with banks,” he says. “In some cases they are able to onboard suppliers more easily, which gives them the scale to onboard the long tail of the supplier base. We’re seeing more clients saying they want to fund the entirety of their supply chains, and not just the top 80%.” Brady adds that together with the increased investor appetite in supply chain finance, “this is helping to drive capital towards the trade finance gap.”</p>
<h5 id=""what-about-blockchain"">What about blockchain?</h5>
<p>Blockchain and distributed ledger continues to be a hot topic in this space. Historically, trade finance has been heavily dependent on paper documentation – meaning there is plenty of room for improvement. “Trade finance is a brilliant use case for the ability to have multiple parties transacting with each other on one secure platform,” says HSBC’s Sengupta. “That will allow for more efficient end-to-end trade finance transactions – which will again help to clear one of the barriers for entry.”</p>
<p>In recent years, a number of international consortia have formed to explore the use of distributed ledger technology in trade finance. Notable initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>we.trade</strong> – supports collaboration between businesses and banks in Europe; is built on the IBM Blockchain Platform using Hyperledger Fabric.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Marco Polo</strong> – launched by TradeIX and R3; provides an open enterprise software platform for trade and working capital finance and a distributed, blockchain-powered solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voltron</strong> – built on Corda; aims to provide a digital, end-to-end documentary trade solution for banks and corporates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goals of these consortia include reducing operational costs, mitigating risks and expediting financing decisions. By nature, these platforms are being developed on a collaborative rather than a competitive basis.</p>
<h5 id=""the-power-of-collaboration"">The power of collaboration</h5>
<p>Indeed, Sengupta notes that initiatives in this area are also helping to bring the whole community closer. “Given there is such a healthy buzz around distributed ledger and blockchain, it’s really encouraged banks to get together,” he says.</p>
<p>In this vein, he says that HSBC is a founding member of the Trade Finance Distribution (TFD) initiative, which incorporates banks, funds, fintechs and technology partners seeking to make trade finance more investible. Other participants include ANZ, Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, ING, Lloyds Bank, Rabobank, Standard Bank, Standard Chartered and SMBC. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) UK and the International Trade and Forfaiting Association (IFTA) have also joined as observers.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the initiative “is an industry-wide drive to use technology and standardisation for the wider distribution of trade finance assets.” Aspirations of the initiative include developing “common data standards and definitions to address operational inefficiencies, transparency issues, and risks.”</p>
<h5 id=""breaking-down-siloes"">Breaking down siloes</h5>
<p>Collaboration is also at the heart of the Universal Trade Network (UTN), which was set up by the banks participating in Marco Polo project, together with TradeIX and R3, but now includes additional banks. According to the Marco Polo website, the UTN aims to “tackle the issue of separate systems of digital silos that cannot communicate or share information between each other”, allowing trading parties and financial institutions to “exchange data, and transact peer-to-peer and in real-time through an open, standard technology infrastructure powered by blockchain technology.” The UTN also aims to promote interoperability between different blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>“There’s some agreement that the first stop is to have standards and regulations around what we all agree to be the rules,” comments Brady. “For years we’ve had uniform customs and standards that have governed trade transactions, because they’re so international that you don’t want to be tied down to one jurisdiction. That’s part of what UTN is hoping to solve from a digital perspective – that we all agree on the rules of the road, so we can use those to plug into the same ecosystem when it comes to moving forward with the next generation of DLT or blockchain.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-way-forward"">The way forward</h4>
<p>Could all these initiatives be enough to make a difference to the trade finance gap? ADB’s Beck says that while the trade finance gap is real, and has a major impact on the global community and its ability to achieve the SDGs, “What’s heartening is that the public and private sector are working together to close the gap. Certainly lots more work to be done, but there are a number of exciting gap-closing initiatives well under way that should deliver results.” He adds that the ADB plans to launch an updated market gap study in September.</p>
<p>It seems clear that collaboration will play a central role in addressing the shortfall. Promisingly, there is much evidence that the community is embracing a more collaborative approach. Brady points out that banks have historically moved relatively slowly towards change – and that while technology and blockchain may be the more exciting topics, the work being done to address documentation and standards is the most encouraging aspect of the efforts under way. “I’ve seen more collaboration between banks in the last four years than I have in the previous 25 years,” he says. “That’s the encouraging thing – and that’s what’s going to drive most of the change.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Private equity (PE) weathered the global financial crisis well and, indeed, the asset class has sparkled in recent years, delivering superior returns versus public markets in a low return environment.</p>
<p>Heavy competition across the sector over the last year, however, has driven deal multiples to historic highs, while growing jitters about an eventual economic downturn are affecting decision making across the sector, from diligence to exit planning.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging environment, the outlook for the sector remains promising, with continuing strong investor interest meaning private equity firms currently boast a record US$2trn in cash waiting to be invested.</p>
<p>But as private equity backed buyouts continue to surge, so does the pressure for portfolio companies to become high performers post-buyout. Private equity groups now need a faster path to positive returns – and portfolio companies need to be able to respond.</p>
<p>That growing pressure on PE-owned companies has led to them becoming more willing to explore alternative financing solutions. Mitch Leonard, former CFO of Electrical Components International, and Dominic Capolongo, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Funding at PrimeRevenue, point to one working capital solution, supply chain finance (SCF), as being especially supportive for portfolio companies looking to fund growth, increase efficiency and meet value creation targets.</p>
<p>Having experienced PE ownership first-hand whilst at ECI, a global leader in the supply of wire harnessing to home appliance and specialty industrial manufacturers, Leonard is well placed to highlight the challenges faced by portfolio companies. Value creation is “priority number one”, he says, adding: “The real challenge here is financial agility. Whether it’s deleveraging, expanding through acquisition or investing in fixed assets, companies need access to material sums of cash in order to achieve these targets. And they must meet or exceed these targets regardless of market conditions. The economic climate can vary greatly between acquisition and exit, but the PE group’s objectives are firm.”</p>
<h4 id=""delivering-on-targets"">Delivering on targets</h4>
<p>Historically there have been a range of funding options for portfolio companies to consider including commercial lending, cost cutting and dynamic discounting. While overleveraging by many companies and the rising rate environment make commercial lending less attractive; the other options too have their drawbacks. Cost cutting is often ineffective; while dynamic discounting improves the cash position but doesn’t always deliver material improvements.</p>
<p>For Capolongo, the one proven alternative is SCF: “It offers a lower cost of funds than a revolving line of credit and a more material impact to cash flow.” Leonard, meanwhile, can point to direct experience of its efficacy: “During the recession of 2008, there weren’t many funding options at all for companies like ECI. SCF helped us survive much better than our competitors. Even outside of recessionary times, the value SCF brings suppliers and buyers is huge, while the multi-funder model makes sure we get the best financing rates for the business.”</p>
<p>As a global provider of working capital solutions, <a href=""https://primerevenue.com/supply-chain-finance-PE/"" target=""_blank"">PrimeRevenue</a> itself runs multi-funder SCF programmes. One such project involved a global caffeinated beverage manufacturer facing billions of dollars in leveraged buyout debt on its balance sheet. It turned to PrimeRevenue to pay off its debt faster. Within the first quarter of launching an SCF programme, the company generated US$750m in cash flow gain, which was used to pay back 15% of its debt and increase the trailing-12-months debt/EBITDA ratio by around 20%.</p>
<p>Capolongo says the uncertain economic outlook, challenging operating environment for portfolio companies, and the increasingly demanding expectations of their owners means it’s crucial PE-owned firms recognise that “it’s not just about growth – it’s about value creation and expediency”.</p>
<p>He adds: “Companies need access to significant sums of cash, they need it quickly and they need to do it without taking on more debt. Looking beyond traditional funding options – to things like SCF, for example – should be part of their strategy to accomplish those objectives.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Multicurrency liquidity management in a volatile economic environment is a challenge but tools are available to help mitigate risk, lower costs and maximise efficiency. Treasury Today goes back to basics with the notions of pooling and sweeping.</em></p>
<p>If there was just one single currency for international trade, life would be so much easier. Instead there are around 167 official national currencies recognised as legal tender. Of course, in global trade many of these are little used, if at all. But even amongst the world’s core currencies, for an international business, having the funds available to meet all commitments in the right place, at the right time and in the right currency can be a challenge, especially considering the trade-off between maintaining readily available cash and the costs of maintaining this asset.</p>
<p>In order to optimise the corporate cash structure, affording a stronger degree of visibility and control, the practical response to this essential balancing act commonly boils down to the use of a cross-border cash pooling structure. This may include a number of options around the concepts of physical pooling (also known as cash concentration) and notional pooling (sometimes referred to as virtual pooling).</p>
<p>Physical pooling sweeps funds into a central and (preferably) tax-efficient location. A notional pool calculates interest on the combined credit and debit balances of accounts but there is no physical transfer of funds between accounts. Combinations may be used and a multi-banking corporate may choose an overlay provider (based perhaps on convenience, footprint or share of wallet).</p>
<p>From the outset it should be understood that some forms of pooling or automated sweeping are not permitted in certain jurisdictions.</p>
<h3 id=""overlay-structure"">Overlay structure</h3>
<p>An overlay cash pool is the top layer of a cash pooling structure in which liquidity is concentrated. It provides a mechanism to enable the physical concentration of cash across borders to a central liquidity pool. Liquidity and interest can be offset through this top layer, which operates as an umbrella-type structure above a network of underlying regional and local accounts or account pools, which can be with the same bank as the overlay pool or with different, local banks. The aim is to have one top-layer per group and then under this have a network of other structures. This allows the treasurer to connect to any other accounts in the structure below, more or less anywhere.</p>
<h3 id=""cross-border-cash-pooling"">Cross-border cash pooling</h3>
<p>A cross-border cash pool is a cash management structure that allows a business to concentrate the cash it holds in different countries, across separate bank accounts, in one location. This technique provides corporates with an effective way of interest optimisation and improved liquidity management. Excess cash from one subsidiary can be moved (swept) to offset debit balances in another. Periodic sweeping to a central account typically uses a ‘zero balance account (ZBA)’ approach where the account is completely emptied (see below for alternatives). Physical transfers of cash are treated as intercompany lending for tax and regulatory purposes.</p>
<h4 id=""pooling-per-legal-entity"">Pooling per legal entity</h4>
<p>When a subsidiary maintains multiple bank accounts in different currencies and countries, pooling the bank balances in each country on a legal entity basis can offer benefits to the group treasury. Cross-border sweeps are delivered to a pool in one country – concentrating all the subsidiary’s cash into a single position and providing visibility and control over all accounts.</p>
<h4 id=""pooling-per-country"">Pooling per country</h4>
<p>If the decision is made to set up pooling per country, each pool will see the various subsidiaries’ bank account balances swept to a master account in each country. These master account balances are then swept cross-border into a central pool in the main country of operation. Depending on factors such as the scope of operations and type of business, the corporate will have to weigh up the benefits of potential locations, as well as carrying out a thorough evaluation of the tax and legal issues that may exist in each.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways in which a cross-border sweeping arrangement can be set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border sweeping by legal entity</h5> <br/>
<p>Automatic sweeps from the subsidiaries’ bank accounts in the different country branches of the concentration bank go directly to the master account at the central pooling location. Should the subsidiary have multiple bank accounts in the same country, the balances need to be consolidated or netted to one account to limit the cross-border sweeps to one per country. If a corporate uses cross-border sweep by legal entity, it needs to be aware of the tax issues that can arise from cross-border inter-company loans being created between the master account holder and the operating companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border sweeping with initial domestic sweep</h5> <br/>
<p>If the corporate has a number of subsidiaries in each participating country, a two-step process can reduce the number of cross-border transfers involved in the sweeping arrangement. In this case, the master account holder would open a non-resident bank account, or target account, with the concentration bank in each participating country. The purpose of this is to enable cash concentration to take place on a domestic basis within each country first, prior to a second cross-border sweep from the target account in each country to the master account held in the final pooling location. Once again, the tax status of cross-border inter-company loans must be considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border sweeping with domestic notional pooling</h5> <br/>
<p>In this set up, the subsidiary balances are notionally pooled in each country first. The cross-border transfer is made from a master account in each of the domestic notional pools to the master account in the central pool location, reducing the balance of each country’s notional pool to zero.</p>
<p>In most cases, the group treasury is the master account holder in the pool in each country, as well as at the central pool location. This solution allows local subsidiaries to maintain ownership of their cash balances and removes the need for inter-company loans.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several variations on the sweeping theme beyond the simple ZBA model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Constant balancing</h5> <br/>
<p>Constant balancing operates on the same principle as zero balancing but a pre-defined residual amount is maintained in the sub-accounts as opposed to a balance of zero. The advantage to sub-account holders of this method is that a balance is immediately available at the start of the trading day to action payments, and interest is accrued on the sub-accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Target balancing</h5> <br/>
<p>Target balancing differs from plain ZBAs in that transfers are made from the master account to the sub-accounts in the opposite direction to which the zero balancing transfers were sent, so the sub-accounts keep a target balance. As the target transfers have a book date of ‘today’ but a value date of ‘tomorrow’, the sub-accounts always have a credit book balance but a zero-value balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Trigger balancing</h5> <br/>
<p>Trigger balancing is when upper and lower amounts are set on sub-accounts. Balances that exceed these amounts trigger the zero balancing process to take place, but only on those sub-accounts that meet the limits (these limits may vary for each sub-account). Trigger balancing can eliminate the need to sweep insignificant balances and lower the number of sweeps that take place, which in turn can reduce banking costs.</p>
<p>Some banks also offer the possibility to execute zero-balance sweeps at intervals other than the standard end-of-day frequency. This may benefit companies when activity on certain sub-accounts is low during certain periods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""cross-border-notional-pooling"">Cross-border notional pooling</h3>
<p>A cross-border notional pool allows corporates to optimise interest across a number of accounts in a variety of countries. In this case, the debit and credit balances of the participating accounts in each separate country are pooled for interest purposes. This may or may not involve cross-border transfers.</p>
<p>Multi-entity notional pooling is treated as bank lending for accounting purposes. Structuring notional cash pools on a cross-border basis thus can be problematic because the bank will require cross-guarantees for each participant. This means entities in the pool provide guarantees for each other’s liabilities. The bank also has the full legal right of set-off over pool accounts. It must retain this for reasons of capital adequacy but it also means it can use a client’s funds in one account to settle debts in another and has the option to terminate that agreement. It is rarely invoked but remains a possibility with which some treasurers will not be comfortable.</p>
<p>Once it is established that a cross-border notional cash pool is the corporate’s preferred option, and their chosen bank can provide this in the countries (and currencies) required, an assessment by treasury of the structure being offered is required. Some of the main structures for cross-border notional pooling are outlined as follows, using the zero balancing model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border notional pooling with domestic zero balancing by country</h5> <br/>
<p>In this structure, a domestic zero balancing cash pool is set up in each participating country. The balances on the master accounts for each of the domestic zero balancing country pools are then swept cross-border to accounts in the same name in the central notional pool. Sweeps can be two-way or one-way, depending on treasury’s requirements. The country accounts in the central pool are notionally pooled for interest purposes. Using this structure, inter-company loans can be created in country, but not cross-border.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border notional pooling with cross-border zero balancing by legal entity</h5> <br/>
<p>This structure removes the need for a domestic cash pool to be established, as cross-border sweeps are made on a legal entity basis. Within the cross-border notional pool, separate accounts are opened for each subsidiary using the structure. Sweeps are set up from all accounts held by the subsidiary in every country directly to its notional pool account in the ultimate pooling location. In some circumstances, the subsidiary may have multiple bank accounts in any one country. In this case, it can be beneficial to zero balance on a legal entity basis within the country first.</p>
<p>Cross-border notional pooling with cross-border zero balancing by legal entity ensures that there is no co-mingling of funds between subsidiary balances. The subsidiaries themselves retain control of their operating accounts, while their balances are simultaneously used to improve the group’s interest charge. If subsidiaries require funding at the local level, the two-way zero balancing sweeps also enable them to be funded indirectly by the master account holder in the cross-border notional pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border notional pooling with domestic notional pooling</h5> <br/>
<p>In-country notional cash pools are established for each country that the corporate requires in this structure. The master account holder for each of these then arranges transfers to an account in their own name that resides in the cross-border notional pool in the main pooling location. These accounts are then notionally pooled. The main benefit of this structure is on the legal side, as the number of participating accounts in the cross-border notional pool is streamlined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""multi-bank-cross-border-solutions"">Multi-bank cross-border solutions</h3>
<p>Cross-border pooling solutions can also be categorised according to whether multiple local banks are used in each country, or a single network that covers the region (or indeed the world) is employed. Using local banks in each individual country may be advantageous if the corporate operates in a relatively small number of countries, especially if it requires highly specific local expertise and services.</p>
<p>Using a larger regional network bank offers the advantages of harmonised services and documentation and the possibility to execute true end-of-day-based cross-border zero balancing. In order for a regional network bank to be a viable option, it must of course have branches or operating subsidiaries operating in all the countries in which the corporate is active.</p>
<p>Certain banks offer multi-bank sweeping services that automatically transfer balances between local bank accounts and the main cash management bank. Since cross-border multi-bank sweeps go through the correspondent banking process, the sweeps usually happen before the end of the business day allowing next-day use at best. Corporate SWIFT connectivity may be used to implement a bank-agnostic in-house pooling structure so that processing and use of the cash within the group is intraday.</p>
<p>This is clearly an advantage but will require the relevant entities to be incorporated into the technical infrastructure of a centralised treasury operation, and the establishment of a base with at least one major bank. The SWIFT network allows connection to almost every bank using various message types (typically MT940s in this instance), the aim being to achieve as much message standardisation and thus automation as possible. Issues with ‘non-standard’ SWIFT messages (in terms of defining the required fields) are common between different banks. SWIFT’s ISO 20022 .camt messages, once fully adopted, will play a crucial role in developing this opportunity.</p>
<h3 id=""trapped-cash"">Trapped cash</h3>
<p>In strongly regulated financial jurisdictions there may be tax implications, restrictions on inter-company lending and limitations on foreign currency convertibility and transfers. So-called ‘trapped cash’ creates a challenge for companies looking to optimise global liquidity. Although balances in some restricted jurisdictions can be used to offset borrowing elsewhere using interest enhancement/optimisation products, the rules vary.</p>
<p>China in particular is making inroads into the internationalisation of its currency but only recently has it been possible for wholly Foreign Owned Entities in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone to take advantage of renminbi (RMB) cross-border pooling. The success of such a scheme will almost certainly be predicated on access to in-depth local knowledge.</p>
<h3 id=""legal-framework"">Legal framework</h3>
<p>Because specific statutory frameworks often do not exist in relation to cash pooling, the framework in which it may operate will largely consist of rules imposed by domestic banking regulations and corporate and insolvency laws which also vary between each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Parties to a cash pooling arrangement may therefore need to devise a legal structure based on conventional legal instruments and concepts such as inter-company loans or those relating to local foreign exchange regulations, in order to establish the parameters in which cash pooling may operate. Matters such as distribution of profits, liabilities, capital maintenance and liquidity protection requirements must be investigated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3 id=""taxation"">Taxation</h3>
<p>According to the Treasury Alliance Group consultancy, almost all liquidity management structures will need to comply with the following three basic requirements from a tax perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Arm’s-length interest allocation: all financial arrangements between participants should reflect market price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business purpose: the entire structure must have a valid business purpose other than tax avoidance or the circumvention of non-tax regulatory restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic substance: the participants must have formal, legal responsibilities surrounding their participation in the pool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific tax issues likely to be encountered include interest deductibility, withholding tax, transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules, business tax and surcharges and stamp duty. Perhaps the most interesting initiative of the moment in terms of physical pooling is the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). This addresses concerns that the profits of multinationals are being allocated to locations different from those where the actual business takes place in order to reduce their overall tax liability. In response, treasurers should expect to revisit documentation and practices around liquidity, foreign exchange and intercompany financing amongst others.</p>
<h3 id=""decisions"">Decisions</h3>
<p>The suitability of pooling must always be part of a discussion with specialist banking, accounting, taxation and legal partners. Of course, not all banking systems are equal and not all entities within a group have the same needs. A centralised approach to treasury may not even be the best approach to multicurrency liquidity management, especially where complex firms come up against tax inefficiencies and difficult local banking and exchange controls. However pooling is approached, regular review is essential to ensure processes remains fit-for-purpose.</p>

<p><em>A treasury policy allows the treasury team to conduct activities with the level of flexibility needed, defined by accepted parameters. At least, that is what’s meant to happen. In this article, we look at the importance of exception handling and regular reviews to ensure harmonisation with market and business developments, amongst other priorities, to explore the fundamentals of what a good treasury policy should cover.</em></p>
<p>No treasury department should be without a treasury policy. The document is typically divided into a body (including the overall approach to treasury management in terms of scope, objectives, roles and responsibilities, the management of transactions, balance sheet and liquidity, and risk) and annexes detailing specific execution minutiae.</p>
<p>Having a well-defined treasury policy ensures treasury staff have written guidelines on their responsibilities and, more importantly, how to fulfil these. It will also detail their boundaries and how the department’s performance will be measured, minimising the risk of internal fraudulent activity due to the failure of suitable policy. “The most important part of the policy is the fact it needs to be adhered to at all times,” says Aashish Pitale, Group Treasurer, Essar Services India.</p>
<h3 id=""making-the-right-call"">Making the right call</h3>
<p>The processes treasury carries out are not areas in which to be vague; the value of a policy is largely dependent on the extent to which detail is provided. It is insufficient, for example, for a policy to simply state ‘forwards should be used to manage FX risk’. Rather, it is important that the treasury policy sets out what strategy should be used, and why, relevant to the particular business. The eventuality to avoid, according to Dana Laidhold, Treasurer of The Carlyle Group, is a “policy for the sake of policy mentality without a clear link back to the business”.</p>
<p>A Chinese manufacturer will have different priorities to the electronics company in Europe that buys parts from them, for instance. As a hypothetical example, in regards to currency transaction exposure, the latter’s policy might state something such as: ‘We import electric components from China (priced in US dollars), to sell in France (priced in euro). We pay the Chinese manufacturer 30 days after invoice date. We typically get paid within 14 days of shipment. From the point at which the obligation to make a payment from the Chinese company arises to the point at which the supplier is paid for those goods (in US dollars), the euro equivalent of the payment will fluctuate in accordance with movements in the USD/EUR exchange rate. Treasury’s aim is to hedge this risk to ensure the products can be sold at the profit margin forecast when the goods were purchased.’</p>
<p>The acceptable hedging instruments, exposure limits, approval process and use of any natural hedge will then be set out, based on this initial justification. It should have a fair amount of flexibility. As Pitale says: “When decisions are made by the treasury’s risk management committee on how to execute the policy, they respond to market conditions – but crucially within the framework of their policy. The policy document itself is not meant to change habitually in response to market conditions.”</p>
<p>Key considerations when establishing a good treasury policy are, therefore, to focus on the document’s compliance with local and international regulations as well as conforming to the objectives of the organisation. Taking a reactive approach, or deviating from policy because of volatility, Pitale says, can lead to treasurers “burning their fingers badly”. He highlights the current oil price volatility as one area which has caught out some international treasuries in this regard. It is worth emphasising that treasury is there to achieve its objectives, not to ‘win’ (or ‘lose’) on a particular hedge. Therefore, Pitale advises: “Stick to your policy during all times of market volatility.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""the-first-and-ongoing-steps"">The first (and ongoing) steps</h3>
<p>For this to be possible – and to avoid the occurrence of poor market-based decisions – policies should be tailored to the individual company’s business model. The starting points are largely the same, however, and the creation of a treasury policy can be split into three key stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The identification of all the activities which routinely take place in the treasury – and all of the risks which the company faces from a treasury perspective (see box above). This is an aspect where the finance director and the other departments which regularly work with the treasury (eg tax, accounting, and internal audit) should be involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing the set of procedures and strategies for managing the risks identified in the first step. This analysis and decision-making should be the responsibility of the treasurer and finance director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval from the board. This approval process will vary from company to company, of course, depending on who was responsible for drafting the policy. Ideally, this approval should take the form of a formal vote of confidence at a full board meeting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As Laidhold says: “What’s most important is to balance risk management with effective business operations. Policies should be underpinned with effective and executable processes.” To ensure this, her treasury team alongside writing the policy also drafts the operating procedures in narrative form and often use visio charts to ensure they will be efficient and “to plug any gaps”.</p>
<p>After which comes approval – but by no means is this the last step. “Every business is organic,” says Laidhold. Periodic reviews are a necessary part of ensuring a treasury policy matches developments within the business and in the industry – and therefore guarantees the department can operate in the relevant manner, without the constraint of an outdated policy. Reviews are typically annual but “to the extent that something material happens in the market or business, we may look at them more frequently than that”, Laidhold explains.</p>
<p>Factors that should be addressed in any policy review include: changes to regulations, changes in key personnel, and changes in the company’s business due to mergers and acquisitions, divestments, any relocation of operations, adding new business lines or products and major changes in the operating/reporting currency(s).</p>




<h3 id=""what-if-policy-isnt-adhered-to"">What if… policy isn’t adhered to?</h3>
<p>The policy should outline sufficient checks along the way “so something damaging can’t reach a point of material impact late in the game”, says Laidhold. Proper segregation of duties, levels of review and checklists, therefore, are essential “so that you minimise the risk a policy won’t be adhered to because you have a lot of cooks in the kitchen managing that process”.</p>
<p>She continues to say that to the extent which a treasury department writes a policy, implements it but doesn’t provide “training, ability for input or guidance for all affected stakeholders,” problems are bound to be encountered.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There are also external factors to consider, which are equally as driving. Laidhold provides the current example of changing factors in the short-term investment landscape – Basel III, Fed moves, prime Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) money market reform, for instance. “That influences treasurers to go back, look at their policies and make sure the department is equipped to effectively operate in that new environment.”</p>
<p>Having an up-to-date policy is not only vital for control, consistency and the assessment of new risks, but also the assessment of new opportunities. Reviews can ensure the department is utilising current best practice. This is particularly relevant to technology enhancements, says Laidhold. “It is important to stay abreast of technological developments, as new tools can make your operations more efficient and/or add controls.”</p>
<p>Do note, however, that not every area of a policy changes year-on-year. “It doesn’t have to be a monumental exercise and you don’t need to reinvent the wheel,” advises Laidhold.</p>
<h3 id=""beyond-the-basics"">Beyond the basics</h3>
<p>Most departments will have these basics covered, but there are areas worth emphasising. Exceptions to the procedures set out in the policy, for instance, are bound to occur and therefore warrant inclusion. A comprehensive policy will contain guidance on exception handling with resolution methodology – but from the start, it clearly cannot contain every exception. With each new exception, new knowledge can be included in the policy to ensure resolution can be achieved quicker should it happen again.</p>
<p>Whilst being an overarching document then, a balance needs to be struck between a policy containing necessary and comprehensive restrictions and one that is practical enough for the day-to-day operations of an individual treasury department. “This too shouldn’t be seen as daunting, however,” says Laidhold. It’s about bringing together stakeholders from within and outside of the treasury department that will be impacted by policy and the supporting operating procedures. “By doing so upfront, you get that buy-in and make sure you are striking the right balance between governance and risk management, and allowing procedures to remain efficient in impacted operations,” she says. “Turn over every rock together.”</p>
<h3 id=""a-focus-on-risk"">A focus on risk</h3>
<p>As the need to manage liquidity and risk has become more pressing during recent times, the importance of clearly defined conditions for some operations should not be overlooked – limits for market-related transactions, for instance. Again, this is an aspect which will not achieve equilibrium from the outset, emphasising for another time the importance of regular reviews. Limits set maximum and minimum levels of exposure for market factors. Examples include: no more than $8m of crude oil exposure to remain unhedged, no more than 1% of spare cash to be retained in RMB and no less than €5m of investment in money market funds.</p>
<p>When review time comes around, cause for change on limits could be, for instance, extremely large unutilised limits or regular limit breaches (from the perspective of operational and/or trader discipline and the adequacy of the limits in that market factor). Scandals in recent years reveal that it is these basic controls which are typically breached.</p>
<p>In addition to complying with limits, some of these (larger) transactions may require approval from senior members of the company. These people, however, are frequently travelling for meetings and conferences and are unlikely to be immediately available in all instances – consequently requiring the policy to cover the procedure in these cases (markets cannot wait for CFOs to return to address pending transactions). For most companies it will be pertinent to have pre-approved ranges so, should those people be out of the office, transactions can still go through on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3 id=""a-matter-of-detail"">A matter of detail</h3>
<p>Treasury policies need to reflect the risk appetite of the company. But, as alluded to, it is a fine line to tread when trying to establish a policy with sufficient detail to be a document relevant for serious use, but one without an overbearing amount of different elements to fulfil. For example, a statement such as “our objective is to maximise our return on liquid investments at minimum risk” is of little value as a policy on the treatment of cash deposits. At the other extreme, however, a treasury policy which lists the names of appropriate counterparties for cash deposits provides too much detail. Whilst the policy should specify the criteria for an appropriate counterparty, this would be too inflexible.</p>
<p>The key concept to bear in mind is parameters. If a policy doesn’t provide clarity of the acceptable margins in which to respond to such questions as ‘what conditions on borrowings is the company prepared to accept?’, ‘how is data held and stored on the systems and for how long?’, ‘what is the ideal maturity profile of the company’s borrowings?’ and ‘how will the company measure exposure to interest rate risk?’, then it’s time to revisit.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the aspects covered here – such as appetite for risk, frequency of review, market limits – will be influenced by company-specific factors such as corporate philosophy, extent of natural hedges, volatility in cash flows, volatility of the business sector, what competitors are doing and what advisors say, for instance. That is why it’s important when answering questions like those above to not rely on a one-size-fits-all approach, but to focus on your specific operating model. What’s more, individual treasurers will bring their own beliefs, standards and expertise to the table.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>PwC’s Capital project and infrastructure spending outlook to 2025 report estimates that annual infrastructure spending will grow from $4 trillion in 2012 to more than $9 trillion by 2025, with $78 trillion spent globally between 2014 and 2025. The firm says private investors may be called upon to foot a higher proportion of costs, even for traditional public sector projects.</p>
<p>However, project finance is also attractive to private sector organisations because they can fund major projects off balance sheet. Project finance is the financing of long-term infrastructure and industrial projects where debt and equity used to finance the project are paid back from the cash flow generated by the project. In other words, it is a loan structure that relies primarily on the project’s cash flow for repayment. A review of global project finance deals in 2014 conducted by Dealogic values total investment at $407.8 billion, the third highest full year volume on record. More than 1,100 deals were completed last year – the second highest full year activity on record – with energy-related projects accounting for one third of global volume.</p>
<p>In a working paper on project finance published in August 2014, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) observes that it depends on a sensible transfer of risks and returns and that if done properly, the involvement of the private sector can improve infrastructure project efficiency.</p>
<p>Doug Segars, Associate Managing Director of Moody’s EMEA project and infrastructure finance team, explains that bank lending has picked up through Japanese banks, some European banks returning to the market and a number of new banks that are more significant now than before the financial crisis. “Public bond issues appear sporadically, but the real story is private debt – both for new projects and as a source of refinancing for existing bank loans,” he notes.</p>
<p>Segars refers to significant appetite for greenfield projects, with investors with defined mandates chasing well-structured projects in sectors such as renewables. “Even demand-risk projects (where there is a risk that a demand forecast may not meet the actual demand) are once again financeable as long as sponsors are realistic. It is very much a borrower’s market at the moment and – barring countries that present clear political and economic risk – we see interest from investors for projects across the world.”</p>
<p>There is very strong appetite in the capital markets for infrastructure project exposure (both equity and debt) says Michael Wilkins, Managing Director Infrastructure Finance ratings at Standard &amp; Poor’s. “Commercial banks have been interested in debt exposure since the early days of project finance in the 1990s and this level of interest has risen in recent years. The other source of finance is institutional, including pension funds, insurers, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers who are looking for long-dated exposure with stable cash flows,” he notes. Banks (commercial, multilaterals and export finance) account for 80% of total project finance, with the remainder made up mostly by project bond issues, he adds. “Banks like projects with strong sponsors, such as an oil and gas project backed by one of the oil majors.”</p>
<h3 id=""investor-considerations"">Investor considerations</h3>
<p>Yield pick-up relative to comparable asset classes is one of the factors investors will take into account when considering whether to back a project, concludes Wilkins. “The average yield on a sovereign bond is around 2%, whereas infrastructure projects generate 3.5-4%.”</p>
<p>Most of the assets in the infrastructure space have behaved in a very predictable way, generating steady returns over a long time horizon. That is the view of Giles Frost, Chief Executive, Amber Infrastructure, who describes one of the benefits of project finance as being that the returns are largely (or in some cases completely) uncorrelated to wider economic factors.</p>
<p>According to the BIS, it is necessary to broaden the potential group of investors beyond direct equity investors and banks. When considering the appeal of infrastructure investment, Frost draws a distinction between the relatively small number of treasurers who have access to long-term cash – for example, those working in insurance companies who are looking for assets to match their long-term liabilities – and the much larger group who are focused on efficient cash management.</p>
<p>“For the latter, listed infrastructure funds are a good way of accessing this asset class. These funds show many of the characteristics of the underlying assets but can be easily traded in and out of.”</p>
<p>He states that treasurers tend to favour investment in their domestic market, with those in the UK and US displaying the most international tendencies. “The profile of London as an international financial centre and the access to a variety of experts that this entails means UK treasurers tend to get offered a wider variety of investments.”</p>
<p>Manish Gupta, Head of Infrastructure Corporate Finance at EY, suggests that anyone looking to invest for a period shorter than seven to eight years should be looking for alternatives to infrastructure investment. “There are many infrastructure debt instruments that are liquid, such as government guaranteed bonds issued by Network Rail or high credit quality bonds issued by infrastructure companies such as Heathrow Airport and regulated utilities. I am aware of many institutional investors who have invested in high credit rated bonds, in some cases as a replacement for gilts.”</p>
<p>When it comes to investment preferences, he agrees that treasurers tend to prefer other markets where the same language is spoken, but adds that most treasurers in developed markets will have an aversion to considering treasury investment options in developing markets. “There is some nervousness around projects in less developed economies in Europe and further afield, particularly where the currency is not linked to the pound or dollar.”</p>
<p>It is possible now for mid-market firms to raise facilities on a corporate level to finance long-term projects with maturities of ten years or beyond, which was not the case even two years ago explains Nedim Music, Assistant Director, Corporate Finance Debt Advisory at Deloitte UK. “The project finance market is very liquid at the moment. Insurance companies and pension funds are hungry for yields and looking to deploy capital, so there is a lot of appetite for infrastructure assets.”</p>
<p>For corporates looking to invest in infrastructure projects that they are not directly involved in, Gavin Quantock, Assistant Director at Deloitte Corporate Finance, suggests that this might not be the most efficient way to invest surplus cash.</p>
<p>“Certain infrastructure assets can be an illiquid market for long-term investors, whereas a corporate treasurer would typically be looking to deploy surplus cash for as little as six and no more than 24 months. The requirement for extensive due diligence is a further reason why corporate treasurers could look elsewhere for short-term returns,” says Quantock.</p>
<h3 id=""increasing-appeal"">Increasing appeal</h3>
<p>One of the factors that would increase the attraction of project finance investment is where the project is of strategic importance to the company and can be financed internally until it is operational and could be refinanced. An example might be a food company financing the construction of a biomass energy facility from its balance sheet in order to create a reliable source of energy and increase the sustainability of its production facility.</p>
<p>Rod Morrison, Editor of Project Finance International at Thomson Reuters describes availability of finance for private sector projects as very good. “There is a lot of long-term debt available from banks and institutional investors and swap rates and loan margins are very low, which is positive for clients.”</p>
<p>Multilateral and export credit agencies are an important source of funding in less developed countries, but elsewhere there is a considerable volume of commercial debt available with the market having fully recovered from the effects of the global financial crisis, he continues. “Liquefied natural gas schemes and oil and gas projects in general are most favoured, although they are being impacted by falling oil prices. Renewable projects with strong tariffs or schemes with good sponsors are also attractive. Regionally, North America is doing well due to the shale gas boom, while Australia has benefited from major infrastructure projects.”</p>
<p>On a transactional level, there is consistent and heavy oversubscription of project finance transactions in primary phase in both bond and loan markets as well as broad and constant demand for assets in the secondary market with far fewer sellers than over the last two to three years, says Jean-Francois Grandchamp des Raux, Global Head of Energy and Infrastructure Group at Crédit Agricole CIB.</p>
<p>“There is strong and robust appetite amongst the leading project finance banks to underwrite transactions and we are starting to see underwritings re-emerge as a favoured strategy compared to traditional large club transactions. Furthermore, sponsors have stronger leverage and increasing diversity of funding options available to them, which provides them with a strong ability to secure more attractive terms and conditions, particularly pricing where we have has seen large reductions across the board over the last 12-24 months,” he says.</p>
<p>According to Grandchamp des Raux, the capital markets and institutional investors are increasing their market share particularly as the project finance bond option becomes a more mature, deliverable and readily available source of financing for private sector projects. This is particularly relevant in Europe where it has partially replaced some loss of the liquidity from those banks who exited the market in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis and the subsequent European sovereign crisis in 2011-12. “As the liquidity pressure on the Eurozone has receded and banks restructured their asset base as well as rebuilding their capital positions, we have seen a strong return of bank liquidity into the project finance product in 2013-2014.”</p>
<p>He describes export credit agencies and multilaterals as continuing to play an important ‘anchoring’ role in emerging and developing countries to bridge liquidity gaps and help facilitate private sector financiers to gain more comfort around sovereign and political risks. There is also evidence of government intervention in the form of credit enhancement mechanisms becoming less relevant for most sectors as liquidity constraints for project financing have disappeared, with the exception of specific sub-sectors of the market which remain challenging for private sector financiers, such as nuclear power.</p>
<p>“The strongest global demand from international commercial lenders is for assets structured in the investment grade arena with limited construction risks. These projects typically benefit from having strong/experienced sponsors and core developed geographies in key sub-sectors such as utility networks, energy and public-private partnership transactions.”</p>
<h3 id=""geographic-focus"">Geographic focus</h3>
<p>Grandchamp des Raux says that countries experiencing substantial growth in investment are in North America (particularly in the energy sectors) and also in Latin America, which represents a considerable opportunity for sponsors and lenders given the macroeconomic outlook/performance combined with relatively under-invested infrastructure. “Banks, in particular, have become increasingly focused on their broader client relationships and geographic focus when deploying capital to projects as they have had to manage their balance sheet constraints in the face of the tougher regulatory environment.”</p>
<p>There is also strong interest in projects in the Middle East and Africa as well as Europe, says Quantock. “The European Commission’s infrastructure plan commits to an investment of £315 billion over the next three years, which means there are a considerable number of transport projects in the pipeline. Energy infrastructure such as solar, on- and off-shore wind, carbon capture and storage and biomass is also high on the agenda.”</p>
<p>According to Deloitte’s Music, lenders are looking for projects with solid sponsors and advisory teams. “Whilst there is more capital to be deployed than there was a few years ago, lenders will want to see evidence of previous successful project delivery. It can be hard to find financing for new technologies.”</p>
<p>The overall financial structure and visibility of earnings also impact on credit quality, adds Music. “There is greater interest in private finance initiative or PFI infrastructure assets where there is an annual government contribution – investing in a toll road where future income depends on the number of vehicles that use the road is clearly less predictable.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, John-Patrick Sweny, a counsel in the project finance group at Latham &amp; Watkins says the recent focus of multilaterals and export credit agencies appears to have shifted from developing country projects to projects in developed countries. “While the amount of capital markets debt for project finance transactions is not currently experiencing the same growth as for bank loans, project bond debt continues to make up a significant share of the overall debt mix globally and is playing an increasingly important role in the financing of projects in certain regions, for example Europe.”</p>
<p>Transport and infrastructure projects in certain jurisdictions (US, Australia, Mexico) continue to attract high levels of investment and there are signs of increased investment in African infrastructure projects, which historically have struggled to attract private sector investment, as investors are forced to seek out more attractive yields in a low interest environment, Sweny continues. “Recent large mining deals in Australia – such as the Roy Hill iron ore project – are outliers in a sector that has traditionally relied on corporate rather than project financing and continues to experience difficulties in Africa and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>When it comes to making a project attractive to investors, he refers to the importance of robust commercial and financing contractual arrangements that clearly allocate risk between the project, its commercial counterparties and its lenders. “For example, depending on the sector, lenders may not be willing to take construction risk and instead may expect a guarantee of the project’s debt by the sponsors until it is completed to the lenders’ satisfaction, or that a suitable construction contractor takes delay and pricing risk during the construction phase of the project through the negotiation of a fixed price, turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contract.</p>
<p>“Ensuring that internationally-reputable counterparts are engaged with respect to the development, supply and operation of the project is extremely important, as is the reputation of the project’s sponsors in many cases.”</p>
<p>In addition to core structuring and economic considerations, lenders will take into account a wide range of factors, depending on the sector and location of the project. Particularly for greenfield projects in developing countries, they will be concerned about the political stability in the host country and seek assurance that the development of the project is in line with the perceived strategic interests of the country to mitigate the risk of future expropriation or other government interference.</p>
<p>“It should be noted that a stable regulatory framework is a concern for lenders to projects in developed and developing countries alike, with the instability of the UK regulatory regime related to renewable energy over a prolonged period of time, for example, undermining investment in that sector,” notes Sweny.</p>
<p>“Geopolitical events can also come into play, as demonstrated by the recent sanctions imposed by the US and EU governments, which in the case of US sanctions specifically targeted the financing of gas projects in Russia, causing certain investors to suspend their involvement in, or pull out of, a number of Russian projects which have had to rely increasingly on domestic and Asian sources of financing,” he concludes.</p>

BPO: a solution looking for a problem?,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Sometimes new processes can take a while to become fully established. SWIFT’s BPO is a case in point. The first end-to-end automated trade finance transaction using the BPO was carried out, with the help of Standard Chartered, between Belgium-based BP Aromatics and Oman-based Octal Petrochemicals as far back as 2011. But since then, uptake has been gradual at best.</p>
<p>There are good reasons to believe this will change in the next 12 months, however. Last year, a milestone was reached when the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) published uniform rules and technological standards for the BPO, giving users of the solution the legal clarity they previously complained was lacking. Over the past year, SWIFT has also invested considerable time and resources in an educational campaign to communicate the benefits of the BPO to corporates, banks and other important stakeholders.</p>
<p>On the banking side, at least, the campaign appears to be paying off. According to the latest data from SWIFT, a total of 12 banking groups are now ready to go live with the solution, with a further 56 – including 15 of the top 20 trade banks – currently in the process of adopting the BPO.</p>
<h3 id=""the-opportunity-for-banks"">The opportunity for banks</h3>
<p>One reason why BPO uptake has been slow thus far may be the threat some bankers perceive the solution poses to the letter of credit (LC) – a revenue stream for banks which they are naturally keen to retain. But Jim Bidwell, Global Head of Documentary Trade Product Management at Barclays, believes these fears are misplaced. At Sibos, SWIFT’s four-day user conference hosted last year in Dubai, he attempted to set the record straight. Although banks will inevitably see some business move from the LC to the BPO, the migration will only be partial and will certainly not eliminate demand for LCs entirely, he told assembled delegates at a breakfast briefing hosted by Barclays.</p>
<p>Indeed, what the banks might lose in LC business, over time, is likely to be far less significant than what they are poised to gain from being able, with the BPO, to re-intermediate themselves through financing in the Open Account space. “For banks that think deeply about the BPO, commit to it, and put their propositions together, I think the opportunities in Open Account far outweigh that which might be lost on the small part of the LC business,” says Bidwell.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about how the BPO would be used in practise has also hampered uptake, according to Bidwell. All the while that the BPO was an initiative exclusive to SWIFT it was always going to be very difficult to reach critical mass in terms of bank adoption. But there is hope that the ICC’s rules, by bringing the BPO in line with other trade finance products such as the LC, documentary collections (D/Cs), and guarantees, will now facilitate an increase in bank confidence in the technology. “Now the banks have a clear set of standards to work with,” he explains, “which means that banks don’t need to have separate agreements with SWIFT and other parties, as everyone knows the rules to play by. That was a very important step.”</p>
<p>Moving forward, Bidwell would like to see greater collaboration between banks. This, he notes, is absolutely imperative if the BPO is to be a success. To explain, Bidwell uses an example of a financing opportunity involving a supplier based in an unfamiliar market. “If Barclays were the obligor bank in a transaction, we would find it very difficult to provide pre-shipment finance to a supplier in a country such as Taiwan, for instance, where we do not operate. But what we could do to help our client finance their supply chain is to work with a local Taiwan-based bank and encourage them to use the BPO to provide pre-shipment finance for the supplier, based on the fact that Barclays is guaranteeing the payment risk in its role as obligor bank.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the BPO’s design supports interoperability between participating banks, making the collaboration Bidwell speaks of relatively straightforward. This interoperability is made possible through the use of a standard set of ISO 20022 messages, each of which reflects events that have taken place in the physical supply chain, and, according to SWIFT, “creates trigger points for the provision of financial services”.</p>
<h3 id=""building-a-business-case"">Building a business case</h3>
<p>In terms of adoption, another argument the banks are often heard making is that they want to see corporate demand become more established before they go live with the BPO. So far, only a small number of corporates have experience of using the solution (mostly commodity players such as OCTAL Petrochemicals) but the feedback from that sample has nevertheless been largely positive. If there are any challenges for corporates using the solution, most of these are internal and not directly connected to actual BPO processes.</p>
<p>“It is something which I think many companies who use the BPO will find,” says Gary Slawther, Corporate Treasurer at OCTAL. “Trade finance people – logistics departments, for instance – know what they like and like what they know. They are generally experienced and have been using LCs for years, and trying to get people to change and use something new can therefore be quite a challenge.”</p>
<p>For adoption among end-users to increase, it is vital that the benefits of the BPO are fully appreciated. For that to happen, the simplification which the solution can bring to trade operations needs to be more effectively communicated. Should that not happen then the level of corporate demand that banks need to take their propositions forward may never materialise. “If it is just seen as a bank product then there is a strong possibility that it will just wither on the vine,” says Slawther.</p>
<p>Enrico Camerinelli, Senior Analyst at the Aite Group, agrees. In his opinion, the near exclusive focus on what the solution has to offer for banks is one of the reasons why the development of the BPO has been so protracted. “There is a tendency from banks to believe that if they solve their own problems the benefits will somehow ripple down to corporates. But that is not always the case,” he explains.</p>
<p>The benefits are definitely there, however (see the box on page 20 for a refresher). The challenge for SWIFT and the banking community in the year ahead will be making sure that message is effectively communicated to corporate clients. “That means listening to their views and helping them build a business case for their involvement,” says Camerinelli. If that important step is taken, then we should begin to see the solution adopted more widely in the year ahead, although it may still be some time before corporate use approaches critical mass.</p>
<h3 id=""spreading-the-word"">Spreading the word</h3>
<p>With eyes fixed firmly on presenting the BPO “in a more corporate-centric way”, André Casterman, Head of SWIFT’s Global Strategy and Business Development in the Corporate and Trade markets, admits that a fresh look at how it is promoted is needed.</p>
<figure class=""center"">

<p>For Casterman, “it is no use talking about how it works” to corporates because corporates have no need to know – in the same way that a mobile phone user does not care how their network operates, only that it works when it is needed. So how is SWIFT going to drive interest in this potentially very useful trade product? Playing on the sheer practicality of the solution is a good place to start, it seems.</p>
<p>“What we will be doing in 2014 is working on industry-specific value propositions,” says Casterman. There is logic to this focused approach. In certain geographies – intra-Europe, for example – the transportation of goods is rapid, but the paper trail is not. The traditional letter of credit (LC), as a paper-based document, will often land on the relevant parties’ desks after the shipped goods have docked. It slows down the supply chain and receipt of payment to the point where letters of indemnity, much-disliked by the shipping protection and insurance (P&amp;I) clubs –because they are complex and yet offer little real protection – are used to try to expedite flows.</p>
<p>To begin with, companies trading in commodities will remain the main focus for SWIFT in 2014. Casterman explains that typical deals in this space are sizeable, recurring and are typically between large corporates that have already established a high level of mutual trust. The market is also intensely competitive to the point where banking fees “are a secondary interest” when it comes to maintaining client relationships and thus anything that can speed up the trade flow and receipt of goods is welcome.</p>
<p>SWIFT is also seeking to demonstrate that regardless of the duration of the physical transportation process, the BPO will be beneficial for buyers. When a purchase order is agreed, if an LC is to be used it must be opened immediately because the documentation process is slow.</p>
<p>As an electronic document currently presented between banks via SWIFT’s TSU, the BPO ensures that an LC can be opened at a much later point, where perhaps the exporter needs only to manage its risk as the shipment arrives – if the order is cancelled pre-delivery the shipment can be re-routed to a new buyer.</p>

<p>“We are aligning the use of credit lines to the real risks in the physical world,” says Casterman, adding that over time the system under-pinning the BPO “will shift entirely to e-banking”. Integration of trade solutions will be essential and SWIFT’s commercial partners are being co-opted into the process. Trade finance solution vendors, such as Surecomp and Global Trade Corporation, already have SWIFT certification for their products. In order to keep that status, all vendors will need to combine the BPO – perhaps as a separate module – with the other instruments such as LCs and Guarantees.</p>
<p>So, perhaps the BPO has now found the problem to its solution, but convincing corporates of that fact will still take time.</p>

<h3 id=""bpo-refresher-the-essentials"">BPO refresher: the essentials</h3>
<p>The BPO is essentially an irrevocable undertaking given by one bank to another bank that payment will be made on a specified date, following a successful electronic matching of data. It functions in a way which is similar to both the letter of credit (LC) and open account settlement, but there are a number of crucial differences <a href=""#chart-1-the-bpo-elements-of-both-worlds"">(see Chart 1)</a>.</p>
<p>For corporates, the BPO offers benefits in three main areas. The first benefit is improved risk mitigation <a href=""#chart-2-risk-mitigation-and-financing-in-the-supply-chain"">(see Chart 2)</a>. In terms of documentary risk, the BPO has significant advantages over traditional trade finance products which are often vulnerable to discrepancies. For example, when using an LC, a participant in a trade may find the goods descriptions on their documents differ from that of their counterparty’s.</p>
<p>However, with the BPO, purchase orders are agreed at the very outset using a data matching application – such as SWIFT’s Trade Services Utility (TSU) – thus minimising the risk of confusion arising between counterparties further down the line. As this action is performed automatically, without the need for manual input, it also has the advantage of not requiring a large team to approve documents exchanged between the buyer and seller.</p>
<p>Next is the assurance the solution provides for sellers that they will be paid in full and on time. Unlike trade on open account, which offers no such assurance, the BPO functions rather like a confirmed LC. This leads in to the third main benefit – the opportunity for the seller to use the BPO as possible collateral for pre and post-shipment financing. Once the obligor bank has issued the BPO, the recipient bank knows that, providing their client ships the goods, repayment is covered.</p>
<p>At this stage, even if the shipment has yet to take place, and might not do so for months, the recipient bank could be prepared to provide its client with a percentage of the value of the BPO as pre-shipment finance. After the goods have been manufactured and shipped, data arrives from the supplier which is matched with the purchase order baseline and, at that point, the obligor bank’s obligation to pay is crystallised.</p>
<p>This also has potential benefits for the buyer. Now that the seller is able to obtain pre-shipment finance, using the BPO as collateral, the buyer may be able to negotiate more favourable contract terms than would have been feasible previously.</p>

<h5 id=""anande-pande-global-head-of-trade-royal-bank-of-scotland-rbs"">Anande Pande, Global Head of Trade, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS):</h5>
<p>Global trade is slowing as a result of the renewed uncertainty we are seeing in both Europe and the US. The latest study from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), published in April 2013, put world trade growth at 2% in 2012 and forecasts 3% growth for this year.</p>
<p>This downtrend will amplify trade finance risk for corporates in Asia in two respects. Firstly, the probability of customers declining shipment in certain industries may increase – something we saw a lot of during the last financial crisis. Secondly, trade flows are shifting, with more trade now taking place within Asia and more in the new corridors opening in the Middle East, Africa and the CIS nations. But while these corridors provide the corporate in Asia with a counterbalance for sluggish demand in Europe and the US, they also bring new problems.</p>
<p>What can a corporate do to mitigate the new risks it will inevitably face when moving into new markets? The first port of call is the credit control department. Start with the basics and evaluate the financial robustness and delivery capabilities of your buyers and suppliers. You may also want to diversify, as far as possible, the locations in which you trade. As we saw in recent years when natural calamities caused the collapse of whole supply chains in Japan and Thailand, buying from one country in order to minimise costs is a strategy which could come back to bite you.</p>
<p>The strength of your legal documentation is another important consideration. If you are selling to an overseas market, you must be aware of the laws of that particular country and whether a potential claim will be enforceable. So the risk function is not only mitigating the risk on the balance sheet. A company needs a very strong risk management focus that takes into account the various non-financial risks that also come with trading.</p>
<p>Letters of credit (LCs), like all paper documentation, are liable to occasional errors that could give the importer the right to refuse payment. To avoid this scenario, find out what your banks are offering in terms of outsourcing solutions in which they prepare the export documents on your behalf to ensure they are not discrepant. Explore electronic trade solutions whenever possible as this reduces documentation error and increases administration efficiency.</p>
<p>With open account as the dominant force in Asian markets, corporates may also want to consider insurance companies that provide risk mitigation for a pool of buyers. The Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) could also help. As a risk mitigant for open account transactions – although still a work in progress – it will help corporates, not only to manage risk on open account transactions, but also increase their trade volumes across the world.</p>

<h5 id=""steven-beck-head-of-trade-finance-programme-asian-development-bank-adb"">Steven Beck, Head of Trade Finance Programme, Asian Development Bank (ADB):</h5>
<p>Corporates must not be deterred from exporting to challenging markets because of payment risks. That may sound like an imprudent thing to say, but the fact is there are ways of shifting these risks off corporates’ books.</p>
<p>LCs and other trade finance instruments have been in existence for hundreds of years. They work well to mitigate risk. Financial institutions can ‘confirm’ (guarantee) trade finance instruments such as LCs, thereby removing the emerging market payment risk. To enhance commercial banks’ ability to assume emerging market payment risk on behalf of corporates, the ADB established the Trade Finance Programme (TFP), which works with commercial banks to support trade in the most challenging markets.</p>
<p>TFP diminishes commercial bank trade finance risk. In 2012 TFP supported $4 billion in trade in the most challenging markets. Of TFP’s 18 markets, its five most active markets were Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan. TFP is in the process of expanding to Myanmar, where there is huge interest from corporates, and in turn their banks, to cover payment risk associated with sales to this frontier market.</p>
<p>In addition to working with commercial banks to reduce payment risk, corporates can also look to insurance, covering payment risk either on buyers – in some cases this is not possible – or from a buyer’s bank under trade finance instruments such as LCs.</p>
<p>There are ways for corporates to mitigate payment risks in frontier markets. ADB, among other multilateral development banks, is playing its part to bolster financial institutions’ capacity to support corporate sales in tough markets. Corporates should be encouraged to expand into frontier markets knowing that associated risks can be managed, regardless of how challenging the market may seem.</p>

<h5 id=""simon-constantinides-regional-head-of-global-trade-and-receivables-finance-asia-pacific-hsbc"">Simon Constantinides, Regional Head of Global Trade and Receivables Finance, Asia Pacific, HSBC:</h5>
<p>A tectonic shift in global trade patterns is underway, forcing many exporters to seek new opportunities, but alongside those opportunities come new – or at least unfamiliar – risks. As businesses switch their focus from the moribund markets of Europe and North America to the vibrant – but more volatile – environment of the emerging economies, they are being squeezed between falling incomes and the rising cost of covering their exposure. It has never been more important to keep the costs of risk mitigation under control. There are two main areas of increased risk: new and untested customers and unpredictable currencies.</p>
<p>Trade finance insurance can be a key element of a broader risk mitigation strategy, but the most effective and cost-efficient way of cutting the danger of default from a customer is to work with a trusted partner which has extensive network and experience on the ground to bridge the gap between markets. Intimate knowledge of the local corporate landscape can give an inside track on potential problems before they become critical and frequently leads to lower costs for credit guarantees.</p>
<p>Currency risks can be less easy – and therefore more expensive – to hedge, but certain effective strategies are emerging, particularly in Asia. Loose monetary policies in the West have led to excess cash flowing in and out of emerging markets, in response to fluctuations in the capital risk/return equation. For a trader operating in such a volatile environment, an unlucky currency call can make the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>Full hedging can be expensive, but certain trends are becoming apparent in emerging Asia. Professor Takatoshi Ito of the University of Tokyo calculated that after controlling for the G3 currencies (US dollar, Japanese yen and the euro), RMB accounts for between 40% and 49% of the fluctuation in the Singapore dollar, the Indonesian rupiah and the Malaysian ringgit, and between 30% and 39% for the Indian rupee, Thai baht, and Taiwan new dollar. After more than half a century as a closed book, the RMB is now establishing itself as a global currency, and the creation of a broad range of hedging instruments is part of that process. It is clear that as exporters explore new markets, they are being exposed to new risks, but with the right partner and the right strategy they can be cost-effectively minimised.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Sridhar Kanthadai"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2013/05/2013-05-tta-03-qa-sridhar-kanthadai-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""sridhar-kanthadai-regional-head-of-transaction-banking-north-asia-standard-chartered"">Sridhar Kanthadai, Regional Head of Transaction Banking, North Asia, Standard Chartered:</h5>
<p>As growth in trade continues to shift from West to East, an increasing number of Asian corporates are expanding beyond their borders. This means they have to operate in new markets with new suppliers under different local regulations. Financial and economic challenges of the past five years have refocused companies’ concerns around counterparty, cross-border liquidity and bank risks. Impact of evolving regulatory requirements such as Basel III is also prompting companies to take a much closer look at how they manage their risk exposures.</p>
<p>Therefore it is critical that Asian corporates find efficient ways of managing risk and cost associated with trade transactions. Here are a few options for Asian corporates’ consideration.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is important to choose the right option for your needs. Starting from the LC to pre-payment, the gamut of options available for companies is staggering. Domestic trade typically uses variants that are established in the particular market. While historically cross-border trade has relied on the documentary origins such as LC, there is an increasing acceptance of open account trade. For those who still prefer the payment certainty of an LC but want the efficiency of open account trade, the Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) is a new solution that is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Secondly, complex supply chains using procurement hubs and re-invoicing centres have resulted in significant value flows for many industries, a big portion of which is inter-company. The regulatory and capital overheads that banks now face and, the potential reduction in financing for less creditworthy names, have also driven needs of companies to manage and support supply chains while managing the risks. Corporates need to look for an experienced financial partner that is able to support these needs, whether it be through receivables financing to reduce credit exposure and improve their days sales outstanding (DSO) and working capital measures; buyer financing to accelerate their receivables and release buyer credit; or vendor financing to extend payment terms and in turn improve working capital.</p>
<p>Thirdly, trade credit insurance is a good risk management tool for Asian corporates to consider in order to mitigate the risks of open account trade. The insurance would help de-risk their business growth while supporting an increasing volume of financing transactions.</p>

<h3 id=""export-finance-solution"">Export finance solution</h3>
<p>Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets has developed an export finance solution designed to support exporters to meet their working capital requirements and is typically provided by way of either a loan or through the provision of guarantees. Structured to meet financing needs either pre- or post-shipment, the facility is typically secured by a letter of credit (L/C) opened in favour of the exporter or a similar instrument.</p>
<p>The size of facility will be dependent on a range of criteria including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The gross margin of the underlying goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of the underlying goods – this will be suitably assessed by reviewing track record, quality of suppliers and customer processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of order book – the underlying goods will typically be subject to either a high percentage of orders from good quality end-buyers and/or a demonstrable track record of sales to a diversified quality customer base.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where an L/C is provided, the bank will take an assignment over the proceeds. All goods must be insured during the life of the transaction and insurance documents issued to the order of Lloyds Bank or with Lloyds Bank named as loss payee.</p>
<p>The next two solutions detailed below are UK government-led initiatives which Lloyds Bank is supporting.</p>
<h3 id=""export-credit-guarantees-department-ecgd-export-working-capital-scheme"">Export credit guarantees department (ECGD) – export working capital scheme</h3>
<p>This is one of four new ECGD products announced in February to coincide with the publication of the Trade and Investment white paper. The scheme is being introduced to assist UK exporters gain access to working capital finance (both pre- and post-shipment) in respect of specific export contracts with a value of £1m and above. Under the scheme, ECGD will provide partial guarantees to banks to cover the credit risks associated with approved export working capital facilities. Where a bank provides such a facility in respect of a UK export contract, ECGD can typically guarantee 50% of the risk.</p>
<p>It is envisaged that the scheme will be particularly useful in circumstances where a UK exporter wins an overseas contract that is higher in value than is typical for it or wins more overseas contracts than it has done before. The types of transaction supported under the scheme are likely to be structured working capital facilities where, for example, the bank may wish to introduce additional control mechanisms relating to drawings under the facility or to monitor repayment in line with the cash flows arising from the underlying contract. The scheme is not intended to cover funding provided as part of a general overdraft facility.</p>

</figure>
<h4 id=""what-are-the-benefits-of-the-scheme"">What are the benefits of the scheme?</h4>
<p>The principal benefit for the UK exporter is that it is able to obtain the necessary working capital finance from its bank to support an export transaction in circumstances where its bank does not have sufficient risk appetite for the full facility amount.</p>
<p>“The scheme is designed to help a bank meet a funding request which they are fully supportive of but are unable to proceed with due to an absence of suitable security cover,” says Simon Banham.</p>
<h4 id=""risks-covered"">Risks covered</h4>
<p>The bank is protected, to the extent of ECGD’s guarantee, against the failure of the UK exporter to repay amounts due under the working capital facility upon its expiry, cancellation or termination.</p>
<h4 id=""eligibility"">Eligibility</h4>
<p>The following criteria must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The guaranteed bank should normally be incorporated in an EU or OECD country and be regulated by a regulator acceptable to the ECGD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exporter must be operating in business in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facility must relate to a contract between the exporter and a buyer outside the United Kingdom (which includes the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) under which the exporter supplies goods and/or services to the buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advances under the facility must be used to pay or reimburse the exporter for payment of expenses incurred in tendering for or performing the export contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The export contract must have a minimum of 20% UK content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum value of the working capital facility cannot be greater than 75% of the export contract’s value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The export contract to which the facility relates should normally have a value of more than £1m.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: for export working capital requirements under £1m, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) Export Enterprise Finance Guarantee (ExEFG) scheme may be more appropriate. However, ECGD will consider applications for smaller amounts where they cannot benefit from support under the ExEFG.)</p>
<h4 id=""maximum-minimum-facility-amount"">Maximum/minimum facility amount</h4>
<p>There is no maximum (or minimum) value for the working capital facility, although the total value of the export contract should normally be greater than £1m.</p>
<h4 id=""maximum-minimum-term"">Maximum/minimum term</h4>
<p>The facility must have a maximum term of less than two years. There is no minimum term.</p>
<h4 id=""cost"">Cost</h4>
<p>The guaranteed bank pays the ECGD a guarantee fee which is typically a proportion of the interest margin received by the bank from the UK exporter for providing the working capital facility.</p>

<p>ECGD has launched the bond support scheme announced in the ‘Trade and Investment for Growth’ white paper.</p>
<h4 id=""what-is-the-bond-support-scheme"">What is the bond support scheme?</h4>
<p>Under the scheme ECGD provide partial guarantees to banks in respect of UK exports. Where a bank issues a contract bond (or procures its issue by an overseas bank) in respect of a UK export contract, ECGD can typically guarantee 50% of the value of the bond and up to 80% for advance payment and progress payment bonds.</p>
<p>“Bonding requirements for an exporter can often be considerable, especially where the company is looking at a step change in its business through the underlying contract. In many cases bond issuance can tie up valuable working capital by the need to fully or partially cash back a facility. The scheme is designed to meet these growth ambitions whilst releasing cash back into the business,” says Simon Banham.</p>

Commerzbank’s Trade Finance,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>While open account has emerged as the method of payment predominantly used in international trade, traditional instruments such as letters of credit and documentary collections still bring trading partners an additional level of security. For this reason many companies still use them, despite the associated complexity. With this in mind, Commerzbank has developed sophisticated solutions to help corporates overcome the obstacles that they may encounter when using these methods.</p>
<h3 id=""payment-in-international-trade"">Payment in international trade</h3>
<p>In international trade, a range of payment methods have been developed, all of which distribute the risks faced by exporters and importers differently.</p>
<p>Open account trading, in which the importer receives goods and then pays the importer, has become the favoured method and is used for around 80% of trade transactions worldwide. However, this method exposes the exporter to the risk that payment may be late or may not be received at all. Consequently, some companies still use more complex payment methods, which have been designed to provide both trading partners with a degree of protection from counterparty risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Letters of credit</h5>
<p>Letters of credit are used for around 15% of global trade and are particularly valuable at the outset of a business relationship when trading with an unknown counterparty. In a letter of credit transaction, the buyer’s bank issues a letter of credit in favour of the seller. The letter of credit includes a number of documentary conditions that must be met before the seller can receive payment, such as the presentation of particular documents like commercial invoices, bills of lading and insurance certificates. Once the conditions of a letter of credit are met, payment is either effected or guaranteed by the bank. Meanwhile, once the documents have been handed over, the buyer can collect the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Documentary collections</h5>
<p>In a documentary collection, the importer does not receive the documents which enable them to claim ownership of the goods until payment has been received (documents against payment) or alternatively until the obligation to make a payment has been accepted by the importer (documents against acceptance). Documentary collections are less secure than letters of credit because the importer’s bank offers no guarantee of payment. As a result, this method of payment is less expensive than a letter of credit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While these methods of payment provide a level of security lacking in methods such as open account, they can also be time consuming to process. Letters of credit are complex transactions which require a lot of details and conditions to be stipulated. The successful processing of letters of credit therefore requires extensive knowledge.</p>

<p>Commerzbank has developed its Trade Finance application to facilitate cross-border complex documentary business and to support corporates through the entire documentary process. It is able to process documentary letters of credit, collections and guarantees online.</p>
<p>The online services involved include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Import letters of credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export letters of credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import documentary collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export documentary collections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guarantees on behalf of corporates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guarantees in favour of corporates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""accessibility"">Accessibility</h4>
<p>The solution is internet-based so users need no special software, although a software option is also available. Using an internet-based solution removes the usual concerns of initial set-up and ongoing maintenance needs. By logging on to the Corporate Banking Portal at www.commerzbank.com, corporates can access the complete range of services. The connection within the application allows documentary business data to be processed quickly and then passed straight to Commerzbank.</p>
<p>The automated and electronic process reduces the amount of paper-based communication, which in turn reduces costs and enables a quicker exchange of messages and information with Commerzbank. Through constant online access to relevant information and documents, corporates can be well-equipped to deal with documentary transactions wherever they are and whatever the time of day.</p>
<p>Extensive reports can be produced whenever requested. These reports can be presented in a range of formats, such as Microsoft Word or Excel, PDF, HTML or RTF. Corporates can therefore choose the most suitable format for their internal purposes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they can opt to receive email updates whenever new information is available, increasing visibility of the process and alerting them to any potential issues as soon as they emerge.</p>

<h4 id=""error-prevention"">Error prevention</h4>
<p>In a letter of credit transaction a lot of data (goods description, documents required, shipment information and other important conditions) has to be captured. The web-based Trade Finance solution includes a range of functions designed to ensure that the transactions are as accurate as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Copy function.</h5>
<p>The Trade Finance application contains a copy function, which is useful for corporates who frequently trade with the same business partner, who trade the same goods, or who use the same text for different guarantees. Once this data has been entered, it can be automatically copied time and time again. This removes the risk of manual inputting errors, such as spelling mistakes and erroneous figures. The copy function facilitates data entry, which can be very time-consuming without using such applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Plausibility checks.</h5>
<p>Automatic plausibility checks also help to identify less obvious errors, such as inconsistent and unusual figures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Information management.</h5>
<p>The application provides complete documentation of any amendments and settlements that may have been made prior to the final payment. This can include information relating to documentary letters of credit, collections and guarantees. The documenting of all this information helps track the process and maintains a record that can be referred to in case of discrepancies or disagreements.</p>

<h5 id=""developments-in-the-trade-finance-market"">What sort of developments are you seeing in the trade finance market at the moment?</h5>
<p>From my point of view, there are at least two important topics that we will have to cope with in the near future.</p>
<p>The first issue we are seeing is that the number of letters of credit being used has decreased in the last couple of years, compared to foreign trade transactions overall. Letters of credit will never be out of the market altogether, but financial globalisation comes along with a high degree of transparency, and this causes the market to tend to waive one of the key reasons for using letters of credit – the financial protection provided by bank payment obligations. Therefore, we have to work with new developments like SWIFT TSU (Trade Services Utility), for example.</p>
<p>Commerzbank is one of the first banks in the world to become a part of the SWIFT TSU User Group. TSU is a financial supply chain solution. The TSU, as a matching engine, intends to provide additional competitive services to corporate bank clients in the supply chain area. It enables banks to offer individual services to suppliers as well as buyers. Corporates that tend to switch from complex and expensive LC business to simpler Open Account transactions, or corporates that encounter the need for pre- or post-shipment financing to the buyer or supplier, should really get in touch with Commerzbank in order to find out how up-to-date trade solutions could support their supply chain.</p>
<p>The second issue is that at least in Germany we have to cope with the strong need for multi-banking, even in the foreign trade business. This is becoming more and more important, even in other European countries. We will definitely have to adapt our applications and interfaces to enable customers to handle all their transactions with different banks within just one application.</p>
<h5 id=""the-web-based-trade-finance-solution"">Why was the web-based Trade Finance solution developed?</h5>
<p>The documentary business is very complex and, after having talked to a lot of customers, we saw the strong need for technical solutions. Many internet-based applications were, of course, developed much earlier in the electronic banking area, but those applications had to be installed at the customer side, whereas plain internet applications do not require any installation at all. This is the key advantage of internet banking in general. Customers are looking for applications that are available anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day. And this need has been brought to the trade finance business.</p>
<h5 id=""when-was-this-product-developed"">When was this product developed?</h5>
<p>It was initially developed in some of the bank’s European branches on an electronic banking basis. It was first offered as an internet application through our European entities in 2003; including our home market. In 2006 we started working with customers in Asia and South-Africa, which we are very proud of because it is pretty difficult to meet customers’ requirements all over the world with a single product. But we are convinced we have done that.</p>
<h5 id=""who-is-your-target-customer"">Who is your target customer?</h5>
<p>The target customer for these applications is primarily the mid-size company with up to 500 foreign trade transactions each year. Customers processing more transactions than that rarely use bank products of this type because they are confident about using their own in-house applications.</p>
<h5 id=""what-differentiates-this-product-from-other-offerings-on-the-market"">What differentiates this product from other offerings on the market?</h5>
<p>We believe that the function and skill of this application is unique in the market. The application offers the whole range of transactions in the foreign trade business, from import letters of credit to guarantees on behalf of customers. The information flows are completely integrated into the bank’s back office system, so this enables a very detailed and transparent communication with the customer.</p>
<p>An import letter of credit, for example, does not end with the customer’s application. We offer to trace the complete transaction from beginning to end, providing all the necessary information to the customer electronically, such as: issuance confirmation, amendment confirmation, take-up of documents online by the customer and advice of the acceptance or payment. So, we cover the whole process from the first to the last step. This applies for all other modules as well, eg export letters of credit, collections, guarantees.</p>
<h5 id=""how-much-demand-are-you-seeing-for-the-product"">How much demand are you seeing for the product?</h5>
<p>We are already dealing with around 700 customers with this application in place, which is pretty good in the foreign trade business. We are still seeing a huge demand. Looking forward, we are aiming to sell this product to even more customers, focusing outside our domestic market.</p>

<h5 id=""security"">Security</h5>
<p>Transferring sensitive data between organisations over the internet can pose security risks. The information is vulnerable to hackers and unauthorised parties, so the Trade Finance application uses SSL-encoded<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> procedures to prevent unauthorised access to any of the data sent over the internet.</p>
<p>The application has a secure username and password system and a user-defined facility for granting access privileges. It is also possible for users to define the identity and number of signatories needed to verify each transaction. The level of security can therefore be tailored to meet the customer’s needs.</p>
<h4 id=""value-for-doc"">Value for doc</h4>
<p>The issues associated with letters of credit have meant that some companies have decided to outsource some or all of the processes relating to letters of credit, rather than carry them out in-house. Commerzbank has responded to this need with another of its offerings in the trade finance space, ‘value for doc’. Through this service, Commerzbank takes on some of the tasks that need to be performed when handling documentary business, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assistance with LC contents prior to contract finalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of country-specific examples of LCs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checks for inconsistencies between incoming LCs and conditions, as well as discrepancies in the underlying delivery contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correspondence with foreign banks regarding changes, supplements or clarification of LC conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close monitoring of processing deadlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document creation, correction and collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrangement of document authentication and legalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistance with insurance and logistics, as well as duty payment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of outsourcing these processes, companies may be able to free up internal resources, which might otherwise have been dedicated to time-consuming document processing activities.</p>
<p>Services such as checking documentation also mean that corporates can benefit from bank’s competence, ultimately preventing LCs from being rejected in the first instance.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Commerzbank has monitored the challenges associated with letters of credit and has come up with sophisticated solutions that are likely to appeal to corporates. The Trade Finance application uses the internet to speed up communication and the transfer of documents involved in the LC process. The automation of procedures, such as error checking, ensures a higher level of accuracy in the accompanying documentation, helping corporates to process letter of credit transactions more efficiently and more reliably.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, value for doc gives corporates the option of using the bank’s knowledge while freeing up resources from processing letters of credit altogether. This enables companies to avoid any disruption that may result from staff sickness and vacation while ensuring that documentary discrepancies do not prevent LCs from being accepted.</p>

For each of its core target groups, it aims to be the ‘best bank’.</p>
<p>Commerzbank is unreservedly committed to its home market, Germany. The group’s network of more than 1,000 branches is spread throughout the country.

In total, Commerzbank is represented in more than 40 countries with its own offices.</p>
<p>It is also important that the bank be easy to reach, especially via online access. In this case Commerzbank’s Corporate Banking Portal offers to both Mittelstand and major corporates 24-hours-a-day access to all relevant information, numerous services and solutions.</p>
